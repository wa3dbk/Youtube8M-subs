battery<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.360> not<00:02:06.479> being<00:02:06.689> part<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> any<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
battery is not being part of any of it

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.190 
battery is not being part of any of it
so<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.369> very<00:02:08.459> important<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so it's very important that we have the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.589 
so it's very important that we have the
battery<00:02:10.470> disconnect<00:02:11.009> switch<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.599> whenever

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
battery disconnect switch on whenever

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.400 
battery disconnect switch on whenever
we're<00:02:12.900> plugged

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
we're plugged

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.710 
we're plugged
in<00:02:13.530> or<00:02:13.830> when<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> generator<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.150> running<00:02:17.720> the

in or when the generator is running the
third<00:02:19.640> charging<00:02:20.640> system<00:02:20.970> we're<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.210> to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
third charging system we're going to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.590 
third charging system we're going to
look<00:02:21.360> at<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.750> solar<00:02:22.290> panels<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.940> key<00:02:24.150> thing<00:02:24.390> on

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
look at is solar panels the key thing on

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.750 
look at is solar panels the key thing on
solar<00:02:24.840> panels<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> solar<00:02:25.770> panels<00:02:26.220> need<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.610> be

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
solar panels the solar panels need to be

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.260 
solar panels the solar panels need to be
wired<00:02:27.060> directly<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.260> battery<00:02:29.270> typically

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
wired directly to the battery typically

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.760 
wired directly to the battery typically
they're<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> roof<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.260> they<00:02:31.380> go<00:02:31.530> through

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
they're on the roof and they go through

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.740 
they're on the roof and they go through
a<00:02:31.800> charge<00:02:32.130> controller<00:02:32.370> which<00:02:33.060> allows<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
a charge controller which allows the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.750 
a charge controller which allows the
power<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.170> come<00:02:34.350> from<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.830> panel<00:02:35.190> down<00:02:35.460> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
power to come from the panel down and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.700 
power to come from the panel down and
doesn't<00:02:36.480> allow<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.750> power<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.320> go<00:02:37.470> from<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
doesn't allow the power to go from the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.010 
doesn't allow the power to go from the
batteries<00:02:38.130> back<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.660> one-way

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
batteries back up so it's a one-way

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.560 
batteries back up so it's a one-way
valve<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.680> were<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.880> basically<00:02:42.390> what

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
valve if you were but basically what

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.570 
valve if you were but basically what
happens<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.200> power<00:02:43.680> comes<00:02:44.010> directly<00:02:44.460> to

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
happens is that power comes directly to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.130 
happens is that power comes directly to
the<00:02:44.970> batteries<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.510> we<00:02:45.570> want<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> make<00:02:45.960> sure

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the batteries and we want to make sure

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.680 
the batteries and we want to make sure
we<00:02:46.260> bypass<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.100> battery<00:02:47.430> disconnect<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
we bypass the battery disconnect that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.420 
we bypass the battery disconnect that
way<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.050> when<00:02:49.200> you're<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.440> storage<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
way there when you're in storage the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.480 
way there when you're in storage the
solar<00:02:50.640> panel<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.060> always<00:02:51.510> charging<00:02:51.870> in

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
solar panel is always charging in

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.970 
solar panel is always charging in
addition<00:02:53.490> some<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.720> even<00:02:55.020> put<00:02:55.290> two<00:02:55.680> solar

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
addition some have even put two solar

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.030 
addition some have even put two solar
panels<00:02:56.490> on<00:02:56.670> one<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.510> charge<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.140> chassis

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
panels on one to charge the chassis

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.860 
panels on one to charge the chassis
battery<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.060> charge<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.570> coach

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
battery and one to charge the coach

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.680 
battery and one to charge the coach
battery<00:03:01.580> some<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.850> fans<00:03:03.120> your<00:03:03.420> charge

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
battery some of the fans your charge

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.450 
battery some of the fans your charge
controllers<00:03:04.200> will<00:03:04.410> even<00:03:04.680> split<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.160> charge

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
controllers will even split the charge

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.450 
controllers will even split the charge
so<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.150> have<00:03:06.270> one<00:03:06.540> big<00:03:06.930> panel<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.770> that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
so you can have one big panel and that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.550 
so you can have one big panel and that
charge<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> both<00:03:09.660> batteries<00:03:12.320> so<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.380> review

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
charge go to both batteries so to review

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.890 
charge go to both batteries so to review
our<00:03:13.830> charging<00:03:14.490> systems<00:03:14.910> basically<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.600> charge

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
our charging systems basically we charge

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.860 
our charging systems basically we charge
three<00:03:16.500> ways<00:03:16.940> first<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.090> charge<00:03:18.420> from<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
three ways first we charge from the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.980 
three ways first we charge from the
engine<00:03:19.440> alternator<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.330> second<00:03:21.330> we<00:03:21.720> charge

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
engine alternator the second we charge

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.600 
engine alternator the second we charge
from<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> converter<00:03:22.830> when<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.220> coach<00:03:23.400> is

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
from the converter when the coach is

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.520 
from the converter when the coach is
plugged<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.180> or<00:03:24.390> when<00:03:24.960> we're<00:03:25.140> running<00:03:25.260> on

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
plugged in or when we're running on

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.190 
plugged in or when we're running on
generator<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.760> third<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:27.930> charge

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
generator and the third is we charge

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.430 
generator and the third is we charge
from<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.590> solar<00:03:28.860> panels
