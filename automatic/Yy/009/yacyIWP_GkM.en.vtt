00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.420
 we will use two bulbs the main pilot the filler unit 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.249
 we will place them in the following way 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.480
 the main unit to hyacinth 35 degrees with respect to the axis of the person by 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.109
 over his head and in chopped forte to avoid rebounds from our 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.050
 camera 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.180
 and the support unit at 315 degrees with respect to the person's axis for 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 fill the face because we are talking practically of a backlight 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.680
 This type of lighting is used mainly in people with hair 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.890
 blond or light to highlight them and give more prominence to the image 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.610
 in people with nice hair or hair very careful result usually 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 be spectacular 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.420
 in hairdressing passes is a fundamental type of lighting at the time of 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.440
 portraying the models and a variant of them will also be fundamental as 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.580
 We'll see later 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580
 for any self-respecting studio photo shoot 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.780
 of we will not use two bulbs the main one I had support 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.049
 we will place the principal doing 80 degrees 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.169
 out of respect for the axis of the person behind it hiding it with his head 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.380
 If the unit is very large we will incorporate some element to the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.210
 scene as a scarf there was a fan to disguise what 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
 or if we do not replace it with a smaller focus 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.250
 and since we are creating an authentic backlight 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.960
 we need a fill unit that we will put back to 300 15 degrees by 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.100
 respect to the axis of the person directing his face directly 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 this type of lighting although it is used for all types of people 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.060
 where its effect is best appreciated 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.110
 it's in people with blonde hair blown because it creates a beautiful trail of light 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 that is highlighted by this type of hair 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.320
 can be used by placing the front person olate the mind and even though 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.690
 employs more for bust portraits is also used for portraits of 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.479
 half finished group body 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.520
 in both cases, the outline of the people is very good 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090
 in the lighting of the classic portrait 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.840
 we use three spotlights 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.250
 the main unit that we will place at 45 degrees in relation to the axis of the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.380
 person above the eyes and make a light dive 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.530
 the less powerful fill focus 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.020
 that we will place it at 315 degrees with respect to the axis of the person 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.309
 directly to your face 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.099
 and finally that the background focus to illuminate this scam tie it rest other 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.359
 possible shadows that could remain 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.359
 the latter must always be placed diagonally with respect to the main focus 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.099
 as you will have observed this type of lighting 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.010
 is a combination of the illuminations that we have studied before is the kind of 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.719
 standard lighting is the most commonly used studies 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.930
 photographic lighting base of every photo shoot 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.890
 the 45 degree focus guarantees natural lighting 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.570
 the filling unit dilutes the contrast created and the focus at the bottom gives life to this 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569
 and eliminated any possibility of annoying shadow 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.760
 With this work scheme prepared, a very safe light source is created. 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.000
 allows the photographer to focus on other fundamental aspects 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 how are the pose and the frame 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.139
 when adjusting the light we will proceed as follows 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.199
 a flash and meter connected to the main unit will reveal the diaphragm that 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.309
 ask for said focus 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.379
 attention because that will be the one that we will have to place in the camera 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.040
 the unit to fill will regulate it or if you can not regulate its power the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.799
 we will move away or approach until we get a more open diaphragm 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.179
 that the main unit 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.169
 however, we will keep in the camera the diaphragm that the 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.169
 main focus 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.700
 This is done because a study is always about getting 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:55.689
 lumination is 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.050
 that they imitate as much as possible in the sunlight that is the mother illumination 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.779
 and as the sun is unique we always receive light a little aside 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.030
 creating in this way soft contrasts 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.030
 just like the one we have prepared here 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.719
 so the side of the face that illuminates the secondary unit will remain 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.040
 something goes up exposed 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.720
 creating a gentle contrast of kilograms and very natural lighting
