to that

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.150 
to that
it<00:01:23.500> was<00:01:23.680> red-hot<00:01:24.130> fluid<00:01:25.090> rock<00:01:25.630> but<00:01:26.620> instead<00:01:27.040> of

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
it was red-hot fluid rock but instead of

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.980 
it was red-hot fluid rock but instead of

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
as lava in a volcano it stayed many

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.110 
as lava in a volcano it stayed many
miles<00:01:32.260> below<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.710> surface<00:01:32.980> and<00:01:33.370> cooled<00:01:33.640> there

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
miles below the surface and cooled there

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.600 
miles below the surface and cooled there
very<00:01:34.930> slowly<00:01:35.140> over<00:01:35.590> thousands<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.070> years<00:01:36.130> and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
very slowly over thousands of years and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.690 
very slowly over thousands of years and
because<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.510> cooled<00:01:37.870> so<00:01:38.110> slowly<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:39.070> allowed

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
because it cooled so slowly it allowed

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.590 
because it cooled so slowly it allowed
very<00:01:40.090> large<00:01:40.510> crystals<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.350> form<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.420> very

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
very large crystals to form it's a very

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810 
very large crystals to form it's a very
coarse-grained<00:01:44.080> rock<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:45.190> that's<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.640> key

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
coarse-grained rock and that's the key

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.580 
coarse-grained rock and that's the key
to<00:01:45.850> its<00:01:46.090> strength<00:01:46.510> this<00:01:46.720> rock<00:01:46.960> spent<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.380> long

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
to its strength this rock spent a long

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.710 
to its strength this rock spent a long
time<00:01:47.620> at<00:01:47.950> high<00:01:48.190> temperatures<00:01:48.730> cooled<00:01:49.510> very

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
time at high temperatures cooled very

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.630 
time at high temperatures cooled very
slowly<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.980> allowed<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.220> lot<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.460> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
slowly and that allowed a lot of the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.550 
slowly and that allowed a lot of the
cracks<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.240> be<00:01:52.360> annealed<00:01:52.660> out<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.200> making<00:01:53.500> a

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
cracks to be annealed out of it making a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.010 
cracks to be annealed out of it making a
very<00:01:53.950> strong<00:01:54.130> Rock<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.480> glaciers<00:01:55.840> had<00:01:55.990> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
very strong Rock so the glaciers had a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.840 
very strong Rock so the glaciers had a
hard<00:01:56.320> time<00:01:56.620> moving<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.460> that's<00:01:57.610> what

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
hard time moving it and that's what

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.250 
hard time moving it and that's what
allows<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.300> to<00:01:58.510> carve<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.990> kind<00:01:59.200> of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
allows you to carve the kind of

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.570 
allows you to carve the kind of
landscape<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.010> can<00:02:00.160> see<00:02:00.340> over<00:02:00.460> my

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
landscape that you can see over my

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.190 
landscape that you can see over my
shoulder<00:02:01.030> here<00:02:02.490> granite<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.610> among<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
shoulder here granite is among the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.380 
shoulder here granite is among the
toughest<00:02:05.650> rocks<00:02:05.920> on<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.610> planet<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.090> mean<00:02:07.240> it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
toughest rocks on the planet I mean it's

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.229 
toughest rocks on the planet I mean it's
very<00:02:07.450> very<00:02:08.020> strong<00:02:08.320> stuff<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:09.610> when<00:02:09.880> glaciers

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
very very strong stuff so when glaciers

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.580 
very very strong stuff so when glaciers
are<00:02:10.390> moving<00:02:10.660> through<00:02:10.840> here<00:02:11.050> they<00:02:11.230> certainly

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
are moving through here they certainly

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.110 
are moving through here they certainly
were<00:02:11.770> able<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.070> erode<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.730> sculpt<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
were able to erode and sculpt the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.140 
were able to erode and sculpt the
landscapes<00:02:13.660> um<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.680> lot<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.430> domes<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
landscapes um but a lot of the domes the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.970 
landscapes um but a lot of the domes the
smooth<00:02:16.600> ridges<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.290> see<00:02:17.500> up<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:17.920> the

smooth ridges that we see up here in the

smooth ridges that we see up here in the
high<00:02:18.070> country<00:02:18.280> they're<00:02:19.060> really<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.360> testament

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.690 
high country they're really a testament
to<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.530> fact<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.860> glaciers<00:02:21.220> weren't<00:02:21.550> able

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
to the fact that glaciers weren't able

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.800 
to the fact that glaciers weren't able
to<00:02:21.850> do<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> lot<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.360> eroding<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.620> landscape

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
to do a lot of eroding of this landscape

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.970 
to do a lot of eroding of this landscape
one<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.989> things<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.260> makes<00:02:26.440> us<00:02:26.590> emiti

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
one of the things that makes us emiti

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.070 
one of the things that makes us emiti
such<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.160> great<00:02:27.430> place<00:02:27.700> for<00:02:27.730> us<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:28.390> geologists

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
such a great place for us as geologists

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470 
such a great place for us as geologists
to<00:02:29.200> work<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:30.010> Nature<00:02:30.430> has<00:02:30.700> taken<00:02:31.330> these

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
to work is that Nature has taken these

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.140 
to work is that Nature has taken these
rocks<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.170> polished<00:02:32.530> them<00:02:32.709> for<00:02:32.980> us<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.120> we

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
rocks and polished them for us and so we

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.120 
rocks and polished them for us and so we
can<00:02:34.450> come<00:02:34.630> out<00:02:34.810> here<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.410> literally<00:02:35.739> crawl

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
can come out here and literally crawl

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.160 
can come out here and literally crawl
around<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.580> our<00:02:36.760> hands<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.180> knees<00:02:37.360> looking<00:02:37.780> at

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
around on our hands and knees looking at

understand<00:05:17.680> it<00:05:17.860> better<00:05:18.120> when<00:05:19.120> I<00:05:19.150> walk<00:05:19.390> around

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
understand it better when I walk around

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.140 
understand it better when I walk around
here<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.140> look<00:05:20.470> at<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.680> Granite's<00:05:21.100> I<00:05:21.280> think<00:05:22.000> I

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
here and look at the Granite's I think I

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.420 
here and look at the Granite's I think I
understand<00:05:22.690> a<00:05:22.960> lot<00:05:23.200> about<00:05:23.590> how<00:05:23.830> most<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.340> the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
understand a lot about how most of the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.460 
understand a lot about how most of the
features<00:05:24.820> that<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:25.090> see<00:05:25.419> formed<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:26.050> can<00:05:26.260> see

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
features that I see formed I can see

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.620 
features that I see formed I can see
cracks<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:27.250> filled<00:05:27.490> with<00:05:27.669> magma<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.210> can<00:05:28.450> see

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
cracks that filled with magma I can see

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.720 
cracks that filled with magma I can see
blobs<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.530> dark<00:05:29.800> magma<00:05:30.280> that<00:05:30.310> were<00:05:30.490> caught

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
blobs of the dark magma that were caught

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.760 
blobs of the dark magma that were caught
up<00:05:30.760> in<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.120> lighter<00:05:31.360> magma<00:05:31.900> then<00:05:32.470> we<00:05:32.620> can

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
up in a lighter magma then we can

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.580 
up in a lighter magma then we can
understand<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.610> by<00:05:34.169> studying<00:05:35.169> it<00:05:35.320> by<00:05:35.530> doing

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
understand that by studying it by doing

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.830 
understand that by studying it by doing
chemical<00:05:36.130> analyses<00:05:36.760> by<00:05:37.240> doing<00:05:37.480> experiments

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
chemical analyses by doing experiments

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.840 
chemical analyses by doing experiments
to<00:05:38.230> try<00:05:38.350> to<00:05:38.440> duplicate<00:05:38.980> some<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.370> these<00:05:39.460> things

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
to try to duplicate some of these things

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.210 
to try to duplicate some of these things
but<00:05:40.150> there<00:05:40.450> are<00:05:40.480> a<00:05:40.810> lot<00:05:41.140> of<00:05:41.169> features<00:05:41.470> out<00:05:41.890> here

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
but there are a lot of features out here

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.760 
but there are a lot of features out here
that<00:05:42.460> none<00:05:42.910> of<00:05:42.940> us<00:05:43.180> understand

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
that none of us understand

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.770 
that none of us understand
when<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:46.310> walk<00:05:46.460> around<00:05:46.610> on<00:05:46.970> these<00:05:47.120> glaciated

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
when you walk around on these glaciated

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.080 
when you walk around on these glaciated
surfaces<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.680> can<00:05:48.830> find<00:05:49.100> a<00:05:49.250> lot<00:05:49.400> of<00:05:49.430> really

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
surfaces you can find a lot of really

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.870 
surfaces you can find a lot of really
unusual<00:05:50.240> things<00:05:51.280> some<00:05:52.280> of<00:05:52.370> them<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.580> think<00:05:52.760> we

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
unusual things some of them I think we

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.370 
unusual things some of them I think we
understand<00:05:53.360> and<00:05:53.600> some<00:05:53.750> of<00:05:53.870> them<00:05:53.990> are<00:05:54.170> great

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
understand and some of them are great

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.060 
understand and some of them are great
mysteries<00:05:54.980> I've<00:05:55.280> been<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.550> this<00:05:55.700> place<00:05:55.910> maybe

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
mysteries I've been to this place maybe

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.940 
mysteries I've been to this place maybe
half<00:05:58.070> a<00:05:58.220> dozen<00:05:58.370> times<00:05:58.790> and<00:05:59.240> I<00:05:59.810> really<00:06:00.620> have<00:06:00.770> no

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
half a dozen times and I really have no

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.520 
half a dozen times and I really have no
idea<00:06:00.980> how<00:06:01.460> this<00:06:01.670> formed<00:06:02.200> it's<00:06:03.200> one<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.470> the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
idea how this formed it's one of the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.020 
idea how this formed it's one of the
weirdest<00:06:03.890> things<00:06:03.980> I've<00:06:04.280> ever<00:06:04.460> seen<00:06:04.730> in<00:06:04.970> a

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
weirdest things I've ever seen in a

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.780 
weirdest things I've ever seen in a
granite<00:06:05.860> same<00:06:06.860> things<00:06:07.070> like<00:06:07.220> this<00:06:07.370> is<00:06:07.520> kind<00:06:07.730> of

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
granite same things like this is kind of

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.520 
granite same things like this is kind of
humbling<00:06:08.150> I<00:06:08.330> think<00:06:08.540> we<00:06:08.630> understand<00:06:09.140> a<00:06:09.290> lot

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
humbling I think we understand a lot

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.680 
humbling I think we understand a lot
about<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:10.040> Granite's<00:06:10.580> in<00:06:10.790> Yosemite<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:11.540> how

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
about the Granite's in Yosemite and how

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.050 
about the Granite's in Yosemite and how
they<00:06:11.840> form<00:06:12.140> and<00:06:12.620> over<00:06:13.070> what<00:06:13.250> time<00:06:13.520> periods

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
they form and over what time periods

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.210 
they form and over what time periods
they<00:06:14.300> form<00:06:14.600> and<00:06:14.870> so<00:06:15.050> forth<00:06:15.350> but<00:06:15.590> you<00:06:15.800> walk

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
they form and so forth but you walk

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.800 
they form and so forth but you walk
around<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.580> corner<00:06:16.820> you're<00:06:17.060> in<00:06:17.210> into<00:06:17.450> something

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
around a corner you're in into something

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.240 
around a corner you're in into something
like<00:06:17.930> this<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.350> it's<00:06:18.440> really<00:06:18.500> humbling<00:06:18.830> it

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
like this and it's really humbling it

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.380 
like this and it's really humbling it
says<00:06:19.430> there<00:06:19.580> are<00:06:19.640> a<00:06:19.670> lot<00:06:19.790> of<00:06:19.820> mysteries<00:06:20.060> out

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
says there are a lot of mysteries out

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.590 
says there are a lot of mysteries out
there<00:06:20.450> still<00:06:20.900> left<00:06:21.050> solve

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.490 

I<00:06:28.210> think<00:06:29.210> a<00:06:29.300> lot<00:06:29.450> of<00:06:29.600> visitors<00:06:29.930> when<00:06:30.200> they<00:06:30.230> come

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
I think a lot of visitors when they come

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.870 
I think a lot of visitors when they come
to<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:30.740> park<00:06:31.010> they're<00:06:31.190> not<00:06:31.370> thinking<00:06:31.670> about

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
to the park they're not thinking about

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.810 
to the park they're not thinking about
geology<00:06:32.810> per<00:06:33.350> se<00:06:33.650> but<00:06:34.430> you<00:06:34.580> know<00:06:34.670> they're

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
geology per se but you know they're

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.250 
geology per se but you know they're
they're<00:06:35.060> here<00:06:35.270> to<00:06:35.420> experience<00:06:36.050> this

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
they're here to experience this

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.410 
they're here to experience this
beautiful<00:06:36.890> place<00:06:37.100> it's<00:06:37.820> right<00:06:38.060> here<00:06:38.270> in<00:06:38.360> the

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
beautiful place it's right here in the

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.540 
beautiful place it's right here in the
core<00:06:38.660> of<00:06:38.690> Yosemite<00:06:39.200> that<00:06:39.230> we<00:06:39.440> have<00:06:39.650> the<00:06:40.190> best

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
core of Yosemite that we have the best

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.310 
core of Yosemite that we have the best
exposure<00:06:40.970> of<00:06:41.240> granite<00:06:41.660> and<00:06:41.810> that's<00:06:41.990> also

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
exposure of granite and that's also

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.840 
exposure of granite and that's also
where<00:06:42.470> we<00:06:42.590> have<00:06:42.620> the<00:06:43.250> most<00:06:43.460> amazing

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
where we have the most amazing

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.630 
where we have the most amazing
landscapes<00:06:44.540> into<00:06:45.020> our<00:06:45.110> meadows<00:06:45.590> in<00:06:45.920> Yosemite

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
landscapes into our meadows in Yosemite

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.030 
landscapes into our meadows in Yosemite
Valley<00:06:46.670> they<00:06:47.600> are<00:06:47.720> a<00:06:47.780> direct<00:06:47.960> result<00:06:48.560> of<00:06:48.770> the

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
Valley they are a direct result of the

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.230 
Valley they are a direct result of the
granite<00:06:49.460> that's<00:06:49.700> here

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
granite that's here
