that<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:51.160> will<00:04:51.310> handle<00:04:51.490> quite<00:04:51.910> well<00:04:52.120> but<00:04:52.240> as

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
that it will handle quite well but as

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.090 
that it will handle quite well but as
it's<00:04:52.570> a<00:04:52.690> one-way<00:04:53.020> back<00:04:53.260> there<00:04:53.650> is<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.830> downside

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
it's a one-way back there is a downside

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.580 
it's a one-way back there is a downside
er<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:55.060> means<00:04:55.270> if<00:04:55.420> you<00:04:55.450> do<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.630> riffle<00:04:56.230> like<00:04:56.350> so

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
er it means if you do a riffle like so

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.400 
er it means if you do a riffle like so
you<00:04:57.040> can<00:04:57.190> see<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.610> will<00:04:57.910> become<00:04:58.390> odd<00:04:58.690> but<00:04:59.320> that

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
you can see it will become odd but that

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.600 
you can see it will become odd but that
doesn't<00:04:59.680> matter<00:04:59.740> for<00:04:59.920> me<00:04:59.980> it's<00:05:00.310> more<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.550> a

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
doesn't matter for me it's more of a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.860 
doesn't matter for me it's more of a
