00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
you got to look at it the first way if

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.549 
you got to look at it the first way if
you're<00:01:01.449> gonna<00:01:01.569> look<00:01:01.809> at<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.019> tournament<00:01:02.319> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
you're gonna look at a tournament the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.930 
you're gonna look at a tournament the
second<00:01:02.889> way<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.010> shouldn't<00:01:03.519> be<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.639> pro<00:01:03.909> player

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
second way you shouldn't be a pro player

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.940 
second way you shouldn't be a pro player
because<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.900> never<00:01:05.080> go<00:01:05.320> into<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:05.560> tournament

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
because you never go into a tournament

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.649 
because you never go into a tournament
saying<00:01:06.130> oh<00:01:06.250> i<00:01:06.280> faced<00:01:06.640> tough<00:01:06.880> opponents<00:01:07.360> i<00:01:07.420> lost

saying oh i faced tough opponents i lost

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.899 
saying oh i faced tough opponents i lost
so<00:01:07.900> that's<00:01:08.110> forgivable<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.490> always<00:01:09.700> want<00:01:09.880> to

things<00:03:02.270> happened<00:03:02.930> but<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.650> did<00:03:03.950> hear<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.310> lot

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
things happened but I did hear a lot

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.040 
things happened but I did hear a lot
about<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.700> talked<00:03:05.060> about<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.330> few<00:03:05.600> players<00:03:05.810> about

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
about I talked about a few players about

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.890 
about I talked about a few players about
different<00:03:06.830> Oh<00:03:06.920> penis<00:03:07.340> but<00:03:07.700> overall<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.870> seems

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
different Oh penis but overall it seems

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.360 
different Oh penis but overall it seems
like<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> lot<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> new<00:03:09.739> units<00:03:10.040> are<00:03:10.160> really

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
like a lot of the new units are really

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.220 
like a lot of the new units are really
strong<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.810> obviously<00:03:11.810> there's<00:03:12.020> going<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.200> be

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
strong and obviously there's going to be

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.050 
strong and obviously there's going to be
a<00:03:12.290> lot<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.440> tweaking<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.250> definitely<00:03:13.730> like

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
a lot of tweaking but I definitely like

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.660 
a lot of tweaking but I definitely like
the<00:03:14.090> sounds<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.630> like<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> spider<00:03:15.560> mine<00:03:15.890> in<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.190> 22

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
right I just at MLG but I wish I would

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.390 
right I just at MLG but I wish I would
have<00:04:05.840> played<00:04:06.049> w<00:04:06.320> CS<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.799> u.s.<00:04:07.010> instead<00:04:07.310> of

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
have played w CS in the u.s. instead of

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.860 
have played w CS in the u.s. instead of
Canada<00:04:07.730> because<00:04:07.820> apparently<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.450> u.s.<00:04:08.720> is

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
Canada because apparently the u.s. is

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.030 
Canada because apparently the u.s. is
going<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.049> be<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.230> two<00:04:09.380> or<00:04:09.500> three<00:04:09.530> times<00:04:09.829> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
going to be like two or three times the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.470 
going to be like two or three times the
amount<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.280> money<00:04:10.400> two<00:04:10.610> or<00:04:10.730> three<00:04:10.940> times<00:04:11.239> the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
amount of money two or three times the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.479 
amount of money two or three times the
amount<00:04:11.540> of<00:04:11.690> spots<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.560> think<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.010> skill<00:04:13.459> is

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
amount of spots and I think the skill is

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.940 
amount of spots and I think the skill is
pretty<00:04:13.790> comparable<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.360> Canada<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.049> kind<00:04:15.920> of

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
pretty comparable to Canada so I kind of

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.140 
pretty comparable to Canada so I kind of
wish<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.220> played<00:04:16.459> this<00:04:16.579> one<00:04:16.850> especially

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
wish I played this one especially

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.909 
wish I played this one especially
looking<00:04:17.690> at<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.049> final<00:04:18.410> not<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.799> either

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
looking at the final not that either

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.490 
looking at the final not that either
player<00:04:19.220> was<00:04:19.370> bad<00:04:19.579> but<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.390> definitely<00:04:21.140> feel

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
player was bad but I definitely feel

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.560 
player was bad but I definitely feel
like<00:04:21.709> I<00:04:21.919> would<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.130> done<00:04:22.940> really<00:04:23.150> well<00:04:23.330> in

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
like I would have done really well in

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
that's announced yet by boom if it isn't

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.920

if<00:04:39.410> this<00:04:39.500> gets<00:04:39.740> posted<00:04:40.130> then<00:04:40.340> there<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:40.790> go<00:04:40.940> I

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
if this gets posted then there you go I

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.530

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
don't think I don't think so i think

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.330 
don't think I don't think so i think
even<00:04:45.080> if<00:04:45.170> it<00:04:45.290> was<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.530> way<00:04:45.800> i<00:04:45.830> would<00:04:46.160> prefer

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
even if it was that way i would prefer

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.440 
even if it was that way i would prefer
it<00:04:46.670> you<00:04:46.850> know<00:04:46.970> because<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:47.300> you're<00:04:47.420> just

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
it you know because then you're just

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.640 
it you know because then you're just
constantly<00:04:47.780> warmed<00:04:48.140> up<00:04:48.260> as<00:04:48.380> long<00:04:48.470> as<00:04:48.530> you're

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
constantly warmed up as long as you're

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.960 
constantly warmed up as long as you're
not<00:04:48.710> playing<00:04:48.950> for<00:04:49.130> like<00:04:49.220> 10<00:04:49.430> hours<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.730> day

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
not playing for like 10 hours a day

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.610 
not playing for like 10 hours a day
because<00:04:50.600> that's<00:04:50.810> rough<00:04:51.110> but<00:04:51.380> if<00:04:51.470> you're

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
because that's rough but if you're

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.780 
because that's rough but if you're
playing<00:04:51.800> like<00:04:51.980> six<00:04:52.160> or<00:04:52.220> eight<00:04:52.340> hours<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.700> you

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
playing like six or eight hours and you

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.160 
playing like six or eight hours and you
constantly<00:04:53.060> have<00:04:53.300> matches<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.840> me<00:04:53.960> that's

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
constantly have matches to me that's

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.080 
constantly have matches to me that's
fine<00:04:54.470> because<00:04:54.980> it<00:04:55.220> keeps<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.550> warmed<00:04:55.790> up<00:04:55.910> and

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
fine because it keeps you warmed up and

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.360 
fine because it keeps you warmed up and
you<00:04:56.210> don't<00:04:56.360> really<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:57.020> know<00:04:57.050> doze<00:04:58.010> off<00:04:58.190> or

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
you don't really you know doze off or

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.010 
you don't really you know doze off or
anything<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:59.300> mentioned<00:04:59.630> that<00:04:59.690> once<00:04:59.870> you

energy in terms of the amount of people

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.220 
energy in terms of the amount of people
the<00:05:07.280> fans<00:05:07.550> other<00:05:07.940> tournaments<00:05:08.720> going<00:05:08.900> on<00:05:09.020> how

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
outside factors it depends on day-to-day

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.910 
outside factors it depends on day-to-day
uh<00:05:16.960> sometimes<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.110> helps<00:05:18.200> sometimes<00:05:18.350> it<00:05:18.770> hurts

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
uh sometimes it helps sometimes it hurts

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.500 
uh sometimes it helps sometimes it hurts
sometimes<00:05:19.790> you<00:05:19.880> don't<00:05:19.940> sleep<00:05:20.180> right<00:05:20.390> the

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
sometimes you don't sleep right the

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.980 
sometimes you don't sleep right the
night<00:05:20.660> before<00:05:21.430> it's<00:05:22.430> it's<00:05:23.240> pretty<00:05:23.510> random<00:05:23.690> so

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
night before it's it's pretty random so

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.480 
night before it's it's pretty random so
I<00:05:24.050> don't<00:05:24.170> really<00:05:24.230> look<00:05:24.620> on<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:24.890> too<00:05:25.040> much<00:05:25.160> but

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
I don't really look on it too much but

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.990 
I don't really look on it too much but
it<00:05:26.480> is<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:26.690> factor<00:05:27.200> just<00:05:27.800> it's<00:05:28.310> so<00:05:28.550> random<00:05:28.730> that

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
it is a factor just it's so random that

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.700 
it is a factor just it's so random that
it<00:05:29.240> doesn't<00:05:29.630> really<00:05:29.780> can't<00:05:30.260> put<00:05:30.440> into<00:05:30.560> words

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
it doesn't really can't put into words

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.100 
it doesn't really can't put into words
