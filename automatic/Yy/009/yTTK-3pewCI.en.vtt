00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
one so they're all matched up but what

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.309 
one so they're all matched up but what
we<00:05:01.439> need<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.770> do<00:05:01.919> now<00:05:02.249> is<00:05:02.939> to<00:05:03.449> turn<00:05:03.749> all<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
we need to do now is to turn all the

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.010 
we need to do now is to turn all the
cards<00:05:04.710> over<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:05.430> try<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.300> remember<00:05:06.419> where

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
cards over and try and remember where

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.920 
cards over and try and remember where
they<00:05:07.169> are<00:05:07.379> to<00:05:07.889> match<00:05:08.099> them<00:05:08.370> up<00:05:08.509> so<00:05:09.509> I'm<00:05:09.689> going

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
they are to match them up so I'm going

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.739 
they are to match them up so I'm going
to<00:05:10.020> only<00:05:10.349> use<00:05:10.529> half<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.069> cards<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:12.360> we'll<00:05:12.509> see

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
to only use half the cards and we'll see

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.649 
to only use half the cards and we'll see
how<00:05:12.930> we<00:05:12.990> get<00:05:13.229> on<00:05:13.560> so<00:05:14.550> here<00:05:14.909> we<00:05:15.029> have<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.240> few<00:05:15.569> of

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
how we get on so here we have a few of

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.749 
how we get on so here we have a few of
the<00:05:15.779> cards<00:05:16.199> of<00:05:16.499> what<00:05:16.830> we<00:05:16.949> need<00:05:17.159> to<00:05:17.189> do<00:05:17.490> is

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
the cards of what we need to do is

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.679 
the cards of what we need to do is
memorize<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.900> pictures<00:05:19.409> of<00:05:19.590> where<00:05:19.830> they<00:05:19.979> are

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
memorize the pictures of where they are

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.580 
memorize the pictures of where they are
so<00:05:21.689> take<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> few<00:05:22.319> moments<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:23.069> memorize<00:05:23.550> them

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
so take a few moments to memorize them

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.879 
so take a few moments to memorize them
I'll<00:05:25.590> turn<00:05:25.949> the<00:05:26.099> cards<00:05:26.430> over<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.620> we'll<00:05:28.620> see

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
I'll turn the cards over and we'll see

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:52.909 
I'll turn the cards over and we'll see
if<00:05:28.979> we<00:05:29.099> can<00:05:29.279> match<00:05:29.490> them<00:05:29.819> up

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.679 

all<00:05:53.280> right<00:05:53.430> so<00:05:53.969> here<00:05:54.419> we<00:05:54.569> go<00:05:56.210> there's<00:05:57.210> equal

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
all right so here we go there's equal

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.100 
all right so here we go there's equal
people

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.159 

equal<00:06:01.110> people<00:06:01.440> might<00:06:01.680> be<00:06:01.830> there<00:06:02.930> that's<00:06:03.930> a

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
equal people might be there that's a

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.380 
equal people might be there that's a
pair<00:06:04.440> they<00:06:04.889> match

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.840 

it's<00:06:10.390> the<00:06:10.630> pontipines<00:06:14.520> there's<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:15.760> other

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
it's the pontipines there's the other

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:23.269 
it's the pontipines there's the other
pontipine's<00:06:16.540> that's<00:06:17.350> a<00:06:17.560> pair<00:06:17.800> they<00:06:18.430> match

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:23.279 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.459 

he's<00:06:23.849> absurd<00:06:24.389> and<00:06:24.569> Z<00:06:26.149> is<00:06:27.149> absolutely<00:06:27.719> Z<00:06:27.779> there

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:28.469 
he's absurd and Z is absolutely Z there

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:35.059 
he's absurd and Z is absolutely Z there
no<00:06:29.239> that's<00:06:30.239> a<00:06:30.479> whole<00:06:30.659> gang<00:06:33.469> let's<00:06:34.469> try<00:06:34.859> another

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
no that's a whole gang let's try another

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:38.890 
no that's a whole gang let's try another
card

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.610 

there's<00:06:39.140> equal<00:06:39.680> pickle<00:06:40.960> these<00:06:41.960> equal<00:06:42.440> people

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
there's equal pickle these equal people

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.500 
there's equal pickle these equal people
here<00:06:43.690> no<00:06:44.690> that's<00:06:45.530> absurd<00:06:46.100> lazy<00:06:46.370> and<00:06:47.180> muck<00:06:47.480> a

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
here no that's absurd lazy and muck a

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:54.120 
here no that's absurd lazy and muck a
bug<00:06:47.870> that<00:06:48.850> let's<00:06:49.850> try<00:06:50.180> another<00:06:50.420> card

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.160 

this<00:06:55.130> is<00:06:55.280> absolute<00:06:55.880> hazy

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.340 

let's<00:06:59.170> try<00:06:59.500> the<00:06:59.560> card<00:06:59.920> up<00:07:00.430> here<00:07:00.880> ah<00:07:01.350> that's

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
let's try the card up here ah that's

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:08.240 
let's try the card up here ah that's
right<00:07:02.650> that's<00:07:03.040> a<00:07:03.310> pair<00:07:04.770> as<00:07:05.770> it<00:07:06.280> will<00:07:06.460> pickle

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
right that's a pair as it will pickle

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.700 
right that's a pair as it will pickle
think<00:07:09.250> it'll<00:07:09.430> equal<00:07:10.030> people<00:07:10.210> is<00:07:10.690> here<00:07:11.110> so

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
think it'll equal people is here so

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.980 
think it'll equal people is here so
that's<00:07:11.920> another<00:07:12.280> pair

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.570 

is<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:17.039> gang

is the gang
now<00:07:19.580> which<00:07:19.879> one<00:07:20.149> was<00:07:20.180> it<00:07:21.159> let's<00:07:22.159> try<00:07:22.460> this<00:07:22.520> one

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:23.119 
now which one was it let's try this one

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.929 
now which one was it let's try this one
ah<00:07:23.439> that's<00:07:24.439> right<00:07:24.800> the<00:07:25.159> whole<00:07:25.369> gang<00:07:25.639> the

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:25.939 
ah that's right the whole gang the
