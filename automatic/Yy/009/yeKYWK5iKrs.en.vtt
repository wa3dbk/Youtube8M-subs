00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.759
 sure slutsky relapse occurred 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:04.200
 cancer and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.280
 treatment was unsuccessful here 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.500
 why did Anna perk 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.379
 start taking a floor wig 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.240
 a failure 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.629
 would be stupid 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.019
 to the colonel I was completely helpless and 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.710
 wisely get out of bed now 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.039
 returned to work 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.050
 moreover, I am full time 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 go shopping car 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.429
 shops and cook myself 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.659
 in a few months the swelling became smaller 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.399
 diminished and the pain is possible that Irina 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.259
 Slutsky is not the only one 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.490
 there is reason for optimism 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.780
 in people with genetic 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.680
 predisposition to oncology 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.430
 disease it occurs approximately 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.840
 in one case out of a thousand is high 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.010
 likelihood of cancer 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.340
 breast and ovarian pancreas and 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.070
 prostate gland 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.640
 in the first stage of clinical 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.040
 60 people took part in the experiment 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.110
 men and women 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.400
 20 and two subjects were found 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.710
 breast cancer oncogenes at first all 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.600
 the subjects and daily took 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.180
 small doses of a parib goal after three 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.480
 weeks to twenty two participants 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.530
 experiment evaluation of breast cancer genes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980
 the dose of the drug was increased to six hundred 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.060
 milligrams patients took 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910
 medication twice a day 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.910
 scientists have found that forty percent 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.780
 patients with genetic 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.590
 predisposition to oncology 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.260
 severely ill 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
 a form of breast cancer and still nothing 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 prostate gland happened 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.870
 tumor reduction 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.640
 A new drug does not work as 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 others reproduction cancerous 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.480
 cells are often injured 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.070
 repairs their special enzyme park 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.040
 as it turned out environmentalist Oleg possessing 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.370
 ability to suppress this 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.510
 enzyme mutated cells 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.600
 very good news for women says 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.480
 professor and advertising from oncology 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.190
 institute name data fargo 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.100
 results 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.720
 characteristic of women with heavy 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.760
 forms of the disease 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.570
 it's too early to announce she sings 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.310
 miracle drug say 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.020
 scientists 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.280
 to its effectiveness 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.219
 confirmed she must endure yet 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.899
 A series of tests conducted a study 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.740
 British scientists supported 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.469
 pharmaceutical company astrasinac his 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.009
 results were published in
