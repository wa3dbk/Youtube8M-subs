hello it's matt from JK and today we're
looking<00:00:14.340> at<00:00:14.580> some<00:00:14.820> more<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.300> buddha

pedals<00:00:15.809> today<00:00:16.139> I've<00:00:16.350> got<00:00:16.380> the<00:00:16.740> chakra

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
pedals today I've got the chakra

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
pedals today I've got the chakra
compressor<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> wicked<00:00:19.020> little

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
compressor now this is a wicked little

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.070 
compressor now this is a wicked little
compressor<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.099> based<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.510> optical

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
compressor this is based on the optical

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.050 
compressor this is based on the optical
compressors<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> 60s<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:23.970> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
compressors of kind of the 60s that you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.700 
compressors of kind of the 60s that you
see<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> lot<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.570> kind<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.989> studios<00:00:25.349> with<00:00:25.590> like

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
see a lot in kind of studios with like

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.310 
see a lot in kind of studios with like
vintage<00:00:25.950> gear<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.939> you've<00:00:27.090> got<00:00:27.300> almost<00:00:28.169> what

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
vintage gear so you've got almost what

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.170 
vintage gear so you've got almost what
you'd<00:00:28.470> expect<00:00:28.560> from<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> compressor<00:00:29.759> obviously

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
you'd expect from a compressor obviously

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.359 
you'd expect from a compressor obviously
compression<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.840> mount<00:00:31.020> and<00:00:31.829> attacks<00:00:32.160> are

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
compression and mount and attacks are

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
compression and mount and attacks are
how<00:00:32.460> long<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.730> takes<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> come<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
how long it takes to come in but the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.800 
how long it takes to come in but the
game<00:00:34.440> control<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.130> kind<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> heart<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
game control is kind of the heart of

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.440 
game control is kind of the heart of
this<00:00:36.989> unit<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:38.070> where<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.910> set<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> game

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this unit because where you set the game

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.240 
this unit because where you set the game
control<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.050> affects<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.620> compression<00:00:41.130> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
control then affects the compression and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
control then affects the compression and
the<00:00:41.340> TAC<00:00:41.580> controls<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.540> keeping<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> down<00:00:43.410> low

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the TAC controls so keeping it down low

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.340 
the TAC controls so keeping it down low
makes<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.130> much<00:00:44.310> more<00:00:44.550> subtle<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.990> turn<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
makes it much more subtle as you turn it

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
makes it much more subtle as you turn it
up<00:00:46.470> it's<00:00:46.650> almost<00:00:47.010> warming<00:00:47.580> up<00:00:47.670> those<00:00:47.850> vintage

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
up it's almost warming up those vintage

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
up it's almost warming up those vintage
valves<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.690> almost<00:00:48.900> giving<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> more<00:00:50.310> push

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
valves it's almost giving it more push

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.000 
valves it's almost giving it more push
and<00:00:51.240> more<00:00:51.660> attack<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.560> gives<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> lot

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and more attack which gives you a lot

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.070 
and more attack which gives you a lot
more<00:00:53.190> compression<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.630> harder<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> hit

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
more compression so the harder you hit

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.320 
more compression so the harder you hit
it<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.380> more<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.830> get<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.190> works<00:00:56.910> really

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
it the more you get back so works really

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.030 
it the more you get back so works really
well<00:00:57.630> for<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.200> clicky<00:00:58.440> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.830> funk

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
well for kind of clicky kind of funk

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.410 
well for kind of clicky kind of funk
stuff<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.940> nice<00:01:00.150> subtle

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
stuff for is a really nice subtle

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.319 
stuff for is a really nice subtle
compressor<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.680> arpeggios<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
compressor for kind of arpeggios and you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
compressor for kind of arpeggios and you
know<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:03.570> things<00:01:03.720> like<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.900> so<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.530> we'll

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
know and things like that so what we'll

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.780 
know and things like that so what we'll
do<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.799> we'll<00:01:04.890> plug<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.309> I'll<00:01:05.460> run<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
do is we'll plug it in I'll run you

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.160 
do is we'll plug it in I'll run you
through<00:01:05.820> some<00:01:06.060> settings<00:01:06.540> everything<00:01:06.840> from

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
through some settings everything from

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
through some settings everything from
low<00:01:07.350> gain<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.829> high<00:01:07.979> gain<00:01:08.250> some<00:01:08.820> very

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
low gain to high gain some very

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.819 
low gain to high gain some very
compression<00:01:09.540> levels<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
compression levels and see what it

00:01:10.829 --> 00:03:35.910 
compression levels and see what it
sounds<00:01:10.979> like

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.980 

you
