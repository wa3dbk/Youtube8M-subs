00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.290
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.809
 Today I came to talk about something that I 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.689
 I really like you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.630
 accustomed to seeing me using much that is 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.800
 Red lipstick 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.160
 I 'm really in love, I think 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.869
 I do not know how to live like this without another color 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.740
 I think every woman should bet 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.870
 You know why watching him means he can 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.199
 so red lipstick manages to bring 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 that joy can know how to leave a 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:44.399
 simple love thing you know you can 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.460
 without makeup plus a mascara and a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.920
 Red lipstick for me, it 's all like that. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.649
 It's a kind of makeup I like. 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 a lot or if you 're bold you too 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.410
 You can bet on an eye everything mouth everything I 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.039
 I think everyone has it. 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.039
 1 red is not one 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.340
 red that needs to be very flashy 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.770
 there are several shades of red and this 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.680
 is it cool you discover what 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.549
 You better adhere your skin knows by 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.020
 example, black with vibrant colors or 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.229
 with tones of wine I think it stays 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.100
 Wonderful 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.100
 bent I received from natura a collection that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 call my red which are some colors 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.680
 of the brand's red lipsticks and I wanted 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 show each of you in detail 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.450
 this is not a publieditorial ie me 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.180
 I was not able to do this kind of video 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.100
 it is only to receive the products and my 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.530
 love for red lipstick that made me 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.070
 make this video for you 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.710
 so I discovered that I love lipstick 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.180
 has been red for some time and since 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.409
 so so when I see a color 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.170
 whenever red is always 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.659
 looking for where it is because I 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.710
 I want the collection and the more lipstick 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:12.120
 red half I'll start with the lipstick 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.360
 natural liquid to him would have in this 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.200
 neighboring packaging 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.260
 clocked with this gloss applicator 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.360
 What's practical is for you to be able to 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 apply more easily because lipstick 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.800
 red has that thing that he 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.500
 need to be well applied inhabit this 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.060
 liquid lipstick it is very practical so the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.970
 day by day 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.760
 if you want to spend less, it gets more 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.580
 transparent or not if you want 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.350
 abuse enough to spend quite effective 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.820
 that mouth knows the cinema of the 50's 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.090
 This is it from here. 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:54.280
 his cool is that he has fps 15 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.430
 is the price of it at that crowded cost $ 25 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.550
 and it got like that a red tone comes 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.520
 very vibrant on my lips, he knows 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.930
 leaves and gives that labita feel 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.060
 bigger so more complete is so 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.950
 to me it's not so much it's not 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.070
 I know he does not have a bit of 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.970
 dryness of a lipstick is very similar to 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.830
 gloss only those who have more pigmentation 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.750
 It definitely looks gorgeous on the lips. 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.040
 I think that an elegant look is 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.209
 wonderful 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.549
 the next one is the lipstick blog he also has 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.720
 a lip gloss applicator like lipstick 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:37.390
 and it is more so in a color of 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.180
 cherry knows it does not look so red 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.799
 vibrant as liquid lipstick then 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.220
 He's cool because he leaves his mouth. 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.470
 so transparent coverage is then 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.870
 Nice if you want to use it alone to 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.739
 leave that one that tad of 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.750
 cherry know in the lips or use it by 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.780
 on top of another button I think it gives a 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.590
 cool loop in both red tones 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.720
 A little light on the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.500
 red on red 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.299
 cherries if I think it highlights a lot and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.269
 is a good choice if you are also 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.000
 passionate about items for the mouth 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.919
 red knows a good indication and let's 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.979
 more traditional lipsticks than people 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.530
 You know this one is the whole of the line. 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.780
 what appears as well as the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.280
 liquid lipstick 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.740
 Also here this is the moisturizer and lipstick 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.540
 also with something super cool that at 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.669
 Sometimes we just forget it's 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:42.300
 protect the mouth against the sun's rays 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:45.330
 and there have fps 8 the price of it is 1790 he 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.910
 has a very creamy texture know in a tone 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.169
 so red a little bit more 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.810
 closed not so open so tomato or 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.960
 not even so cherry it stays in a tone 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.040
 Medium red is very beautiful is mine. 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.610
 favorite 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.630
 he left his super super moisturizing mouth 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.120
 bulky 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.720
 Wow, I think it's beautiful, the duration is 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.560
 Nice is the duration of a creamy lipstick. 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.200
 if you start and but I loved you entered 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.620
 to my favorites in favorite lipsticks 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.479
 red is the lip gloss 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.910
 lipstick is quite different from that of 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.700
 we use because we often use or 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.360
 creamy or matte and this one is a bet 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.710
 different because it is very transparent 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.950
 he knows he has a very soft kitchen 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.830
 in discreet red and have some 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.630
 shouts at the micro clippers as well 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.120
 Wee even though when you do 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.550
 will move in the mouth gives know to realize 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.550
 that that different brightness is 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.950
 what speech and finishing in gloss is 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.260
 not as wet as gloss but 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:59.100
 also has that different shine know 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.539
 he also has fps 8 and I found a treat 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.090
 According to this lipstick 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.760
 the next one is the darling because 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.500
 max finishing became darling of 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.630
 our Brazilian consumers with 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.050
 sure because who is not looking for 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:18.660
 a red matte lipstick is not really 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:21.510
 so the natura has to it has fps 10 and 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.990
 It costs 19 and 80 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.210
 It's a pretty cool price, he's got a 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.050
 legal coverage only that it is not 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.770
 extremely strong so dry is one is 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.820
 that I'm using too is he is so the 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.430
 application 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.250
 it's creamy it looks like this 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.680
 more sequinho but not that bother know 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.740
 how are you dry so it's okay 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.590
 comfortable and his tone what is cool is 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.250
 that is not very flashy is not that it is 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.950
 so super vibrant 1st and neither that 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.040
 very rosy room with the ones that do not 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.500
 like red so soft yes and it has 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.960
 others that may even start to like 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.730
 because sometimes mine have 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.540
 difficulty getting started with lipstick 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:12.630
 red because I can not see one 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:15.270
 lipstick ybrant so maybe then the lipstick 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.100
 mate of natura watercolor be a good 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.120
 option because it has a tone as soon as it 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.120
 for all 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.880
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.780
 of these red lipstick options do the 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.640
 your bets 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.130
 I just was not without a little bat 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.630
 red I already found my red 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.550
 Ok folks 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.550
 I'll see you until the next rain
