00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and a holographic face bolt so I just

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.099 
and a holographic face bolt so I just
want<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> make<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> clarification<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.780> this

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
want to make a clarification that this

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.500 
want to make a clarification that this
is<00:00:16.289> not<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.980> hyper<00:00:17.250> blade<00:00:17.609> series<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
is not the hyper blade series this is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.950 
is not the hyper blade series this is
still<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.619> normal<00:00:20.010> middle<00:00:20.670> Fury<00:00:20.960> series

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
still just a normal middle Fury series

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.920 
still just a normal middle Fury series
but<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.800> does<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.300> spark<00:00:24.300> effects<00:00:24.630> which

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
but it does have spark effects which

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.019 
but it does have spark effects which
basically<00:00:25.350> means<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.949> recolored<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.849> has<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
basically means it's recolored it has a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.779 
basically means it's recolored it has a
holographic<00:00:27.599> faceful<00:00:28.170> alright<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> found

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
holographic faceful alright so I found

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.049 
holographic faceful alright so I found

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
spacing so that's the box let's get to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:24.600 
spacing so that's the box let's get to
unboxing<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.500> check<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:15.240> beyblade

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.920 

you

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.650 

see<00:01:27.680> here<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.730> instruction<00:01:29.450> manual<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
see here is the instruction manual the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.070 
see here is the instruction manual the
launcher<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.740> record<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:35.420> here<00:01:35.870> is<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
launcher and the record and here is the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.280 
launcher and the record and here is the
collector<00:01:39.080> card<00:01:39.320> with<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.680> code<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:41.540> this<00:01:42.080> is

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
collector card with the code so this is

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.090 
collector card with the code so this is
the<00:01:42.410> front<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.920> then<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.150> is<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.720> code<00:01:45.100> all

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the front and then this is the code all

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.480 
the front and then this is the code all
right<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:46.460> let's<00:01:47.950> take<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.010> look<00:01:49.190> at<00:01:49.370> this

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
right so let's take a look at this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.490 
right so let's take a look at this
beyblade<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.810> will<00:01:50.960> definitely<00:01:51.320> do<00:01:51.470> a

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
beyblade and I will definitely do a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.940 
beyblade and I will definitely do a
comparison<00:01:51.980> with<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:55.510> 40<00:01:56.510> beyblade<00:01:56.900> so<00:01:57.680> here

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
comparison with the 40 beyblade so here

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.790 
comparison with the 40 beyblade so here
we<00:01:58.100> have<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.490> face<00:01:58.700> bolt<00:01:59.290> the<00:02:00.290> holographic

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
we have the face bolt the holographic

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.750 
we have the face bolt the holographic
face<00:02:01.220> bolt<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.880> is<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.420> sticker<00:02:03.580> it's<00:02:04.580> not

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
face bolt it is just a sticker it's not

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.520 
face bolt it is just a sticker it's not
printed<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.150> or<00:02:05.360> anything<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:07.490> there<00:02:07.760> is

beyblade you can see there's a lot of

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.030 
beyblade you can see there's a lot of
differences<00:04:11.110> not<00:04:12.110> much<00:04:12.320> difference<00:04:12.769> in<00:04:13.010> the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040

colors but definitely in the metal

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:30.760 
colors but definitely in the metal
wheels<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.729> how<00:04:29.560> Hasbro<00:04:30.560> has

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770

interpreted<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.800> attack<00:04:34.160> mode

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
interpreted it this is the attack mode

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.500 
interpreted it this is the attack mode
of<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:36.130> Takara<00:04:37.130> Tomy<00:04:37.190> version<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.180> forty

change<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.099> fact<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.340> it's<00:05:04.610> not<00:05:04.849> an

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
change in the fact that it's not an
