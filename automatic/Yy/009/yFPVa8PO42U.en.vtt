00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
particular aspect but on heavy emphasis

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.100

on the prestige mode with the generation

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.130 
on the prestige mode with the generation
system<00:05:35.740> so<00:05:37.230> kind<00:05:38.230> of<00:05:38.320> just<00:05:38.470> looking<00:05:38.830> at<00:05:39.040> what's

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
system so kind of just looking at what's

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.830 
system so kind of just looking at what's
shown<00:05:41.160> there's<00:05:42.160> definitely<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.120> lot<00:05:43.390> of<00:05:43.600> stuff

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
shown there's definitely a lot of stuff

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.070 
shown there's definitely a lot of stuff
that<00:05:44.050> makes<00:05:44.320> me<00:05:44.590> feel<00:05:44.920> encouraged<00:05:45.550> and

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
that makes me feel encouraged and

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.870 
that makes me feel encouraged and
overall<00:05:47.080> really<00:05:47.590> hyped<00:05:47.800> up<00:05:47.980> to<00:05:48.160> see<00:05:48.340> what<00:05:48.730> the

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
overall really hyped up to see what the

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.640 
overall really hyped up to see what the
actual<00:05:49.270> game<00:05:49.420> is<00:05:49.720> going<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:49.930> intel<00:05:50.200> completely

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
actual game is going to intel completely

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.170 
actual game is going to intel completely
because<00:05:50.830> obviously<00:05:51.040> this<00:05:51.490> is<00:05:51.670> a<00:05:51.700> threat<00:05:52.030> of

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
because obviously this is a threat of

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.620 
because obviously this is a threat of
leaks<00:05:52.770> there<00:05:53.770> may<00:05:53.950> be<00:05:53.980> a<00:05:54.160> lot<00:05:54.370> more<00:05:54.430> stuff<00:05:54.910> that

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
leaks there may be a lot more stuff that

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.620 
leaks there may be a lot more stuff that
we<00:05:55.780> have<00:05:55.810> yet<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.260> see<00:05:56.290> and<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:57.390> there<00:05:58.390> was<00:05:58.510> like

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.370 
book early and it was like supposed to
be<00:06:06.580> released<00:06:06.910> like<00:06:07.330> last<00:06:07.780> week<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.200> they<00:06:08.260> got

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
be released like last week and they got

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.630 
be released like last week and they got
like<00:06:08.500> two<00:06:08.680> weeks<00:06:08.800> ago<00:06:08.980> or<00:06:09.130> something<00:06:09.460> like

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
like two weeks ago or something like

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.060 
like two weeks ago or something like
that<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:10.260> they<00:06:11.260> showed<00:06:11.500> off<00:06:11.650> that<00:06:11.830> there's

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
that and they showed off that there's

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.580 
that and they showed off that there's
actually<00:06:12.340> monsters<00:06:13.210> as<00:06:13.360> well<00:06:13.570> so<00:06:14.050> along<00:06:14.560> with

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
actually monsters as well so along with

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.010 
actually monsters as well so along with
the<00:06:14.860> NPC's<00:06:15.310> there's<00:06:15.520> actually<00:06:16.060> some<00:06:16.540> monsters

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
the NPC's there's actually some monsters

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.750 
the NPC's there's actually some monsters
that<00:06:17.140> probably<00:06:17.800> plays<00:06:18.220> some<00:06:18.490> sort<00:06:18.700> of

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
that probably plays some sort of

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.630 
that probably plays some sort of
significance<00:06:19.450> to<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.810> game<00:06:20.370> for<00:06:21.370> another

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
significance to the game for another

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.380 
significance to the game for another
probably<00:06:22.120> player<00:06:22.870> versus<00:06:23.230> enemy<00:06:23.590> element<00:06:24.390> and

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
probably player versus enemy element and

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.850 
probably player versus enemy element and
that's<00:06:25.540> going<00:06:26.020> to<00:06:26.110> be<00:06:26.169> something<00:06:26.350> else<00:06:26.650> though

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
that's going to be something else though

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.900 
that's going to be something else though
it's<00:06:27.070> going<00:06:27.190> to<00:06:27.250> be<00:06:27.340> interesting<00:06:27.460> to<00:06:27.730> see

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
it's going to be interesting to see

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.909 
it's going to be interesting to see
exactly<00:06:28.240> what<00:06:28.720> that<00:06:28.870> entails<00:06:29.290> and<00:06:29.620> what<00:06:29.650> that

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
exactly what that entails and what that

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:30.670 
exactly what that entails and what that
has<00:06:30.040> to<00:06:30.070> do<00:06:30.310> with<00:06:30.430> the

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
has to do with the

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.230 
has to do with the
whether<00:06:30.979> it's<00:06:31.190> more<00:06:31.580> of<00:06:31.639> a<00:06:31.699> multiplayer
