00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello swami max how do you understand it 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.000
 again tactics and today we will have 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.000
 phantom cass mom 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.040
 what do kim phantom do 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.470
 to quickly break the face of the enemy 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.750
 Now I will give a couple of examples as in 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.150
 solo can pick them up first example 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.730
 traxa letting go you're one going to push 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.160
 t2 but she needs to prevent 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:44.090
 yes I have in the inventory could power treads 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.370
 would k there was a storm in general look second 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.590
 An example is worth such a moon on the Freeboard as 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.510
 always on the way yana break her face 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.149
 really not fast due to my 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.309
 there was no bkb she slapped me 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.890
 and so there would be a side think 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.079
 would soon have turned out okay think about 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.289
 Japan, which is why my initial 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.810
 procurement caresses from angus seeking and 1 iron branch 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:12.410
 you can buy two but you can not 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.720
 buy at your discretion are standing on or 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.180
 not support of course and farm fast moms 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.729
 then you can buy either phase or pt 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.100
 also at your discretion who still does not know 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.039
 phrases give speed as well as damage and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.740
 gives plus 30 attack speeds well 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.170
 plus 8 selected boot option to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.149
 example plus 8 grade bone and what 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.220
 then it is necessary to collect about to collect 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.090
 following artifact either bashir or 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.310
 milestone 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.410
 I think first yours and then l what 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.690
 shorter going on in default 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.700
 cary we with all this tactic i think already 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.099
 you understand that it will be fast 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.530
 wreck the face of the enemy and the brand 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.450
 there they really fall fast and yes 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.170
 one note if you play against 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.020
 Aksa 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.080
 You can immediately write gg. this is the most 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.130
 tough enemy phantoms still you and mom in 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.410
 general fear 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.929
