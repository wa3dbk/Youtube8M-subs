00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.460
 hop 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.690
 of course everyone here Masters 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.020
 fiction today we find ourselves for 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.610
 a new video on sim city so 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.270
 so here today I'm going to you 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.670
 to present a line a little more advanced 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.830
 because I think my episodes of 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.129
 kit for good MP I will stop them 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.050
 I think I think I made you 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.050
 have made us see everything there 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.610
 had to make you see down for good 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.750
 start 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.530
 So here we are today 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.120
 in a city a little more advanced 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.269
 I'll have something to say to you too 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.280
 I'll have some tips to tell you then 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.110
 so 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.230
 so here I am one hundred and seventy three 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.610
 thousand inhabitants must know that this 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.399
 city, however, I do not get too much 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.199
 to develop it I'm a deficit 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.909
 so here I am a little galley a year 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.490
 she is so great that 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.009
 I arrive more so what is it 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.950
 in this city I laid a center 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.929
 exposure so I can provide 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.570
 events so there I took planned a 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:23.590
 event a sporting event 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.780
 so that's after I asked a lot of 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.970
 building that attracts tourists kind 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.670
 that I do not know how I do not know 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.640
 how they ever end chrome but 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.840
 here is the tower of pisa 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.960
 then another thing here is it willis 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.729
 tower then I asked 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.979
 the university i'm trying to 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.759
 search the space shipyard what 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.340
 will allow me to build a center 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.689
 space in large building 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.110
 here we see all my buildings 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.640
 that have evolved tremendously can be 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.000
 walk around the city to see a little 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.740
 what it's doing here is not bad 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.340
 if you want to have fun doing 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.330
 like that frankly it's not bad 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.900
 then I laid a nuclear power station 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.720
 with reactors beats for the city 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.420
 could not problems of electricity 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.300
 it's really practical too but 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.890
 attention with nuclear power plants 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.720
 since if you have employees not 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.400
 fairly skilled 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.130
 Well, she's just at risk 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.709
 exploded there it's at the end of your 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.780
 city ​​that everything is irradiated no one anymore 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.760
 will not come 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.980
 so here it was I wanted you 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.110
 show it in this city we will go 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.820
 immediately to another city 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.880
 I will tell you about my new 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.510
 concept that's it at all right away 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.470
 rather to immediately everyone is 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.750
 well received the world 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.090
 so we end up on one of my 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.580
 other cities so here it is a city 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.080
 purely industrial 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.380
 I put things to pollute everywhere 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.760
 I even have to be put a little too much 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.340
 we can clearly see that I read power stations 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.890
 coal in order to mine coal mines have 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.019
 advanced and where ore mines by 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.880
 all everywhere from the foundries vosges to a 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.590
 huge deficit but on the other hand I win 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.610
 enormously thanks to actually trade 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.790
 every day I earn 100 thousand I 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.989
 do we pretty much say that like that 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.049
 so this is a city really 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.319
 purely industrial polluting everything 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.659
 what do you want 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.959
 do not do that if you want 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.810
 large green spaces so the suction of 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.499
 regions where there are a lot of people 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.719
 you will be able to see it there is no 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.909
 a lot of people so with cities evolved 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.790
 we even managed to counter a project 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.480
 archaeological so it's a bit of a 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.629
 city ​​in celebration 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:57.480
 I do not have how to find Sylvie explained 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:59.889
 but not too much it's a fine rest and 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.799
 locals go where to rest 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.599
 finally just like that 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.349
 it's a little dozens like like 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.939
 place ok here so what I 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.120
 wanted to talk to you as a concept 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.819
 it was for example if you have a 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.459
 city ​​that has marked you or a region 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.530
 Lent or for example I will not you 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.070
 have a lot of people all the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.270
 stuff like that 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:29.470

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:33.460

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.520

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.890
 pleasure to come to your area for 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.970

 to see who will say anything so here it 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.240
 could not be bad to present 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.960
 other cities of other people too 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.240
