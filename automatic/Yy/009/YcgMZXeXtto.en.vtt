be a very uh you know big assumption of

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.880 
be a very uh you know big assumption of
mine<00:05:13.500> but<00:05:14.220> i<00:05:14.280> think<00:05:14.640> at<00:05:15.300> least<00:05:15.570> i<00:05:15.930> have<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.650> very

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
mine but i think at least i have a very

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.550 
mine but i think at least i have a very
strong<00:05:17.280> belief<00:05:17.520> in<00:05:18.030> this<00:05:18.810> assumption<00:05:19.200> you

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
strong belief in this assumption you

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.740 
strong belief in this assumption you
know<00:05:19.650> i<00:05:19.680> do<00:05:20.130> think<00:05:20.760> what<00:05:21.000> i'm<00:05:21.120> saying<00:05:21.450> is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750

know i do think what i'm saying is
correct<00:05:21.990> if<00:05:22.440> i'm<00:05:22.979> wrong<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.310> long<00:05:23.669> run<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.180> a

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
correct if i'm wrong a long run and a

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.120 
correct if i'm wrong a long run and a
lot<00:05:24.479> of<00:05:24.510> people<00:05:24.630> say<00:05:25.050> i'm<00:05:25.350> wrong<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.710> shit

like<00:05:26.160> that<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.790> they<00:05:27.300> don't<00:05:27.570> answer<00:05:27.810> right

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
like that and they don't answer right

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.180 
like that and they don't answer right
that<00:05:28.440> ok<00:05:28.830> whatever<00:05:29.370> but<00:05:30.180> i<00:05:30.650> think<00:05:31.650> like<00:05:32.160> I

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
that ok whatever but i think like I

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.740 
that ok whatever but i think like I
strongly<00:05:32.640> believe<00:05:32.760> that<00:05:33.030> I'm<00:05:33.300> right<00:05:33.330> about
