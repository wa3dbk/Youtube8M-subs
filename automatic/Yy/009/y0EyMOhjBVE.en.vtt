 hi lobbys, well, well, I bring a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.070
 hairstyle video with a guest 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.170
 special 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.700
 elena that is ron roll of I will leave you for 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.550
 here your channel and also the description 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.160
 good and good is very kawaii hairstyles 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.349
 so let's start 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.690
 well the first hairstyle is very simple and 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.630
 very simple what we are going to do is 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.210
 take a small section of the part of 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.520
 above the head and let's do so 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.739
 like a pigtail and we will do the same 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.470
 on both sides it has to be like this 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.510
 fall very loose but you can press it 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.739
 a little bit more so that it stays with a 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.309
 little volume and we do the same in the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.309
 other side 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.510
 they are simply two very loose tails 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.470
 but the truth is that it is very cute 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.890
 because it 's like two little things that are not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.670
 typical and if you put some bow 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.290
 they are something I think is very nice 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.290
 and forward 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.710
 the second hairstyle is a little more 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.780
 elaborated but it 's very easy to do 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.570
 we divide the head into two halves 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.690
 same and after the first half the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.760
 we are going to divide equally into two halves and 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.040
 let's make a little pigtail and go 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.900
 to make a bow turn the whole lock 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.560
 and we are doing as well as a small 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.560
 made scope 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.940
 and we hold them with hairpins that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.130
 simply expose them like this below and 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.080
 you do not undo the bun you do it like this 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.990
 like half of the head and then with 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.090
 the back we're just going to 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.410
 make a ponytail at the height of the bun 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.720
 very pegadito you have to look like this 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.720
 Pegadito so you do not notice the cut 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.879
 and we do the same on the other side if 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.160
 you want to decorate it you can put a 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.349
 I tie there in the bun and it's super 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.989
 monkey we do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.540
 we just make a pigtail we turn 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.709
 we make the bun the pigtail and we put the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.709
 tie and you would be 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.240
 Amen 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.850
 third good hairstyle in this hairstyle 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.370
 first let's make a braid in what 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.900
 what is the fringe and we are going to make a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.560
 triangulito let's divide into three 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.300
 mesons and we're going to braid but one 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.610
 turn or normal and then the next 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.819
 back we will be adding strands of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.159
 rest of the bangs 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.909
 as you are seeing there at the time of 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.670
 turn the lock we take a lock of the 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.680
 head and braid 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.530
 let's see that it is a bit loose 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.780
 so that it is not so tight and what 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.780
 we do until we finish the bangs 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 do not 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.690
 by hand 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.790
 when it has already become very long 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.610
 we keep braiding normal just 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.980
 with those strands and tie it with a 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.050
 You can leave a little gummie so 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.060
 the truth is that it is very beautiful or what 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.970
 What am I going to do? 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.019
 little the other side's hair so that 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.019
 day a little more volume 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.370
 I'm going to throw all my hair at him 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.960
 side where I have put the braid and with 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.140
 all that hair I'm going to make a braid 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.850
 on that normal and current side I put 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.540
 a little bow and I think it's very, very 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.540
 very pretty 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.000
 well then I hope that I have 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.129
 liked the video that I made 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.259
 especially with her to teach the 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.970
 care for short hair and you see that 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.009
 It can be done perfectly even if 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.509
 you have it a little bit even if 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.080
 you have around here I think you can 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.080
 do so 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.730
 and I hope you liked it in the 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:37.730
 next and a little kiss bai help 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.730

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.250

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.210
