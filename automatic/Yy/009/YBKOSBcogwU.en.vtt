00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
will probably work a bit different

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
will probably work a bit different
different<00:01:23.880> runescape<00:01:24.780> itself<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.590> these

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
different runescape itself see these

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.270 
different runescape itself see these
doors<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.549> only<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:27.840> opened<00:01:28.140> by<00:01:28.590> Sara<00:01:29.070> Dolan

before<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.380> works<00:01:40.890> I'll

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
before it actually works I'll

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450 
before it actually works I'll
demonstrate<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.329> I'll<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:44.189> way<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
demonstrate that I'll go this way and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460 
demonstrate that I'll go this way and
use<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> stepping<00:01:45.299> stones<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.899> shoulders<00:01:46.320> as

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
use a stepping stones and shoulders as

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.910 
use a stepping stones and shoulders as
well

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.310 

now<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:54.980> don't<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.400> that<00:01:55.610> hopping

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
now you don't have that hopping

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.420 
now you don't have that hopping
animation<00:01:57.320> but<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:57.710> don't<00:01:57.920> think<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.400> really

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
animation but I don't think it really

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.370 
animation but I don't think it really
matters<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:59.180> much<00:01:59.510> if<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.840> really<00:01:59.990> wanted

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
matters that much if you really wanted

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:15.089 
matters that much if you really wanted
sure<00:02:00.710> I'll<00:02:00.920> added<00:02:01.340> doesn't<00:02:01.790> really<00:02:01.910> matter

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.460 

yeah<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.129> get<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.459> messages<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.930> door<00:02:18.110> didn't

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
budge let's try and blah blah blah so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.729 
budge let's try and blah blah blah so
again<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.760> takes<00:02:22.939> about<00:02:23.090> 15<00:02:23.780> times<00:02:24.140> before<00:02:24.650> you

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
again it takes about 15 times before you

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.190 
again it takes about 15 times before you
actually<00:02:24.920> open<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.579> and<00:02:25.700> these<00:02:26.480> doors<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:27.140> be

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
actually open it and these doors can be

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.350 
actually open it and these doors can be
locked<00:02:27.709> of<00:02:27.950> course<00:02:27.980> again<00:02:28.790> three<00:02:29.329> times

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
locked of course again three times

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.619 
locked of course again three times
during<00:02:29.900> again<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.640> case<00:02:31.909> can<00:02:32.209> be<00:02:32.239> locked

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
during again in this case can be locked

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.870 

there<00:03:01.220> we<00:03:01.459> go<00:03:02.680> now<00:03:03.680> I'll<00:03:03.920> switch<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
there we go now I'll switch to the
