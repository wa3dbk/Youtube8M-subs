out try to find that you have to have an
order<00:03:08.300> like<00:03:08.420> Dan<00:03:08.690> Gilbert<00:03:09.170> that's<00:03:09.560> willing<00:03:09.950> to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
order like Dan Gilbert that's willing to

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.220 
order like Dan Gilbert that's willing to
spend<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> money<00:03:10.610> on<00:03:10.850> which<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.510> which<00:03:11.930> he<00:03:12.080> is

the right right way of both of them for

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.060 
the right right way of both of them for
especially<00:03:26.840> defensively<00:03:27.019> but<00:03:27.860> what

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
especially defensively but what

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.220 
especially defensively but what
tangibles<00:03:28.850> can<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.180> try<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.840> bring<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
tangibles can you try to bring to the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.470 
tangibles can you try to bring to the
table<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.560> help<00:03:30.680> your<00:03:30.890> team<00:03:31.070> win<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
table to help your team win and the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.780 
table to help your team win and the
first<00:03:32.690> thing<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:33.019> we<00:03:33.110> thought<00:03:33.320> about<00:03:33.790> when

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
first thing that we thought about when

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.729 
first thing that we thought about when
we<00:03:34.910> talk<00:03:34.940> about<00:03:35.150> championships<00:03:36.080> it's

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
we talk about championships it's

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.259 
we talk about championships it's
chemistry<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.430> always<00:03:37.700> hear<00:03:37.850> people<00:03:37.880> say

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
chemistry you always hear people say

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.790 
chemistry you always hear people say
well<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.959> got<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.230> have<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.440> right<00:03:39.470> chemistry

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
well you got to have the right chemistry

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.850 
well you got to have the right chemistry
and<00:03:40.400> we've<00:03:41.300> put<00:03:41.989> our<00:03:42.110> hands<00:03:42.320> again<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.650> we

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
and we've put our hands again and we

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.970 
and we've put our hands again and we
thought<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.489> chemistry<00:03:44.530> was<00:03:45.530> defined

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
thought that chemistry was defined

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.809 
thought that chemistry was defined
simply<00:03:46.700> by<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.030> word<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.390> try

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
simply by the word to try

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.800 
simply by the word to try
and<00:03:48.530> opening<00:03:49.530> night<00:03:49.799> dinner<00:03:50.549> before<00:03:51.480> training

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
and opening night dinner before training

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.539 
and opening night dinner before training
camp<00:03:51.930> that's<00:03:52.530> all<00:03:52.680> we<00:03:52.799> talked<00:03:53.040> about<00:03:53.159> we

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
camp that's all we talked about we

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.039 
camp that's all we talked about we
