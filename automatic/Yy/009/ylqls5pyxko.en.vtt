00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:14.581
Nothing beats spending time with friends... 

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:15.984
old friends, 

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:16.756
new friends, 

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:19.717
team mates, 

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:20.936
rivals.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:22.733
Precious moments 

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.902
sharing experiences and ideas.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.590
Even though we’re on opposite sides of the world,

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.224
we’re part of the same tribe.

00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:05.206
We share common goals 

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:06.137
and values...

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.881
we share jokes and stories... 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.150
food and drink, and good times

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:25.744
We get inspiration from the connections we make, 

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:27.664
seeing what others do and how they do it 

00:01:28.428 --> 00:01:31.928
motivates us and new ideas are formed.

00:01:57.982 --> 00:02:00.241
there is excitement in the air, 

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:04.077
energy is created, sparks fly...

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.588
We can learn so much 

00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:09.195
if we put ourselves in someone else’s shoes.

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:33.152
Who is your biggest inspiration?

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:35.929
Who's in your tribe?

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.020
If you could put yourself in someone else’s shoes

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:41.176
whose would you choose?

00:02:42.063 --> 00:02:43.439
Put yourself in their shoes...

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:44.875
Put yourself in my shoes...
