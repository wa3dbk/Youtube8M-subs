00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.250
 everything starts in the sacks of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.740
 peanut brought from Chihuahua and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.740
 sinaloa and that are stored in a cellar 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.580
 cold to 18 degrees to prevent it from 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.580
 raise bugs 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:24.580
 and they take the roasters where they will pass 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.580
 45 minutes at 140 degrees and after 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.620
 about 30 degrees centigrade 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.920
 you pass you go to the brancher area and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.489
 selection that what makes the rangers the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.460
 range what he does is scrape peanut 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.730
 it removes the cuticle and with 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 air extractors 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.250
 they separate the cuticle the peanut 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.250
 water marks is to find the clean 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.530
 clean the peanut passes the grinding and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.930
 then mix it with sugar to create the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.649
 peanut cajeta and then it 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.649
 will pulverize 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.330
 is sent to be analyzed to remove the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.120
 aflatoxin tests 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.600
 after the photo if you do not go to the 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.720
 mills and there are breaks he grinds he does 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 We do not pass pasta to those who come 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.650
 being the blenders 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.980
 but I remember 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.780
 will be formed 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.570
 the marzipan 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.760
 the packaging machines with these 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.980
 machines that we have here 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.830
 I wanted to pass the woman who is 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.460
 in the machinist and is feeding the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.000
 machine you are in the pill the machine 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.000
 It is the pill of the form and it wraps 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.100
 before the candy bars were made 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.409
 by hand but with the machines the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.939
 production increases 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.939
 where the finest is formed
