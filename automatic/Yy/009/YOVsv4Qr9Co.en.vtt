00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
composition but it is incredibly hard to

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.729 
composition but it is incredibly hard to

witnessed yield when to use all these

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.479 
witnessed yield when to use all these
defensive<00:03:41.780> abilities<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.530> they<00:03:43.310> just

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
defensive abilities and they just

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.250 
defensive abilities and they just
haven't<00:03:43.819> they<00:03:44.420> haven't<00:03:44.630> played<00:03:45.049> it

haven't they haven't played it
particularly<00:03:45.829> well<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.340> they<00:03:46.459> missed<00:03:46.670> their

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
particularly well and they missed their

particularly well and they missed their
timing<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:47.390> now<00:03:47.510> genera<00:03:47.840> will<00:03:47.959> just<00:03:48.110> be<00:03:48.200> able

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
timing so now genera will just be able

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.839 
timing so now genera will just be able
to<00:03:48.410> close<00:03:48.620> not<00:03:48.799> even<00:03:48.860> going<00:03:49.430> for<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.640> fifth

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
to close not even going for the fifth

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.059 
to close not even going for the fifth

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
end here from genera I like what they

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.900 
end here from genera I like what they
did<00:03:53.959> yeah<00:03:54.410> one<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.860> most<00:03:55.099> decisive<00:03:55.489> ents

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
did yeah one of the most decisive ents

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.309 
did yeah one of the most decisive ents
we've<00:03:56.060> seen<00:03:56.269> from<00:03:56.420> genera<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:56.959> season<00:03:57.260> I

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
we've seen from genera this season I

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.630 
we've seen from genera this season I
think<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.620> was<00:03:57.769> really<00:03:57.920> tight<00:03:58.220> all<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.489> way

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
think that was really tight all the way

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.480 
think that was really tight all the way
through<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.239> Game<00:03:59.450> one
