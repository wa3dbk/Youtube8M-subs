 current tournaments yesterday we reported 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.979

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.909
 give them 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.230

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.930
 rivals like the french titans inari and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.640
 confess honestly despite the fact that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.739
 full game consisted of three cards 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.629
 the result became known after the first 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.819
 before the inferno was extremely interesting 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.620
 especially its outcome when the teams became 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.540

 two in addition so the score became 5 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.099
 3 in favor of the born win then 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.840
 exchange of rounds continued and the first 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.389
 half ended quite naturally 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.639
 in 87 in favor of giving them after the change of sides 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.769
 the game has become more stress both teams are not

 wanted to give advantage however under 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.599

 we all do not even understand what happened 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.860

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.890
 the tip is in the back picking up the organ and 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.370
 slaughterhouse 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:33.919

 card give them and they go out for sure 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.740
 the battle in persons crack 3 takes place on 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.200
 map where depending on the level 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.419
 defensive player is from 2 to 5 so 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.490
 called attacker resource points 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.890
 player gets resources for capturing points and 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.540
 spend resources on restoration 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.910
 lost in combat equipment for a year and a half 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.070
 online mode has become more interesting and understandable 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.330
 more dynamic thanks to a couple of innovations 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.040
 firstly now you can do it yourself 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.300
 test your defense and this 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.919
 works so obvious and 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.990
 it is natural that it is not clear how to do 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.310
 it was possible to play earlier in the attack players 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.650
 got a whole range of extra 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.540
 abilities like artillery call 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.310
 smoke screen support and other 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.800
 useful things can now be destroyed 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.450
 minefields barrage no firing points 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.430
 putting your troops under attack 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.990
 this is almost a priceless opportunity 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.240
 cases when the defending player 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.470
 blocked the bridge or rashly assembled 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.300
 a lot of technology in a bunch 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.610
 the rest of the changes were mainly made 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.560
 underwater part of the economy balance game and 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.180
 development systems so the challenge 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.950
 developers was to 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.510
 equal to interest players and in 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.740
 building maximum effective 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.140
 defense and in order to risk 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.090
 sending your troops to attack according 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.680
 developers all is well gradually with 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.720
 experience comes to the player more and more 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.700
 deep understanding of the possibilities of the game and 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.080
 so the alignment of troops and structures 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.120
 over time it becomes more and more 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.080
 aggressive leaving the enemy to everyone 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.360
 less resources 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.400
 the same applies to such a side 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.350
 Blitzkrieg 3 teams ahead still very 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.120
 a lot of work in the game is desperately needed new 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.740
 interface vital system 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.810
 ratings not completed development 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.250
 solo campaigns also in 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.600
 online mode is planned introduction 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.280
 additional chips like 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.050
 patrolling and setting up models 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.120
 detachment behavior in remote 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.020
 run after release is possible 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.759
 creation we 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.190
 a different version of the game and the traditional 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.660
 synchronous online battles on 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.800
 that's all dear friends thank you for 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.800
 attention all bye
