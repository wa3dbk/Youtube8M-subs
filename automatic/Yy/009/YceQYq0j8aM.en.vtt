and<00:01:28.090> once<00:01:28.240> that's<00:01:28.420> finished<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.869> should<00:01:29.020> drain

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
and once that's finished it should drain

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.410

about three quarts and then we'll go on

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
about three quarts and then we'll go on
to<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.570> next<00:01:31.750> step<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.080> filling<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.440> up

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to the next step of filling it up

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.560 
to the next step of filling it up
alright<00:01:33.610> after<00:01:33.760> you<00:01:33.909> have<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.150> drain<00:01:34.390> bolt

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
alright after you have the drain bolt

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.670 
alright after you have the drain bolt
off<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.080> see<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.350> little<00:01:35.530> bit<00:01:35.619> of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
off you can see it's a little bit of

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.990 
off you can see it's a little bit of
sludge<00:01:35.890> buildup<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.640> you're<00:01:36.760> going<00:01:36.850> to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
sludge buildup on it you're going to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.030 
sludge buildup on it you're going to
clean<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.360> off<00:01:37.659> just<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:38.260> soft<00:01:38.500> paper<00:01:38.770> towel

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
not wash it right there when you go buy

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.940 
not wash it right there when you go buy
them<00:01:43.930> make<00:01:44.050> sure<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.229> just<00:01:44.380> buy<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> couple<00:01:44.860> of

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
them make sure you just buy a couple of

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.540 
them make sure you just buy a couple of
them<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:46.680> next<00:01:47.680> step<00:01:47.800> we're<00:01:47.920> going<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.070> do<00:01:48.250> is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
them and next step we're going to do is

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.969 
them and next step we're going to do is
find<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.330> ATM<00:01:49.690> all<00:01:50.350> right<00:01:50.500> when<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:50.710> forgot<00:01:50.860> to

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
find the ATM all right when I forgot to

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.109 
find the ATM all right when I forgot to
mention<00:01:51.130> when<00:01:51.340> you're<00:01:51.460> cleaning<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.880> drain

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
mention when you're cleaning the drain

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.580 
mention when you're cleaning the drain
bolt<00:01:52.300> it's<00:01:52.630> probably<00:01:52.899> easier<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.259> put<00:01:53.470> that

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
bolt it's probably easier to put that

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.219 
bolt it's probably easier to put that
back<00:01:53.770> in<00:01:54.040> let<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.060> car<00:01:55.240> down<00:01:55.450> from<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.960> jacks

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
back in let the car down from the jacks

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.830 
back in let the car down from the jacks
and<00:01:56.790> work<00:01:57.790> on<00:01:57.940> it<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.090> way<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:58.360> here's<00:01:58.720> your

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
and work on it that way so here's your

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.240 
and work on it that way so here's your
engine<00:01:59.110> bay<00:01:59.259> you're<00:01:59.770> going<00:01:59.890> to<00:01:59.950> want<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.100> look

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
engine bay you're going to want to look

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.770 
engine bay you're going to want to look
right<00:02:00.399> back<00:02:00.580> here<00:02:00.820> I'm<00:02:01.360> assuming<00:02:01.479> that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
right back here I'm assuming that

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.410 
right back here I'm assuming that
already<00:02:02.200> you're<00:02:03.190> gonna<00:02:03.310> see<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.940> see<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.119> bolt

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
already you're gonna see you see a bolt

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.100 
already you're gonna see you see a bolt
right<00:02:04.450> down<00:02:04.720> there

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
right down there

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.660 
right down there
I<00:02:05.140> can't<00:02:05.470> delay<00:02:05.679> them<00:02:05.800> enough<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.009> ATF<00:02:09.399> on

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
I can't delay them enough this is ATF on

it's easier he needs some because of the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.060 
it's easier he needs some because of the
extension<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:17.290> need<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> little<00:02:17.650> more<00:02:17.769> torque

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
extension you need a little more torque

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.070 
extension you need a little more torque
just<00:02:18.519> take<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.790> off<00:02:18.970> there's<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.690> washer<00:02:20.019> on

it<00:02:20.140> next<00:02:20.920> step<00:02:21.100> pretty<00:02:21.700> common-sense<00:02:22.030> is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
it next step pretty common-sense is

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.570 
it next step pretty common-sense is
going<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> take<00:02:23.050> your<00:02:23.260> long<00:02:23.560> funnel<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.160> mean

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
going to take your long funnel I mean

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.949 
going to take your long funnel I mean
how<00:02:24.730> long<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.420> need<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> pretty<00:02:25.750> long

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
how long this is you need a pretty long

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.940 
how long this is you need a pretty long
one<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.200> make<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.380> easy<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:27.480> set<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.660> there

to try to show you guys with the
training<00:03:03.760> filter<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.570> don't<00:03:05.170> know<00:03:05.320> if<00:03:05.380> you

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
training filter is I don't know if you

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.509 
training filter is I don't know if you
can<00:03:05.560> see<00:03:05.739> down<00:03:05.769> there<00:03:08.820> except<00:03:09.820> black<00:03:10.060> thing

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
can see down there except black thing

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.479 
can see down there except black thing
it's<00:03:12.519> kind<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.730> hard<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.940> shed<00:03:14.250> that's<00:03:15.250> right

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
it's kind of hard to shed that's right

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.060 
it's kind of hard to shed that's right
there<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.700> can<00:03:15.820> see<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.799> little<00:03:17.799> bar

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
there you can see the little bar

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.890 
there you can see the little bar
sticking<00:03:18.430> out<00:03:18.549> that's<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.359> think<00:03:19.750> that's

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
sticking out that's the I think that's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.039 
sticking out that's the I think that's
the<00:03:20.140> temperature<00:03:20.440> gauge<00:03:21.239> now<00:03:22.239> that's<00:03:22.900> it

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
the temperature gauge now that's it

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:23.970 
the temperature gauge now that's it
right<00:03:23.200> down<00:03:23.320> there<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.739> that's<00:03:23.859> right

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
right down there so that's right

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.490 
right down there so that's right
underneath<00:03:24.160> your<00:03:24.370> intake<00:03:24.700> pretty<00:03:24.970> much<00:03:25.500> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
underneath your intake pretty much and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.210 
underneath your intake pretty much and
so<00:03:27.489> anyway<00:03:28.170> take<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> out<00:03:29.380> replace<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.130> you

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
so anyway take it out replace it and you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.040 
so anyway take it out replace it and you
just<00:03:30.250> change<00:03:30.700> three<00:03:31.030> quarts<00:03:31.359> of<00:03:31.450> fluid<00:03:32.040> rock
