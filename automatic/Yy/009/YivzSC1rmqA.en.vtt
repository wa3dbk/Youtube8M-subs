00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.750
 ah 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.010
 very good and welcome to a new video 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.830
 of bonsai but this time I wanted 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.360
 present the new bonsai 0 special or 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.730
 special or special the new vo60 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.080
 this time we are going to do it with a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.790
 pine pinus pinea pine but from 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.980
 I have this caliber because I have 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.000
 about 50 centimeters but 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.280
 it's well over 50 centimeters this 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.390
 It is very good because if someone wants 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.800
 run a little bit more wants to go a 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.280
 slightly more advanced has a trunk 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.829
 much more advanced 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 look 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 the trunk is already a trunk much more 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.820
 consolidated but it is at the point 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.979
 perfect because it's still flexible it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.179
 has reached this caliber yet of 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.969
 done when the tree arrives it fills it 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.679
 totally like that inside a box for 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.750
 occupy less space if you ask that it is very 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.549
 flexible does not have any problem sure 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 that some when done that does not 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.479
 you worry that no problem then 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 They have perfect caliber or very fat 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.600
 it can not last because the rest nor 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.130
 too fine if you want to run a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.440
 little bit more then this is the pine of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.479
 bonsai special zero was here at 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.959
 I caught it, I did not swear I did not have any 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.940
 ready to take it this without 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:26.280
 But this is bigger has the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.470
 buds there are many that already have buds 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.860
 there it looks, this one is here in the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.190
 little corner 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:38.290
 look at the lemons you have here 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.170
 the beige candles and if you see the candles are 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.250
 the super strong and super vigorous the good 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.380
 of these pines is that what we are going to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.120
 make me the pine 60 in the version 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.620
 normal is that we are going to do the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.420
 branch of the tree with these branches 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.890
 from here below and with this what we are going to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.810
 to do once is a very long mistake 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.690
 very large sacrifice to follow 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.250
 swelling the base of the tree and continue 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.780
 working with the branch then that 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.030
 we will sacrifice it and we will make a 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.030
 bonsai teeny bonsai be opined 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.470
 normal is very optimal to make a swing 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.910
 and here you use this one thing a 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.750
 little bit bigger we already have a caliber 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:15.280
 of thickness a little bigger eating 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.140
 more then this is the one with 60 pine 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.239
 I told you to present and then 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.510
 then we also have that now and not you 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.510
 move 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 thank you for your patience we have 60 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.769
 normal that are these pinus pinea 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.269
 precious little ones all are from one 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.760
 sap are starting to branch 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.840
 They are very strong and very vigorous with 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.409
 these pines is what we do 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.310
 bonsai but normal now the price is 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.599
 different is more cheap because it is no longer 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.939
 includes the carriage thus in that way 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:50.310
 we can combine the advice of the fish 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:54.450
 with 60 little ones and only to pay a 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.859
 carrying another so the price what 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.870
 you have put and up because I remember 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.709
 and it's in the price and the part of the carriage 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.450
 you can combine it with the guys you can 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.799
 put of ginkgo biloba let's do it 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.750
 we have here sonar zone 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.470
 look 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.990
 how are the solar 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.220
 How are we for nationals? 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.570
 ginkgo biloba are very little and 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.910
 We are installing to train 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.370
 doing someday the free with the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.740
 elms and seeing the same let's look 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.660
 Apple trees and ginkgo video to mimic and 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.910
 Seeing if we have any new things 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.330
 the with 60 on rock that was talked about yesterday 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.680
 It is also a project in mind but 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.770
 I have to look for all the elements like that 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.130
 that is not easy and to finish 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.110
 I'll show you how it goes my bonsáis the 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.940
 he opined so that no one since cheering that 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.459
 started with a bonsai being or pine trees like 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.340
 these little ones of a sap and is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.629
 now beautiful do not you go back 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.670
 look how is my bonsai 0 pine that 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.050
 started with one of a sap look at the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.209
 trunk gauge that has already has 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.220
 some brand of wire like that a little bit 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.500
 marked but they are super vigorous trees 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.110
 very young then these trees go to 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.610
 grow very fast and they are going to get 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.410
 precious right now we are working 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.790
 the lateral branches and you have to 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.110
 let the apex have long to 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.690
 do it as a branch of sacrifice 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.150
 cut it and make a lovely shojin 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.100
 this height with a fat trunk that's why 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.810
 to the runners that's why the colanders 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.669
 so are 60 pine trees that we started 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.590
 last year so if it did not start until 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.789
 last year starts this year already and not 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.370
 let you escape because they get 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.490
 precious and to finish and with this 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.080
 I leave you to remember the day water 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.520
 Magus we planted the 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.680
 January 6 we are today at 22 023 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.300
 we are today to January 23 and look 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.249
 talking about little things that start from 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.870
 zero look how he 's looking 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:49.660
 let's take the meat to garnett 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.310
 look at what nicer things are already 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.290
 coming out and that's what I told you in the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.120
 directive that this is false and this 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.650
 illusion that to us people the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.570
 when we see these things, they do come out 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.120
 from the beginning for that you ride 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:05.520
 but I think it implies the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.990
 bonsai spirit in him and that's why 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.510
 you can let it go 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:16.530
 I promise many more editions of wench and 0 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.530
 and and tomorrow we are going to do the transplant 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.069
 I live in 60 apple tree that is here 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:29.440
 my bonsai be apple tree that is here and 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:31.380
 I'm going to transplant 260 sonars for 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.320
 example 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.440
 I'm going to do this cascade and this mode 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.600
 comes on top of the Malvinas so 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.120
 tomorrow I will plant the ones also in 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.610
 your colanders to start the process 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.440
 step by step from him gonzález but 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.520
 we have also pending with 60 ginkgo 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.070
 biloba that mine still had not started 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.560
 rotary that either 60 elm and the 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.030
 I'm 60 ficus that nobody thinks this 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.530
 has been left out because of course what 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.640
 happens is that winter there is nothing 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.230
 make us loads 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.970
 Now is when the fun starts 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.680
 we go back to the videos of 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.140
 counselors we are going to do the transplant 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.670
 of more personnel in the stock market and nearby 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.670
 we return to resume the works
