00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hey everyone this is kevin from the math

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.760 
hey everyone this is kevin from the math
welcome<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.200> today<00:00:04.290> we're<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.710> be

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
welcome and today we're going to be

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.140 
welcome and today we're going to be
going<00:00:04.890> over<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.190> nice<00:00:05.370> little<00:00:05.609> multiplying

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
going over a nice little multiplying

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.780 
going over a nice little multiplying
trick<00:00:06.540> multiplying<00:00:07.379> numbers<00:00:07.589> where<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.309> tens

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
trick multiplying numbers where the tens

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.690 
trick multiplying numbers where the tens
digits<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.929> same<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.830> ones<00:00:11.160> digits

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
digits are the same and the ones digits

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.390 
digits are the same and the ones digits
add<00:00:11.940> up<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.630> ten<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.679> for<00:00:13.950> example

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
add up to ten so for example

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.440 
add up to ten so for example
twenty-three

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
twenty-three

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.240 
twenty-three
I<00:00:16.190> can<00:00:17.190> write<00:00:17.520> 23<00:00:18.270> times<00:00:18.539> 27<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.070> see

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I can write 23 times 27 as you can see

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.580 
I can write 23 times 27 as you can see
here<00:00:20.430> are<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> tens<00:00:20.910> digits<00:00:21.420> are<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> same

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
here are the tens digits are the same

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.580 
here are the tens digits are the same
they're<00:00:22.980> both<00:00:23.010> 2<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.539> ones<00:00:24.900> digits<00:00:25.410> add

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
they're both 2 and the ones digits add

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.970 
they're both 2 and the ones digits add
up<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:26.220> 10<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.789> 3<00:00:27.060> plus<00:00:27.330> 7<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.840> 10<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.800> is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
up to 10 so 3 plus 7 is 10 so this is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.109 
up to 10 so 3 plus 7 is 10 so this is
what<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.519> looking<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:29.939> today

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
what we're going to be looking at today

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
what we're going to be looking at today
and<00:00:30.359> we'll<00:00:30.449> look<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.810> various<00:00:31.619> examples<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and we'll look at various examples of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
and we'll look at various examples of
how<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.640> looks<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.540> anytime<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.440> this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
how it looks but anytime you see this

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.740 
how it looks but anytime you see this
all<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.940> multiply<00:00:36.660> 3<00:00:37.200> times<00:00:37.230> 7

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
all you have to do is multiply 3 times 7

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.590 
all you have to do is multiply 3 times 7
21<00:00:39.860> you're<00:00:40.860> gonna<00:00:40.980> take<00:00:41.340> two<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.450> you're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
21 you're gonna take two and you're

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.819 
21 you're gonna take two and you're
going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.750> multiply<00:00:42.899> by<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.350> next<00:00:43.710> highest

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
going to multiply by the next highest

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.619 
going to multiply by the next highest
number<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.399> 1<00:00:44.730> 2<00:00:45.059> 3<00:00:45.090> 2<00:00:45.809> times<00:00:46.079> 3<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.649> 6<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.629> here's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
number so 1 2 3 2 times 3 is 6 so here's

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.270 
number so 1 2 3 2 times 3 is 6 so here's
your<00:00:48.840> answer<00:00:49.640> 621<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> take<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:53.129> at

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
your answer 621 so take a look at

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.580 
your answer 621 so take a look at
another<00:00:53.579> example<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.170> let's<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.320> 82<00:00:56.420> times

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
another example here let's do 82 times

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.560 
another example here let's do 82 times
88<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.699> here<00:00:59.940> again<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> tens

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
88 so you can see here again the tens

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290 
88 so you can see here again the tens
digits<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> same<00:01:01.289> they're<00:01:01.649> both<00:01:01.680> 8<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.300> 2

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
digits are the same they're both 8 and 2

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.429 
digits are the same they're both 8 and 2
plus<00:01:03.719> 8<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.260> equal<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.970> 10<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.450> first<00:01:07.350> thing

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
plus 8 is equal to 10 so first thing

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
plus 8 is equal to 10 so first thing
we're<00:01:07.560> gonna<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.830> 2<00:01:08.280> times<00:01:08.580> 8<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.880> 16<00:01:09.240> we

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we're gonna do is 2 times 8 is 16 we

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.039 
we're gonna do is 2 times 8 is 16 we
just<00:01:09.900> write<00:01:10.140> down<00:01:10.170> 16<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> 8<00:01:12.210> times<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> next

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
just write down 16 and 8 times the next

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
just write down 16 and 8 times the next
highest<00:01:13.200> number<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> 9<00:01:14.159> 8<00:01:14.490> times<00:01:14.760> 9<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
highest number which is 9 8 times 9 is

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.539 
highest number which is 9 8 times 9 is
72<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> number<00:01:18.119> seven<00:01:18.720> thousand

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
72 and that is the number seven thousand

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.670 
72 and that is the number seven thousand
216<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.390> also<00:01:21.600> works<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.259> you're<00:01:22.470> doing

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
216 now this also works if you're doing

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.530 
216 now this also works if you're doing
a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.130> higher<00:01:23.340> numbers<00:01:23.900> let's<00:01:24.900> say<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
a little higher numbers let's say we do

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.580 
a little higher numbers let's say we do
112<00:01:27.540> times

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.429 

118<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:33.320> 1111<00:01:34.320> they're

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
118 as you can see here 1111 they're

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.069 
118 as you can see here 1111 they're
both<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.369> 2<00:01:35.670> plus<00:01:36.060> 8<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.540> still<00:01:36.659> 10

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
both the same and 2 plus 8 is still 10

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.890 
both the same and 2 plus 8 is still 10
so<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:37.979> case<00:01:38.220> it'll<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.850> work<00:01:38.880> 2<00:01:39.600> times

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so in this case it'll still work 2 times

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.300 
so in this case it'll still work 2 times
8<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.170> 16<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.460> 11<00:01:42.210> times<00:01:42.810> 12<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:44.360> 132<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:47.159> our

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
8 is 16 and 11 times 12 is 132 so our

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.249 
8 is 16 and 11 times 12 is 132 so our
answer<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.869> 13,000<00:01:49.340> 216<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:52.079> you've

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
answer is 13,000 216 and if you've

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.340 
answer is 13,000 216 and if you've
watched<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.670> other<00:01:53.759> video<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.390> how<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.689> square

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
watched the other video on how to square

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
watched the other video on how to square
numbers<00:01:55.649> ending<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:55.979> 5<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.119> look<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
numbers ending in 5 it's gonna look the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.660 
numbers ending in 5 it's gonna look the
exact<00:01:57.869> same<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.810> will<00:02:00.810> show<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.079> why

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
exact same and this will show you why

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.999 
exact same and this will show you why
normally<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:02.909> write<00:02:03.450> down<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> 25<00:02:04.380> but

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
normally you just write down a 25 but

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.100 
normally you just write down a 25 but
it's<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> same<00:02:05.850> thing<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it's going to be the same thing as you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.869 
it's going to be the same thing as you
can<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.710> both<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.950> fours<00:02:08.399> are<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> same

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
can see here both the fours are the same

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.330 
can see here both the fours are the same
and<00:02:09.149> 5<00:02:09.390> plus<00:02:09.690> 5

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
and 5 plus 5

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.790 
and 5 plus 5
ten<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.270> we<00:02:11.300> can<00:02:11.540> just<00:02:11.810> do<00:02:11.959> five<00:02:12.260> times<00:02:12.560> five

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
ten so we can just do five times five

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.059 
ten so we can just do five times five
equals<00:02:12.860> 25<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.410> four<00:02:15.410> times<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.920> next

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
equals 25 and four times the next

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.860 
equals 25 and four times the next
highest<00:02:16.280> number<00:02:16.400> which<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.910> five<00:02:17.150> four<00:02:17.540> times

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
highest number which is five four times

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.150 
highest number which is five four times
five<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.170> twenty<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:21.530> 45<00:02:22.100> times<00:02:22.430> 45<00:02:23.000> equals

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
five is twenty so 45 times 45 equals

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.340 
five is twenty so 45 times 45 equals
2025<00:02:25.160> we'll<00:02:25.370> do<00:02:25.490> one<00:02:25.760> more<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.959> want<00:02:27.319> to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
2025 we'll do one more just so I want to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.710 
2025 we'll do one more just so I want to
understand<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:27.980> we'll<00:02:28.160> do<00:02:29.170> thirteen<00:02:30.170> times

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
understand so we'll do thirteen times

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.320 
understand so we'll do thirteen times
seventeen<00:02:33.250> again<00:02:34.250> once<00:02:34.640> again<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.030> start<00:02:35.239> this

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
seventeen again once again to start this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.120 
seventeen again once again to start this
excuse<00:02:35.870> me<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.140> tens<00:02:36.380> digit<00:02:36.470> are<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.920> same

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
excuse me the tens digit are the same

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.630 
excuse me the tens digit are the same
and<00:02:37.580> three<00:02:38.330> plus<00:02:38.510> 7<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.959> 10<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.400> do<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
and three plus 7 is 10 so we can do the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.290 
and three plus 7 is 10 so we can do the
trick<00:02:40.910> 3<00:02:41.540> times<00:02:41.750> 7<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.110> 21<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.980> 1<00:02:43.940> times<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
trick 3 times 7 is 21 and 1 times the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.290 
trick 3 times 7 is 21 and 1 times the
next<00:02:44.450> house<00:02:44.630> number<00:02:44.959> which<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.410> 2<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:46.070> 2<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:46.640> 13

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
next house number which is 2 is 2 so 13

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.220 
next house number which is 2 is 2 so 13
times<00:02:47.330> 17<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.940> 221<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.300> fairly<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.780> trick<00:02:50.989> so

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
times 17 is 221 so fairly is a trick so

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.960 
times 17 is 221 so fairly is a trick so
a<00:02:51.440> lot<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:51.920> people<00:02:52.160> have<00:02:52.340> their<00:02:52.459> own<00:02:52.580> methods

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
a lot of people have their own methods

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.759 
a lot of people have their own methods
when<00:02:53.120> they<00:02:53.239> multiply<00:02:53.600> two<00:02:53.660> two-digit<00:02:54.290> numbers

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
when they multiply two two-digit numbers

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.030 
when they multiply two two-digit numbers
but<00:02:55.730> just<00:02:56.000> always<00:02:56.540> look<00:02:56.750> at<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.440> teams<00:02:57.709> are

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
but just always look at if the teams are

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.670 
but just always look at if the teams are
the<00:02:58.340> same<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.540> ones<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.110> up<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.380> ten

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
the same and the ones that up to ten

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.610
