how<00:00:23.700> that<00:00:23.970> looks<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.870> smells<00:00:25.110> good<00:00:25.289> these<00:00:25.980> cups

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
how that looks it smells good these cups

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.010 
how that looks it smells good these cups
are<00:00:27.230> 200<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:29.250> decimal<00:00:29.670> good<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:30.000> are<00:00:30.150> 210

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
are 200 the decimal good they are 210

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.500 
are 200 the decimal good they are 210
calories<00:00:31.380> per<00:00:31.949> cup<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:33.149> lower

for 329 I do not think it's worth the
price<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.630> do<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:14.320> that's<00:02:14.470> way<00:02:14.680> too<00:02:14.740> much<00:02:15.100> so
