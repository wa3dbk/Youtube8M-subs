00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello today I show you like one 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.670
 Call a ripped t-shirt from the inside 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.030
 It could be torn at the bottom 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.340
 I need a big hole here 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.119
 just a white thread a relative 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 small needle and such a blade to 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.560
 slit the remaining nice ones first 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.900
 Let's take a look where the hole is torn 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 We see that it is very far away and so on 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.250
 Nobody wants to run around like that now 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 Let's take a look at where the hole is torn 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.899
 it's right there in the armpit 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.410
 and that you first time the white thread 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.840
 take a long finish out and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.530
 Put this in the needle's eye 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.920
 invite 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.809
 Now that I have finally made it 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.390
 that thread in this impossibly small 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.250
 hole from this needle to take care of that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.010
 once to half through whom i want 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.299
 in a double found that is firmer 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:10.100
 So I have it two linen and her 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.100
 is through until I'm at the end 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.070
 I do not think I'm that long 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.480
 thread 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.730
 so if i have been around for so long 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.800
 as I need to cut off and only 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.610
 make a knot with it me 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.440
 do not go through the entire 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.690
 drove through the hole we go then 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.990
 have naturally disturb such a knot in 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.360
 Kloten Now I start to the hole 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.010
 call 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.860
 I see where is torn is we take 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.399
 The idea is to hold it together 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.580
 very important, I fold the hole 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.360
 outside inwards that I edge again 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.330
 At the edge has now a needle 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.040
 outside the hole and go through 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.320
 pulls the thread through to where I am 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.060
 had this knot laid now go 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:21.180
 I'm very short of the hole 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.090
 next to it always remember it 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.299
 to keep the hole straight 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.220
 so nothing goes wrong 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.590
 best I put the rest of you 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 cord next so I followed the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.850
 next over the thread 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.030
 I can call it the same 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.030
 closer 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:58.480
 so I am now continue until 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.610
 the hole is almost sewn as you can see 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.740
 I now have almost everything from a hole 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.170
 should be nurtured especially now 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.780
 be careful so that the pressure on the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.480
 thread not too high because clearly 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.220
 I forgave the thread in t shirt and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.000
 Destroy mine because that would t 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.980
 shirt after folding while folding 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.060
 because the pressure in the t shirt all of the 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.010
 pressure on the thread of t shirts would be too high 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.239
 so that i am now licking my name 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:36.370
 completely emptied the last two 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:40.840
 networks so now I have the last stitch 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.640
 made the last stab at the hole 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.200
 old stich I never normal 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.870
 afterwards here in the normal me too 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.350
 make sure that the thread is not 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:58.209
 right on the hole because I mean so 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.709
 now you can see that I supposed that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.780
 I had approached the hole exactly 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.130
 from here it was still torn so well 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.860
 that the city ​​was torn 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:11.140
 Continue on via nato and here 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.269
 I want the hole ended I had 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.670
 no tensions in the t-shirt I recognize 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.600
 because I'm not particularly drawn 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.820
 areas from so now so that the thread also 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.440
 remains the same that I can cut short 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.930
 and may leave immediately 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.729
 I strung him an easy vettel 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.410
 a few times through the surface of the holes 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.690
 holes through the top of the t 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.970
 shirts just where possible after that 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.800
 so that you can use it the rest of the thread 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.450
 does not recognize the monarch t shirt 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.020
 then unfold it so now 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.020
 win through 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.750
 Now I'm just a knot am 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.750
 end of the t-shirt 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.540
 now that I have made my knot 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.800
 exactly at the beginning of the thread 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:08.070
 I now separate this through the t 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.850
 shirt is sewn see the shake up 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:17.040
 we know that the seam is clean and none 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.700
 mistake has the remaining verden 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.640
 from it can be easily removed 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:31.110
 and scissors the protruding ones 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:33.510
 We are horses from the previous one 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.280
 a clean start et of t shirts without 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.780
 complete holes i hope that i will give you 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.320

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.480
 Video 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.940

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.080
