down here and fire on confetti bombs

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.640 
down here and fire on confetti bombs
which<00:05:23.729> which<00:05:24.729> would<00:05:24.969> be<00:05:25.120> useful<00:05:25.530> we<00:05:26.530> have

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
which which would be useful we have

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.040 
which which would be useful we have
plenty<00:05:26.889> more<00:05:27.190> on<00:05:27.430> dead<00:05:27.729> rising<00:05:27.909> 3<00:05:28.180> I've<00:05:28.690> got<00:05:28.900> a

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
plenty more on dead rising 3 I've got a

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.529 
plenty more on dead rising 3 I've got a
bunch<00:05:29.650> of<00:05:29.919> gameplay<00:05:30.430> from<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.789> with<00:05:31.240> combo

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
bunch of gameplay from it with combo

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.330 
bunch of gameplay from it with combo
weapons<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.080> such<00:05:32.379> but<00:05:33.009> I<00:05:33.039> thought<00:05:33.219> we'd

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
weapons and such but I thought we'd

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.950 
weapons and such but I thought we'd
start<00:05:33.580> off<00:05:33.729> with<00:05:33.969> possibly<00:05:34.659> the<00:05:34.840> most

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
start off with possibly the most

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.469 
start off with possibly the most
ridiculous<00:05:36.780> combo<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.259> game<00:05:38.469> which<00:05:39.190> would

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
ridiculous combo of the game which would

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:57.310 
ridiculous combo of the game which would
involve<00:05:40.479> a<00:05:40.780> street<00:05:41.650> sweeper<00:05:42.190> cleaner<00:05:42.569> typing
