00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.730
 here it must have set itself the task in the meantime a Kern team says this 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:14.739
 together 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.470
 at the RPC will now take the opportunity that each of the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.979
 introduces nine authors and on which products such as the work Hello 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.779
 with if Marie Thornton headmaster the publishing house 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 in and it is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
 and the VESA area with its core themes is one who important part 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.480
 the federal government is publisher 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.760
 Last year we decided to set up a core team 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.160
 high quality products 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 regularly 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.550
 to bring out al 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.060
 and around 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.150
 These core topics include half five people 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.960
 one is not there Chris costs depends on the first week of May confidant 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.900
 Olmerts editor 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.370
 but the others are sitting here and the micro mar continues 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.490
 to the ones who can say something about themselves and to the products where 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.600
 they are working on it right now because listeners and SWR 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.640
 most interesting 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.170
 Ehrmann am Suter I'm sort of chick percent 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.890
 the core editorial office around Vienna 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 Percent of the youngest and also the shortest division since 2005 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.920
 Percent of first cases projection that is 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 and ought to be away from their two big projects that is not akan on the one hand 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.900
 8th 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.160
 the MAGE against him plays so half of it tastes tourist academies 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.920
 to introduce in detail to over 8 to 10 pages 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.450
 including floor plans details on height the residents of the academy and process 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.190
 according to the proposals and so on 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.330
 and the second major project is percent the dark times in the pier in the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.850
 That it is a box 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.200
 the one yes the dark times as it wants to do by SÃ¤ckingen Spider and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.370
 This, of course, for the Isarauen and evil Wasen enters new territory 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.410
 and both products are roughly targeted for the summer 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.180
 Take Torsholt as an example 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180
 and unlike and left already 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.049
 a few years old 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.329
 writing since 88 and 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.529
 but since the death of Mullaittivu as editor-in-chief 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.549
 just in its function 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.549
 since concert 97 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.980
 and now my job in the core team 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.049
 is actually the coordination 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.989
 any specially larger titles 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:40.279
 actual publishing work takes over the puppets 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:44.459
 Euro that makes the type of reading percent of capital 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.479
 and I'll take care of it 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.479
 and that the lyrics 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.009
 to fit high school graduation background 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.369
 Daseep the rules are respected 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.699
 or percent 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.079
 In certain situations, I allow five to be straight 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.999
 I do not have my own big project at the moment 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.699
 Than involved in the planning for Couturier 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.709
 the next continent we will stand for the black smoke 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.979
 but it will not appear until next year if 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.189
 that certainly 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.119
 here on the RPC 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.249
 Euro next year 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.089
 very concrete what can say about it 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.089
 if we already have it with Gaal 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.809
 and that's a bigger Sun 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.099
 very interesting project because it actually turn 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.209
 for most but in Turin players enter new territory 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.109
 I am the judge 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.689
 the idea has also been around since the appearing and the ominous black 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.479
 Box that appeared in a public library 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.479
 Schreiber also a bit longer for first was that the two 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.139
 Games for the very old of 93 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.819
 and percent occupy me in space are now two major projects 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.150
 Also, this is for one adventure bands and in the emperor Omen is where you go 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:16.329
 to deal with her the Jane Hall of Garrett and a marten 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.199
 Dieter Meier seems 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.039
 and the second altitude greater or Brussels the regional 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.210
 Game Help 13 the north to the north the title in the spell of the North nothing 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.520
 wearing 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.980
 the all information gathers about the year the high north of Turin 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.840
 eternal ice and all the folks there places there and even the water 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.990
 have a story open up there 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.530
 and percent of the band will appear normal in early fall or Napster 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.060
 which Dais abrupt City Nights will be planned and then just next time 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.009
 that appear 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.010
 the reaped the next episode seems to call me the most important 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.310
 is the long-awaited enough it was a regional train 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.139
 then it will be 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.129
 in the direction of Rod Thorn 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.589
 the dark times 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:07.229
 appear 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.529
 Karben is planned yet another kind of regional one at the 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.309
 Regional election continues on the high north 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:16.529
 that's the direction of food 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.619
 before that there will be a band about the magician academies that are now 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:21.939
 the tick 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.629
 speak defend titles as we do in small quantities 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.639
 There are of course still adventure volumes 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.400
 and anthologies of judges 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.940
 yes then maybe so far and much success with this
