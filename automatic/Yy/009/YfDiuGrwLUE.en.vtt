this<00:03:30.290> very<00:03:31.220> first<00:03:31.430> note<00:03:31.670> what's<00:03:32.270> happening<00:03:32.690> is

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
this very first note what's happening is

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.840 
this very first note what's happening is
when<00:03:33.470> your<00:03:33.590> amplifiers<00:03:34.070> are<00:03:34.220> up<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:34.610> loud<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
when your amplifiers are up so loud and

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.180 
when your amplifiers are up so loud and
they're<00:03:35.090> right<00:03:35.240> next<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.890> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
they're right next to you the the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.460 
they're right next to you the the
magnets<00:03:37.580> put<00:03:37.790> off<00:03:37.910> an<00:03:38.540> electrical<00:03:38.750> field<00:03:39.200> that

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
magnets put off an electrical field that

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.780 
magnets put off an electrical field that
interacts<00:03:39.860> with<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.040> electrical<00:03:40.460> field<00:03:40.670> of

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
interacts with the electrical field of

interacts with the electrical field of
the<00:03:40.850> pickup<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.330> causes<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.780> sustain

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
the pickup and it causes it to sustain

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.850 
the pickup and it causes it to sustain
feedback<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:43.160> coupled<00:03:43.550> with<00:03:43.580> distortion<00:03:44.860> my

I'll been able to get that sort of

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.380 
I'll been able to get that sort of
sustained<00:03:49.400> when<00:03:49.670> you're<00:03:49.850> standing<00:03:50.030> next<00:03:50.240> to
