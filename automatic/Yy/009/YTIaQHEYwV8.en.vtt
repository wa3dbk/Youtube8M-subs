00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880 

I've<00:00:00.240> seen<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.630> adult<00:00:00.960> active<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:01.740> this

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
I've seen the adult active on this

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.940 
I've seen the adult active on this
mountain<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.370> long<00:00:02.550> time<00:00:02.870> okay<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.500> it<00:00:04.799> a

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
mountain in a long time okay is it a

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.610 
mountain in a long time okay is it a
factor<00:00:05.460> yes<00:00:05.730> but<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.629> it<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.779> factor<00:00:07.140> low<00:00:07.319> down

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
factor yes but is it a factor low down

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.169 
factor yes but is it a factor low down
where<00:00:07.919> it's<00:00:08.040> all<00:00:08.189> red<00:00:08.370> spruces<00:00:08.820> were<00:00:08.940> talking

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
where it's all red spruces were talking

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.209 
where it's all red spruces were talking
about<00:00:09.269> before<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.780> answer<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.139> 0<00:00:10.380> by

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
about before the answer is 0 by

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.330 
about before the answer is 0 by
definition<00:00:11.269> okay<00:00:12.590> so<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.650> know<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.190> you're

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
definition okay so you know what you're

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.890 
definition okay so you know what you're
looking<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:14.820> very<00:00:14.849> important<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.480> point

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
looking at it's very important to point

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.010 
looking at it's very important to point
this<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.580> what<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> seeing<00:00:18.060> here<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.660> an

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
this out what you seeing here is an

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.759 
this out what you seeing here is an
ecosystem<00:00:19.830> already<00:00:20.400> living<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> edge

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
ecosystem already living on the edge

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.349 
ecosystem already living on the edge
therefore<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.189> domino's<00:00:23.670> effect<00:00:24.029> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
therefore it is a domino's effect that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.960 
therefore it is a domino's effect that
we're<00:00:24.480> observing<00:00:24.779> okay<00:00:25.380> any<00:00:26.310> time<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
we're observing okay any time there's a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.560 
we're observing okay any time there's a
really<00:00:27.240> cold<00:00:27.630> winter<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> hot<00:00:28.410> summer<00:00:28.859> drought

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
really cold winter a hot summer drought

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.630 
really cold winter a hot summer drought
whatever<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.170> magnified<00:00:31.830> instead<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
whatever it is it's magnified instead of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.569 
whatever it is it's magnified instead of
having<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.090> impact<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.620> has<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> lot<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
having a little impact it has a lot of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.590 
having a little impact it has a lot of
impact<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.960> ecosystem<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.100> weak

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
impact because the ecosystem is so weak

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.840 
impact because the ecosystem is so weak
so<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.930> simply<00:00:40.260> say<00:00:40.440> oh<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.219> tree<00:00:41.610> died

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
so you know simply say oh that tree died

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
so you know simply say oh that tree died
this<00:00:42.090> year<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.840> high<00:00:42.989> ozone<00:00:43.260> is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
this year because of high ozone is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340 
this year because of high ozone is
ridiculous<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.390> no<00:00:45.510> longer<00:00:45.809> say<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
ridiculous you can no longer say that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.069 
ridiculous you can no longer say that
the<00:00:47.039> air<00:00:47.250> pollution<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> major

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the air pollution is one of the major

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.189 
the air pollution is one of the major
triggering<00:00:50.010> factors<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> decline<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
triggering factors to the decline of the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319 
triggering factors to the decline of the
ecosystem<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.100> believe<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.670> wasn't<00:00:54.059> for

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
ecosystem we believe that it wasn't for

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
ecosystem we believe that it wasn't for
the<00:00:55.199> air<00:00:55.379> pollution<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.100> would<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.399> see

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the air pollution that you would not see

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.150 
the air pollution that you would not see
anywhere<00:00:56.969> near<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.170> amount<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.739> damage<00:00:59.070> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
anywhere near the amount of damage I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680 
anywhere near the amount of damage I
mean<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> fraction<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.149> we<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.510> are

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
mean not a fraction that we that we are

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.840 
mean not a fraction that we that we are
living<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.050> today<00:01:01.850> out<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.850> overstory

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
living with today out on the overstory

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
living with today out on the overstory
now<00:01:06.090> let<00:01:06.210> me<00:01:06.270> comment<00:01:06.600> about<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> understory

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
now let me comment about the understory

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850 
now let me comment about the understory
right<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.720> basically<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.439> 99

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
right here basically as you can see 99

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.609 
right here basically as you can see 99
percent<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> overstory<00:01:12.119> has<00:01:12.390> died<00:01:12.619> they

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
percent of the overstory has died they

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.020 
percent of the overstory has died they
are<00:01:13.799> dead<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> reason<00:01:14.520> why<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:14.880> see

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
are dead the reason why you don't see

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.109 
are dead the reason why you don't see
far<00:01:15.360> more<00:01:15.390> stems<00:01:16.340> than<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.000> they

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
far more stems than you do here they

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.390 
far more stems than you do here they
used<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.630> least<00:01:18.900> 2,000<00:01:19.740> stems<00:01:19.979> per<00:01:20.189> acre

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
used to be at least 2,000 stems per acre

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910 
used to be at least 2,000 stems per acre
is<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.450> reason<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.930> died<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.590> falling

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
is the reason that they died and falling

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
is the reason that they died and falling
down<00:01:23.100> okay<00:01:24.060> most<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.540> actually

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
down okay most of them are actually

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.539 
down okay most of them are actually
rotted<00:01:25.229> into<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> ground<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.369> see

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
rotted into the ground like you can see

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.390 
rotted into the ground like you can see
here<00:01:26.880> HAP<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.960> taught<00:01:28.259> standard<00:01:28.950> stems<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
here HAP is taught standard stems that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.880 
here HAP is taught standard stems that
you<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> ones<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.439> recent

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you see are the ones of more recent

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.120 
you see are the ones of more recent
vintage<00:01:32.900> underlying<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:34.229> standing<00:01:34.770> stems

vintage underlying those standing stems

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420 
vintage underlying those standing stems
you<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.759> other<00:01:35.939> trees<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:37.650> still<00:01:38.100> green

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you see other trees that are still green

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.510 
you see other trees that are still green
sort<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> uniform<00:01:39.329> cohort<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.320> called<00:01:40.619> of

that<00:02:20.800> yellow<00:02:21.480> next<00:02:22.480> year<00:02:22.690> you'll<00:02:22.870> come<00:02:23.110> back

that yellow next year you'll come back

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
tips all over it the year after that it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.699 
tips all over it the year after that it
will<00:02:27.790> be<00:02:27.940> all<00:02:28.150> brown<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:29.140> year<00:02:29.349> after<00:02:29.380> that

will be all brown the year after that

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.259 
will be all brown the year after that
it'll<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.220> one<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.430> those<00:02:30.519> trees<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.090> saw

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
it'll be one of those trees that we saw

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.380 
it'll be one of those trees that we saw
with<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.720> feathery<00:02:32.310> branches<00:02:33.390> hanging

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
with just the feathery branches hanging

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.350 
with just the feathery branches hanging
onto<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.959> tree<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.410> rest<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:35.980> dead

so<00:02:37.360> what<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.930> see<00:02:38.110> here<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.410> known<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.739> a

reproductive trees they're dead so what

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.280 
reproductive trees they're dead so what
you're<00:03:47.739> seeing<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.220> point<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:48.670> time<00:03:49.290> I've

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
you're seeing is a point in time I've

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.470 
you're seeing is a point in time I've
been<00:03:50.350> up<00:03:50.650> here<00:03:50.950> every<00:03:51.190> year<00:03:51.400> for<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:51.910> past<00:03:52.000> 23

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
been up here every year for the past 23

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.650 
been up here every year for the past 23
years<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.260> have<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.709> real<00:03:54.310> knowledge<00:03:54.700> or

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
years and I have a real knowledge or

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.240 
years and I have a real knowledge or
real<00:03:55.840> feel<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.590> know<00:03:56.680> what<00:03:56.799> I'm<00:03:56.859> saying<00:03:57.130> is

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
real feel if you know what I'm saying is

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.789 
real feel if you know what I'm saying is
so<00:03:57.370> what<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.910> going<00:03:58.150> on<00:03:58.269> up<00:03:58.480> here<00:03:58.799> sometimes

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
so what is going on up here sometimes

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:00.930 
so what is going on up here sometimes
it's<00:03:59.950> very<00:03:59.980> difficult<00:04:00.160> for<00:04:00.609> people<00:04:00.910> to

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
it's very difficult for people to

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.629 
it's very difficult for people to
understand<00:04:01.480> seeing<00:04:01.780> just<00:04:02.049> once<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:03.489> know
