I<00:00:30.530> can<00:00:30.680> type<00:00:30.830> an<00:00:30.920> IP<00:00:31.100> address<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.730> then<00:00:32.239> of

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
I can type an IP address and then of

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.729 
I can type an IP address and then of
course<00:00:32.509> it<00:00:32.629> gives<00:00:32.689> me<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.870> list<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.260> sequences

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
course it gives me a list of sequences

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.080 
course it gives me a list of sequences
right<00:00:33.770> now<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.190> I<00:00:34.219> have<00:00:34.370> three<00:00:34.670> programmed

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
right now and I have three programmed

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.520 
right now and I have three programmed
but<00:00:35.329> there's<00:00:35.629> going<00:00:35.749> to<00:00:35.809> be<00:00:35.870> more<00:00:36.050> coming<00:00:36.289> soon

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
but there's going to be more coming soon

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.430 
but there's going to be more coming soon
so<00:00:37.249> I'm<00:00:38.030> just<00:00:38.149> going<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.329> go<00:00:38.420> right<00:00:38.539> in<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.989> run

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
so I'm just going to go right in and run

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.979 
so I'm just going to go right in and run
this<00:00:39.589> ring<00:00:39.980> sequence<00:00:40.690> basically<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:41.839> just

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
this ring sequence basically that just

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.079 
this ring sequence basically that just
makes<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.230> bar<00:00:42.440> of<00:00:42.589> light<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:43.070> goes<00:00:43.280> from<00:00:43.940> my

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
makes a bar of light that goes from my

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.489 
makes a bar of light that goes from my
feet<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.510> my<00:00:44.539> neck<00:00:44.839> and<00:00:46.899> with<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.019> parameters

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
feet to my neck and with the parameters

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.139 
feet to my neck and with the parameters
on<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.710> screen<00:00:49.069> here<00:00:49.339> once<00:00:49.640> I<00:00:49.730> got<00:00:49.909> into<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
on the screen here once I got into the

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.689 
on the screen here once I got into the
ring<00:00:50.390> sequence<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.170> adjust<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.620> speed<00:00:51.739> the

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
ring sequence I can adjust the speed the

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.579 
ring sequence I can adjust the speed the
thickness<00:00:53.179> of<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.629> ring<00:00:53.839> so<00:00:54.079> I<00:00:54.109> can<00:00:54.140> slow<00:00:54.469> it

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
thickness of the ring so I can slow it

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:54.790 
thickness of the ring so I can slow it
down

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
down

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.360 
down
I<00:00:55.159> can<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.539> can<00:00:56.780> make<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.050> ring<00:00:57.350> really<00:00:58.100> thick

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
I can I can make the ring really thick

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.790 
I can I can make the ring really thick
you<00:00:58.780> know<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.809> can<00:00:59.989> make<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.109> a<00:01:00.199> bunch<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.499> pixels

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
you know I can make it a bunch of pixels

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.119 
you know I can make it a bunch of pixels
I<00:01:01.210> can<00:01:02.210> change<00:01:02.389> the<00:01:02.659> step<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.139> it<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.499> it<00:01:03.649> can<00:01:03.800> go

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
I can change the step of it so it can go

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.700 
I can change the step of it so it can go
really<00:01:04.280> fast<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:05.030> can<00:01:05.960> make<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.260> move<00:01:06.440> in<00:01:06.650> a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
really fast I can make it move in a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.249 
really fast I can make it move in a
different<00:01:06.979> direction<00:01:07.100> if<00:01:07.549> I<00:01:07.670> want<00:01:08.049> so<00:01:09.049> I<00:01:09.110> can

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
different direction if I want so I can

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.819 
different direction if I want so I can
make<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.469> move<00:01:09.619> down<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:11.320> can<00:01:12.320> change<00:01:12.469> the<00:01:12.619> color

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
make it move down I can change the color

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.639 
make it move down I can change the color
of<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.630> can<00:01:14.630> choose<00:01:14.810> any<00:01:14.990> color<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.229> want

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
of it can choose any color I want

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.270 
of it can choose any color I want
these<00:01:16.369> are<00:01:16.490> RGB<00:01:16.880> LEDs<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:18.079> can<00:01:18.860> also<00:01:18.979> bounce

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
these are RGB LEDs I can also bounce

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.749 
these are RGB LEDs I can also bounce
from<00:01:19.640> top<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:19.850> bottom<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.430> if<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.549> pick<00:01:22.700> a

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
from top to bottom so if I pick a

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.679 
from top to bottom so if I pick a
balance<00:01:23.119> here<00:01:23.180> goes<00:01:23.869> back<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.409> forth<00:01:24.469> and

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
balance here goes back and forth and

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.149 
balance here goes back and forth and
then<00:01:26.689> lastly<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.200> have<00:01:27.289> an<00:01:27.409> accelerometer<00:01:27.860> in

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
then lastly I have an accelerometer in

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.300 
then lastly I have an accelerometer in
the<00:01:28.700> sleeve<00:01:29.119> here<00:01:29.420> where<00:01:30.380> if<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.680> raise<00:01:30.950> my

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
the sleeve here where if I raise my

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.270 
the sleeve here where if I raise my
right<00:01:31.700> arm<00:01:32.560> it'll<00:01:33.560> enable<00:01:33.740> this<00:01:34.070> option

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
right arm it'll enable this option

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.230 
right arm it'll enable this option
called<00:01:34.729> sleeves<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:36.880> sorry<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:37.939> can't<00:01:38.090> see

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
called sleeves and sorry you can't see

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.120 
called sleeves and sorry you can't see
that<00:01:38.409> sleeves<00:01:39.409> down<00:01:39.680> here<00:01:39.890> at<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.009> bottom

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
that sleeves down here at the bottom

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.730 
that sleeves down here at the bottom
that<00:01:40.789> will<00:01:40.939> turn<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.539> what<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.350> does<00:01:42.560> is

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
that will turn on and what that does is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.499 
that will turn on and what that does is
when<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.039> raise<00:01:43.250> my<00:01:43.280> arms<00:01:43.670> it'll<00:01:43.909> go<00:01:44.119> all<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
when I raise my arms it'll go all the

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.819 
when I raise my arms it'll go all the
way<00:01:44.539> to<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.810> sleeves<00:01:45.079> with<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.649> Rings<00:01:45.859> so

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
way to the sleeves with the Rings so

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.919 
way to the sleeves with the Rings so
that's<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.159> ring<00:01:49.640> sequence<00:01:50.210> here's<00:01:50.810> another

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
that's the ring sequence here's another

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.599 
that's the ring sequence here's another
sequence<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.619> called<00:01:51.829> splotches<00:01:52.340> for

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
sequence that I called splotches for

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.880 
sequence that I called splotches for
lack<00:01:52.729> of<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.909> better<00:01:53.030> term<00:01:53.619> basically<00:01:54.619> that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
lack of a better term basically that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.669 
lack of a better term basically that
just<00:01:55.039> creates<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.670> pattern<00:01:55.969> of<00:01:56.299> random<00:01:57.200> LEDs

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
just creates a pattern of random LEDs

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.149 
just creates a pattern of random LEDs
that<00:01:58.490> show<00:01:58.670> up<00:01:59.049> this<00:02:00.049> time<00:02:00.109> it's<00:02:00.469> I've<00:02:00.890> picked

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
that show up this time it's I've picked

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.590 
that show up this time it's I've picked
green<00:02:01.460> as<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.850> color<00:02:01.999> but<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.359> pick<00:02:02.509> any

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
green as the color but I can pick any

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.950 
green as the color but I can pick any
color<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.929> want<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:04.060> can<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.509> know<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.869> like

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
color I want I can you know just like

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.109 
color I want I can you know just like
with<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.259> other<00:02:06.369> sequences<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.490> can<00:02:07.640> speed<00:02:07.999> it

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
with the other sequences I can speed it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.840 
with the other sequences I can speed it
up<00:02:08.240> slow<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.479> down<00:02:08.600> change<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.320> color<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:10.399> can

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
up slow it down change the color I can

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.970 
up slow it down change the color I can
select<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.210> amount<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.080> if<00:02:12.409> I<00:02:12.500> want<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.739> lot<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
select the amount so if I want a lot of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.250 
select the amount so if I want a lot of
pixels<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.970> show<00:02:14.150> up<00:02:14.269> at<00:02:14.420> once<00:02:14.659> I<00:02:14.870> can<00:02:15.019> do<00:02:15.080> that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
pixels to show up at once I can do that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.420 
pixels to show up at once I can do that
I<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:16.370> also<00:02:16.489> add<00:02:16.700> flat

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
I can also add flat

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.199 
I can also add flat
sh'zazz<00:02:17.760> added<00:02:18.390> effect<00:02:18.689> to<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:20.209> that's

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
sh'zazz added effect to it so that's

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.619 
sh'zazz added effect to it so that's
kind<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.450> cool<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.640> other<00:02:24.090> sequence<00:02:24.390> that

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
kind of cool and the other sequence that

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.089 
kind of cool and the other sequence that
I<00:02:24.689> don't<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.109> have<00:02:25.290> programmed<00:02:25.709> yet<00:02:25.859> on

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
I don't really have programmed yet on

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.309 
I don't really have programmed yet on
the<00:02:26.310> iPhone<00:02:26.909> but<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:27.989> cool<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.200> I

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
the iPhone but it's kind of cool that I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.289 
the iPhone but it's kind of cool that I
wanted<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.590> demo<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.099> this<00:02:29.819> equalizer

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
wanted to demo is this equalizer

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.660 
wanted to demo is this equalizer
sequence<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.799> basically<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.640> a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
sequence and so basically I have a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.250 
sequence and so basically I have a
microphone<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.480> glove<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.760> when<00:02:35.760> I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
microphone on this glove here and when I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.929 
microphone on this glove here and when I
detect<00:02:37.260> audio<00:02:37.680> snapping<00:02:38.609> into<00:02:38.849> the

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
detect audio snapping into the

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:45.789 
detect audio snapping into the
microphone<00:02:39.389> I<00:02:40.040> convert<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.069> into<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:43.129> so

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
microphone I convert that into like so

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.110 
microphone I convert that into like so
so<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.069> an<00:02:47.159> example<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.489> me<00:02:47.609> just<00:02:47.819> tapping

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
so this is an example of me just tapping

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.490 
so this is an example of me just tapping
on<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.389> microphone<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.139> can't<00:02:49.290> really

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
on the microphone because I can't really

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.619 
on the microphone because I can't really
yell<00:02:49.650> too<00:02:49.829> loud<00:02:49.980> right<00:02:50.129> now<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.389> can<00:02:51.510> see

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
yell too loud right now but you can see

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.879 
yell too loud right now but you can see
that<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.870> creates<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.230> sort<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:52.470> equalizer

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
that it creates a sort of equalizer

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.149 
that it creates a sort of equalizer
effect<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:54.349> so<00:02:55.349> that's<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.680> demo<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.950> my

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
effect and so that's the demo of my

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.729 
effect and so that's the demo of my
iPhone<00:02:56.489> controlled<00:02:57.060> LED<00:02:57.419> suit<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.079> if<00:02:58.650> you're

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
iPhone controlled LED suit and if you're

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.770 
iPhone controlled LED suit and if you're
gonna<00:02:58.829> be<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> Dragon<00:02:59.340> Con<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.639> weekend<00:02:59.939> try

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
gonna be a Dragon Con this weekend try

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.240 
gonna be a Dragon Con this weekend try
to<00:03:00.840> find<00:03:01.079> me<00:03:01.169> I<00:03:01.200> should<00:03:01.439> it<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.620> too<00:03:01.980> hard<00:03:02.159> to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
to find me I should it be too hard to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.620 
to find me I should it be too hard to
spot<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.879> feel<00:03:03.719> free<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.930> ask<00:03:04.049> any<00:03:04.290> questions
