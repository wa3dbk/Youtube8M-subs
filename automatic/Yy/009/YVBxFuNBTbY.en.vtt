 Today I bring another video for our 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.639
 channel 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 The video that I'll be bringing today is 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 just a tutorial on how to solve a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 bug in this game tomb raider 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.489
 very simple second is just to shoot of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.780
 English and objects that kind of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.620
 crane on the subject pulls this object 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 sure the object fell the same way we 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.570
 here we have to do on the other side that the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.059
 purpose sensor 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 the yellow one there and it turned yellow that also 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.649
 In other words, we have to overthrow that 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.469
 key object of china together with him and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.010
 to break a break but look 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.239
 Only what happens is regretted. 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.409
 It's exactly what comes next. 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.470
 The rich object wakes up and the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.799
 object is flying there is some kind of 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.100
 supernatural power and the galera of the island 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 way I found to resolve this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.220

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.070
 To solve this book is you. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.280
 in the end the right tradition and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.640
 still can not that right side 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.190

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.159
 and moving the lara croft to 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.600

 here with another bug is very simple but 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.210
 I can not afford it, I can take a 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.440
 little and then came the second 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.440

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.420

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.780
