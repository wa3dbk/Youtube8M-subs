00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
mark 3 which was very impressive but

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.760 
mark 3 which was very impressive but
we're<00:00:47.239> hoping<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:47.660> should<00:00:47.870> be<00:00:48.020> just<00:00:48.469> as<00:00:48.620> good

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
we're hoping it should be just as good

we're hoping it should be just as good
in<00:00:48.890> low-light<00:00:49.219> conditions<00:00:49.370> in<00:00:50.300> addition<00:00:50.540> to

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
that cannon is optimized the autofocus

points for low-light conditions and
apparently<00:00:55.790> works<00:00:55.940> up<00:00:56.180> 2-3<00:00:56.930> EV<00:00:57.710> which<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.190> the
