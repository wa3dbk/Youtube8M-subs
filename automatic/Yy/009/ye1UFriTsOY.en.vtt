and now there is an almost switch down

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.060 
and now there is an almost switch down
here<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:10.070> remember<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:11.330> is<00:04:11.390> throttle<00:04:11.990> so<00:04:12.950> it

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
here so remember this is throttle so it

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.370 
here so remember this is throttle so it
goes<00:04:13.250> up<00:04:13.490> and<00:04:13.670> down<00:04:13.760> this<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.810> y'all<00:04:15.110> and
