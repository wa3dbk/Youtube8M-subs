00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
 fish only nice but yes I also have whole 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.329
 much about gaming and hid things 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 commented in spoken of course about 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 plenty of fish channel for sale call or duty 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.370
 show ghost because it is one anyway 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.020
 new game and I think fish are finished 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 channel that too of course 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.100
 yes comes into its own and what you put on here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 the background looks is cranky gameplay 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 and hurt works like you do a kill 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.890
 makes you will have 30 seconds 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.410
 to make a new pill 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.300
 otherwise you will export and if you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.969
 narcissist indeed get that is coming 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.830
 also tide wine and yes if you like me 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.260
 just die then you need that again 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.850
 should get hurt and if you sound 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.439
 nice chit sommer can get you faster 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.470
 walk you go it much faster you will 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.799
 draw I also see here eventually 18 8 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.600
 played with here for is my specialist 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.950
 equally i think you know what i have too 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 try it out but there are many 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.330
 possibilities call of duty ghost and me 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 hit ff small short peak one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.829
 give a chat about what I like about it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.689
 Call of Duty chose so far to the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.820
 Game I'm certainly in terms of class they 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.189
 app and how you can classify weapons as evil 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 works in terms of the touch excuse I think is super 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.329
 genius it works with 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.030
 squad porns and with those squad boys look 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.100
 my weapons to lure and time siemens 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.479
 and it is not that you 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 all the way out to everything 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.110
 have no you can also just yet 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 buy you can say ok i want that 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.280
 have a weapon but then you do have a score 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.540
 Need points and score points 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.210
 for example by challenge 'swatches 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.860
 for example h10 he proud or if you 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.840
 lot 500 kills answer given 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.040
 all score points for but also if you 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.570
 the level 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.700
 every time you are a level you get 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.099
 also squad points and with those squad points 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.780
 can you buy things like weapons and 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.300
 weapons still cost some preference 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.220
 if the bar requires six points 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 he sometimes gets like you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.480
 but one or two points so it costs 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.310
 some time the level also mourns 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.600
 quite a long time 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.770
 but yes here look here you see it too 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.400
 did this is surely a fantastic one 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.990
 time or a man lost and it is 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.140
 that just under water and you can also 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.340
 the water through the water you just saw and 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.200
 that man is really super genius 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.040
 Personal folders are too large must 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.100
 I also honestly enter 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.690
 but most folders are just one 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.210
 six or seven are certainly 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.640
 playable 6006 and become a drone 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.570
 of course totally nice I think well 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.010
 also 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.350
 but there are also real ones 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.400
 what this game so much 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.010
 can make better and that is yes the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.820
 damage the bullets and you go in here 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 the game 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.690
 die very quickly and that means you will 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.550
 it ie you will also see how fast here 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.160
 people fall dead but how fast you yourself 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.630
 death, of course, is a must 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.820
 I think his changes are going too fast 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.380
 kill it glitch its kempers can you 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.270
 still easy that the morning killer you 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.070
 actually can't turn around anymore and you 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.990
 are already dead and that is normal 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.880
 ruthlessly sometimes you can just 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.860
 yes then do nothing about it 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.280
 you you you die you it is such 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.930
 without the occasional but I think if they do that 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.060
 patch and as the damage of the bullets 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.890
 just really did twice as much 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.750
 need bullets than it is me now 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.390
 think that the patch was certainly successful 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.950
 then you will certainly be harder 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.989
 make kills of course 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.920
 but now it's really too easy now see 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.440
 You actually don't notice the difference between 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.910
 someone who is good and someone who 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.130
 yes what is less in call or duty 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.160
 everyone is well now seems right 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.900
 And yes I think good players really like that 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.640
 want to go russia 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.920
 is very difficult in this web game because 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.209
 the damage from those bullets just way too 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.709
 being big 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.170
 and I'll tell you hi you can really 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.760
 high long go also annoy me can also 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.799
 just play game just have fun lol 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.630
 and just wait for it to update 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.820
 is because those updates all think anyway 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.390
 do come, I think if you infinity 'is 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.340
 and you want to continue to do so and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.110
 you still want to keep playing this game 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.610
 they will probably be with one 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.400
 price come out with an update 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.660
 soon in then coming days 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.910
 yes i just hope so within this week 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.070
 that app did and comes in and then knows 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.050
 I'm sure this game was super successful 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.560
 is going to be really super successful I care 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.270
 though a figure you would have me now ge 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.700
 about what I have eaten now 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.919
 what i have seen and how i am all alone 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.960
 I share him and seven and a half 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.669
 give consideration 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.260
 and I think if they have some updates 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.510
 implement 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.000
 I can do this for a game lore wake 9 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.680
 could give and that too has 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.050
 of course with the new krank 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.000
 murder and with stupid nation and how it is 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.340
 all looks like it has one 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.200
 whole lot of it and the look I think and it 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.240
 looks really cool that look I think 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.380
 so my opinion of course looks closely 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.730
 there ever fat 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.200
 and everything is a bit different 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.030
 of course you also just see as someone 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.350
 getting a killstreak is 5 very strict team 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.210
 girls I see all live in pictures 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.520
 are left below the minima on the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.200
 minimap is also a deep reason made and 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.450
 that of course makes it little 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.650
 I always find because yes in the typeface 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.750
 You usually don't see that but in one 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.630
 wide you sometimes come to see where they are 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.520
 closely and they adjusted what I 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.470
 a college is almost on the move again 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.900
 yes i would say say just try 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.310
 call or duty jacket with just love too 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.260
 keep playing it is fantastic 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.510
 I think so far it is still possible 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.250
 better of course and updates what i just got 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.039
 said the first one 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.960
 the actually first impression I have and 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.729
 it's a fun game for everyone 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.890
 nice and playable well thought out 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.510
 to flow over the purchase that is possible 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.640
 share how you can organize your specialist 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.560
 how you like old street and how a 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.229
 can buy all your weapons and can 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.840
 lure and I think that just really good 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.729
 thought about it and if we just got that 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.770
 updates are coming then i'm sure this 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.150
 I think this is going to be a game 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.150
 can play all year round 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.780
 I now see how I can is special 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.850
 so many things you can actually do 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.740
 explain in videos and this was 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.150
 actually this time my commentary 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.190
 fries channel i heard you enjoyed it 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.820
 have my little first impression 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.600
 about call of duty ghosts and yes play it 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.280
 just mostly 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.169
 watch it especially on all channels and 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.060
 like him for fish of course and 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.060
 then i said it bye bye
