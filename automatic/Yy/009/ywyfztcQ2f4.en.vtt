00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.490
 greetings sports friends without a tie 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.469
 Today I have a pleasant surprise 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.230
 is a football legend that 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.230
 broke both in Mexico and in the USA 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.920
 welcome to the brown thank you for 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.960
 join us in sport without a tie 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
 thank you it's a pleasure to be here with 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.300
 with you and obviously in your program 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.360
 Mexican soccer has so much level 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.500
 like to think that it can reach a 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 end of the world cup you have to be 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.329
 honest mexico has grown today the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.780
 player goes to europe without another mentality 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.899
 which is more competitive than just that alone 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 makes you be in another country then but 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.580
 to get to that they came to the end of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 buy the world where we missed what 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.410
 it's because of the flight of talent in mexico what 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.150
 most important today is that the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.880
 Mexican player wants to transcend 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.880
 because in our country we are a bit 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.799
 it can be said well comfortable we are paid 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.409
 well we are in our land but 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.060
 now acquires that adventure and good 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.280
 few of us ventured to that and 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.040
 we did not succeed then that's very 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.980
 important 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 and that you tell me about chicharito 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.160
 wrong going to real madrid then look 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.900
 if to me study a position of him I 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.210
 also and want to go to real Madrid not 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 that is something normal and any 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.680
 player wants to play in real madrid is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.330
 something that one as a player or person in 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 any area of life one has 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.870
 to try and venture and achieve their 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 goals talking about that and rafa marquez him 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.360
 gives the tri or think that maybe 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.940
 should give way to other generations 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.009
 I believe that it contributes and is one of the 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.110
 players who were references for 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.390
 the players that were me I think it's 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.210
 very important always to have someone 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.940
 like him in friction raúl jiménez is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 another player who left mexico but not 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.420
 is having a lot of luck with the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.270
 Atlético de Madrid does not have to 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.230
 get used to that competition of all 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.220
 the days 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.730
 and in Europe if you do not train well all 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.070
 the days and the day of the game you play and 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.660
 you do not play well it will be difficult for you to repeat 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.510
 may the US be one day at the level of 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.569
 the first world powers 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.329
 missing a lot and in all 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.659
 aspects but to me what I like is 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:37.560
 that are doing things there is a 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.860
 planning and this planning is done 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.650
 go well or go wrong is true me 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.329
 I think the league has grown a lot 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.680
 thousands and I think if in the future 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.590
 we will be talking about what will be one of 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.450
 the strong leagues in Latin America I know 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.189
 that you are involved in a program that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.680
 helps young footballers in 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.629
 tell me about the dream in the case is that is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.150
 something very important for all 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.670
 young Latinos for all the people who 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.470
 wants to become a professional and that's 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.620
 very important what he does is dream in 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.310

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.849
