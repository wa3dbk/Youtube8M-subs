was recording cinematics my new montage

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.779 
was recording cinematics my new montage
and<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.910> found<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.300> glitch<00:00:18.560> first<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:19.830> I

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and I found this glitch first of all I

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.170 
and I found this glitch first of all I
don't<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.420> teammates<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.640> guy<00:00:23.850> he<00:00:24.060> had

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
don't like teammates so this guy he had

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.599 
don't like teammates so this guy he had
to<00:00:24.269> go<00:00:24.449> I'd<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:25.109> rid<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> his<00:00:25.470> deal<00:00:25.680> by<00:00:26.039> doing<00:00:26.340> um

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
to go I'd be rid of his deal by doing um

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.640 
to go I'd be rid of his deal by doing um
but<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> glitch<00:00:27.810> doesn't<00:00:27.840> work<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.529> those

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
but the glitch doesn't work with those

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.050 
but the glitch doesn't work with those
anybody<00:00:28.980> else<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> game<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.699> makes<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
anybody else in the game which makes it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.490 
anybody else in the game which makes it
a<00:00:30.119> little<00:00:30.210> harder<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> hit<00:00:30.810> trick<00:00:31.050> shots<00:00:31.260> with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
a little harder to hit trick shots with

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.610 
a little harder to hit trick shots with
it<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.910> in<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:34.050> doing<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it but in it I'm doing this in the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.810 
it but in it I'm doing this in the
public<00:00:34.860> match<00:00:35.660> as<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.469> see<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.579> glitch

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
public match as you can see the glitch

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.049 
public match as you can see the glitch
it's<00:00:39.600> complicated<00:00:40.520> but<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> do

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
it's complicated but what you have to do

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.220 
it's complicated but what you have to do
is<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> uh

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is you have to get over here by that uh

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
is you have to get over here by that uh
dead<00:00:44.190> waterfall<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.780> edge<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> map<00:00:46.590> by

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
dead waterfall on the edge of the map by

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
dead waterfall on the edge of the map by
the<00:00:47.280> bridge<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.750> falling<00:00:49.110> down<00:00:49.230> tree<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the bridge in that falling down tree and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
the bridge in that falling down tree and
you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> messed<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you can see I messed it up here like I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.029 
you can see I messed it up here like I
just<00:00:51.870> can't<00:00:52.230> quite<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.860> that's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
just can't quite get it like that's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
just can't quite get it like that's
wrong<00:00:53.309> you're<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.820> supposed<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
wrong you're not supposed to do that but

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.290 
wrong you're not supposed to do that but
then<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> realized<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.039> needed<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> part

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
then I realized I needed to do that part

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.490 
then I realized I needed to do that part
because<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> need<00:00:57.719> those<00:00:57.840> birds<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.350> there

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
because you need those birds right there

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.450 
because you need those birds right there
to<00:00:58.590> fly<00:00:58.770> away<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.559> back<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> spot<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to fly away so I go back to the spot and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.270 
to fly away so I go back to the spot and
I<00:01:02.940> shake<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.420> head<00:01:03.570> yes<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.470> verify<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> fact

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I shake my head yes to verify the fact

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.390 
I shake my head yes to verify the fact
that<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.790> indeed<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> spot<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
that this is indeed the spot to go to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.230 
that this is indeed the spot to go to
and<00:01:08.400> we're<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> cook<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and we're going to do is going to cook a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
and we're going to do is going to cook a
grenade<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.990> any<00:01:10.200> other<00:01:10.500> primary

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
grenade you can have any other primary

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.190 
grenade you can have any other primary
or<00:01:11.130> anything<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> jump<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.960> it'll

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
or anything I'm going to jump and it'll

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
or anything I'm going to jump and it'll
blow<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.860> map<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.790> don't<00:01:14.850> even

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
blow you out of the map you don't even

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940 
blow you out of the map you don't even
have<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.229> works<00:01:16.439> automatically

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
have it this it just works automatically

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
have it this it just works automatically
like<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:17.970> order<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> fully<00:01:18.540> get

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like this and then in order to fully get

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.990 
like this and then in order to fully get
out<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> map<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:20.250> sign<00:01:20.520> tells<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
out of the map this sign tells you to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.510 
out of the map this sign tells you to
stop<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> juke<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:23.369> then

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
stop you have to juke it out and then

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.969 
stop you have to juke it out and then
look<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> map<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.650> top<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
look I'm out of the map I go on top of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.859 
look I'm out of the map I go on top of
this<00:01:26.070> watchtower<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.450> where<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> hid

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
this watchtower here this is where I hid

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.039 
this watchtower here this is where I hid
all<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.140> tempers<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.799> bills<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:30.049> montages
