of<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.620> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.890> bit<00:01:29.070> -<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.490> these<00:01:29.550> two

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
of like a little bit - and these two

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.280

have<00:01:29.909> sort<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.420> faced<00:01:30.659> each<00:01:30.810> other<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.080> couple
