I<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.400> because<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> look<00:01:15.390> at

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
I think about it because if you look at

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
I think about it because if you look at
it<00:01:15.570> she's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:15.960> exactly<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.040> bestest<00:01:17.670> sports

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.530 
it she's not exactly the bestest sports
I<00:01:18.590> mean<00:01:19.590> even<00:01:19.860> her<00:01:20.520> own<00:01:20.580> teammates<00:01:21.210> tell<00:01:21.420> her

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
I mean even her own teammates tell her

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.370 
I mean even her own teammates tell her
how<00:01:21.720> bad<00:01:21.990> she<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> what's<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> mean<00:01:25.170> by

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
how bad she is so what's the mean by

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.679 
how bad she is so what's the mean by
leading<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.460> team<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.030> she<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
leading the team is she really the
