00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
I feel like the diff story should have a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.290 
I feel like the diff story should have a
little<00:01:50.000> bit<00:01:50.180> more<00:01:50.330> health<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.670> scientist<00:01:53.150> and

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
little bit more health the scientist and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
the infiltrator have 300 and then the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.230 
the infiltrator have 300 and then the
destroyer<00:01:57.020> has<00:01:57.670> 400<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:58.970> don't<00:01:59.030> know<00:01:59.180> I
