we've created a couple of prefabricated
characters<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.320> couple<00:00:16.890> locations<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.060> take

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
characters a couple locations so it take

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.080 
characters a couple locations so it take
a<00:00:18.390> look<00:00:18.660> at<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.740> old<00:00:19.890> ruined<00:00:20.520> university

a look at the old ruined university

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730 
a look at the old ruined university
we'll<00:00:21.390> take<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> look<00:00:21.689> at<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.380> character

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
we'll take a look at the character

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.779 
we'll take a look at the character
that's<00:00:22.920> been<00:00:23.039> geared<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.519> bit<00:00:23.609> more

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
that's been geared a little bit more

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.110 
that's been geared a little bit more
towards<00:00:24.090> warrior<00:00:24.750> base<00:00:24.990> abilities<00:00:25.920> again

purposes show give an idea of how these

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.930 
purposes show give an idea of how these
different<00:00:36.300> mechanics<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> function

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
different mechanics and a function

different mechanics and a function
yeah<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.440> bit

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
yeah you can see this a little bit

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.650 
yeah you can see this a little bit
different<00:00:40.949> environmental<00:00:41.399> darker

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
different environmental darker

different environmental darker
ya<00:00:43.900> know<00:00:44.110> our<00:00:44.280> narrative<00:00:45.280> Lee<00:00:45.400> area<00:00:46.210> we've

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
ya know our narrative Lee area we've

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.450 
ya know our narrative Lee area we've
been<00:00:46.630> doing<00:00:47.110> all<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:47.290> things<00:00:47.530> as<00:00:48.130> far<00:00:48.340> as

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
been doing all the things as far as

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.910 
been doing all the things as far as
experimentation<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.450> Barrett<00:00:49.720> saw<00:00:49.920> one

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
experimentation to the Barrett saw one

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.229 
experimentation to the Barrett saw one
other<00:00:51.040> thing<00:00:51.220> because<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.790> fact<00:00:51.970> that<00:00:52.030> you're

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
other thing because the fact that you're

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.690 
other thing because the fact that you're
able<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.480> switch<00:00:52.690> between<00:00:52.809> equip<00:00:53.200> into<00:00:53.440> stuff

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
able to switch between equip into stuff

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.250 
able to switch between equip into stuff
we've<00:00:54.700> just

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
we've just

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.380 
we've just
a way<00:00:56.859> to<00:00:56.920> quick<00:00:57.250> swap<00:00:57.550> between<00:00:57.760> equipment

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
a way to quick swap between equipment

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.410 
a way to quick swap between equipment
sets<00:00:58.600> so<00:00:59.410> if<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.649> was<00:00:59.829> to<00:00:59.859> say<00:01:00.160> press<00:01:00.640> left<00:01:00.910> left

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
sets so if I was to say press left left

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.750 
sets so if I was to say press left left
it<00:01:01.510> up<00:01:01.600> in<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.780> epad<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.410> switch<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.219> a<00:01:03.370> second

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
it up in the epad I switch to a second

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.359 
it up in the epad I switch to a second
armor<00:01:04.030> set<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:05.290> messed<00:01:05.530> up<00:01:05.740> switch<00:01:06.159> back<00:01:06.340> to

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
armor set we messed up switch back to

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.450 
armor set we messed up switch back to
the<00:01:06.490> one<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.729> started<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.180> left<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:09.100> allows<00:01:09.280> you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
the one I started in left it allows you

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.100 
the one I started in left it allows you
to<00:01:09.549> switch<00:01:09.670> between<00:01:09.790> armor<00:01:10.330> sets<00:01:10.540> on<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.750> fly

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
to switch between armor sets on the fly

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.499 
to switch between armor sets on the fly
so<00:01:11.409> that<00:01:12.070> as<00:01:12.250> you're<00:01:12.520> going<00:01:12.700> through<00:01:12.789> magic<00:01:13.330> or

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
so that as you're going through magic or

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:14.880 
so that as you're going through magic or
different<00:01:13.899> situations<00:01:14.470> where<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.649> want<00:01:14.799> to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
different situations where you want to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.350 
different situations where you want to
use<00:01:14.979> different<00:01:15.250> weapons<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.729> can<00:01:16.149> quickly

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
use different weapons I can quickly

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.060 
use different weapons I can quickly
switch<00:01:16.630> in<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.049> heat<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.229> battle<00:01:17.350> without

switch in the heat of battle without

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.590 
switch in the heat of battle without
have<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.490> open<00:01:18.759> up<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.970> menu<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.360> everything

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
have to open up the menu and everything

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.359 
have to open up the menu and everything
like<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.780> it's<00:01:20.440> really<00:01:20.680> important<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.159> start

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
like that it's really important to start

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.070 
like that it's really important to start
to<00:01:21.490> create<00:01:21.700> these<00:01:21.820> hybrid<00:01:22.299> kind<00:01:22.539> of<00:01:22.659> character

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
to create these hybrid kind of character

00:01:23.080 --> 00:02:11.880 
to create these hybrid kind of character
models

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.550 

also<00:02:12.580> take<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> quick<00:02:13.030> look<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:14.440> our

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
also take a quick look what our

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.610 
also take a quick look what our
environments

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
environments

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.979

they<00:02:15.769> were<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.069> binds<00:02:16.599> give<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.750> really

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
they were the binds give you a really

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.259 
they were the binds give you a really
brief<00:02:18.140> idea<00:02:18.379> how<00:02:18.909> some<00:02:19.909> of<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> range

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269

mechanics<00:02:20.780> work<00:02:21.129> is<00:02:22.129> more<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.580> a

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
mechanics work is more of a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.900
