that<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.930> dual<00:04:04.260> counter

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.510 

we've<00:04:13.900> also<00:04:14.050> worked<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.470> lot<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:15.280> different

we've also worked a lot on the different

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.949 
we've also worked a lot on the different
archetypes<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.269> game<00:04:16.420> to<00:04:16.570> make<00:04:16.690> sure<00:04:16.840> that

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
archetypes in the game to make sure that

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.849 
archetypes in the game to make sure that
you<00:04:17.019> have<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.230> change<00:04:17.470> your<00:04:17.620> strategy

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
you have to change your strategy

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.069 
you have to change your strategy
depending<00:04:18.579> on<00:04:18.700> who<00:04:19.180> you're<00:04:19.390> attacking<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:19.989> in

depending on who you're attacking so in

this instance your base attack won't

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.790 
this instance your base attack won't
work<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.420> you<00:04:22.570> need<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.810> use<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.020> more<00:04:23.590> advanced

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800

tactics you may not have noticed but all

that combat took place on uneven terrain
just<00:04:30.220> like<00:04:30.340> our<00:04:30.460> navigation<00:04:31.180> we're<00:04:31.330> tried

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
just like our navigation we're tried

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.240 
just like our navigation we're tried
very<00:04:31.780> hard<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:32.200> make<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.500> believable<00:04:32.650> and

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
very hard to make it believable and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.780 
very hard to make it believable and
contextual<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.210> environment<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:38.790> new

contextual to the environment the new

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.250 
contextual to the environment the new
assassin<00:04:40.150> can<00:04:40.270> also<00:04:40.390> assassinate<00:04:41.140> his

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
assassin can also assassinate his

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.840 
assassin can also assassinate his
enemies<00:04:41.560> with<00:04:41.680> all<00:04:41.830> tools<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.460> all<00:04:42.580> weapons

enemies with all tools and all weapons
in<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:43.300> case<00:04:43.480> we'll<00:04:43.660> use<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.020> tomahawk<00:04:44.470> to

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
in this case we'll use the tomahawk to

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.430 
in this case we'll use the tomahawk to
finish<00:04:44.890> off<00:04:45.040> a<00:04:45.070> poor<00:04:45.370> fleeing<00:04:45.700> guard<00:04:49.169> we<00:04:50.169> truly

you'll<00:05:08.950> see<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.460> environment<00:05:09.880> self<00:05:10.240> is

not<00:05:10.390> greeted<00:05:10.930> that<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.500> Connor<00:05:11.919> is<00:05:12.070> able<00:05:12.310> to

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
not greeted that a Connor is able to

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.190 
not greeted that a Connor is able to
grab<00:05:12.700> on<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.120> all<00:05:13.360> kinds<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.720> different<00:05:13.870> shapes

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
grab on to all kinds of different shapes

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.110 
grab on to all kinds of different shapes
which<00:05:15.010> we<00:05:15.130> think<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.400> particularly<00:05:15.730> special

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
which we think is particularly special

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:25.340 
which we think is particularly special
in<00:05:16.660> an<00:05:16.810> open<00:05:17.050> world<00:05:17.169> context

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.140 

this<00:05:25.920> is<00:05:26.040> one<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.190> three<00:05:26.490> ways<00:05:26.730> into<00:05:27.000> this

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
this is one of three ways into this

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.850 
this is one of three ways into this
particular<00:05:27.450> fort<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.110> sort<00:05:28.320> of<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.500> stealth

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:50.670 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth
path<00:05:29.640> at<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.120> rear

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.409 

so<00:05:51.280> black<00:05:51.460> powder<00:05:51.699> is<00:05:51.880> not<00:05:52.000> just<00:05:52.180> a<00:05:52.240> key

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
so black powder is not just a key

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.090 
so black powder is not just a key
historical<00:05:52.570> resource<00:05:53.470> you<00:05:53.620> can<00:05:53.650> see<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:53.949> being

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
historical resource you can see it being

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.409 
historical resource you can see it being
loaded<00:05:54.310> there<00:05:54.990> into<00:05:55.990> that<00:05:56.139> cabin<00:05:57.270> but<00:05:58.270> also

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
loaded there into that cabin but also

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.540 
loaded there into that cabin but also
gave<00:05:58.660> us<00:05:58.750> an<00:05:58.810> opportunity<00:05:58.900> to<00:05:59.370> include<00:06:00.370> some

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
gave us an opportunity to include some

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:10.409 
gave us an opportunity to include some
historical<00:06:01.090> exploding<00:06:02.050> barrels<00:06:09.180> so<00:06:10.180> nothing

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
historical exploding barrels so nothing

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:11.700 
historical exploding barrels so nothing
we<00:06:10.509> invested<00:06:10.810> heavily<00:06:10.960> in<00:06:11.169> is<00:06:11.350> this<00:06:11.440> notion

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
we invested heavily in is this notion

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.460 
we invested heavily in is this notion
that<00:06:11.949> Connor<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.460> always<00:06:13.360> on<00:06:13.509> the<00:06:13.630> move<00:06:13.810> we

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
that Connor is always on the move we

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.770 
that Connor is always on the move we
gave<00:06:14.590> him<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.710> bunch<00:06:14.919> of<00:06:15.009> new<00:06:15.280> abilities<00:06:16.210> such

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.570 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such
as<00:06:16.810> running<00:06:17.169> assassinate<00:06:17.770> so<00:06:18.190> here<00:06:18.400> is<00:06:18.490> he

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
as running assassinate so here is he

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.249 
as running assassinate so here is he
chases<00:06:18.940> Silas<00:06:19.300> you<00:06:19.419> can<00:06:19.570> assassinate<00:06:19.810> this

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
chases Silas you can assassinate this

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:21.990 
chases Silas you can assassinate this
guy<00:06:20.440> in<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.560> room<00:06:20.740> you<00:06:21.220> can<00:06:21.400> snatch<00:06:21.639> up<00:06:21.850> this

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
guy in the room you can snatch up this

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.999 
guy in the room you can snatch up this
musket<00:06:22.389> on<00:06:22.509> the<00:06:22.600> run<00:06:22.780> kill<00:06:23.259> another<00:06:23.530> guy<00:06:23.770> and

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
musket on the run kill another guy and

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.690 
musket on the run kill another guy and
