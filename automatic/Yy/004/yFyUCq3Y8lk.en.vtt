00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
me was control and I found that all I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
me was control and I found that all I
had<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.570> hang<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.930> around<00:01:55.110> B

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
had to really do was hang out around B

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.620 
had to really do was hang out around B
and<00:01:56.579> depending<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.149> map<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.600> are

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and depending on which map you are

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.569 
and depending on which map you are
sometimes<00:01:58.259> there's<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> heavy<00:01:58.950> ammo

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
sometimes there's a heavy ammo

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.300 
sometimes there's a heavy ammo
stash<00:02:00.149> around<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.409> capture<00:02:02.070> point

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
stash around the be a capture point

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.190 
stash around the be a capture point
anyway<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.240> makes<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> really<00:02:03.719> convenient

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
