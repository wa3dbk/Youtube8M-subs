00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.910
 Let me introduce my gaming pc 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.029
 me in the last three to four weeks 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.430
 Let's go together 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 I use the h2 classic ropes 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.140
 cases the front has two fans and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.260
 the back is a pretty quiet one 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300
 symbol of the ethics council 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.930
 In addition , no blu ray disc drive and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.719
 a dvd drive city the two turbines 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.969
 and this special foam is 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.800
 because that the pc is not so loud 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.530
 that's fine if you put it on 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 higher levels are switched off by the processor and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.239
 the graphics card can sometimes very 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.239
 getting hot 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.360
 her from behind the pc i apologize 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.640
 me here for a short time for the whole shake 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.700
 you've got a few on it 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:20.110
 connections hdmi vga out puts four 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.260
 usb ports 2.0 and two 3.0 the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.210
 graphics card with hdmi to graphic had 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.430
 I'll come to her right there 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.340
 a rather internet connection and here 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.520

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.640
 I will introduce you soon 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.990
 I am now the intel i7 core the 3 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.720
 770 k 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:50.260
 with 3 5 gigahertz it's overclocking up 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.479
 to 5 or 6 gb / s quite a portal 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:59.860
 graphics card gpu is the power edition 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:01.500
 msi geforce gtx six handed 776 bis 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.720
 pretty brutal 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.790
 costs a little less than the 680 has 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.130
 but significantly more power 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.940
 That's the drinking Frisian of the two 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.950
 daughters 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:20.940

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.420
 I have my motherboard frame 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.860

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.630
