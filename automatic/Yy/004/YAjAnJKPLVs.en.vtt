00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.970
 Hello Love Theory Piano Piano Keyboards Whatever interested 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.479
 or just welcome love Musikverein 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.519
 yes there is another video from my new almost back to series 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.719
 like my futures from a to z threesomes 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.369
 I want to call this series now where piano lessons are concerned 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 I'm probably not the right person for you but I'll give you a little bit 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.819
 what about the basics 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.689
 a piano here using the example of a keyboard 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.630
 to explain and to own how you can make melody where that actually 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.900
 not so much to say so now you would make a melody otherwise 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.630
 every composer more 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.800
 Océ long story short. "We have so constructed for us so why 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.820
 not just directly with the Sido beginning 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.740
 where we continue to tell before we talk 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.990
 Océ 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.960
 I had recently mentioned next videos, it goes on with 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.300
 Grisham if I may not do it all now Ahmad Kurd inside 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.920
 and there the black keys came in for the first time for the first time 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 and then so much funnier 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.840
 Denise Springmesser can make out 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.460
 Sound of was and continues to deepen that really should be from a to z all for 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.070
 explain its very important absolute beginner basics 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.840
 soft last video maybe even a bit too fast on one 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.910
 Super jump 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.219
 it is said that now come to the box but why only the black ones 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.939
 Generally, adult keys will be tinted 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.900
 So the sound has more last time look 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 Forts GER 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.960
 Although that's really just all sounds, I do not want to explain again 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.280
 Now I would like to see again to the sounds itself you hear stop and stop 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.240
 really great CSG it flows 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.140
 all this what is that all 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.130
 yes, so one 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.120
 Then around Stone 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.190
 s something here 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.429
 why is this not quite a 2 and patiently two buttons 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.340
 which seem to be next to each other 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.980
 but here between seeing is still a tape 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.549
 this key is his tone which do exactly what it does 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.740
 if about one percent 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.080
 completely dead with a whole tone in between 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.530
 with that we have two more 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.940
 Persevere logically here at the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.450
 therefore do form and content and there is no more gate to shoot and 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.139
 ambulance 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.479
 for the notes Georg one percent 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.299
 so at 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.509
 do it all 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.780
 Now, not only does that have something to do with turning off the white black 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.439
 that can also be around for example this example at 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.869
 look at yourself what was that and now the key 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.340
 half or so 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.629
 yes, that was very stupid because here 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.049
 a whole zoo 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.209
 In between, it's ultimately about it going wrong or not 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.729
 just as it is in theory 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.849
 so now it's not always two white burgundies black or white 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.849
 In the stomach, take the example of the two black ones 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.290
 so what does that sound like now? 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.449
 right and very nice because here the data 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:55.149
 A whole day wonder between Lahr so ​​now we can make these cups easy 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.909
 do most or some would be happy to pay here maybe 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.809
 Letters or something else on it or make any markings 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:03.350
 knowledge 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.570
 what you should press 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.980
 I'll just tell you so that it learns correctly and I hope the construction cranes mistakes 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.179
 You can win something like that 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.729
 Jaja Mehdorn professional everything but I know for free 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:14.899
 damp 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:15.949
 around 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.949
 and then not that I was not a mistake and so tell you now 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.849
 We shut up the basic sounds we already had 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.049
 once played with a super contract at this point 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.409
 I would like to say again here is a microphone that does not look in the video now 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.609
 But that's the reason why it was only black. He was also this one 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.479
 Giant pop protection is over but I am yes 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.849
 an incredibly good pianist and student and feel the box shape 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.339
 So that's all right 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.140
 then you can start right at the start 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.439
 all players always the bottom to top it on 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.870
 took downstairs so from the deep down 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.189
 to the tall box 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.699
 then this key is called here and now but black keys what he 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.059
 promised for the victories 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.089
 St ciss this key 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.869
 because I'm from Lake Constance Light Assist that the leg she is 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.840
 so and now you do not need much 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.160
 speculate what can that be who knows that we can do that now 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.669
 that's the one that is 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.220
 so on and so forth 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.220
 it goes on with her 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:16.719
 at St 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.729
 Initial letters a from ditto and from which they derive 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.430
 it is and as I am right now I am gone 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.439
 all players heroines 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.230
 from top to bottom that is from Boeing 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.520
 to the low notes 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.610
 Meppen 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.909
 forgiveness 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.170
 Dan percent 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.050
 the keys have one 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.240
 another name 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.520
 I personally 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.139
 yes, but I do not want to understand myself rushed impossible 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.080
 when he says 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.310
 and here they do this then everybody knows this button is meant there 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.480
 think about it and Mannheim what should be the last bite for you 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.850
 played up to the bottom but this seems to be more bands a lot later 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:54.469
 thicket 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:57.479
 yes, that's no theory. Men usually go to the squad I want 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.900
 do not say piano lessons it's just not one 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.539
 Okay found in the specific case 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.300
 percent 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.650
 at the core of this 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.190
 CS also be one of that because I am like I said top to bottom game and 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.439
 while at 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.309
 it is so pleased that the sentence 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:16.960
 the CS was Volz the same sound 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.839
 the follow-up costs change in the same way 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.839
 so for example the Dells 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.319
 and throw out Gates 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.389
 and here the ARZ 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.710
 conceivable 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.479
 and now he goes out 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.740
 some Tegan speculation are wet but you have given away before 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.780
 maybe also seen earlier »the junior secondary school 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.510
 the high school belly in my Barth or maybe current music school 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.639
 that is that b 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.949
 okay so now does not come in the WTO with the accession but that it 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.659
 the web 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.569
 here can both 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.089
 1 as well as the beer both 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.969
 here can 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.409
 Pour as well as be bars 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.559
 here you can 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:02.639
 I think or Menz forbidden to drive 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.990
 then we have that or theirs 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.780
 and very or to lower so when could want to specify the duo 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.020
 befriend 16 Pike you know what St 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.410
 but we still can not read music even if December letters 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.100
 and, as I said, that occurred 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.510
 the naming of the keys with it always van everseel game are coarse 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.130
 so young 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.870
 JPY yet Bioland to paint or play my tune 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.590
 middle nasty or whatever I find here Skate what then you know what 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.879
 so half ton is so great so do the person 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.770
 Hello were examined 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.249
 Became serious 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:34.280
 until now 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.620
 then you know how the black cash registers are called that's the course goes too 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.280
 for all other keys we are always 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.960
 the same 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.330
 thin the voters on the 9th 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
 okay 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.340
 One and the same applies of course to me already has hundreds 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.159
 Male in recent years are always the same films also applies to the 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.130
 white robes 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.909
 like Emma 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:54.320
 Do you see it 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.639
 Picture Christ 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:59.979
 sleeve 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:03.430
 that's just enough for today, I hope you've learned something percent 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.560
 I guess so 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.650
 and consumers can do something with it when I save that forever 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.039
 very important so sounds 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.749
 So as we know grassland club increase the principle of tones 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.710
 was shown in this video I quickly say goodbye to the hospice 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.720
 wishes a nice RS weekend 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.270
 broken comments thumbs up please no down 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.810
 and if he gradually plan 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.220
 Unfortunately, I can not do anything against Poland - but quite sad to turn back 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:31.789
 "Okay you changed even the silly Barca words I changed in kind 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:34.119
 Hentig now finally 

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:35.269
 Percent
