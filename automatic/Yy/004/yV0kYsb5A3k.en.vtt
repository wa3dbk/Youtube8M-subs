00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
stock electronics as far as the switch

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.660 
stock electronics as far as the switch
and<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> pots<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.760> came<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.629> affinity

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
and the pots that came on this affinity

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.540 
and the pots that came on this affinity
tally<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> pickups<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.250> bridge

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
tally so just the pickups and the bridge

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
tally so just the pickups and the bridge
saddles<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.270> been<00:00:45.510> altered<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.020> pickups<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
saddles have been altered the pickups I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.819 
saddles have been altered the pickups I
think<00:00:50.670> running<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.329> $50<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.260> pair

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
think running like $50 for the pair

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.700 
think running like $50 for the pair
so<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.730> truly<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.059> bargain<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:55.620> they

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

plus

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.990 
plus
throwing<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.650> little<00:03:55.889> overdrive<00:03:56.430> let's<00:03:56.790> see

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
throwing a little overdrive let's see

00:03:57.000 --> 00:05:13.129 
throwing a little overdrive let's see
how<00:03:57.150> she<00:03:57.209> sounds

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.329 

alright<00:05:14.139> I'm<00:05:14.349> gonna<00:05:14.499> switch<00:05:14.770> from<00:05:15.069> the

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:15.339 
alright I'm gonna switch from the

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.209 
alright I'm gonna switch from the
overdrive<00:05:15.879> to<00:05:16.389> a<00:05:16.719> hotter<00:05:17.169> distortion<00:05:17.979> sound

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
overdrive to a hotter distortion sound

00:05:18.219 --> 00:06:06.240 
overdrive to a hotter distortion sound
here

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.050 

so<00:06:07.250> they<00:06:07.400> can<00:06:07.520> get<00:06:07.640> nice<00:06:07.880> and<00:06:07.910> crunchy<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:10.060> my

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
so they can get nice and crunchy to my

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.510 
so they can get nice and crunchy to my
bad<00:06:11.300> setup<00:06:11.690> if<00:06:12.050> you<00:06:12.200> want<00:06:12.410> to<00:06:12.560> try<00:06:13.010> something

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
bad setup if you want to try something

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.220 
bad setup if you want to try something
with<00:06:13.760> a<00:06:14.030> little<00:06:14.270> bit<00:06:14.390> less<00:06:14.510> noise<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:15.020> little

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
with a little bit less noise a little

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.220 
with a little bit less noise a little
more<00:06:15.350> fatness<00:06:15.830> to<00:06:16.040> it<00:06:16.330> not<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.390> bad<00:06:17.570> choice<00:06:17.900> for

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
more fatness to it not a bad choice for

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.910 
more fatness to it not a bad choice for
