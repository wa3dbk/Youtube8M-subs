00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.639 
Ballet
I<00:00:55.300> think<00:00:56.230> it's<00:00:56.350> apparent<00:00:56.679> to<00:00:56.859> me<00:00:58.019> watching<00:00:59.019> and

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
I think it's apparent to me watching and

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.459 
I think it's apparent to me watching and
dancing<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.879> choreography<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.510> Robbins

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
dancing the choreography that Robbins

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.380 
dancing the choreography that Robbins
loved<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.339> piece<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.789> music

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
loved this piece of music

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.310 
loved this piece of music
I<00:01:04.800> think<00:01:05.800> choreographers<00:01:07.050> generally<00:01:08.050> don't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
I think choreographers generally don't

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.160 
I think choreographers generally don't
choose<00:01:08.910> masterpieces<00:01:09.910> but<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.840> case<00:01:11.020> of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
choose masterpieces but in the case of

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.170 
choose masterpieces but in the case of
the<00:01:11.260> Goldberg<00:01:11.620> Variations<00:01:11.670> Bach<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.910> so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
the Goldberg Variations Bach is so

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.890 
the Goldberg Variations Bach is so
danceable<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.020> rhythmic<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.060> joyous<00:01:16.060> that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
danceable so rhythmic and so joyous that

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.990 
danceable so rhythmic and so joyous that
it<00:01:17.020> was<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.170> great<00:01:17.380> choice<00:01:17.710> for<00:01:17.740> Jerry<00:01:18.580> Robbins

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
it was a great choice for Jerry Robbins

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.620 
it was a great choice for Jerry Robbins
to<00:01:19.120> choreograph<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.800> daily<00:01:24.250> routine<00:01:25.210> is

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
to choreograph well the daily routine is

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.960 
to choreograph well the daily routine is
dominated<00:01:26.350> by<00:01:26.700> rehearsals<00:01:27.700> with<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.910> dancers

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
dominated by rehearsals with the dancers

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
is vastly more difficult for the pianist

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.150 
is vastly more difficult for the pianist
than<00:01:47.480> it<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.690> for<00:01:47.870> any<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.200> dancers<00:01:48.380> you
