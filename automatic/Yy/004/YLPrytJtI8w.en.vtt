channel epic once again I've got two

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
channel epic once again I've got two
channels<00:01:11.340> together<00:01:11.760> than<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> same<00:01:12.450> thing

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
channels together than the same thing

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.219 
channels together than the same thing
over<00:01:12.780> here

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
over here

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.730 
over here
here's<00:01:13.800> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.429 

tell<00:01:18.740> controls<00:01:19.160> off-base<00:01:19.850> only

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.910 

treble<00:01:25.189> only

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
treble only

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:36.899 
treble only
right

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.280 

make<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.060> way<00:01:38.210> cleaner<00:01:38.570> put<00:01:38.930> everything

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:02:01.340 

so<00:01:42.830> full<00:01:43.070> amplifier<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:43.790> both<00:01:43.970> sides

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.600 

so<00:02:02.350> if<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.500> put<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:02.920> between<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:08.610> brain

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
so if you put it in between to the brain

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:18.360 
so if you put it in between to the brain
switch<00:02:09.850> back<00:02:10.090> off<00:02:10.390> it's<00:02:11.200> more<00:02:11.500> base

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:29.839 

all<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.670> men<00:02:18.819> region<00:02:19.180> still<00:02:19.480> sounds<00:02:19.810> musical

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.280 

so<00:02:30.849> Michael<00:02:31.150> let's<00:02:31.299> go<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> dead<00:02:32.019> clean

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
so Michael let's go for a dead clean

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.619 
so Michael let's go for a dead clean
tone<00:02:32.560> I'm<00:02:33.370> gonna<00:02:33.580> turn<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.909> gain<00:02:34.090> down<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.540> it

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
tone I'm gonna turn the gain down to it

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.430 
tone I'm gonna turn the gain down to it
at<00:02:34.780> about<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.409> don't<00:02:35.860> know<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.310> quarter<00:02:37.349> put<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
at about I don't know a quarter put the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.040 
at about I don't know a quarter put the
tone<00:02:38.650> controls<00:02:39.069> more<00:02:39.819> or<00:02:39.909> less<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.329> middle

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
tone controls more or less in the middle

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:54.410 
tone controls more or less in the middle
you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.060

basement of my turn to buy my the guitar

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:22.650 
basement of my turn to buy my the guitar

so the next one Michael we're gonna take
the<00:03:25.220> same<00:03:25.520> channel<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.450> we're<00:03:26.600> gonna<00:03:26.690> we're

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
the same channel and we're gonna we're

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.570 
the same channel and we're gonna we're
gonna<00:03:27.320> give<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.650> some<00:03:27.680> gain<00:03:28.040> I'll<00:03:28.340> take<00:03:28.550> a

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580

little teeny bit of high-end off it so
you're<00:03:30.500> using<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.830> clean<00:03:31.160> channel<00:03:31.520> as<00:03:31.670> a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
you're using the clean channel as a

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:54.740 
you're using the clean channel as a
slightly<00:03:32.060> dirty<00:03:32.360> tune<00:03:32.720> right

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.690 

so<00:03:55.750> let's<00:03:55.989> try<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.290> get<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:57.099> kind<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.459> tone

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
so let's try to get that kind of tone

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.370 
so let's try to get that kind of tone
out<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.150> other<00:03:58.270> channel<00:03:58.720> slightly<00:03:59.200> dirty

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
out of the other channel slightly dirty

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.380 
out of the other channel slightly dirty
I'll<00:03:59.770> make<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.160> gain<00:04:00.370> at<00:04:00.550> about<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.790> third<00:04:01.120> and

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
I'll make the gain at about a third and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.059 
I'll make the gain at about a third and
put<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.690> tone<00:04:01.900> controls<00:04:02.260> in<00:04:02.410> exactly<00:04:02.890> the

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
put the tone controls in exactly the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.120 
put the tone controls in exactly the
same<00:04:03.099> place<00:04:03.520> same<00:04:04.390> kind<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.750> idea<00:04:05.110> but<00:04:05.200> it's

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
same place same kind of idea but it's

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:40.600 
same place same kind of idea but it's
it's<00:04:06.610> a<00:04:06.730> different

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.980 

we'll<00:04:41.610> make<00:04:41.759> it<00:04:41.939> more<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.270> modern<00:04:42.599> tone<00:04:42.810> I'm

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
we'll make it more of a modern tone I'm

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.600 
we'll make it more of a modern tone I'm
gonna<00:04:43.139> turn<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.439> treble<00:04:43.860> way<00:04:44.039> up<00:04:44.340> in<00:04:44.520> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
gonna turn the treble way up in the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.939 
gonna turn the treble way up in the
mid-range<00:04:45.060> way<00:04:45.629> down<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.199> bass<00:04:46.409> way<00:04:46.740> up

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
mid-range way down and the bass way up

00:04:46.949 --> 00:05:12.260 
mid-range way down and the bass way up
so<00:04:47.310> go<00:04:47.490> for<00:04:47.639> much<00:04:47.789> more<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.180> modern

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.320 

let's<00:05:13.270> see<00:05:13.450> if<00:05:13.540> we<00:05:13.660> can<00:05:13.840> clean<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:15.580> lead

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
let's see if we can clean the lead

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.650 
let's see if we can clean the lead
channel<00:05:16.630> up<00:05:16.870> completely<00:05:17.350> which<00:05:18.160> would<00:05:18.660> it's

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
channel up completely which would it's

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.760 
channel up completely which would it's
not<00:05:19.690> something<00:05:20.080> you're<00:05:20.140> supposed<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.470> be<00:05:20.620> able

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
not something you're supposed to be able

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.260 
not something you're supposed to be able
to<00:05:20.890> do<00:05:21.040> but<00:05:21.310> if<00:05:21.400> these<00:05:21.520> are<00:05:21.700> truly<00:05:21.970> two

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
to do but if these are truly two

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.760 
to do but if these are truly two
separate<00:05:22.660> amplifiers<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:23.290> shouldn't<00:05:23.740> work

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
separate amplifiers that shouldn't work

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.740 
separate amplifiers that shouldn't work
right<00:05:24.100> so<00:05:24.280> I'm<00:05:24.430> gonna<00:05:24.580> turn<00:05:24.730> this<00:05:24.880> way<00:05:25.240> way

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
right so I'm gonna turn this way way

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.510 
right so I'm gonna turn this way way
down<00:05:25.960> Michael<00:05:26.380> turn<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.680> bright<00:05:26.890> switch<00:05:27.220> on

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
down Michael turn the bright switch on

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.980 
down Michael turn the bright switch on
give<00:05:27.790> it<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.910> little<00:05:28.120> bit<00:05:28.300> more<00:05:28.420> mid-range<00:05:28.780> and

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
give it a little bit more mid-range and

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:47.660 
give it a little bit more mid-range and
less<00:05:29.110> space<00:05:29.350> as<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:29.710> clean<00:05:29.920> up<00:05:29.950> beautifully

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.400 

this<00:05:48.670> is<00:05:48.820> our<00:05:48.940> two<00:05:49.090> channel<00:05:49.450> C<00:05:49.690> once<00:05:50.140> again

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
this is our two channel C once again

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.610 
this is our two channel C once again
this<00:05:51.100> thing<00:05:51.370> is<00:05:51.490> being<00:05:51.670> played<00:05:52.030> to<00:05:52.360> at<00:05:52.620> 212

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620

straight into a D aw no compression no
EQ<00:05:58.420> there<00:05:58.600> is<00:05:58.720> a<00:05:58.750> little<00:05:59.050> reverb<00:05:59.350> on<00:05:59.500> it<00:05:59.560> and

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
EQ there is a little reverb on it and

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.060 
EQ there is a little reverb on it and
I'm<00:05:59.890> playing<00:06:00.130> with<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.370> reverb<00:06:00.670> knob<00:06:00.850> on
