00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.579
 more cooking on this occasion I 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.660
 Accompany Carlos who will help me 

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:13.670
 make a cold soup of codito I 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.070
 I'm doing for is a way to 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.900
 make life easier for new moms 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.210
 they have their baby accompany them and another 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.689
 way to facilitate the is the diapers 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.689
 baby tips to make this recipe is very 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.880
 simple is for those people who 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.380
 they have this complication since it is 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.640
 the complication of having the baby on 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.790
 husband must be changing diapers 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.380
 and we are going to harass the pasta since you have 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.720
 given some examples of how 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.060
 get it 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.040
 is already cooked we put this and you 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.620
 I recommend that in this case you put a 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.970
 little salt to water so your recipe does not 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.520
 will have a lot of salt but will have the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.070
 flavor the pasta is going to take is a 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.800
 soup packet that are almost 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.100
 they always come in packages of 200 250 and 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.920
 220 in those ranges also a liter of 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.350
 cream I like very much the believes very 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.290
 creamy active likes 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.240
 a little bit not so much but then I 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.020
 I'm going to put a liter of cream can 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.880
 have the liter ready and live putting it 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.100
 depending also half a kilo of ham 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.040
 ham we will ask for in a 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.220
 thick slice and we're going to chop it in 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.860
 squares the same case with cheese 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.470
 yellow 250 grams and we will apply 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.100
 in squares so simple like this 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.380
 simple how to put the cream all and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.670
 let's put a little bit 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 and I put him 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.700
 if you want before continuing to put 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.700
 add the ham 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.830
 another important thing to season is 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.350
 our seasoning powder that carlos now 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.780
 He helped me do it and it was great 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.840
 you can put my liking 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.840
 a lot with garlic he put some herbs 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.690
 please 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.530
 when I want to go to a teaspoon and 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.230
 We 're going to try you, I think with 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.069
 that teaspoon is more than enough 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.900
 let me move you before you finish 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.840
 I imagine that this is going to give you a lot of flavor 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.810
 we will highlight it to match 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.810
 now we add what do you think about the cheese 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.819
 I chose from your yellow can be another 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.819
 type of cheese that is 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.610
 It draws my attention to the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.120
 clear if they have children also fun 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.970
 if that father in sight is what 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.330
 we always say that it is also art that 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.100
 the food also has to be pretty 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.750
 nice and other first usually 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.850
 by the sight I do not go to the fresh one and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.620
 stomach, well, I did not put all the 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.110
