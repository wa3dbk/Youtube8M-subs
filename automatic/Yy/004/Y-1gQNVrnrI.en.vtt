in<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.500> tutorial<00:00:01.770> you<00:00:02.370> will<00:00:02.399> learn<00:00:02.520> how<00:00:02.909> to

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
in this tutorial you will learn how to

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.190 
in this tutorial you will learn how to
morph<00:00:04.020> text<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.770> Adobe<00:00:04.890> Flash<00:00:05.779> CSS<00:00:06.779> in

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
morph text in Adobe Flash CSS in

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.759 
morph text in Adobe Flash CSS in
previous<00:00:07.799> tutorials<00:00:08.280> we<00:00:08.400> looked<00:00:08.580> at<00:00:08.760> how<00:00:09.030> to

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
previous tutorials we looked at how to

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.999 
previous tutorials we looked at how to
move<00:00:10.769> objects<00:00:11.250> around<00:00:11.450> using<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:13.009> motion

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
move objects around using the motion

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.129 
move objects around using the motion
tweening<00:00:14.250> effect<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.570> also<00:00:15.719> looked<00:00:16.049> at

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
tweening effect and we also looked at

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.429 
tweening effect and we also looked at
how<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.460> morph<00:00:17.460> objects<00:00:18.180> using<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.199> shape

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
how to morph objects using the shape

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.429 
how to morph objects using the shape
tween<00:00:20.340> tool<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.210> changing<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:21.960> object

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
tween tool so it was changing one object

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.800 
tween tool so it was changing one object
and<00:00:22.710> its<00:00:22.920> properties<00:00:23.310> into<00:00:24.090> something<00:00:24.600> else

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and its properties into something else

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.099 
and its properties into something else
so<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.439> example<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.980> square<00:00:26.340> into<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.300> circle

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
so for example a square into a circle

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
so for example a square into a circle
and<00:00:28.199> changing<00:00:28.830> its<00:00:28.949> color<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.310> size<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and changing its color in size at the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.630 
and changing its color in size at the
same<00:00:30.000> time<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.380> morph<00:00:31.920> text<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
same time but to morph text as a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.000 
same time but to morph text as a
slightly<00:00:32.969> different<00:00:33.210> process<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.710> first

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
slightly different process so the first

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.700 
slightly different process so the first
thing<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.309> we'll<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.530> we've<00:00:37.530> already

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
thing that we'll do is we've already

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.479 
thing that we'll do is we've already
created<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.370> new<00:00:38.750> file<00:00:39.750> here

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
created a new file here

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.750 
created a new file here
just<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.640> blank<00:00:41.899> empty<00:00:43.309> ActionScript<00:00:44.309> 3<00:00:44.460> file

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
just a blank empty ActionScript 3 file

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.270 
just a blank empty ActionScript 3 file
and<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.559> next<00:00:46.800> thing<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.100> need<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and then the next thing that we need to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
and then the next thing that we need to
do<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.940> create<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.660> text<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
do is to create the text that we want to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.700 
do is to create the text that we want to
more<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.539> first<00:00:51.780> piece<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.140> text<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
more from so our first piece of text and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.459 
more from so our first piece of text and
then<00:00:53.370> later<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.090> we'll<00:00:54.300> create<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> text<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
then later on we'll create the text and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
then later on we'll create the text and
walking<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.550> second<00:00:56.879> piece<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.239> text<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
walking into the second piece of text so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.420 
walking into the second piece of text so
to<00:00:58.350> start<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.890> grab<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.789> text<00:01:00.510> tool<00:01:00.719> from

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
to start with grab the text tool from

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
to start with grab the text tool from
the<00:01:02.430> toolbar<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> pick<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> color

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the toolbar and we can pick the color

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.770 
the toolbar and we can pick the color
here<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:08.270> I'll<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.330> leave<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
here that we want I'll just leave it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
here that we want I'll just leave it
with<00:01:09.900> blue<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> moment<00:01:11.360> we<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.510> change

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
with blue at the moment we can change

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
with blue at the moment we can change
the<00:01:12.900> size<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.380> well<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.280> font<00:01:15.030> style<00:01:19.580> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the size as well and the font style so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
the size as well and the font style so
I'll<00:01:20.700> select<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> text<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:24.600> make

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
I'll select all of that text just make

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.800 
I'll select all of that text just make
it<00:01:25.020> simple<00:01:27.439> one<00:01:28.439> star<00:01:29.270> might<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> size<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it simple one star might make the size a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.940 
it simple one star might make the size a
little<00:01:31.500> bit<00:01:31.740> smaller<00:01:33.079> there<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.350> okay<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
little bit smaller there we go okay so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.140 
little bit smaller there we go okay so
grab<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> selection<00:01:35.909> tool<00:01:37.040> drag<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.310> text

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
grab the selection tool drag that text

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.770 
grab the selection tool drag that text
just<00:01:39.560> put<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.650> into<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> center<00:01:41.720> okay<00:01:42.720> so

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
just put it into the center okay so

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.249 
just put it into the center okay so
we've<00:01:43.350> made<00:01:43.880> our<00:01:44.880> first<00:01:45.180> piece<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.720> text<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
we've made our first piece of text and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
we've made our first piece of text and
that's<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.799> simple<00:01:47.159> hello<00:01:47.430> message<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that's just a simple hello message and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
that's just a simple hello message and
then<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.420> want<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.689> morph<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:49.229> another

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
then we want to morph it into another

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
then we want to morph it into another
piece<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.250> text<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.579> says<00:01:50.790> goodbye<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.570> it'll

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
piece of text that says goodbye so it'll

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.569 
piece of text that says goodbye so it'll
gradually<00:01:51.920> morph<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.259> okay<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.579> now

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
gradually morph into that okay so now

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.190 
gradually morph into that okay so now
that<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.149> piece<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> text<00:01:57.869> we

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that we have this piece of text we

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.270 
that we have this piece of text we
actually<00:01:58.680> need<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.180> make<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.360> into<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.280> merge

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
actually need to make it into a merge

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
actually need to make it into a merge
shape

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
shape

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.609 
shape
and<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.039> we<00:02:05.609> need<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.049> right<00:02:07.049> click<00:02:07.500> on

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
and to do that we need to right click on

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.589 
and to do that we need to right click on
it<00:02:07.799> click<00:02:09.649> on<00:02:10.649> break<00:02:10.890> apart<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:12.300> what<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it click on break apart and what that

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.080 
it click on break apart and what that
does<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:13.590> breaks<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.790> word

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
does is it actually breaks this word

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.860 
does is it actually breaks this word
apart<00:02:15.540> into<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.230> individual<00:02:16.800> letters<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:18.269> we

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
apart into the individual letters but we

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.809 
apart into the individual letters but we
can't<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.560> stop<00:02:19.769> there<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.129> need<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.459> right

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
can't just stop there we need to right

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.160 
can't just stop there we need to right
click<00:02:21.150> again<00:02:21.799> second<00:02:22.799> time<00:02:23.690> click<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.840> break

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
click again second time click on break

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.930 
click again second time click on break
apart<00:02:25.530> again<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.510> see<00:02:27.840> it's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
apart again and now you can see it's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.699 
apart again and now you can see it's
actually<00:02:29.940> converted<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.019> into<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.319> merged

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
actually converted it into a merged

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.570 
actually converted it into a merged
shape<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.290> made<00:02:34.290> into<00:02:34.620> something<00:02:35.430> that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
shape and it's made into something that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.180 
shape and it's made into something that
will<00:02:35.970> allow<00:02:36.269> us<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.660> apply<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.140> shape<00:02:37.440> tween<00:02:37.650> so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
will allow us to apply a shape tween so

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.400 
will allow us to apply a shape tween so
we<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.459> actually<00:02:38.579> morph<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.329> text<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.290> now

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
we can actually morph the text so now

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.620 
we can actually morph the text so now
that's<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.739> merged<00:02:40.950> shape<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.180> we've<00:02:42.360> got<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
that's a merged shape and we've got the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.130 
that's a merged shape and we've got the
first<00:02:42.840> piece<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> text<00:02:43.709> there<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.910> now<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:45.810> can

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
first piece of text there and now we can

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.759 
first piece of text there and now we can
just<00:02:46.430> insert<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.640> new<00:02:47.819> blank<00:02:48.120> keyframe<00:02:48.769> further

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
just insert a new blank keyframe further

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.280 
just insert a new blank keyframe further
along<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.129> timeline<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.790> put<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.810> our<00:02:51.930> second

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
along the timeline and put in our second

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.479 
along the timeline and put in our second
piece<00:02:52.379> of<00:02:52.560> text<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.090> we'll<00:02:54.569> go<00:02:55.489> put

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
piece of text so to do that we'll go put

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.920 
piece of text so to do that we'll go put
this<00:02:56.549> example<00:02:57.030> we'll<00:02:57.239> move<00:02:57.420> up<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.690> timeline

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
this example we'll move up the timeline

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.190 
this example we'll move up the timeline
about<00:02:58.319> 50<00:02:58.680> frames<00:02:59.269> it's<00:03:00.269> on<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> timeline<00:03:00.959> or

about 50 frames it's on the timeline or

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.160

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.870 
could just drag that into the center and
kind<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.150> guess<00:03:30.540> where<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.650> needs<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.950> go<00:03:32.069> but

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
kind of guess where it needs to go but

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.479 
kind of guess where it needs to go but

instead of doing that we can click on a

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.020 
instead of doing that we can click on a
tool<00:03:35.849> down<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.329> bottom<00:03:37.319> which<00:03:37.609> is<00:03:38.609> called<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
tool down the bottom which is called the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.640 
tool down the bottom which is called the
onion<00:03:39.329> skin<00:03:39.630> tool<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.109> if<00:03:40.169> we<00:03:40.260> click<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.620> that

onion skin tool so if we click on that

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.890 
onion skin tool so if we click on that
we<00:03:41.069> can<00:03:41.519> actually<00:03:41.700> see<00:03:42.180> what<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
we can actually see what is on the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.520 
we can actually see what is on the
previous<00:03:43.349> keyframe<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.099> line<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:44.970> up<00:03:48.530> just

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
previous keyframe and line it up just

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.559 
previous keyframe and line it up just
drag<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.010> text<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.849> it's<00:03:50.970> in<00:03:51.239> line<00:03:51.540> with

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
drag the text so that it's in line with

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.740 
drag the text so that it's in line with
that<00:03:52.880> previous<00:03:53.880> piece<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.450> text<00:03:56.419> then<00:03:57.419> click

on<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.230> onion<00:03:58.500> skin<00:03:58.769> tool<00:03:58.980> again<00:03:59.310> to<00:04:01.160> take

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
on the onion skin tool again to take

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.830 
on the onion skin tool again to take
that<00:04:02.340> away<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:03.000> we<00:04:03.120> can<00:04:03.239> no<00:04:03.389> longer<00:04:03.419> see<00:04:03.810> the

that away so we can no longer see the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.220 
that away so we can no longer see the
previous<00:04:04.260> keyframe<00:04:04.709> now<00:04:05.700> again<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.630> need<00:04:06.810> to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
previous keyframe now again we need to

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.009 
previous keyframe now again we need to
turn<00:04:08.099> this<00:04:08.250> into<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.609> merge<00:04:08.880> shape<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:09.599> we<00:04:09.750> right

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
turn this into a merge shape so we right

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.440 
turn this into a merge shape so we right
click<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.590> piece<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:10.980> text<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:12.120> click<00:04:12.329> on

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
and then we click on break apart again

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.670 
and then we click on break apart again
and<00:04:19.739> that's<00:04:19.920> converted<00:04:20.370> into<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.760> merge<00:04:21.060> shape

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
and that's converted into a merge shape

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.240
