00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 very good everyone welcome again 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.480
 to destin and in this video we will see a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.630
 new zone to falsify weapons and equipment 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.950
 so much of blue legend in green in short what 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 that forms a new area for the team 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.420
 the enemies come out pretty fast that 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 is what one really looks for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.570
 because what you can fall can 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.199
 fall the same here as on the moon in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.910
 Mars 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.619
 where they do what they need that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.650
 go out enemies fast to kill and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.199
 here they come out pretty fast too what 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 what we have to catch is the earth 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.010
 patrol and it's right at the beginning nothing 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.100
 more leave we throw here for the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.500
 right and is in this kind of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.450
 tiny buildings worth here behind 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 We clean the areas are here the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 enemy we do not have to clean it whole 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 what follows this this area has a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.430
 little thing that will explain to you at the end of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 video that we have to take into account 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.809
 because we can have the best time once 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.480
 nothing less can happen but good 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 then we will see it from here a 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.690
 ship that ship should not be thrown 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.030
 account those areas there do not have to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.259
 realize it and what we would have 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.729
 to clean the areas that we have 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.290
 cleaned that area that of the ship that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 we are seeing not this area that we have 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.360
 cleared from here and the four enemies 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.479
 there it back here that yes it 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.289
 we must eliminate if not not leave us 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.270
 the enemies 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.369
 we eliminate already they begin to leave different 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.869
 others for once we eliminate these 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.289
 enemies we go down here for these 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.659
 stairs to the bottom goes down this hall 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.429
 we come here we put here we have 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.960
 to download it with basses and get here in 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.819
 the ending for the door we look 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.470
 tickets and when the red light comes out of 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.330
 above, not the one on the right but the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.520
 up is that the enemies have come out 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.110
 we have to pull up and they are already 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 the enemies here available come out of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.390
 there from behind the stairs is worth 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.619
 we just have to finish them 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.200
 It's worth once we finish with them 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.940
 ok we go down again down to the same 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.050
 site looking for the door so that 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.490
 to work 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.740
 for there and when it comes to red light 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.010
 we see it there we go up it will take 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.160
 23 second quarter two or more and they come back to 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.160
 get out the enemies come out pretty fast 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.480
 It is one thing that finally after 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.880
 update that they put in the cave 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.610
 there are quite a lot there will be many areas 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.770
 let the enemies come out like that but it 's like that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.110
 aesthetic is super close are the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.270
 enemies says if you get out very fast and 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.270
 I already say the same thing can come out here in 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.430
 the moon because the one that you fall team 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.200
 that does not change it they change where the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.490
 enemies come out slower or change the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.430
 sonar enemies 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.290
 and others are worth we see that here 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.990
 come out again the enemies up here 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.270
 and nothing else we have to eliminate it 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.640
 go down and go up and go up well when 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.900
 listen and the noise is the thing that 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.870
 I wanted to comment when I heard this 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.280
 noise 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.870
 of bombing and others out is that it 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.170
 Approaching a ship, we will have to 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.480
 go up here is worth arribita and kill 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.129
 again to the four enemies because 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.829
 they have left have gone back out there 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.349
 of the background is worth this comes out again 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.359
 but you can not even leave that you are 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.879
 down there is not there listening to the ship not 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.349
 the enemies come out and they have returned 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.480
 to appear the enemies made from 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.069
 above it is rare that they appear but good 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.900
 with what he said so that at least 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.549
 You know, it's worth as I say, this is not, we see 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.169
 here they see it come out again and they come back to 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:23.109
 leave if we go always I is not an area 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:25.859
 that have been here for a long time 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.799
 have tried two or three times if 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.049
 ten minutes or fifteen all the more and not 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.819
 I did not want to show all the loot that comes out 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.159
 or nothing is worth simply show in the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.390
 formula that is in the area also and 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.220
 how to do it 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.010
 and nothing boy to raise level is 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.300
 pretty good to get equipment 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.970
 It is also quite well 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.580
 already the team of very high levels but 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.740
 teams of level 20 22 24 then you're going to 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.750
 drop good things and nothing this has been 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.720
 I hope you liked it, I hope 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.670
 that will serve you in your search and we 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.670
 we see in the next see you later
