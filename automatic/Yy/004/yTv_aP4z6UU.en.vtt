00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello guys with this video is not analyze with you happened in the city 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.130
 of the 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.169
 to do this 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.960
 proactive of the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.960
 1 analogue to that logical port 0re 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.380
 graffer socks 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.530
 I can see the behavior 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.010
 i this tension 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.020
 the report 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.150
 all 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.050
 here is the code you need to contact 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 you have furnished 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.990
 and frankly I'm in 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.530
 here I send 5 chieri 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.120
 the 5 variables that can be printed 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 the use is 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 that basically 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.130
 here is arduino power supply graffer which is representing the voltage 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.640
 produced ours 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.290
 sensacell zero renato 5 times 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 those are more or less zero. saints 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 face does not pocket a simple lighter 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.830
 how it behaves is ours 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.660
 as you see 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.040
 a discreet 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.130
 voltage drop 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 lighter biostenol 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780
 raising wisdom have no intention I turn on 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.680
 massarosadue is producing 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.390
 but corrected 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.680
 electrician relationship to light 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.660
 that hits him alessio positioned ahead 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.319
 for you how it is 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.319
 facedakar 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:16.459
 supply 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.459
 mine is farmhouse domination 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.899
 is useful 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.629
 for passive project auctions that there is 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.219
 simplify the use of sex in movies 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.899
 or away 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.269
 in fact, applying the ex-bed position 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.539
 torrent cements 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.539
 it will be possible 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.059
 is a ratio distance value 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.059
 reflected light 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.289
 if concert 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.749
 this kind of turns 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.069
 very useful experimentation because 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.019
 second use clubs 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.429
 in general 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:01.769
 electronic components 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.169
 for a different use than what they are for 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.139
 it helps us to have a perfect little idiot in Greece and lateral thinking and win 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.109
 sharpen our knowledge of 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.160
 I hope this cue has been useful 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.929
 in the next weeks 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.929
 live globe paestum 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.569
 one of which is the development of a solar panel 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:30.919
 to evaluate 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.919
 cityville potential buildings enzo 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.959
 he is all about a sensor 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 next dates 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.169
 realized 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.569
 udu l of any kind 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.009
 and of any color 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.009
 in which 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.789
 i hope chalk liked this tutorial see you the next few days
