00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.240
 Volkswagen likes to come later than others with its models 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.750
 but then tremendously 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.369
 that was in front of the gate way and for the Touran 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.939
 It has also done with the new Tiguan 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.669
 the production does not go down 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.230
 Customers are begging move part of sporty off-road vehicle 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.170
 with its dimensions 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.790
 Tiguan had a size that is not too big and not too big 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.099
 confusing 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.380
 but he is not too low for the journey 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.949
 and for the performance 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 At the same time, the Tiguan is a beneficent form of modesty 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.700
 consume less 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.060
 lower costs and still a lot of fun 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.410
 he is not a Globetrotter but he can expect more too much forward 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.610
 just the right song i Andre is not for him 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.790
 the Tiguan for his own personality in the field 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.569
 Body is clear 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.239
 also needs to be packed quickly helps rear for an additional charge the camera 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.970
 The trunk is unfortunately not as spacious as you expect 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.979
 Under the floor, there are still no storage compartments under the spare wheel 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.820
 to the best features of the TVO 1 Johann its driving characteristics 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.220
 they are basically like that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 as we are used to from a Golf 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140
 after a short trip to the realm of slippery 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.970
 I have the impression that the Tiguan could make its way to ours 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.150
 create 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.140
 a special praise 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.730
 Earns the steering 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.890
 she works directly 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.460
 not too smooth and free of drive or road influences 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.150
 an unexpected disappointment 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.790
 prepared diesel engine 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.270
 When it comes to fuel consumption, the new machine can probably convince 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.200
 but when the turbocharger starts 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.400
 that's it 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.740
 that can only be tolerated if you are not faster than Vettel 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.730
 Kilometers per hour drives 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.710
 Conclusion 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 The VW Tiguan has a compact body 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.869
 excellent driving characteristics 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.680
 and a direct steering 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.739
 negative noticed are small trunk and loud engines 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.689
 with the Tiguan 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.049
 land on the Schlossallee with VW Porsche 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.419
 there must then have even with front-wheel drive gave the qualities 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:18.379
 to a bestseller
