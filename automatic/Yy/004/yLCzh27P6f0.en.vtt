00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
season what stood out to you I think the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.470 
season what stood out to you I think the
intriguing<00:02:16.280> thing<00:02:16.640> about<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.030> season

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
intriguing thing about this season

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.170 
intriguing thing about this season
really<00:02:17.630> was<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.170> variety<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.160> designers<00:02:19.880> but

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
really was the variety of designers but

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.670 
really was the variety of designers but
I<00:02:20.240> also<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.080> time<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.350> had

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
I also think that this time you had

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.040 
I also think that this time you had
designers<00:02:22.220> really<00:02:22.430> who<00:02:22.640> had<00:02:22.850> very<00:02:23.570> much<00:02:23.750> a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
designers really who had very much a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.570 
designers really who had very much a
specific<00:02:24.980> look<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.230> an<00:02:27.350> attitude<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.130> I

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
specific look and an attitude and I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.010 
specific look and an attitude and I
always<00:02:28.820> think<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.090> interesting<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.690> see<00:02:29.900> if

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
always think it's interesting to see if

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.010 
always think it's interesting to see if
they<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.350> translate<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.790> signature<00:02:32.390> into

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
they can translate that signature into

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.199 
they can translate that signature into
something<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.440> has<00:02:33.590> variety<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.910> know<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
something that has variety you know and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.720
