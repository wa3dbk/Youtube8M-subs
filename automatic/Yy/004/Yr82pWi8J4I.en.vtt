00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
because I asked them to but yeah so

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.080 
because I asked them to but yeah so
that's<00:02:41.290> pretty<00:02:41.440> good

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that's pretty good

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.900 
that's pretty good
got<00:02:43.930> ten<00:02:44.140> articulation<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.160> wouldn't<00:02:45.820> be

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
got ten articulation I wouldn't be

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.850 
got ten articulation I wouldn't be
concerned<00:02:46.239> about<00:02:46.420> warping<00:02:46.989> because<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.680> legs

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
concerned about warping because the legs

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.690 
concerned about warping because the legs
are<00:02:48.040> pretty<00:02:48.160> thick<00:02:49.980> pretty<00:02:50.980> good<00:02:51.220> decent

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
are pretty thick pretty good decent

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.960 
are pretty thick pretty good decent
amount<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.940> articulation<00:02:53.700> assembly<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.850> have

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
amount of articulation assembly you have

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.360 
amount of articulation assembly you have
to<00:02:55.120> put<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.600> feet<00:02:55.989> on<00:02:56.140> together<00:02:56.560> put<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.190> feet

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
to put the feet on together put the feet

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.479 
to put the feet on together put the feet
on<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:58.180> have<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.390> touch<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.630> legs<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
on you have to touch the legs to the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.650 
on you have to touch the legs to the
centerpiece<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.000> put<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.209> dome<00:03:01.420> on

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
centerpiece you have to put the dome on

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.060 
centerpiece you have to put the dome on
have<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> put<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.650> guns<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.890> little

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
have to put the guns on so it's a little

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.590 
have to put the guns on so it's a little
bit<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.400> assembly<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:06.970> it's<00:03:07.120> not<00:03:07.269> really<00:03:07.570> that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
bit of assembly but it's not really that

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.479 
bit of assembly but it's not really that
hard<00:03:07.720> another<00:03:08.560> thing<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.830> found<00:03:08.980> hard<00:03:09.250> was

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
hard another thing I found hard was

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.370 
hard another thing I found hard was
putting<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.940> dome<00:03:10.120> onto<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.630> like<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.989> torso

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
putting the dome onto the like the torso

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.979 
putting the dome onto the like the torso
piece<00:03:11.590> kind<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.070> but<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> eventually<00:03:13.480> got<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.870> to

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
piece kind of but I eventually got it to

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.310 
piece kind of but I eventually got it to
work<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:15.269> anyways<00:03:16.269> I'll<00:03:17.049> go<00:03:17.230> over

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
work but anyways I'll go over

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.740 
work but anyways I'll go over
articulation<00:03:18.040> pretty<00:03:18.250> quick<00:03:18.459> oh<00:03:18.790> yeah<00:03:19.540> let's

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
articulation pretty quick oh yeah let's

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.009 
articulation pretty quick oh yeah let's
see<00:03:20.489> what<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:21.549> got<00:03:21.700> right<00:03:21.880> here<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.570> swivel

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
see what you got right here is a swivel

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:23.400 
see what you got right here is a swivel
joint

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
joint

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.400 
joint
well<00:03:24.400> found<00:03:25.090> I'll<00:03:25.510> find<00:03:25.780> it's<00:03:25.900> easier<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.320> do

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
well found I'll find it's easier to do

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.570 
well found I'll find it's easier to do
it<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.560> way<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:28.590> right<00:03:29.590> here<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.400> got<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
it this way but right here you got a

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.870 
it this way but right here you got a
swivel<00:03:31.090> joint<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:32.920> right<00:03:33.400> above<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.670> you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
swivel joint and then right above it you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.270 
swivel joint and then right above it you
gotta<00:03:34.920> do<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:37.390> then<00:03:37.900> right<00:03:38.620> here<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:39.160> got

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
gotta do it and then right here you got

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.840 
gotta do it and then right here you got
another<00:03:39.610> hinge<00:03:40.060> joint<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.560> right<00:03:41.829> here<00:03:42.370> you

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
another hinge joint and right here you

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.229 
another hinge joint and right here you
know<00:03:42.970> if<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.120> guys<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.420> see<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.780> yeah<00:03:45.239> there

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
know if you guys can see that yeah there
