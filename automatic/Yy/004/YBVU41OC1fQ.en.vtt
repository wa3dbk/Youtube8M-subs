some come flying out there's no gap
there<00:01:51.530> they're<00:01:52.430> offset<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:53.630> grab<00:01:53.869> their<00:01:54.049> lip

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
there they're offset to grab their lip

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.510 
there they're offset to grab their lip
on<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.469> way<00:01:54.590> out<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.009> know<00:01:55.189> that's<00:01:55.369> why<00:01:55.490> I

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
on the way out you know that's why I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.840 
on the way out you know that's why I
look

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
look

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.210 
look
you're<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.479> good<00:01:56.720> with<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.470> round<00:01:57.740> being<00:01:57.979> offset

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
you're so good with a round being offset

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.609 
you're so good with a round being offset
because<00:01:58.790> there's<00:01:58.939> nothing<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.509> line<00:02:00.229> with

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
because there's nothing in line with

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.350 
because there's nothing in line with
that<00:02:00.799> hook<00:02:00.950> point<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.670> set<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.000> hook<00:02:02.119> and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
that hook point you set the hook and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.219 
that hook point you set the hook and
you're<00:02:02.450> going<00:02:02.570> right<00:02:02.720> into<00:02:02.960> me

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
you're going right into me

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.070 
you're going right into me
there's<00:02:03.380> nothing<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.890> way<00:02:04.040> there<00:02:05.080> that's

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
there's nothing in the way there that's

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.279 
there's nothing in the way there that's
why<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:07.239> draw<00:02:08.239> our<00:02:08.420> two<00:02:08.539> folks<00:02:08.780> just<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.050> little

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
why the draw our two folks just a little

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.510 
why the draw our two folks just a little
bit<00:02:09.380> better<00:02:09.530> than<00:02:09.860> your<00:02:09.979> standard<00:02:10.160> director

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
bit better than your standard director

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.890 
bit better than your standard director
why<00:02:10.610> get<00:02:10.819> folks<00:02:11.060> because<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.480> hook<00:02:11.600> point<00:02:11.810> is

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
why get folks because that hook point is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.320 
why get folks because that hook point is
offset<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.010> little<00:02:13.280> bit<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.880> on<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> way

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
offset just a little bit so on the way

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.390 
offset just a little bit so on the way
out<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.050> fish's<00:02:15.230> mouth<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:16.220> know<00:02:16.310> you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
out of the fish's mouth you know you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.650

livers to meet you know so hook up ratio
just<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:20.000> little<00:02:20.330> bit<00:02:20.450> better<00:02:20.630> with<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.350> hook

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
just a little bit better with this hook

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.180 
just a little bit better with this hook
that's<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.180> great<00:02:23.270> one<00:02:23.450> I'll<00:02:23.569> go<00:02:23.720> fast<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.950> go

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
that's one great one I'll go fast and go

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.210

that<00:02:40.370> angle<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.930> eye<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.850> how<00:02:44.000> you

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
that angle of the eye that's how you

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.670 
that angle of the eye that's how you
have<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.300> come<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.900> out<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.200> plastic
