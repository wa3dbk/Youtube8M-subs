00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.300 
the advantages is you know we've only
got<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.460> convince<00:05:31.200> 5%<00:05:32.200> of<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.830> rest<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.220> the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
got to convince 5% of the rest of the

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.130 
got to convince 5% of the rest of the
world<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.820> buy<00:05:33.970> a<00:05:34.000> Mac<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.570> we've<00:05:34.690> doubled<00:05:35.050> our

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
world to buy a Mac and we've doubled our

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.740 
world to buy a Mac and we've doubled our
market<00:05:35.530> share<00:05:35.740> so<00:05:36.030> clearly<00:05:37.030> these<00:05:37.360> stores

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
market share so clearly these stores

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.810 
market share so clearly these stores
we're<00:05:38.080> hoping<00:05:38.440> will<00:05:38.620> help<00:05:38.800> us<00:05:39.040> grow<00:05:39.640> our

computers we sell in our stores are to

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.540 
computers we sell in our stores are to
people<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.710> have<00:05:44.800> never<00:05:44.980> owned<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.340> Mac

extremely<00:06:23.620> successful<00:06:24.280> in<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.490> UK<00:06:24.960> and<00:06:25.960> I

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
extremely successful in the UK and I

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.770 
extremely successful in the UK and I
think<00:06:26.530> we<00:06:26.980> are<00:06:27.130> the<00:06:27.280> number<00:06:27.550> one<00:06:27.580> mp3<00:06:28.300> player

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
think we are the number one mp3 player

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.180 
think we are the number one mp3 player
in<00:06:29.080> France<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:30.130> Germany<00:06:30.400> and<00:06:30.760> many<00:06:30.970> other

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
in France and Germany and many other

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.030 
in France and Germany and many other
we<00:06:32.460> can<00:06:32.610> always<00:06:32.910> do<00:06:33.060> better<00:06:33.240> and<00:06:33.810> as<00:06:34.680> you<00:06:34.830> know

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
we can always do better and as you know

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.760 
we can always do better and as you know
we<00:06:35.310> sell<00:06:35.580> I<00:06:35.880> think<00:06:35.940> over<00:06:36.420> 40%<00:06:36.780> of<00:06:37.170> our<00:06:37.320> revenues

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
we sell I think over 40% of our revenues

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.370 
we sell I think over 40% of our revenues
come<00:06:38.100> from<00:06:38.580> international<00:06:39.450> sales<00:06:39.720> today

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
come from international sales today

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.310 
come from international sales today
so<00:06:40.800> we<00:06:41.310> could<00:06:41.460> do<00:06:41.550> better<00:06:41.730> than<00:06:42.030> that<00:06:42.570> but<00:06:43.290> I

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
so we could do better than that but I

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.750 
so we could do better than that but I
think<00:06:43.590> we're<00:06:43.710> doing<00:06:43.740> pretty<00:06:43.890> well<00:06:44.280> now

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
think we're doing pretty well now

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.340 
think we're doing pretty well now
and<00:06:45.030> in<00:06:45.150> terms<00:06:45.360> of<00:06:45.510> your<00:06:45.630> chips<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:46.020> know<00:06:46.140> you've
