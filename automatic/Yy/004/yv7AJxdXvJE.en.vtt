00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.410 
to the Amazon link below in the
description<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.460> yeah<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.940> ordered<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
description so yeah so I ordered the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.680 
description so yeah so I ordered the
sky-blue<00:00:49.079> color<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.300> there's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> darker

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
sky-blue color I think there's a darker

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.290 
sky-blue color I think there's a darker
blue<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> teal<00:00:52.680> color<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.000> ordered

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
blue and like a teal color but I ordered

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600 
blue and like a teal color but I ordered
this<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> darker<00:00:56.340> blue

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
this one and it's like a darker blue

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
this one and it's like a darker blue
then<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.180> thought<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.960> would<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.829> it's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
then I thought it would be but it's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
then I thought it would be but it's
really<00:00:59.430> cool<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:00:59.940> gonna<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.629> turn<00:01:01.079> on

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
really cool I'm gonna see if I turn on

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
really cool I'm gonna see if I turn on
this<00:01:01.379> light<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.609> give<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this light will you know give you a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
this light will you know give you a
different<00:01:03.690> view<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
different view of it so that's kind of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
different view of it so that's kind of
what<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.369> looks<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
what it looks like and then on the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.200 
what it looks like and then on the
bottom<00:01:09.830> it<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:11.130> Vince<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.010> little<00:01:14.960> feet<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
bottom it has Vince and little feet and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:25.219 
bottom it has Vince and little feet and
so<00:01:19.130> when<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.689> open<00:01:21.740> your<00:01:22.740> computer<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.229> turn

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so when you open your computer and turn

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:25.940 
so when you open your computer and turn
it<00:01:25.350> around

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it around

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
it around
you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> glowing<00:01:27.720> Apple<00:01:27.900> symbol

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you can see the glowing Apple symbol

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.190 
you can see the glowing Apple symbol
symbol<00:01:29.280> through<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> case<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> still

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
symbol through the case so it still

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.520 
symbol through the case so it still
glows<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.890> dark<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> dark<00:01:37.229> it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
glows in the dark and in the dark it's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
glows in the dark and in the dark it's
not<00:01:37.770> night<00:01:37.950> time<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> can't<00:01:38.610> completely

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
not night time so I can't completely

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.700 
not night time so I can't completely
show<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> keyboard

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
show you this but the keyboard

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.679 
show you this but the keyboard
brightness<00:01:43.710> still<00:01:44.549> shows<00:01:44.880> through<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
brightness still shows through the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.550 
brightness still shows through the
keyboard<00:01:45.869> case<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:48.299> overall<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.259> like

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
keyboard case so overall I really like

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.810 
keyboard case so overall I really like
this<00:01:49.740> case<00:01:50.420> it's<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.990> nice<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.790> a

put<00:02:28.300> on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.590> only<00:02:29.830> problem<00:02:30.190> was<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.410> top

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
put on the only problem was the top

piece<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.130> was<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> little<00:02:33.580> hard<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:34.270> find<00:02:34.510> out

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
piece it was a little hard to find out

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.320 
piece it was a little hard to find out
which<00:02:34.840> way<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.470> goes<00:02:35.709> because<00:02:36.459> there's<00:02:37.090> no

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
which way it goes because there's no

on keys and there's no special way to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.220 
on keys and there's no special way to
like<00:03:11.019> make<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:11.830> stay<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:13.360> just<00:03:13.630> stays<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:13.870> there

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
it's a hard to get used to typing with

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.100 
it's a hard to get used to typing with
this<00:03:17.400> I'm<00:03:18.400> slowly<00:03:18.760> getting<00:03:18.970> used<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.730> I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
this I'm slowly getting used to it but I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.199 
this I'm slowly getting used to it but I
really<00:03:23.110> like<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.470> they<00:03:23.560> included<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.250> it's

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
really like that they included this it's

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.020 
really like that they included this it's
a<00:03:25.269> really<00:03:25.420> great<00:03:25.690> feature<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.140> think<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:27.160> they

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
a really great feature I think and they

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.300 
a really great feature I think and they
actually<00:03:28.480> included<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.290> which<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.070> did<00:03:30.280> not

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
actually included to which I did not

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.039 
actually included to which I did not
know<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.940> did<00:03:31.120> not<00:03:31.269> say<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.690> website

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
know and it did not say on the website

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.650 
know and it did not say on the website
that<00:03:32.080> they<00:03:32.350> included<00:03:32.799> -<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.340> don't<00:03:34.209> think<00:03:34.269> this

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
that they included - I don't think this

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.120 
that they included - I don't think this
was<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:34.959> mistake<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:37.480> yeah<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.440> think<00:03:38.860> that

was a mistake but yeah so I think that

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.820 
was a mistake but yeah so I think that
was<00:03:39.250> really<00:03:39.280> awesome<00:03:39.670> -<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.150> nice<00:03:40.830> because

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
like if something happens is like if it

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.390 
like if something happens is like if it
tears<00:03:44.170> or<00:03:44.530> if<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.680> gets<00:03:44.830> really<00:03:44.980> messed<00:03:45.250> up

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
tears or if it gets really messed up

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.020 
tears or if it gets really messed up
some<00:03:45.790> reason<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.959> have<00:03:47.079> an<00:03:47.200> extra<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.030> that's

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
opening I spent about 20 dollars on all

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.840 
opening I spent about 20 dollars on all
of<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.830> in<00:04:36.400> total<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:38.440> list<00:04:38.680> price<00:04:38.980> was<00:04:39.250> $30

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
of this in total the list price was $30

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.270 
of this in total the list price was $30
and<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:41.080> price<00:04:41.320> was<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.520> 1199<00:04:43.410> but<00:04:44.410> the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
and the price was like 1199 but the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.040 
and the price was like 1199 but the
shipping<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:45.940> handling<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.510> process<00:04:46.870> of

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
shipping and handling the process of

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.370 
shipping and handling the process of
handling<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.770> was<00:04:48.490> $17.99<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.840> spent<00:04:50.260> about

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
handling it was $17.99 so I spent about

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.220 
handling it was $17.99 so I spent about
20<00:04:50.770> dollars<00:04:51.390> in<00:04:52.390> total<00:04:52.750> which<00:04:52.870> is<00:04:52.900> still

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
20 dollars in total which is still

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.290 
20 dollars in total which is still
saving<00:04:54.010> about<00:04:54.370> $10<00:04:55.180> from<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.990> list<00:04:56.170> price<00:04:56.440> but

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
saving about $10 from the list price but

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.770 
saving about $10 from the list price but
I<00:04:58.300> think<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.170> about<00:04:59.380> all<00:04:59.790> I'll<00:05:00.790> list<00:05:01.420> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
I think that is about all I'll list the
