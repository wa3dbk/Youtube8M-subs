or a special guest referee I guess I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.859 
or a special guest referee I guess I
could<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.610> put<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> special<00:01:12.299> enforce<00:01:12.659> or

could have put like a special enforce or
something<00:01:13.260> along<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.560> line<00:01:14.299> but<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> seems

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
something along that line but it seems

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
something along that line but it seems
is<00:01:16.020> almost<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:18.140> John<00:01:19.140> Cena<00:01:19.500> kind<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.890> passed

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130

depending<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.650> Cena<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> be

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
depending on if Cena was going to be

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
depending on if Cena was going to be
ready<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.020> did<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> right

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
ready and I think they did the right

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.219 
ready and I think they did the right
thing<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.880> big<00:01:39.060> question<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.780> think

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
thing here the big question is I think

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.460 
thing here the big question is I think
for<00:01:40.380> WWE<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.070> don't<00:01:41.250> want<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> kill<00:01:41.729> ryback's

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
for WWE they don't want to kill ryback's

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.999 
for WWE they don't want to kill ryback's
you<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:44.060> momentum<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.420> him<00:01:45.570> lose<00:01:46.009> but

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
you know momentum and have him lose but

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
you know momentum and have him lose but
they<00:01:47.159> also<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.729> want<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.299> him

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
they also don't want to have him

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.270 
they also don't want to have him
probably<00:01:49.200> win<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> title<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.130> they

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
probably win the title because they

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.530 
probably win the title because they

Royal<00:01:54.780> Rumble<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.470> they<00:01:55.619> built<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.070> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
Royal Rumble because they built up so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.510

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
they could give the title to Ryback and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.679 
they could give the title to Ryback and
have<00:02:05.460> them<00:02:05.549> lose<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.909> back<00:02:06.090> within<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.540> few

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
special guest referee and I definitely

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.930 
special guest referee and I definitely
think<00:02:31.530> that's<00:02:31.770> an<00:02:31.920> option<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.550> could<00:02:32.700> weigh

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
think that's an option that could weigh

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.810 
think that's an option that could weigh
into<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.420> storyline<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.010> maybe<00:02:35.400> John

into the storyline you know maybe John

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.660 
into the storyline you know maybe John
Cena<00:02:36.120> turns<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.660> Ryback<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.620> we<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.310> John

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
John Cena and Ryback go at it I think

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.150 
John Cena and Ryback go at it I think
that<00:03:10.019> would<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.290> kind<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.680> interesting<00:03:10.890> i

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
that would be kind of interesting i

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.680 
that would be kind of interesting i
don't<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:11.459> w.e<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.060> willing<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.510> that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
don't think w.e is willing to do that

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.330 
don't think w.e is willing to do that
but<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.380> definitely<00:03:13.709> think<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.160> my<00:03:14.310> opinion

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
but I definitely think in my opinion

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.130 
but I definitely think in my opinion
John<00:03:14.880> Cena<00:03:15.150> has<00:03:15.360> got<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.600> be<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> part<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.019> this

referee<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:22.230> know<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.459> w/e<00:03:23.910> really

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
referee you know I think the w/e really

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.979 
referee you know I think the w/e really
does<00:03:24.450> have<00:03:24.660> quite<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:26.209> dilemma<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.420> their<00:03:27.600> hands

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
does have quite a dilemma on their hands

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.960 
does have quite a dilemma on their hands
because<00:03:28.320> there's<00:03:28.530> no<00:03:28.620> DQ<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.310> inside<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> cage

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
because there's no DQ it's inside a cage

because there's no DQ it's inside a cage
you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.540> something<00:03:30.660> like<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.110> can't

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
you can of something like that you can't

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.620 
you can of something like that you can't
ever<00:03:31.530> count<00:03:31.799> out<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.700> can't<00:03:33.000> have<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> double
