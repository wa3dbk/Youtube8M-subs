00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
an interior exterior we were doing

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
an interior exterior we were doing
interior<00:01:34.890> no<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.000> be

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
interior no I would think it would be

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.000 
interior no I would think it would be
just<00:01:36.479> work<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.140> well<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.560> outside<00:01:37.590> as

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
just work just as well on the outside as

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.399 
just work just as well on the outside as
it<00:01:38.130> does<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> inside<00:01:38.900> we<00:01:39.900> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it does on the inside we kind of put it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
it does on the inside we kind of put it
through<00:01:40.530> its<00:01:40.590> paces<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.549> painted<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
through its paces we actually painted a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.260 
through its paces we actually painted a
bunch<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.750> rooms<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.440> we<00:01:43.970> made<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> paint

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
bunch of rooms and then we made a paint

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
bunch of rooms and then we made a paint
change<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.290> went<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.710> color<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
change so we went from one color to the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.350 
change so we went from one color to the
other<00:01:47.220> color<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.760> thought<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.060> went<00:01:48.270> really

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
other color we thought that went really

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.859 
other color we thought that went really
well

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
well

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
well
yeah<00:01:49.290> cleaning<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.830> up<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.250> yep<00:01:50.729> yeah<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
yeah cleaning it up and out yep yeah I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.670 
yeah cleaning it up and out yep yeah I
didn't<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.110> difficult<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.530> had

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
didn't think it was difficult I had

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
didn't think it was difficult I had
heard<00:01:52.920> horror<00:01:53.549> stories<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:54.030> other

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
heard horror stories from other

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.330 
heard horror stories from other
contractors<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:55.110> difficult<00:01:55.710> spray<00:01:56.010> painters

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
contractors how difficult spray painters

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
contractors how difficult spray painters
are<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.610> clean<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.390> put<00:01:57.600> away<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
are to clean up and put away and I

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.140 
are to clean up and put away and I
thought<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.560> was<00:01:58.650> really<00:01:58.950> easy<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.490> and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
thought this one was really easy so and

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.580 
thought this one was really easy so and
made<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> nice<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.020> didn't<00:02:01.350> take<00:02:01.470> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
made it nice that it didn't take that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.530 
made it nice that it didn't take that
long<00:02:01.860> yeah<00:02:02.220> what<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.369> priming<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.030> yeah

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
long yeah what about priming it yeah

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
long yeah what about priming it yeah
they<00:02:04.080> had<00:02:04.259> us<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:04.920> some<00:02:05.070> water<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.580> first

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
they had us put some water in it first

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.550 
they had us put some water in it first
some<00:02:06.030> clean<00:02:06.210> water<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.630> prime<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.439> then

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
some clean water to prime it and then

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.249 
some clean water to prime it and then
start<00:02:08.310> sucking<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.729> paint<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.269> it<00:02:09.420> was

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
start sucking up the paint and it was

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.720 
start sucking up the paint and it was
flawless<00:02:10.560> had<00:02:10.860> picked<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.549> got

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
flawless had picked it up and we got

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.849 
flawless had picked it up and we got
going<00:02:12.030> how<00:02:12.689> hard<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.049> it<00:02:13.079> to<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.499> pattern

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:13.859 
going how hard is it to get the pattern

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:14.989 
going how hard is it to get the pattern
dialed<00:02:14.219> in<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> way<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.549> know<00:02:14.669> well<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:14.969> I

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:14.999 
dialed in the way you know well like I

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.350 
dialed in the way you know well like I
said<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.269> had<00:02:15.389> that<00:02:15.540> quick<00:02:15.779> start

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
said they had that quick start

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.420 
said they had that quick start
sheet<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.170> shows<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.650> pattern<00:02:17.860> they<00:02:18.160> want

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
sheet and it shows the pattern they want

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.430 
sheet and it shows the pattern they want
right<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.120> uh<00:02:19.150> yeah<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:19.930> said<00:02:20.230> kept

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
right and uh yeah it just said kept

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
right and uh yeah it just said kept
turning<00:02:20.590> up<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.830> pressure<00:02:20.860> till<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.340> get

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
turning up the pressure till you get

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.800 
turning up the pressure till you get
this<00:02:21.610> what<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:21.910> looks<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.360> wall<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
this what it looks like on the wall and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.840 
this what it looks like on the wall and
yeah<00:02:23.800> we<00:02:23.920> didn't<00:02:24.070> have<00:02:24.160> any<00:02:24.280> problems<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.700> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
yeah we didn't have any problems in just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.190 
yeah we didn't have any problems in just
a<00:02:24.940> couple<00:02:25.180> minutes<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.660> then<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:25.900> were<00:02:26.020> away

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
a couple minutes and then we were away

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.680 
a couple minutes and then we were away
we<00:02:26.230> went<00:02:26.530> yeah<00:02:27.070> what<00:02:27.220> about<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.490> overspray<00:02:28.390> is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
we went yeah what about the overspray is

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.000 
we went yeah what about the overspray is
that<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> problem<00:02:29.170> with<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.320> pie<00:02:29.470> yeah<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.830> think

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
that a problem with the pie yeah I think

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.100 
that a problem with the pie yeah I think
with<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.790> particular<00:02:31.120> application<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.750> used

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
with the particular application we used

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.510 
with the particular application we used
it<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.380> we<00:02:32.470> were<00:02:32.590> using<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.950> primer<00:02:33.280> which

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
it and we were using a primer which

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.030 
it and we were using a primer which
tends<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> thicker<00:02:34.240> paint<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.950> we

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
tends to be a thicker paint and so we

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.260 
tends to be a thicker paint and so we
really<00:02:36.310> had<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.460> turn<00:02:36.640> up<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.850> pressure<00:02:36.880> to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
really had to turn up the pressure to

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.460 
really had to turn up the pressure to
get<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.480> pattern<00:02:37.630> they<00:02:37.900> asked<00:02:38.140> for<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
get the pattern they asked for in the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.140 
get the pattern they asked for in the
book<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.670> had<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.820> little<00:02:39.910> bit<00:02:40.060> of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
book and we had a little bit of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.460 
book and we had a little bit of
overspray<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.720> mean<00:02:40.990> we<00:02:41.110> were<00:02:41.200> getting<00:02:41.410> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
overspray I mean we were getting a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.630 
overspray I mean we were getting a
little<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.860> Machine<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> little<00:02:42.340> bit<00:02:42.580> in

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
little on the Machine a little bit in

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.060 
little on the Machine a little bit in
the<00:02:42.700> room<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.170> needed<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> wear<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.740> dust

mask because of the overspray mm-hmm but

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.840 
mask because of the overspray mm-hmm but
other<00:02:47.800> than<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:48.250> thought<00:02:48.490> I'd<00:02:48.580> do<00:02:48.670> real

enough<00:02:52.540> for<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.590> was<00:02:53.740> one<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
enough for you and that was one of the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.140 
enough for you and that was one of the
things<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.280> kind<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.550> found<00:02:54.670> out<00:02:54.880> about<00:02:54.970> it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
things we kind of found out about it

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.240 
things we kind of found out about it
that<00:02:55.270> we<00:02:55.390> wish<00:02:55.810> was<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.020> little<00:02:56.290> different<00:02:56.560> it's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
that we wish was a little different it's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.250 
that we wish was a little different it's
it's<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.640> rigid<00:02:57.880> hose<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.480> there's<00:02:58.600> no<00:02:58.750> swivels

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
it's a rigid hose and there's no swivels

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.479 
it's a rigid hose and there's no swivels
on<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.739> if<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.980> weren't<00:03:00.160> paying<00:03:00.310> attention

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
on it so if you weren't paying attention

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.860 
on it so if you weren't paying attention
what<00:03:00.790> you're<00:03:00.970> doing<00:03:01.209> if<00:03:01.360> you're<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.750> around

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
what you're doing if you're going around

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.180 
what you're doing if you're going around
the<00:03:02.050> room<00:03:02.230> next<00:03:02.470> thing<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.709> know<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.890> find<00:03:03.100> it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the room next thing you know you find it

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.130 
the room next thing you know you find it
kind<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.400> kinked<00:03:03.880> mm-hmm<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.900> you'd<00:03:05.020> have

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
kind of kinked mm-hmm so then you'd have

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.930 
kind of kinked mm-hmm so then you'd have
to<00:03:05.200> manually<00:03:05.620> take<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.130> nozzle<00:03:06.280> tip<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.790> kind

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
to manually take the nozzle tip and kind

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.270 
to manually take the nozzle tip and kind
of<00:03:07.000> unspinning<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:08.080> order<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.650> get<00:03:08.830> get<00:03:09.190> it

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
of unspinning in order to get get it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.130 
of unspinning in order to get get it
untangled<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.450> would<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.690> nice<00:03:10.810> if<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.110> had

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
untangled so it would be nice if it had

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.199 
untangled so it would be nice if it had
a<00:03:11.440> swivel<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.310> little<00:03:12.489> more<00:03:12.610> flexible<00:03:13.000> hose

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
a swivel and a little more flexible hose

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.729 
a swivel and a little more flexible hose
yeah<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.750> guess<00:03:13.989> but<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.320> meantime<00:03:14.470> you

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
yeah I guess but in the meantime you

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.290 
yeah I guess but in the meantime you
just<00:03:14.770> got<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.130> be<00:03:15.220> aware<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.670> just<00:03:15.850> do<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
just got to be aware and just do the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.640 
just got to be aware and just do the
dance<00:03:16.480> move<00:03:16.600> right<00:03:16.959> just<00:03:17.230> put<00:03:17.440> her<00:03:17.590> there

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
dance move right just put her there

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.580 
dance move right just put her there
always<00:03:18.040> correct<00:03:18.360> okay<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.110> anything<00:03:20.440> else

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
always correct okay and so anything else

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.740 
always correct okay and so anything else
about<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.860> you'd<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.100> tell<00:03:21.310> us<00:03:21.690> all<00:03:22.690> I

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
about it you'd like to tell us all I

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.330 
about it you'd like to tell us all I
thought<00:03:23.200> was<00:03:23.350> really<00:03:23.500> nice<00:03:23.680> machine<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.220> was

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
thought was really nice machine it was

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.430 
thought was really nice machine it was
really<00:03:24.549> easy<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.850> use<00:03:25.150> there<00:03:25.600> one<00:03:26.049> other<00:03:26.230> thing

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
really easy to use there one other thing

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.170 
really easy to use there one other thing
we<00:03:26.590> wish<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.920> we<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.340> pickup<00:03:27.610> tube<00:03:27.760> was<00:03:27.880> just<00:03:28.090> a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
we wish is we the pickup tube was just a

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.120 
we wish is we the pickup tube was just a
little<00:03:28.450> bit<00:03:28.570> longer<00:03:28.870> we<00:03:29.709> were<00:03:29.830> actually

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
little bit longer we were actually

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.740 
little bit longer we were actually
working<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.730> five-gallon<00:03:31.330> bucket

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
working out of a five-gallon bucket

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.370 
working out of a five-gallon bucket
right<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:34.060> reached<00:03:34.570> well<00:03:35.230> you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
right and it just reached well you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.979 
right and it just reached well you
really<00:03:35.620> had<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.070> have<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.940> unit<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
really had to have the the unit and the

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.810 
really had to have the the unit and the
bucket<00:03:38.320> right<00:03:38.470> next<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.890> each<00:03:38.950> other<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.700> get

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
bucket right next to each other to get

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.060 
bucket right next to each other to get
enough<00:03:40.060> holes<00:03:40.269> into<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.810> bucket<00:03:41.200> mm-hmm<00:03:41.890> I

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
enough holes into the bucket mm-hmm I

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.550 
enough holes into the bucket mm-hmm I
mean<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.610> was<00:03:42.730> kind<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.060> like<00:03:43.180> like<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:43.810> right

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
mean it was kind of like like this right

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.050 
mean it was kind of like like this right
so<00:03:45.010> yeah<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.400> would<00:03:45.519> have<00:03:45.549> been<00:03:45.700> nice<00:03:45.850> if<00:03:45.880> we

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
so yeah it would have been nice if we

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.229 
so yeah it would have been nice if we
had<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.180> little<00:03:46.360> more<00:03:46.480> there<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:46.860> other<00:03:47.860> than

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
had a little more there but other than

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.820 
had a little more there but other than
those<00:03:49.239> two<00:03:49.299> little<00:03:49.810> things<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.350> really<00:03:50.739> thought

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
those two little things I really thought

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.720 
those two little things I really thought
it<00:03:50.950> was<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.070> nice<00:03:51.220> unit

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
it was a nice unit

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.160 
it was a nice unit
I<00:03:51.760> didn't<00:03:52.120> she<00:03:52.209> would<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.660> recommend<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.140> a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
I didn't she would you recommend it to a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.140 
I didn't she would you recommend it to a
friend<00:03:53.230> yeah<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.100> don't<00:03:54.610> know<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:54.910> would

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
friend yeah I don't know that I would

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.640 
friend yeah I don't know that I would
tell<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.390> homeowner<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.930> buy<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.290> paint<00:03:56.440> one

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
tell a homeowner to buy it to paint one

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.080 
tell a homeowner to buy it to paint one
bedroom<00:03:57.100> but<00:03:57.280> if<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.489> were<00:03:57.610> painting<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.940> whole

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
bedroom but if you were painting a whole

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.910 
bedroom but if you were painting a whole
house<00:03:58.330> or<00:03:58.630> you're<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.840> small<00:03:59.049> contractor<00:03:59.769> I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
house or you're a small contractor I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.350 
house or you're a small contractor I
think<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.580> would<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:00.790> excellent<00:04:01.060> for<00:04:01.330> that

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
think it would be excellent for that

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.120 
think it would be excellent for that
yeah<00:04:01.959> because<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.350> seems<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.680> with<00:04:03.040> an

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
yeah because it seems that with an

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.560 
yeah because it seems that with an
airless<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.730> would<00:04:03.850> cut<00:04:04.030> down<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.360> amount

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
airless it would cut down in the amount

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.360 
airless it would cut down in the amount
of<00:04:04.630> product<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.019> use<00:04:05.230> yeah<00:04:05.620> exactly<00:04:05.860> in<00:04:06.250> fact

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
of product to use yeah exactly in fact

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.370 
of product to use yeah exactly in fact
the<00:04:06.519> application<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.120> used<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.540> what<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> did<00:04:08.260> is

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
the application I used it what I did is

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.590 
the application I used it what I did is
we<00:04:08.560> we<00:04:08.860> were<00:04:08.950> priming<00:04:09.340> upstairs<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:09.880> me<00:04:10.060> by

we we were priming upstairs just me by

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.240 
we we were priming upstairs just me by
myself<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.230> had<00:04:11.410> several<00:04:11.680> volunteers
