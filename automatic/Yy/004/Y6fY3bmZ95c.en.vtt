hey guys it's mr. bloom today we'll be

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.660 
hey guys it's mr. bloom today we'll be
taking<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.990> quick<00:00:04.290> look<00:00:04.319> at<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.859> OtterBox

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
taking a quick look at the OtterBox

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.519 
taking a quick look at the OtterBox
Commuter<00:00:05.940> Series<00:00:06.270> case<00:00:06.480> for<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.080> HTC

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
Commuter Series case for the HTC

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.120 
Commuter Series case for the HTC
Sensation<00:00:08.400> 4G<00:00:08.660> thus<00:00:09.660> otterbox<00:00:10.260> mid-range

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
Sensation 4G thus otterbox mid-range

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.730 
Sensation 4G thus otterbox mid-range
case<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> will<00:00:12.059> offer<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.690> medium<00:00:13.469> amount<00:00:13.530> of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
case so it will offer a medium amount of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.829 
case so it will offer a medium amount of
protection<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.000> still<00:00:15.299> offers<00:00:15.420> pretty

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
protection so it still offers pretty

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.840 
protection so it still offers pretty
good<00:00:15.960> protection<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> keeps<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.490> slimmer

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
good protection but it keeps a slimmer

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.340 
good protection but it keeps a slimmer
of<00:00:18.029> going<00:00:18.300> factor<00:00:18.720> than<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
of going factor than that of the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.630 
of going factor than that of the
defender<00:00:19.770> series<00:00:19.980> case<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.990> retails<00:00:22.410> for

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
defender series case so this retails for

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.740 
defender series case so this retails for
3495<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> little<00:00:24.269> bit<00:00:24.390> expensive

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
3495 so it is a little bit expensive

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
3495 so it is a little bit expensive
compared<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.500> other<00:00:25.560> cases<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.670> are

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
compared to some other cases but you are

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.160 
compared to some other cases but you are
paying<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.480> quality<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
paying for the quality and the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.830 
paying for the quality and the
protection<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:30.000> send<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> actual<00:00:30.689> case

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
protection so with send the actual case

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.420 
protection so with send the actual case
itself<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> couple<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.920> things<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.309> I

the extra plastic shell which wraps
around<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> device<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.570> offers<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
around the device and this offers the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
around the device and this offers the
actual<00:01:14.100> grip<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> device<00:01:14.880> whereas<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
actual grip on the device whereas a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.020 
actual grip on the device whereas a
silicone<00:01:16.080> after<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> shock<00:01:16.680> absorption<00:01:17.040> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
silicone after the shock absorption so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
silicone after the shock absorption so
this<00:01:18.210> has<00:01:18.420> sort<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.049> textured<00:01:19.560> backing

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
this has sort of a textured backing

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
this has sort of a textured backing
which<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.659> weird<00:01:21.900> because

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
which is a little bit weird because

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.539 
which is a little bit weird because
actually<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.710> more<00:01:22.799> slip<00:01:23.130> right<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
actually a bit more slip right in the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.010 
actually a bit more slip right in the
back<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> sensation<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
back of the sensation because the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
back of the sensation because the
sensation<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:25.710> has<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> sort<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.670> soft<00:01:26.909> touch

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
sensation back has a sort of soft touch

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.260 
sensation back has a sort of soft touch
feel<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.070> too<00:01:29.280> bad<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.790> it's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
feel on it so it's not too bad but it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730 
feel on it so it's not too bad but it's
just<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:30.659> bit<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:30.930> slippery<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
just a little bit more slippery and you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.819 
just a little bit more slippery and you
can<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> cutouts<00:01:32.520> around<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.829> so

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
can see all the cutouts around here so

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.170 
can see all the cutouts around here so
it's<00:01:35.009> pop<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> device<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:35.880> we'll

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it's pop this on the device and we'll

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
it's pop this on the device and we'll
see<00:01:36.329> exactly<00:01:36.570> how<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.990> fits<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.500> i<00:01:37.530> want<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
see exactly how it fits not i want to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
see exactly how it fits not i want to
mention<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> full<00:01:39.360> review

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
mention that this is not a full review

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.870

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and you can see this way you're left

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.359 
and you can see this way you're left
with<00:02:03.240> these<00:02:04.170> screen<00:02:04.439> protectors<00:02:04.469> actually<00:02:05.219> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
with these screen protectors actually on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.730 
with these screen protectors actually on
the<00:02:05.640> actual<00:02:06.299> phone<00:02:06.450> itself<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the actual phone itself and this is the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.139 
the actual phone itself and this is the
highest<00:02:07.950> quality<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
highest quality as you can see there is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.600 
highest quality as you can see there is
some<00:02:09.390> bubbling<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> side

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
some bubbling around the side

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.670 
some bubbling around the side
and<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.360> actually<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.720> square<00:02:12.110> piece<00:02:12.380> that

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and it's actually a square piece that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.260 
and it's actually a square piece that
just<00:02:12.980> covers<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.370> actual<00:02:13.730> screen<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.210> it

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
just covers the actual screen so it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.880 
just covers the actual screen so it
isn't<00:02:14.480> covering<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.780> capacitive<00:02:15.290> buttons<00:02:15.320> at

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
isn't covering the capacitive buttons at

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.270 
isn't covering the capacitive buttons at
the<00:02:15.920> bottom<00:02:16.310> or<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.910> top<00:02:17.120> at<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:19.160> if<00:02:19.220> you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
take a look at the case itself you can

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.390 
take a look at the case itself you can
see<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.870> cutouts<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.470> back<00:02:21.680> or<00:02:21.890> spot<00:02:22.220> on

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the most cancellation microphone is

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.030 
the most cancellation microphone is
perfectly<00:02:25.820> cut<00:02:26.480> out<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:27.290> can<00:02:27.470> see<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.800> camera

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
perfectly cut out you can see the camera

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.610 
perfectly cut out you can see the camera
and<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.550> dual<00:02:28.730> LED<00:02:28.910> flash<00:02:29.500> speaker<00:02:30.500> works

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and the dual LED flash speaker works

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.310 
and the dual LED flash speaker works
nicely<00:02:31.180> at<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.360> bottom<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.080> main

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
nicely at the bottom you have the main

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.740 
nicely at the bottom you have the main
microphone<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:35.120> can<00:02:35.270> see<00:02:35.390> there's<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> nice

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
microphone you can see there's a nice

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.480 
microphone you can see there's a nice

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
lay on the table design all around here

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.040 
lay on the table design all around here
which<00:02:37.820> will<00:02:37.940> provide<00:02:38.209> some<00:02:38.450> pretty<00:02:38.930> good

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
which will provide some pretty good

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.330 
which will provide some pretty good
protection<00:02:39.380> if<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.709> were<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.920> drop<00:02:40.100> this

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
protection if you were to drop this

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.270 
protection if you were to drop this
screen<00:02:40.670> side<00:02:40.910> down<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.950> overall<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.070> case

screen side down and overall the case

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.090 
screen side down and overall the case
itself<00:02:43.640> feels<00:02:43.910> very<00:02:44.390> very<00:02:44.750> solid<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.800> does

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
itself feels very very solid so it does

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.970 
itself feels very very solid so it does
seem<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.580> one<00:02:46.850> full<00:02:47.180> piece<00:02:47.620> now<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.830> see

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
seem like one full piece now you can see

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.710 
seem like one full piece now you can see
the<00:02:49.100> port<00:02:49.370> covers<00:02:49.670> right<00:02:49.820> around<00:02:50.000> here<00:02:50.239> they

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
the port covers right around here they

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.650 
the port covers right around here they
actually<00:02:51.080> dig<00:02:51.500> into<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.160> actual<00:02:52.520> button<00:02:53.000> so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
actually dig into the actual button so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.630 
actually dig into the actual button so
it's<00:02:53.780> nice<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.140> flush<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.560> there<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:55.310> have<00:02:55.489> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
it's nice and flush in there you have to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.250 
it's nice and flush in there you have to
worry<00:02:55.820> about<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.030> covering<00:02:56.600> getting<00:02:56.900> wet<00:02:57.110> or

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
worry about that covering getting wet or

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.550 
worry about that covering getting wet or
anything<00:02:58.600> same<00:02:59.600> thing<00:02:59.840> goes<00:02:59.870> for<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.350> side

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
anything same thing goes for the side

anything same thing goes for the side
right<00:03:00.770> here<00:03:01.010> or<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.820> can<00:03:01.850> see<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.420> actual

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
right here or you can see the actual

micro USB charger this one's a little

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.220 
micro USB charger this one's a little
bit<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.550> get<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.480> was<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.690> little<00:03:05.870> bit<00:03:05.989> harder

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
bit to get this was a little bit harder

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.390 
bit to get this was a little bit harder
to<00:03:06.260> get<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.739> because<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.310> bit

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.520 
to get just because it's a little bit
more<00:03:07.550> deep<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:07.970> there<00:03:08.180> but<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.170> still<00:03:09.350> covers

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
more deep in there but it still covers

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.479 
more deep in there but it still covers
it<00:03:09.709> nicely<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:11.270> is<00:03:11.360> pretty<00:03:11.600> flush<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.400> in

it nicely and it is pretty flush so in

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.070 
it nicely and it is pretty flush so in

that<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:31.880> was<00:03:32.060> mentioning<00:03:32.239> this<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:33.049> actually

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
that I was mentioning this is actually

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.170 
that I was mentioning this is actually
pretty<00:03:33.530> accessible<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.310> if<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.850> were<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:34.970> plug

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
pretty accessible so if you were to plug

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.370 
pretty accessible so if you were to plug
in<00:03:35.299> some<00:03:35.390> headphones<00:03:35.600> you'd<00:03:35.959> have<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.200> worry

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
in some headphones you'd have to worry

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.890 
in some headphones you'd have to worry
about<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:36.739> not<00:03:37.130> fitting<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:38.540> leave<00:03:38.720> power

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
about this not fitting and leave power

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.960 
about this not fitting and leave power
button<00:03:39.260> is<00:03:39.290> actually<00:03:39.709> much<00:03:40.190> more<00:03:40.459> squishier

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
button is actually much more squishier

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.600 
button is actually much more squishier
than the<00:03:41.209> actual<00:03:41.360> volume<00:03:42.019> rocker<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.580> is

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
than the actual volume rocker so this is

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.780 
than the actual volume rocker so this is
a<00:03:43.790> little<00:03:43.970> bit<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.650> concern<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.709> mine<00:03:46.070> just

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
a little bit of a concern of mine just

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.949 
a little bit of a concern of mine just
because<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.120> don't<00:03:47.180> really<00:03:47.330> feel<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.720> button

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
because you don't really feel the button

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.840 
because you don't really feel the button
you<00:03:48.049> just<00:03:48.080> feel<00:03:48.470> you're<00:03:49.160> pressing<00:03:49.430> something

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
you just feel you're pressing something

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.380 
you just feel you're pressing something
squishy<00:03:50.120> down<00:03:51.489> like<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.580> said<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.880> back<00:03:53.030> has

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
squishy down like I said the back has

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.770 
squishy down like I said the back has
that<00:03:53.600> sort<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.900> textured<00:03:54.380> material<00:03:54.950> which<00:03:55.130> is

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
that sort of textured material which is

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.600 
that sort of textured material which is
not<00:03:56.780> slippery<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.799> is<00:03:57.890> more<00:03:58.130> slippery

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
not slippery but it is more slippery

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.060 
not slippery but it is more slippery
than<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.970> soft<00:03:59.269> touch<00:03:59.510> finish<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.320> while<00:04:00.920> this

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
than a soft touch finish so while this

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.800 
than a soft touch finish so while this
case<00:04:01.310> will<00:04:01.519> be<00:04:01.640> adding<00:04:01.940> some<00:04:01.970> more<00:04:02.209> protection

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
case will be adding some more protection

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.620 
case will be adding some more protection
from<00:04:03.080> drops<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.680> falls<00:04:03.890> i<00:04:04.130> do<00:04:04.190> feel<00:04:04.850> as<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.150> i'm

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
from drops and falls i do feel as if i'm

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.330 
from drops and falls i do feel as if i'm
more<00:04:05.840> prone<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.170> drop<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.709> just<00:04:06.950> because<00:04:07.250> this

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
more prone to drop it just because this

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.690 
more prone to drop it just because this
is<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.820> little<00:04:08.150> bit<00:04:08.269> more<00:04:08.420> slippery<00:04:08.780> than<00:04:09.019> usual

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
is a little bit more slippery than usual

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.190 
is a little bit more slippery than usual
but<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.820> definitely<00:04:10.970> does<00:04:11.329> feel<00:04:11.360> like<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.900> very

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
but it definitely does feel like a very

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.440 
but it definitely does feel like a very
solid<00:04:12.680> case<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.220> very<00:04:13.430> robust<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.269> don't

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
solid case and very robust so you don't

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.910 
solid case and very robust so you don't
have<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.630> worry<00:04:14.810> about<00:04:14.959> your<00:04:15.170> phone<00:04:15.380> breaking
