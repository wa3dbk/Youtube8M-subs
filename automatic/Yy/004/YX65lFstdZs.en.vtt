00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 yes 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.760
 hi hello skeleton ni wings as they are 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.030
 well today I come giving war with a 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.100
 new manicure so you are ready 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.779
 you have prepared the pipe but not you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 Do not worry, it 's a joke, no need to take 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.710
 notes with this manicure but still 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.509
 I'm going to give you some tips so that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.689
 they are better put and lasts a 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.490
 little bit more we start the manicure without 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.510
 forget to put a base to avoid 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.510
 aggression in the nail 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.460
 here are the words I'm going to use 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 the manicure this mark is the first time 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.200
 that I use it and at first sight the colors 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 have taken more than the account to draw 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.660
 but it has a finish like plasticized 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.660
 what I liked 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.990
 I bought these stickers in the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.990
 last fairs of the beauty of Granada 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.670
 the lives of some distance and I threw 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.080
 like crazy for them 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.400
 Too bad there were not the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.910
 of the wines of the risks because 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.770
 sure lives here some speed to 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.540
 the time to put them the first thing that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.550
 we should do is check and measure the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.220
 size of the stickers with our 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.320
 we cut the nails to our measure 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.150
 taste and we place them with care 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.310
 considering that we have to 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.290
 press from the center towards the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.619
 contribution of exteriors avoiding that 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.479
 form wrinkles to press we can 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.820
 help us with a cotton soaked in 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.090
 stickers and with a pattern on the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.090
 stickers 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.340
 to remove enciso we can use scissors 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.720
 a cuticle pusher or our 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.110
 own fingers doing a little bit of 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 Pressure 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.160
 when removing the sticker that 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 over the tips the best way to 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.780
 do it with a lime and ojito the lime 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.020
 it must always be in position 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 perpendicular to the shape of our nail 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.289
 we will thus avoid my hand in war and 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.479
 spoil the way we have given 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.250
 we apply everything by putting special 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.439
 attention to the edges and protecting 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.599
 the tips this is the only way to 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.079
 that this type of manicure can not hold more 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.079
 weather 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.810
 and he was ready for envy have 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.200
 to tell me if there was ever 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.390
 used lime water and stickers 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.920
 stickers are a sack days and we can 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.370
 get out of trouble from time to time 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.260
 because they are easy to put on and fast and 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.330
 I can only invite you to share 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.569
 your manicures with me and wish you 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.140
 pass and a good day goodbye 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.140
 yes
