00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 And how are you today, I'll talk 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.700
 which is better to write by hand or direct 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.700
 on the computer 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.660
 I think it 's so everyone does what 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.480
 I do not know 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.460
 If you're the guy who likes to write in 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.190
 your pad first and then go through 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.320
 computer because it is already peace or 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.560
 to go to the computer and give you 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.380
 one edited you will have a second 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.030
 Good text version does but I think 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.100
 It's cool to write on paper it seems 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.860
 reading is another may be a new 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:38.180
 So way you read the text it seems 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.000
 that 's him, it's another distance that is not 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.950
 that text that rests one day is 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.720
 a text on paper that sometimes you do not 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.790
 recognize but its letter seems that it is 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.190
 of another person then you see with others 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.660
 eyes I know there's end but nobody knows 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.750
 that at some point it will have that 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.030
 entered and if you prefer to use a 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.850
 computer beauty work less ne More 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.180
 the things I still write in up to one 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.360
 dock in are ideal for example you 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.330
 can see the ideas of the idea in a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.670
 corner I already gave this tip here and 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.680
 jotting down as soon as you have an idea is a 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.110
 text the idea of your book idea of â€‹â€‹that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.479
 music is composing is always annotating 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.049
 I'm not a brat in your notepad. 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.060
 that is in the purse or pocket and then ok 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.470

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.220

 internet and you can access everything 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.560
 I have even written any version to 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.659
 first time writing in the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.070
 white screen on a white sheet 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.020
 but I do not think so there is a 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.930
 The better way, each one chooses his 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.420
 ride when I started to study 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.310
