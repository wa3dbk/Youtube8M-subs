00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.530 

I'm<00:00:42.160> going<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.310> do<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.460> palm<00:00:42.760> mute<00:00:43.090> which<00:00:43.390> is

I'm going to do a palm mute which is

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.480 
I'm going to do a palm mute which is
basically<00:00:43.870> where<00:00:44.050> you<00:00:44.170> take<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:45.280> heel<00:00:45.460> of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
basically where you take the heel of

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.900 
basically where you take the heel of
your<00:00:45.640> hand<00:00:46.080> place<00:00:47.080> it<00:00:47.110> right<00:00:47.650> here<00:00:48.160> along<00:00:48.820> the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
your hand place it right here along the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.910 
your hand place it right here along the
bridge<00:00:49.090> just<00:00:49.570> so<00:00:49.660> you're<00:00:49.780> sort<00:00:50.410> of<00:00:50.530> muting<00:00:50.890> the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
bridge just so you're sort of muting the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.150 
bridge just so you're sort of muting the
strings<00:00:51.720> but<00:00:52.720> they<00:00:52.900> still<00:00:53.110> play<00:00:53.380> what<00:00:53.950> it<00:00:54.040> does

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
strings but they still play what it does

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.400 
strings but they still play what it does
is<00:00:54.310> it<00:00:54.340> just<00:00:54.550> tightens<00:00:54.880> everything<00:00:55.000> up<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:56.320> if

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
is it just tightens everything up so if

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.750 
is it just tightens everything up so if
you<00:00:56.530> keep<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.770> like<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:56.920> as<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.400> pick<00:00:57.640> you

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.380

you

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.359 

and<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:43.210> course<00:01:43.450> for<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:43.720> song<00:01:44.009> starting<00:01:45.009> on

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.950 

three<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.579> five<00:01:48.790> which<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.299> basically<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.720> C

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
three and five which is basically a C

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.640 
three and five which is basically a C
chord<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:51.250> goes<00:01:51.729> like<00:01:51.909> this

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.749 

it<00:01:55.160> was<00:01:55.310> quite<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.550> stretch<00:01:55.970> as<00:01:56.480> you<00:01:56.600> can<00:01:56.720> see

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
it was quite a stretch as you can see

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.370 
it was quite a stretch as you can see
and<00:01:59.759> then<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> call<00:02:00.659> out<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.200> actually

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and then what I call out it's actually

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.309 
and then what I call out it's actually
like<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:02.090> d7<00:02:03.200> brought<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> fifth<00:02:04.649> string

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
like a d7 brought up to the fifth string

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.240 
like a d7 brought up to the fifth string
so

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.340 

then<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.580> same<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.900> only

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
then you do the same thing is this only

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:28.820 
then you do the same thing is this only
what<00:02:13.530> bring<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.520> down<00:02:14.730> one<00:02:15.270> string<00:02:18.050> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.450 

and<00:02:30.120> that's<00:02:31.120> pretty<00:02:31.240> much<00:02:31.360> it
