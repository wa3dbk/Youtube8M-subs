00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.889
 a pleasure that everyone knows 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.480
 but it is always dragging on the product that we eat 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.270
 to help us discover all that lies behind this product 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.370
 magical chocolate takes us behind the scenes of the four artisans 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.620
 chocolatiers Paris is Jean-Charles Rochon who opens the ball of 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.409
 senile plaques in his murderous street shop 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.449
 after an explanation about the origins and processing of cocoa we 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.159
 let's get to the heart of the subject tasting 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.460
 but for good tasted a few rules to observe 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.779
 the tasting of chocolate she is a little bit about the same 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.690
 principles that the tasting of wine that is to say that we have strong states 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.800
 to sink 505 work so the first sight what color he has 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.810
 in dark chocolate 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.300
 in acquisitions rather in marble sheets 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.450
 but after dark ah it will depend on its origin 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.490
 he has for example interested do not get away with what you're already feeling 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.470
 seen that's what's called and then then we can indeed cause 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.170
 according to the texture of it will make noise sorry it is the mythical series 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 that works and then behind we rework palace 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.530
 especially the pleasure 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.210
 the designation of the south - 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.620

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.940
 it is Sunday 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.580
 there are some who do it 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.580
 he would have fled from France 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.560
 after the theory of practice and that pleasure also goes through the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.890
 discovery the participants will be entitled to an association of flavors 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.650
 unexpected 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.650
 and then this year 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.340
 but the adventurous still there 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.860
 I am used to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.950
 and then 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.130
 on a little bit the sensation against the vulgar contents the flavor 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.799
 in mouth

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.079

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
