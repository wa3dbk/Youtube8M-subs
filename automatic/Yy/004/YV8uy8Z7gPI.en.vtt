00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.579
 petanque like to put the stickers and 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:01.850
 let's see these balls I saw them out there 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.939

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.800
 that I am a collector 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.890
 let's open it carefully 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.990

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.050
 clairvoyant because I do not like to save in 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.950
 box 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:26.140
 well here we have 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.140
 this is a 2 x 2 cube 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.050
 but are you tired heads 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.050

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.610
 I'm going 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.330
 it's called ballet 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.240
 and pretty cool it seems that the factory 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.159
 they manufacture in china and where first by 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.079
 where in two ways in German 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.700
 he seemed to see the good ones and well it's a 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.860
 Catalogue 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.080
 and here come the six heads that there are 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.030
 how are we not to throw away the money 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.740
 Well, with one leftover 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 I would like to have everything that I like 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.990
 I have one with Ferrari and not have to go 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.720
 to work but well pretty cool 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.550
 incredible all of collection of 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.080
 wonders are kept in their leaves good 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.080
 let's see what we are 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.380
 these a 2 for 2 good as it gets stuck 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.380
 here a little 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.810
 has click yes 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.370
 well it gets stuck a little bit here for 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.370
 do this but it works well 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.560
 and well this must be had 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.550
 is a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 they are two by two 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.610
 but I had one I had clicked on this 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.610
 he wants to sound something 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.159
 but good 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.329
 I have already seen the web are the 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.329
 pretty cool heads 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:16.200
 in two by two 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.650
 we're already going to see the other one here with 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.800
 eat let's see the other 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.830
 this well 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.780
 come here in a house can you with by 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.730
 yes that could not be I suppose we go no 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.300
 It has a lot of mystery I came with a zeal 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.300
 we will go 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.470
 but carefully I do not like to break 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.470
 things 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.200
 this is one with a blister but 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.820
 this is pretty cool cardboard I 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.230
 I think it's pretty and in these 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.230
 plastic limits because yes that is a 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.030
 little shorter but I do not like it 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.730
 break it can open well be 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.050
 we solve cubes and we are going to walk 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.050
 breaking things so good 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.530
 and this ball of petanque 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.859
 good good here we are here we are 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:19.969
 with the reflection very well 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.969
 you see me very well 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.300
 then perfect 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.300
 Y 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.450
 that is, or the circles 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.450
 it does not click 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.160
 if you do not have ready but good 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.740
 then it's pretty cool it 's just 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.740
 a 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.809
 it seems very simple 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.809
 There are several designs 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:57.070
 just turn this I thought that it turned more 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.000
 only the centers are mixed 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.790
 always fixed 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.720
 if as it was better but so far they 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.300
 have cheated or be cool is a while but 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.830
 they just turn these good 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.830
 and here it comes with these stickers 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.770
 that you have to put it on 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.209
 you will remember to answer the silver 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.339
 I always have this mirror 

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:26.339
 client collected only mirror 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.350
 but 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.920
 the red white 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.290
 are to put them 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.460
 ok do not be a little disappointed by the 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:44.089
 photo seemed better but good this 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:54.080
 affirm of this 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:54.080
 of prominence these are some 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.180
 everything is done 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.849
 these are the other ones are for 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.200
 in 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.790
 OK 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.790
 they are part of inside 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.590
 and others when I understand 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.590
 I do not understand it because you're 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.010
 I do not understand it 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:37.730
 well I'll hit them and we'll see 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.730
 what they are from here 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.080
 it can be to leave to leave some 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.009
 some blank stickers that I do not have 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.759
 no idea 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:56.360
 well I'll put them to see how I'm going to 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.360
 see how they are 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.389
 well I've already put here the stickers is 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.310
 a little tedious and it turns out that of course 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.500
 looking at the documentation on the internet and 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.319
 Well, it is that you can make 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.520
 Six colors or 12 colors 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:18.630
 then I have put the 12 colors 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.180
 because the 6 colors a little bit incapable and 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:26.910
 I did not feel like thinking and that's why they are 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:28.310
 of different houses as you take and put 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.030
 those from outside circles 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:35.590
 today has left is here without putting because 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:38.300
 It was black and good 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:42.090
 well this was very good 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:45.480
 and ready before 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.460
 good good because there is a field 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.030
 than having it for the collection just like 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.030
 head 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:57.410
 and well I hope that 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.690
 I say all these are gone in boxing and 

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.130
 good to buy them 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.910
 more than anything collector more than 

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:08.950
 nothing of the good challenge I hope that I have 

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.950
 liked thank you for everything
