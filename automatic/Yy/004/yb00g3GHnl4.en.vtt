00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.830
 [Music] 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.930
 we will speak now in 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.869
 jackets the most root of the ace 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.350
 alpinestars marker embalo of course 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 jacket i was pro dadis late so the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.520
 GP Pro is made with cattle leather on 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 will also find the elastic at the level 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.530
 arms so molasses and cloth 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.720
 elastic hours but also resistant to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.380
 abrasion 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.149
 we will find here the bellows 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.540
 leather for a better position 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.280
 radical motorcycle and also the bellows 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.400
 we will find them above the elbow 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.390
 and at the rate level we can see the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.010
 hump so this is a jacket that is 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.990
 racing and especially when we try it you 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 will see that the arms automatically 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.960
 they go in the front so that wants 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 to say that it's really a fun 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.270
 preformed provide to be in position 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.759
 moto2 know well comfortable when we 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.439
 is like that so it's true that as 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.300
 I do not like that, but it's true 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.730
 that she is not a good always towards 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.590
 the front but that's why 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.050
 protections whose productions are 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.080
 certified certified they are also 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.860
 reinforced by a plastic plate 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.150
 we're going to have here on this plate in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.010
 more strengthen protection 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.290
 inside she's going to have an effect and 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.530
 sliding the facts slipping I the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.740
 reminds enough so that if we agree 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 the cons tar we will therefore slipped and 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.070
 which he or not to shock himself for not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.720
 break the clavicle or the couderc it's 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.790
 a very comfortable need because they we 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.310
 say a lot of different thickness 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.830
 leather levels so in areas that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 are a bit harder to have a 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.220
 fall to wa wa wa do like that in 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.530
 the guides have so it's mg more 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 so small in areas like the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.080
 elbows go 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.750
 the shoulders and all that is a grammage 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.720
 leather a little thicker so who 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.020
 hold more nature 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.810
 we will have an open collar our call 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.660
 sporty action goes and the jacket on 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.060
 found a lining a lining 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.990
 sweat abl she has no lining 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 thermal 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.370
 she just has this lining 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.110
 sweating here we will find like 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.240
 a protection inside a 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.790
 foam protection that does not come off 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.390
 not, but who will be able to protect you 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.000
 homeland zone the double closure 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.110
 lightning for the pants so if it's a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.970
 alpinestars pants we're not going 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.250
 need the city of farres 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.080
 multifilament until just the simple 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.850
 double she can sew on a 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.580
 pants that are not of the brand 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.310
 alpine star to power the site and with 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.880
 our mountaineers jacket 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.830
 to finish it looks like the buzz in gb 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.790
 pro-animals price it's a price is very 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.070
 normal it's not a top price but it's 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.640
 a need that gives a very good 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.560
 quality 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.620
 it looks like it's mostly for two 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.370
 sports bikes so use it too 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.040
 on naquet bikes or a little bit more 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.880
 tourism so I advise you 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.940
 to buy these jackets if you have a 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.500
 of his motorcycles and if you like a little 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.500
 little sports duets 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:45.709
