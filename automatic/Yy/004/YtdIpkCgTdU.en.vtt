00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.910 

Daytona<00:01:57.800> was<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.160> very<00:01:58.760> very<00:01:58.940> close<00:01:59.060> second<00:01:59.630> and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.240 
Daytona was a very very close second and
I<00:02:00.920> like<00:02:01.760> this<00:02:01.910> scenario<00:02:02.600> it's<00:02:03.470> kind<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:03.800> each

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
I like this scenario it's kind of each

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.950 
I like this scenario it's kind of each
client<00:02:04.820> rest<00:02:05.060> because<00:02:05.480> of<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.750> kind<00:02:05.900> of

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
client rest because of the kind of

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:16.360 
client rest because of the kind of
technology<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:14.210> new<00:02:14.770> consistent<00:02:15.770> with

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
technology that the new consistent with

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.500 
technology that the new consistent with
oh<00:02:16.990> yes<00:02:17.990> was<00:02:18.970> something<00:02:19.970> which<00:02:20.090> really<00:02:20.270> blew

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
oh yes was something which really blew

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.679 
oh yes was something which really blew
me<00:02:20.630> away

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.360 

so<00:02:27.689> like<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.989> SS<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.680> pictures<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.219> been

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
so like the SS the pictures have been

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.860 
so like the SS the pictures have been
floating<00:02:29.819> around<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.120> internet<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.510> quite

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
floating around the internet for quite

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.410 
floating around the internet for quite
some<00:02:31.079> time<00:02:31.129> but<00:02:32.129> if<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.819> take<00:02:32.939> my<00:02:33.180> pick

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
some time but if I have to take my pick

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.610 
some time but if I have to take my pick
I<00:02:33.719> think<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:35.900> solid<00:02:36.900> everything<00:02:37.109> definitely

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
