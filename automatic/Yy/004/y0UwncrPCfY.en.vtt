king<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:09.410> gone<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.770> that's<00:02:09.979> really<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.820> to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
king is gone and that's really not to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.430 
king is gone and that's really not to
get<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.390> all<00:02:11.510> because<00:02:11.810> those<00:02:11.990> things<00:02:12.200> are

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
get it all because those things are

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.250 
get it all because those things are
really<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:13.760> dangerous<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.690> they<00:02:15.110> can

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
really really dangerous and they can

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.920 
really really dangerous and they can
dish<00:02:15.440> add<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> lot<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.920> damage<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.630> right<00:02:17.630> here<00:02:17.900> I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
dish add a lot of damage so right here I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.449 
dish add a lot of damage so right here I
was<00:02:18.170> debating<00:02:18.320> if<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:18.920> should<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.220> for<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
was debating if I should go for the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.250 
was debating if I should go for the
earthquake<00:02:19.790> with<00:02:19.970> gonna<00:02:20.270> punch<00:02:20.510> but<00:02:20.750> then<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.990> I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
earthquake with gonna punch but then I I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
earthquake with gonna punch but then I I
realized<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.310> should<00:02:22.850> probably<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.239> go<00:02:23.390> for

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
realized I should probably just go for

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.390 
realized I should probably just go for
the<00:02:23.600> Thunder<00:02:24.170> punch<00:02:24.320> on<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.620> Persian<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.340> to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
the Thunder punch on the Persian just to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the Thunder punch on the Persian just to
take<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.820> there<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.180> quick<00:02:26.390> as

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
take it out of there as quick as

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.740 
take it out of there as quick as
possible<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:27.520> perhaps<00:02:28.520> break<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.450> sub

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
possible and then perhaps break the sub

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.540 
possible and then perhaps break the sub
or<00:02:30.020> thing<00:02:30.200> out<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.620> another<00:02:31.070> discharge

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
or thing out of it another discharge

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.530 
or thing out of it another discharge
from<00:02:31.820> for<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.870> lantern<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:34.270> thankfully<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.300> do

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
from for the lantern and thankfully I do

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.360 
from for the lantern and thankfully I do
break<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.200> sub<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:38.570> do<00:02:39.170> brick<00:02:39.590> Hingis<00:02:39.890> concert

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
break the sub I do brick Hingis concert

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.930 
break the sub I do brick Hingis concert
which<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:40.970> nice<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.239> then<00:02:41.900> like<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
which is really nice and then like the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.400 
which is really nice and then like the
bar<00:02:44.090> gets<00:02:44.300> another<00:02:44.510> boost<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.110> that's<00:02:45.290> going

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
bar gets another boost so that's going

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.380 
bar gets another boost so that's going
to<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.590> very<00:02:45.620> useful<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.880> actually<00:02:46.970> almost

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
to be very useful and I actually almost

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.120 
to be very useful and I actually almost
take<00:02:47.750> down<00:02:47.989> his<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.320> person<00:02:48.860> with<00:02:49.010> that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
take down his a person with that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.640 
take down his a person with that
discharge<00:02:49.640> but<00:02:49.880> his<00:02:50.450> Persian<00:02:50.870> will<00:02:51.140> go<00:02:51.380> down

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
discharge but his Persian will go down

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.699 
discharge but his Persian will go down
to<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.630> confirm<00:02:53.630> punch<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.930> probably<00:02:54.410> should

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
to the confirm punch I probably should

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.949 
to the confirm punch I probably should
have<00:02:54.830> targeted<00:02:55.310> Genghis<00:02:56.209> Khan<00:02:56.390> instead<00:02:56.810> of

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
have targeted Genghis Khan instead of

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.250 
have targeted Genghis Khan instead of
Persian<00:02:57.380> but<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.830> was<00:02:58.459> afraid<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
Persian but I was afraid that the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.900 
Persian but I was afraid that the
substitute<00:03:00.260> would<00:03:00.380> not<00:03:00.590> break<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.250> for

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
substitute would not break I for

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.150 
substitute would not break I for
discharge<00:03:02.390> because<00:03:03.019> looking<00:03:03.380> at<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.739> damage

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
discharge because looking at the damage

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.640 
discharge because looking at the damage
from<00:03:04.340> before<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.970> really<00:03:05.450> didn't<00:03:05.750> really

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
from before it really didn't really

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.020 
from before it really didn't really
didn't<00:03:06.830> look<00:03:06.980> too<00:03:07.190> good<00:03:07.220> at<00:03:07.459> all<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.610> might<00:03:07.880> have

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
didn't look too good at all I might have

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.759 
didn't look too good at all I might have
been<00:03:08.150> men<00:03:08.390> damaged<00:03:08.780> before<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:09.140> don't<00:03:09.440> know<00:03:09.530> but

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
been men damaged before I don't know but

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.789 
been men damaged before I don't know but
at<00:03:10.730> least<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.090> new<00:03:11.239> break<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.600> sub<00:03:11.900> he<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.470> not

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
at least a new break the sub he is not

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.199 
at least a new break the sub he is not
gonna<00:03:13.040> take<00:03:13.130> him<00:03:13.430> out<00:03:13.549> of<00:03:13.580> there<00:03:13.820> with<00:03:14.060> the

gonna take him out of there with the
return<00:03:14.570> which<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:14.959> really<00:03:15.320> nice<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.060> he<00:03:17.060> might

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
return which is really nice but he might

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.940 
return which is really nice but he might
actually<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.959> sucker<00:03:18.260> punch<00:03:18.350> which

fertilized in this parrot worms
kangaskhan<00:03:57.960> right<00:03:58.080> here<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> discharge

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980

kangaskhan right here with the discharge
i<00:03:59.100> don't<00:03:59.430> believe<00:03:59.580> i<00:03:59.820> do<00:03:59.880> but<00:04:00.150> instead<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.570> get

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
i don't believe i do but instead I get

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.410 
i don't believe i do but instead I get
it<00:04:00.900> critical<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.740> I<00:04:01.980> guess<00:04:02.850> that's<00:04:03.060> kind<00:04:03.360> of

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
it critical it so I guess that's kind of

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.920 
it critical it so I guess that's kind of
useful<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:05.640> flame<00:04:06.030> work<00:04:06.210> activates<00:04:06.720> on

gun too but it looks to me like his poor

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.450 
gun too but it looks to me like his poor
gun<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:29.940> more<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.330> bulky<00:05:30.750> buried<00:05:31.140> so<00:05:31.530> that

gun to is more of a bulky buried so that

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.430 
gun to is more of a bulky buried so that
kind<00:05:32.940> of<00:05:33.150> sucks<00:05:33.480> but

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440
