00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello today I'm going to teach you my pop and you 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.559
 I'm going to teach some good tricks this is 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.719
 my pop is full of shit and good 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:16.259
 to do the first trick you will need 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.259
 a lot of food for example the most 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.450
 it's the fruits 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.820
 the pineapple and the watermelon and also 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.920
 you will need many positions as per 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.980
 example the fat burner 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 and the conversation I'm going to make a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.140
 show then let's first take 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.149
 the fruit and we're going to give it 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.820
 until you get fat you can not anymore 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.300
 then we are going to give this so that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 so that he is left without hunger and he is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.590
 lose weight then we keep giving it 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.520
 a lot until it does not stop 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.530
 and as you can see now I have 364 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.629
 and now yes if I give it continuously 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.240
 and I give it back to the bad manners and the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.259
 hunger potter, you can see that he has 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 uploaded 479 this is the first trick the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.440
 second trick is as easy as going to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440
 settings 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.920
 look 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.340
 date and time define date and change the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 date move forward a couple of days then 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.290
 al and vice al pop 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.640
 and as you can see 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.890
 the payment is half dead then what 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.170
 what we have to do is cure it up 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.250
 that until I'm fine and how can you 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.570
 see now it has 494 then if you give it to 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.280
 eat 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:58.270
 and you give him a choice and you also go 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:03.160
 put a little bit because maybe it can be good 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.229
 or surely so that it goes up more and I'm going 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.800
 this is how you can level up more 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.899
 easily for example here you already have 719 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.080
 Well I hope you liked me 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.080
 half and goodbye
