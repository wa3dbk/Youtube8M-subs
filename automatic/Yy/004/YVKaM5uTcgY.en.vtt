00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.480 

now<00:05:09.520> another<00:05:09.760> great<00:05:10.090> safety<00:05:10.480> feature<00:05:11.490> about

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
now another great safety feature about

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.850 
now another great safety feature about
these<00:05:12.790> are<00:05:13.090> or<00:05:13.480> another<00:05:13.720> nice<00:05:14.050> thing<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.440> reason

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
these are or another nice thing a reason

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.950 
these are or another nice thing a reason
why<00:05:14.980> you<00:05:15.040> guys<00:05:15.280> should<00:05:15.340> own<00:05:15.730> one<00:05:15.960> that's

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
why you guys should own one that's

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.420 
why you guys should own one that's
because<00:05:17.200> I<00:05:17.320> know<00:05:17.380> you're<00:05:17.680> all<00:05:17.710> safe<00:05:18.160> and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
everybody eventually Falls up they've

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.850 
everybody eventually Falls up they've
got<00:05:25.890> they've<00:05:26.890> got<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.400> climbing<00:05:28.590> hooks<00:05:29.590> right

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
got they've got a climbing hooks right

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.820

here so if you're hanging stands you you

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.610 
here so if you're hanging stands you you
run<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.070> lineman's<00:05:33.910> belt<00:05:34.180> from<00:05:34.690> this<00:05:35.110> loop<00:05:35.410> to

run a lineman's belt from this loop to
this<00:05:35.770> loop<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.490> then<00:05:36.790> when<00:05:36.910> you're<00:05:37.030> up<00:05:37.150> there

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
this loop and then when you're up there

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.380 
this loop and then when you're up there
hanging<00:05:37.600> this<00:05:37.660> tree<00:05:38.050> stand<00:05:38.350> or<00:05:38.680> steps<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:40.240> can

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
hanging this tree stand or steps you can

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.360 
hanging this tree stand or steps you can
hang<00:05:40.630> out<00:05:40.810> you<00:05:41.140> daren't<00:05:41.350> hold<00:05:41.560> onto<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:42.070> tree

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
hang out you daren't hold onto the tree

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.980 
hang out you daren't hold onto the tree
you<00:05:43.180> can<00:05:43.300> just<00:05:43.450> hang<00:05:43.630> out<00:05:43.720> nice<00:05:43.960> and

this<00:05:46.630> around<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.050> tree<00:05:47.350> and<00:05:47.880> not<00:05:48.880> worry<00:05:49.180> about

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
this around the tree and not worry about

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.040 
this around the tree and not worry about
falling<00:05:49.870> out<00:05:50.550> normally<00:05:51.550> people<00:05:51.880> fall<00:05:52.720> more

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
falling out normally people fall more

falling out normally people fall more
probably<00:05:53.410> hanging<00:05:53.680> tree<00:05:53.950> stands<00:05:54.510> than<00:05:55.510> they

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
probably hanging tree stands than they

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.470 
probably hanging tree stands than they
do<00:05:56.550> anything<00:05:57.550> else<00:05:58.320> but<00:06:00.000> so<00:06:01.000> this<00:06:01.120> is<00:06:01.270> going<00:06:01.420> to

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
do anything else but so this is going to

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.440 
do anything else but so this is going to
work<00:06:01.770> excellent<00:06:02.770> for<00:06:02.950> that<00:06:03.070> as<00:06:03.280> well<00:06:03.460> so<00:06:04.300> now
