00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.929
 I think edgar is super cool 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 but you know this is a sweetheart 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.570
 young what I tell you know 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.210
 you that what that is easy to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 to understand my opinion about it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.180
 indicate the somewhat general information 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.340
 go tell about 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.300
 then we start corn with the general 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.980
 information 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.719
 first mouse over the evening mouse 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 soak on the sides 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.469
 sit back which is very nice for it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 extra geer i had lately 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.940
 always read my wrist with the other mouse 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.829
 which I had associated with went worse 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.510
 what a bit of a green march was 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 no rubber on it was really a ploter 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.500
 and if it happens and that is actually the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.059
 reason why I am very happy with this 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 month actually all your parts side 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.659
 has rubber and that just takes care of it 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.119
 extra grip with your thumb which is just super 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.830
 The USB cable of this mouse is great 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.600
 gold plated it means that he is one 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 make better connection with the pc what 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.080
 I am very nice wit a lot of people 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.220
 more of the wireless mouse but i like 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.439
 it rolls very annoyingly I have 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 always having problems with wireless mice 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.799
 one of the om that I have something that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 the 100 malfunction or so and all that 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.520
 stuff very happy the mouse was with 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.659
 the window and because that gold is gilded 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.740
 It will also come in that you are good at it 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.000
 makes an extra with the PC 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.320
 but of course always beautiful 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.549
 Sparta has taken you 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.710
 probably a mouse that good 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.180
 god has it means glow in the dark 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.650
 indeed have different colors for that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.869
 This mouse you can put there software 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.400
 Download the program www.samsung.com 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.399
 and then you can fully adjust the mouse 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.740
 you must have namely a 128 kb 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.950
 out in this girl it's just one 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.799
 nice piece of usb stick for this mouse in 98 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.909
 100 sensor where I actually do not have much 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.219
 I can tell about that not so much 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.509
 understand the percent kind of man well that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.799
 does it sound good and it would work steadily 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.719
 useful for singing well for it is too 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.740
 useful to two of these modules that 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.479
 he just 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.250
 you can even tip it here you can 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.409
 adjust and if you don't know what one 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.509
 cent a tip that is i'm your of this 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.039
 buttons are you so you were your tree 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.050
 look by putting tip of the corn 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.730
 higher than you can about families this kind 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.209
 of energy bar when you lay down 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.220
 lower is higher than for young people was a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.230
 girl quickly angry are you someone who really 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.610
 very gently with the mouse on better goes 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.880
 the course him screen 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.650
 step for them then very low then you must 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.610
 all moving so and then he goes 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.900
 very slowly 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.489
 then you get a bit in your way 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.530
 find well i usually have one in three 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.850
 that I have the beautiful things that I like 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.190
 it is a bit fine on corn 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.090
 what is faster I can do better 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.090
 to concentrate 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.739
 my baby about this mouse is fine though good 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.959
 mainly because I mouse wind 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.459
 which lies in his hand and I mean 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.540
 not just eyes of nice mouse me 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.170
 feels great in the hand 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.610
 i can 348 keep this mouse on each other and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.650
 ordinary game enough but where me 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.239
 very intensive shooter I can with this 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.910
 mars could also play 4 her place 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.380
 I tested in what worked I have 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.310
 no wax from my wrist I I do 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.470
 my leg bothered because I don't 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.150
 well what was in between these with 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.500
 others I was there I had to do so could 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.000
 I spent an hour playing and then I could 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.109
 I miss my wrist a bit like that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.030
 You also know a don't have to know at 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.170
 am writing to you at school and was 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.950
 one is always a little showroom 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.030
 mask 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.950
 well that is actually a bit 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.780
 against flooding this mouse and that week 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.640
 zero almost apart from the fact that he 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.560
 was very nice in hand I am me 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.900
 still a beautiful very very fat 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.519
 well I 'm totally complicated it 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.260
 already speaks overview as soon as you realize it 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.980
 has nico move can see it in energy 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.400
 bar 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.380
 just put a lower as soon as you put on this 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.640
 click that I still find very will not 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.200
 something that I find very cool maybe 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.730
 make sense in another person's other 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.410
 this to me a little something that and i up 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.359
 the area with the buttons is there you can 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.700
 your audience can see orkut 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.100
 stand there then click what the color of 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.109
 the mouse other than cutting a way 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.819
 favorite scent yellow is not a start 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.239
 search is in the green among the yellow 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.769
 care throat 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.530
 I think it's about giel we are already 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.430
 this color I think it's a super home 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.049
 get to put head 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.400
 the logo is also very beautiful 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.019
 glowinthedark and I think that's one 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.370
 super fat so in the corner and the beautiful 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.900
 of this mouse and I like it in it 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.340
 are obvious 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.959
 then I don't have much experience with mice 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.250
 the only mice I actually like a lot 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.849
 she happened to me that I now have my bed too 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.650
 lie 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.900
 that is my opinion about the port on mars 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.090
 and that with that general information 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.380
 who can tell you after much I read 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.970

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.810
 general information that's what i still have 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.940
 of know 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.380
 before the giveaway comes from this market 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.130

 behind that all that you play is wifi too 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.770
 coding hard and you will see a ball of wool 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.870
