walking my dog I hated exercise and so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.679 
walking my dog I hated exercise and so
it<00:01:31.340> was<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.520> only<00:01:31.640> form<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:31.970> exercise<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.390> did

during the whole time I was losing
weight<00:01:34.360> walking<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.390> dog<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:35.780> me<00:01:35.869> was<00:01:36.140> the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
weight walking a dog for me was the

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.389 
weight walking a dog for me was the
perfect<00:01:36.439> that's<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.799> sign<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.009> wasn't

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
perfect that's a sign that wasn't

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.910 
perfect that's a sign that wasn't
strenuous<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:38.030> say<00:01:38.299> enjoyed<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.770> could

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
strenuous I say enjoyed it and I could

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800 
strenuous I say enjoyed it and I could
do<00:01:40.009> as<00:01:40.100> little<00:01:40.220> as<00:01:40.340> much<00:01:40.580> as<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:40.820> want<00:01:41.090> wanted

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
do as little as much as I want wanted

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.230 
do as little as much as I want wanted
the<00:01:42.380> third<00:01:42.590> thing<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.830> did<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.159> bought<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.759> smaller

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the third thing I did I bought a smaller

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.090 
the third thing I did I bought a smaller
plate<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.869> seems<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.170> bit<00:01:45.200> ridiculous<00:01:45.649> but

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
plate so that seems a bit ridiculous but

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.910 
plate so that seems a bit ridiculous but
my<00:01:46.729> Bryant<00:01:47.299> mind<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:47.750> easily<00:01:48.049> confused<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.710> I

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
my Bryant mind is easily confused and I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.170 
my Bryant mind is easily confused and I
bought<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> smaller<00:01:49.369> plate<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:49.880> did<00:01:50.030> really

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
bought a smaller plate so it did really

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.730 
bought a smaller plate so it did really
really<00:01:50.299> well<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:50.840> didn't<00:01:51.110> buy<00:01:51.200> them<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.470> had<00:01:51.619> them

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
really well I didn't buy them I had them

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.480 
really well I didn't buy them I had them
in<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.890> cupboard<00:01:52.039> already

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
in the cupboard already

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.830 
in the cupboard already
I<00:01:52.520> used<00:01:52.880> smaller<00:01:53.149> plates<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.539> they<00:01:53.600> really

I used smaller plates and they really

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.440 
I used smaller plates and they really
really<00:01:54.020> did<00:01:54.170> trick<00:01:54.380> me<00:01:54.500> into<00:01:54.789> eating<00:01:55.789> less<00:01:56.119> and

eaten<00:02:27.260> chicken<00:02:27.410> because<00:02:27.709> it's<00:02:27.769> high<00:02:27.920> in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
eaten chicken because it's high in

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.870 
eaten chicken because it's high in

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.330 
becoming more extreme I was on holiday
and<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.750> got<00:04:53.930> back<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.320> saw<00:04:54.530> pictures<00:04:54.710> myself<00:04:55.010> and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
and I got back I saw pictures myself and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.650 
and I got back I saw pictures myself and
I<00:04:55.370> realized<00:04:55.669> hey<00:04:55.820> that's<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.090> bit<00:04:56.240> too<00:04:56.419> skinny

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
I realized hey that's a bit too skinny

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.080 
I realized hey that's a bit too skinny
and<00:04:57.199> so<00:04:57.410> I<00:04:57.440> was<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.770> bit<00:04:58.010> more<00:04:58.099> relaxed<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.729> put

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
and so I was a bit more relaxed and put

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.610 
and so I was a bit more relaxed and put
a<00:04:59.120> bit<00:04:59.270> away<00:04:59.449> on<00:04:59.599> I'm<00:04:59.750> just<00:04:59.930> under<00:05:00.139> 11<00:05:00.440> stone

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
a bit away on I'm just under 11 stone

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.950 
a bit away on I'm just under 11 stone
now<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.010> then<00:05:01.580> yeah<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.479> biggest<00:05:02.810> thing

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
now and then yeah so the biggest thing

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.330 
now and then yeah so the biggest thing
is<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.110> not<00:05:03.410> become<00:05:03.530> addicted<00:05:03.979> if<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.160> see

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
is to not become addicted if you see

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.529 
is to not become addicted if you see
those<00:05:04.460> scales<00:05:04.789> going<00:05:05.030> down<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.419> down<00:05:05.479> and

those scales going down and down and

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.210 
those scales going down and down and
down<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:06.199> can<00:05:06.440> become<00:05:06.560> addictive<00:05:07.010> when<00:05:07.099> you

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
down it can become addictive when you

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.680 
down it can become addictive when you
might<00:05:07.430> not<00:05:07.580> want<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.849> to<00:05:07.970> stop<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:08.419> do<00:05:08.570> be
