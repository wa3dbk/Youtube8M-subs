00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
into a war I'm not sure if Miguel Cotto

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.950 
into a war I'm not sure if Miguel Cotto
is<00:04:45.800> still<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:48.680> elite<00:04:49.680> status<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.640> where

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
is still of the elite status to where

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.680 
is still of the elite status to where
he's<00:04:51.960> going<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.500> be<00:04:52.650> able<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:53.130> outbox<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:54.030> stay

away from Delvin Rodriguez for 12 rounds
I<00:04:58.950> think<00:04:59.700> that<00:05:00.380> everyone<00:05:01.380> knows<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:02.580> put

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.410 
I think that everyone knows that to put
pressure<00:05:03.000> on<00:05:03.270> Miguel<00:05:03.600> Cotto<00:05:03.810> is<00:05:05.270> tends<00:05:06.270> to
