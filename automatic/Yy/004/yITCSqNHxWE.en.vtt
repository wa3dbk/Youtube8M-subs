chart constructed behind me and what
I've<00:00:04.680> done<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.250> basically<00:00:06.029> just<00:00:06.150> duplicated

I've done is basically just duplicated
the<00:00:07.200> chart<00:00:07.500> as<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.680> can<00:00:07.890> see<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.460> put

the chart as you can see here I put

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.879 
the chart as you can see here I put
planets<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> inside<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.290> move<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
planets on the inside that move and

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.740 
planets on the inside that move and
planets<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.519> outside<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.910> don't<00:00:12.269> move<00:00:12.450> I

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
planets on the outside that don't move I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.279 
planets on the outside that don't move I
call<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.530> matrix<00:00:13.860> chart<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:15.630> matrix<00:00:16.109> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
call this a matrix chart and my matrix I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.019 
call this a matrix chart and my matrix I
mean<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> outside<00:00:17.220> planet<00:00:17.699> will<00:00:17.820> never

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
mean that the outside planet will never

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.390 
mean that the outside planet will never
sis<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.080> want<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:20.100> how

as the person gets older I'm going to
see<00:00:50.100> different<00:00:50.250> things<00:00:50.700> about<00:00:50.910> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
see different things about that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.779 
see different things about that
individual<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.590> rotate<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> chart<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.670> we

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
individual as I rotate the chart here we

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
individual as I rotate the chart here we
see<00:00:53.940> somebody<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.390> 18<00:00:54.780> years<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> age<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.100> here

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
see somebody at 18 years of age and here

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
see somebody at 18 years of age and here
we<00:00:56.520> notice<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.480> Jupiter<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
we notice that Jupiter up here in the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.959 
we notice that Jupiter up here in the
top<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.809> aligning<00:01:00.809> itself<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.469> 18<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.129> Saturn

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
top is aligning itself at 18 with Saturn

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
top is aligning itself at 18 with Saturn
so<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> tells<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:04.110> at<00:01:04.260> 18<00:01:04.489> something

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so that tells me at 18 something

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.070 
so that tells me at 18 something
extremely<00:01:05.970> important<00:01:06.510> happened<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:06.960> this

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
extremely important happened with this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.140 
extremely important happened with this
person<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.549> how<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> start

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
person you see that's how I start

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.000 
person you see that's how I start
looking<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> chart<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> chart

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
looking at the chart so as a chart

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
looking at the chart so as a chart
rotates<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.180> 24<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> now

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
rotates so here we are at 24 and now

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.940 
rotates so here we are at 24 and now
notice<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.280> 24<00:01:14.880> Saturn<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.200> pushing<00:01:16.740> here

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
notice that at 24 Saturn is pushing here

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.289 
notice that at 24 Saturn is pushing here
at<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> Sun<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.700> where<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> Sun

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
at the Sun it's where it's the Sun

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.260 
at the Sun it's where it's the Sun
supposed<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.560> moon<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.670> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
supposed to be and the moon up here is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.810 
supposed to be and the moon up here is
where<00:01:21.540> Saturn<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.320> Saturn<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.310> we

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
where Saturn is so Saturn now as we

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270 
where Saturn is so Saturn now as we
learned<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> earlier<00:01:25.380> chart<00:01:25.710> Saturn

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
learned with the earlier chart Saturn

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.429 
learned with the earlier chart Saturn
restricts<00:01:26.850> us<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.180> holds<00:01:27.479> us<00:01:27.570> back<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.110> says<00:01:28.259> no

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
restricts us it holds us back it says no

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.690 
restricts us it holds us back it says no
you're<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.070> doing<00:01:29.250> anything

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
have to go this alone Saturn is the one
thing<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.750> holds<00:01:40.170> us<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.920> restricts<00:01:41.460> us

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
thing that holds us back it restricts us

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
thing that holds us back it restricts us
it<00:01:41.790> constricts<00:01:42.509> us<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.350> does<00:01:43.530> things

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it constricts us it just does things

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.039 
it constricts us it just does things
that<00:01:43.920> makes<00:01:44.310> us<00:01:44.520> absolutely<00:01:45.149> frustrated<00:01:45.899> when

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that makes us absolutely frustrated when

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
that makes us absolutely frustrated when
we<00:01:46.170> try<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:46.590> something<00:01:46.799> done<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
we try to get something done it is a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
we try to get something done it is a
frustrating<00:01:48.780> planet<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.380> called<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
frustrating planet it is called the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
frustrating planet it is called the
planet<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.610> emotional<00:01:51.509> growth<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
planet of emotional growth for that

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.160 
planet of emotional growth for that
reason<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.250> when<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> Saturn<00:01:54.990> has

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
reason so when we see that Saturn has

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
reason so when we see that Saturn has
moved<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> place<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> chart

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
moved to a place like this in the chart

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.209 
moved to a place like this in the chart
it<00:01:57.420> gives<00:01:57.689> us<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> brand<00:01:58.259> new<00:01:58.469> indication<00:01:59.100> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it gives us a brand new indication of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.609 
it gives us a brand new indication of
somebody's<00:01:59.579> lifestyle<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.630> moment<00:02:00.960> so

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
somebody's lifestyle at that moment so

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.410 
somebody's lifestyle at that moment so
here<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:01.979> looking<00:02:02.009> at<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> 24<00:02:03.090> years<00:02:03.329> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
here I'm looking at it in 24 years of
