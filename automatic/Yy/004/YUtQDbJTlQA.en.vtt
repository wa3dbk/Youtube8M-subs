00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.490
 how about friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.190
 video today we're going to learn how to cut 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.040
 our hand on playstation3 on youtube 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.990
 to our tablet or smartphone so no 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.990
 you get away from this video we start 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.099
 good friends first tell them that 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.570
 for this we need to be root users 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.310
 because the applications that we are going to 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.500
 install need permits 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.539
 superuser so we're going to go to the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.000
 play store and we will download the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.220
 application that is called sixaxis 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.680
 compatible checker is an application that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.360
 will serve us later to know if 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.460
 Our device is compatible with the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.210
 application so what are we going to 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.949
 open and here we are going to give you ok and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.949
 then we will give to be 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.570
 and we're going to allow the permits 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.210
 Super user 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.620
 and here we will be able to see what is 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.090
 our device if it is compatible 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.190
 then this application is very 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.870
 important to know if our 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.699
 device is compatible with the command 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.760
 of playstation well here we are going to give 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.500
 to this to stop the application and how 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.600
 we see that it is compatible let's go 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.490
 back to the play store and we're going to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.000
 download the application that is called 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.320
 Sixaxis controller thanks to 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.770
 applications that we can to be able 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.229
 use our playstation control 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.000
 with our smartphone or tablet well 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.070
 as you can see it is a paid application I already 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.460
 I have it bought so I just 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.460
 I'm going to install 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.670
 Once installed, we will open it and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.330
 here we will give you yes 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.590

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.590
 so we're going to activate it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.289
 we give it back and here we go 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.380
 to press on start to start 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.469
 to 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.810

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.030
 allows again permits or asks us 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.690
 alright these these numbers these letters and 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.750
 numbers are very important that you 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.470
 notes because that's what we're going to use 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.300
 for 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.920
 to put it in our control of 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.110
 playstation on the pc 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.580
 good guys there are we just give stop 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.890
 and we go to our pc 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.380
 already here on our pc we are going to install 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.780
 this program called sixaxis for 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.910
 go tool I'm going to leave you on the blog 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.220
 spot to download it here 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.200
 we're just going to install it's easy 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.010
 installation simply next next 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.459
 once you finish installing 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.500
 we will be able to see that it is not in 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.629
 no shortcut on the desktop 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.200
 so we're going to have to look at 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.270
 our team in the ce disk file 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.070
 of programs 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.500
 and let's go down this part we're going 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.220
 look for the folder called ecstasy 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.940
 for the tulle and let's open the first 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.150
 file that is dot exe 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.730
 here we are going to give you yes and how can 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.240
 see me looking for some device 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.240
 so we have to plug our control 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.970
 from playstation via usb cable to our 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.400
 pc as you can see already is already 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.040
 recognizing it is going to install some 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.510
 drives also from our command so 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.690
 how can you see the numbers we have 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.120
 up are the mac from our command 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.820
 playstation and we have to change by 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.950
 the numbers that we had previously 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.410
 annotated from the mac of our device 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.620
 so let's start writing down everything 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.620
 this 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.410
 and once this is done we will give you 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.890
 pop day and this way it's going to change 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.170
 the top by the bottom and good 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.480
 we just close it here and we go 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.010
 to our devices here in our 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.709
 phone again we are going to enter the 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.290
 Sixaxis controller application here 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.000
 let's give start and in our human 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.799
 of playstation we are going to press on 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.130
 the button in the middle where you are 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.680
 the playstation logo and how can you see 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.080
 already the connection starts to be made 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.580
 recognized so this is all guys 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.070
 every time you want to play here we're going 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.870
 to give where the three points and here in 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.960

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.010

 we also have an option to edit 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.229
 the buttons so they can play from a 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.300
 most comfortable way as you like 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.490

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.789

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.349
 good friends how can you see there are games 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:00.509
 that instantly recognize our 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.499
 gamepad or our playstation control 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.499
 in our case 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.030
 let's find many new ones that are 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.030
 compatible with our command 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.070
