00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:25.600
Create the pink color, using translucent clay plus a very
small amount of red and orange.
Make it thin with paste machine.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:41.120
Take the translucent clay only and make it
thin with paste machine, but less often than
the thickness of the sheet of rose clay.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:02:43.920
Create four square of equal size.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:03:35.400
Merge the layers, as shown in the video.
Cut in half and stack together.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:54.720
Squeeze, cut and stack one more.
Add an extra layer of translucent clay.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:27.520
Cut a thin slice and from this slice cut several tiny strips.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:05:06.520
Roll off the sharp edges and curl the prawn.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:46.800
Using a tiny dotter tool, make a little eye socket.
Insert in it, a small ball of black clay.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.840
Make an indentation in the bottom of the head section 
to simulate the mouth parts.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:32.120
Roll a very fine scrap of translucent clay. 
Press it lightly into the indendation.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:41.680
Bake it.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:54.320
I created other prawns that I put in a ceramic dish,
with fimo liquid. Then I glazed all prawns.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:10.600
