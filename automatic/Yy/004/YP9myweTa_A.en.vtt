or so
um<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.420> fact<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:28.260> last<00:00:28.439> time<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.680> had<00:00:28.859> an

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
um in fact the last time I had an

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.099 
um in fact the last time I had an
opportunity<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.609> play<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.750> subscribers

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
opportunity to play was with subscribers

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.690 
opportunity to play was with subscribers
and<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> don't<00:00:31.830> even<00:00:32.070> say<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.610> an

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and I don't even say that as an

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
and I don't even say that as an
opportunity<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.290> wanted<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> play

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
opportunity that I really wanted to play

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.979 
opportunity that I really wanted to play
so<00:00:35.489> here's<00:00:35.760> kind<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> thing<00:00:36.390> um<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.899> think

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so here's kind of the thing um I think

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.569 
so here's kind of the thing um I think
titanfall<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.590> an<00:00:37.649> amazing<00:00:38.040> shooter<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> it's

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
titanfall is an amazing shooter and it's

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.850 
titanfall is an amazing shooter and it's
a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> fun<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:40.050> last<00:00:40.260> time<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> had<00:00:40.770> an

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a lot of fun the last time I had an

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
a lot of fun the last time I had an
experience<00:00:41.219> playing<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.050> different

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
experience playing was kind of different

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.229 
experience playing was kind of different
though<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.160> had<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.520> had<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> chance<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> play

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
though like I had I had a chance to play

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.490 
though like I had I had a chance to play
with<00:00:45.329> friends<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
with friends right and I think I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
with friends right and I think I
livestream<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.309> went<00:00:47.430> through<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
livestream this we went through the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.389 
livestream this we went through the
campaign<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> entire

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
campaign of the game like the entire

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.520 
campaign of the game like the entire
technical<00:00:50.789> single-player<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.719> titanfall<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
technical single-player of titanfall and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
technical single-player of titanfall and
this<00:00:53.070> kind<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.579> left<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.820> bad<00:00:54.030> taste<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.570> my

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this kind of left a bad taste in my

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.209 
this kind of left a bad taste in my
mouth<00:00:54.719> because<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.440> single-player<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
mouth because the single-player of

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.310 
mouth because the single-player of
titanfall<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:57.000> literally<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
titanfall is literally just the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
titanfall is literally just the
multiplayer<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> when<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.520> already<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.059> know

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
multiplayer and when we already you know

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
multiplayer and when we already you know
and<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.930> understand<00:01:01.500> how<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and know that we understand how that is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
and know that we understand how that is
but<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.370> actually<00:01:02.609> experience<00:01:03.149> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
but when you actually experience it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.359 
but when you actually experience it
firsthand<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.159> these

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
firsthand and you really have these

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
firsthand and you really have these
matches<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.240> kind<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.659> um<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.260> like

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
matches that are kind of um that like

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
matches that are kind of um that like
multiplayer<00:01:08.250> matches<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> same

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
multiplayer matches they have the same

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.090 
multiplayer matches they have the same
objectives<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.140> multiplayer<00:01:10.619> matches<00:01:10.830> but

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
objectives as multiplayer matches but

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.520 
objectives as multiplayer matches but
they're<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> exact<00:01:12.000> same<00:01:12.150> thing<00:01:12.659> dude<00:01:12.960> it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
they're the exact same thing dude it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440 
they're the exact same thing dude it's
like<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> laziest<00:01:14.490> thing<00:01:14.610> possible<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.360> I'm

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
like the laziest thing possible and I'm

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.730 
like the laziest thing possible and I'm
not<00:01:15.540> even<00:01:15.720> gonna<00:01:15.810> say<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.290> lazy

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
not even gonna say that it's lazy

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
not even gonna say that it's lazy
especially<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.939> didn't<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.240> much

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
especially because they didn't have much

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.999 
especially because they didn't have much
time<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:18.810> titanfall<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.770> game<00:01:19.890> who

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
had to be made pretty fast and they went

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
had to be made pretty fast and they went
for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.229> multiplayer<00:01:22.530> part<00:01:22.979> first<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> at

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
for the multiplayer part first and at

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
for the multiplayer part first and at

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
within a multiplayer match of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
within a multiplayer match of
single-player<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.840> pretty<00:01:40.140> much<00:01:40.259> what

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
single-player that's pretty much what

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.440 
single-player that's pretty much what
titanfall<00:01:40.740> single-player<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> that's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
titanfall single-player is and that's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.120 
titanfall single-player is and that's
like<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> worst<00:01:43.110> part<00:01:43.439> about<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.740> game<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.009> my

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
like the worst part about the game in my

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
like the worst part about the game in my
opinion<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> multiplayer<00:01:45.600> game<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
opinion but it's a multiplayer game you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.630 
opinion but it's a multiplayer game you
shouldn't<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.409> focused<00:01:46.890> about<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.520> know

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
shouldn't be focused about you know

shouldn't be focused about you know
worrying<00:01:48.329> about<00:01:48.450> single-player<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

actually delved into which was very

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920 
actually delved into which was very

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
disappointing it wasn't that that made

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.170 
disappointing it wasn't that that made
me<00:02:29.080> stop<00:02:29.530> playing<00:02:29.770> titanfall<00:02:30.340> by<00:02:30.700> any<00:02:30.850> means

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
but there's a couple other things that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.340 
but there's a couple other things that
really<00:02:33.520> hit<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.270> hammer<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> head<00:02:34.810> why<00:02:35.320> I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
really hit the hammer on the head why I

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.320 
really hit the hammer on the head why I
stopped<00:02:35.950> playing<00:02:36.190> recently<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.910> made<00:02:37.120> me

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
stopped playing recently and it made me

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.420 
stopped playing recently and it made me
realize<00:02:37.630> something<00:02:38.100> because<00:02:39.100> they<00:02:39.220> still

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
realize something because they still

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.400 
just playing and didn't really have too
much<00:02:54.340> fun<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.570> played<00:02:55.750> titanfall<00:02:56.080> ever

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
much fun because I played titanfall ever

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.840 
much fun because I played titanfall ever
since<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:56.740> February<00:02:56.950> pretty<00:02:57.460> much<00:02:57.610> with<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
since like February pretty much with the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.660 
since like February pretty much with the
initial<00:02:58.180> betas<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.920> came<00:03:00.250> across<00:03:00.370> this

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
initial betas so I came across this

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.730 
initial betas so I came across this
realization<00:03:01.390> why<00:03:02.020> there<00:03:02.260> hasn't<00:03:02.410> been<00:03:02.560> any

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
realization why there hasn't been any

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.770 
realization why there hasn't been any
titanfall<00:03:03.130> videos<00:03:03.520> especially<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.390> it's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
titanfall videos especially and it's

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.050 
titanfall videos especially and it's
mostly<00:03:05.110> because<00:03:05.290> after<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.280> conversation<00:03:06.970> I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
mostly because after a conversation I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970 
mostly because after a conversation I
had<00:03:07.240> at<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.570> run<00:03:07.750> back<00:03:07.900> with<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.620> within<00:03:08.920> a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
where they kind of just stopped playing

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.590 
where they kind of just stopped playing
titanfall<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:24.940> really<00:03:25.270> good<00:03:25.450> you

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600

defend<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.140> think<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.440> game's<00:03:26.620> fantastic

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.949 
defend it I think the game's fantastic
as<00:03:27.430> far<00:03:27.610> as<00:03:27.700> its<00:03:27.820> multiplayer<00:03:28.150> design<00:03:28.720> and

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
as far as its multiplayer design and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.680 
as far as its multiplayer design and
it's<00:03:29.050> just<00:03:29.560> traditionally<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> lot<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.700> fun<00:03:30.970> but

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's just traditionally a lot of fun but

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's just traditionally a lot of fun but
for<00:03:31.900> some<00:03:32.050> reason<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.440> didn't<00:03:32.650> keep<00:03:32.770> my

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
for some reason it didn't keep my

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.310 
for some reason it didn't keep my
interest<00:03:33.550> really<00:03:33.880> fast<00:03:34.300> than<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.900> interest

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
interest really fast than the interest

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.199 
interest really fast than the interest
of<00:03:35.440> others<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:36.070> in<00:03:36.610> some<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.850> say<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.120> I'm

the only times I really really enjoyed

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.979 
the only times I really really enjoyed
it<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:01.000> when<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.540> was<00:04:01.660> playing<00:04:01.930> with

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.810 
it is when I was playing with
subscribers<00:04:02.620> recently<00:04:02.950> where<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:03.430> actually

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
subscribers recently where we actually

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.729 
subscribers recently where we actually
got<00:04:04.000> into<00:04:04.209> matches<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.810> we<00:04:04.870> never<00:04:05.140> ever<00:04:05.260> left

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
got into matches and we never ever left

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.860

what<00:04:06.010> like<00:04:06.220> we<00:04:06.430> never<00:04:06.610> ever<00:04:06.820> allowed<00:04:07.180> one<00:04:07.780> of

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
what like we never ever allowed one of

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.720 
what like we never ever allowed one of
those<00:04:07.989> ships<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.410> evacuate<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.070> planet<00:04:09.430> every

that's<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.169> kind<00:05:43.349> of<00:05:43.409> stuff<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.740> think

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
that's the kind of stuff that I think

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.189 
that's the kind of stuff that I think
titanfall<00:05:44.279> thrives<00:05:44.909> upon<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.569> when<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:45.960> ran

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
titanfall thrives upon and when I ran

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.170 
titanfall thrives upon and when I ran
into<00:05:46.379> people<00:05:46.680> playing<00:05:47.219> this<00:05:47.430> game<00:05:47.639> and<00:05:47.969> I<00:05:48.060> was

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
into people playing this game and I was

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.180 
into people playing this game and I was
running<00:05:48.419> around<00:05:48.509> solo<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.500> was<00:05:49.710> nothing<00:05:50.009> but

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
running around solo it was nothing but

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.589 
running around solo it was nothing but
teams<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.819> was<00:05:50.909> nothing<00:05:51.150> but<00:05:51.270> these<00:05:51.389> big

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
teams it was nothing but these big

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.329 
teams it was nothing but these big
coordinated<00:05:52.169> teams<00:05:52.379> and<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:52.740> just<00:05:53.009> was<00:05:53.159> like

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
coordinated teams and I just was like

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.430 
coordinated teams and I just was like
most<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.270> time<00:05:54.419> if<00:05:54.659> you're<00:05:55.050> on<00:05:55.169> a<00:05:55.199> team

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
most of the time if you're on a team

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.899 
most of the time if you're on a team
that<00:05:55.469> isn't<00:05:55.919> doing<00:05:56.099> well<00:05:56.250> you're<00:05:56.610> gonna<00:05:56.729> get

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
that isn't doing well you're gonna get

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.820 
that isn't doing well you're gonna get
murdered<00:05:57.270> at<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.419> same<00:05:57.479> time<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:58.229> that's<00:05:58.680> not

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
murdered at the same time and that's not

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.670 
murdered at the same time and that's not
a<00:05:58.889> bad<00:05:59.069> thing<00:05:59.129> most<00:05:59.729> games<00:06:00.029> are<00:06:00.680> traditionally

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
a bad thing most games are traditionally

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.379 
a bad thing most games are traditionally
team-based<00:06:02.129> now<00:06:02.400> outside<00:06:02.909> of<00:06:03.029> things<00:06:03.150> like

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
team-based now outside of things like

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.300 
team-based now outside of things like
Call<00:06:03.599> of<00:06:03.629> Duty<00:06:03.990> battlefield<00:06:04.440> is<00:06:04.949> pretty<00:06:05.159> much

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
Call of Duty battlefield is pretty much

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.279 
Call of Duty battlefield is pretty much
a<00:06:05.339> team<00:06:05.669> game<00:06:05.969> in<00:06:06.270> a<00:06:06.330> lot<00:06:06.449> of<00:06:06.599> situations<00:06:06.719> as

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
a team game in a lot of situations as

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.860 
a team game in a lot of situations as
well<00:06:07.319> so<00:06:07.860> all<00:06:08.430> I'm<00:06:08.759> saying<00:06:08.789> is<00:06:09.180> that<00:06:09.330> I<00:06:09.569> don't

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
well so all I'm saying is that I don't

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.779 
well so all I'm saying is that I don't
want<00:06:10.050> there<00:06:10.259> to<00:06:10.289> be<00:06:10.440> no<00:06:10.889> more<00:06:10.919> titanfall<00:06:11.490> I

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
want there to be no more titanfall I

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.040 
want there to be no more titanfall I
really<00:06:12.089> like<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.360> have<00:06:12.479> a<00:06:12.509> balance<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:12.960> a

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
really like to have a balance of a

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.170 
really like to have a balance of a
shooter<00:06:13.409> in<00:06:13.560> other<00:06:13.710> games<00:06:14.009> so<00:06:14.639> I'm<00:06:14.759> thinking

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
shooter in other games so I'm thinking

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.909 
shooter in other games so I'm thinking
the<00:06:15.330> best<00:06:15.360> way<00:06:15.719> to<00:06:15.779> alleviate<00:06:16.139> this<00:06:16.560> and<00:06:16.830> if

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
the best way to alleviate this and if

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.320 
the best way to alleviate this and if
you<00:06:17.009> guys<00:06:17.129> have<00:06:17.310> been<00:06:17.370> having<00:06:17.550> similar<00:06:17.879> issues

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
you guys have been having similar issues

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.390 
you guys have been having similar issues
as<00:06:18.479> well<00:06:18.690> is<00:06:18.990> for<00:06:19.289> me<00:06:19.589> to<00:06:19.710> probably<00:06:19.919> stream

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
as well is for me to probably stream

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.399 
as well is for me to probably stream
more<00:06:20.580> titanfall<00:06:20.969> with<00:06:21.509> subscribers<00:06:21.870> with

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
more titanfall with subscribers with

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.779 
more titanfall with subscribers with
people<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:22.800> have<00:06:22.949> actually<00:06:23.310> wanted<00:06:23.520> me<00:06:23.729> to

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
people that have actually wanted me to

jumping on the mic with people would be

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.400
