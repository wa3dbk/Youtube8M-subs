00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
on the 550d is bad but it's not as good

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.080 
on the 550d is bad but it's not as good
as<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.530> JVC<00:00:47.530> HD<00:00:47.980> vide<00:00:48.190> that<00:00:48.460> was<00:00:48.550> an<00:00:48.640> excellent

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
as the JVC HD vide that was an excellent

microphone they had in there I felt my

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.640 
microphone they had in there I felt my
need<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.700> upgrade<00:00:51.940> but<00:00:52.420> this<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.350> think<00:00:53.530> you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
need to upgrade but this I think you

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.470 
need to upgrade but this I think you
know<00:00:53.770> it<00:00:54.010> will<00:00:54.250> definitely<00:00:54.550> provide<00:00:55.120> a<00:00:55.270> better

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
know it will definitely provide a better

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.130 
know it will definitely provide a better

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
somewhere to that but he did some tests

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.219 
somewhere to that but he did some tests
you<00:01:02.320> know<00:01:02.410> it's<00:01:02.530> pretty<00:01:02.680> cool<00:01:03.150> I<00:01:04.150> ordered<00:01:05.140> this

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
can get it for 140 or something but um

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.749

condenser<00:01:27.850> microphone<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.900> i'll<00:01:28.990> give<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.260> a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
condenser microphone so i'll give it a

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.380 
condenser microphone so i'll give it a
test<00:01:29.560> after<00:01:30.040> I'm<00:01:30.159> done<00:01:30.549> just<00:01:30.880> taking<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.299> out

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
test after I'm done just taking it out

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.360 
test after I'm done just taking it out
here<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:31.870> there's<00:01:32.440> not<00:01:32.590> too<00:01:32.740> much<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.920> look<00:01:33.280> at

so this is just a quick test of the rode
mic<00:01:57.460> obviously<00:01:58.270> as<00:01:58.930> we<00:01:59.590> all<00:01:59.710> know<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.010> server

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
mic obviously as we all know the server

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.399 
mic obviously as we all know the server
makes<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.610> shitload<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:01.000> noise<00:02:01.270> so<00:02:01.409> just

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
makes a shitload of noise so just

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.039 
makes a shitload of noise so just
testing<00:02:03.340> its<00:02:03.640> capabilities<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.689> cut<00:02:04.900> out

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
testing its capabilities to cut out

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.740 
testing its capabilities to cut out
surrounding<00:02:05.680> noise<00:02:06.060> obviously<00:02:07.060> you'll<00:02:07.600> learn

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
surrounding noise obviously you'll learn

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.300 
surrounding noise obviously you'll learn
is<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.049> difference<00:02:08.500> if<00:02:08.649> there<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> lotta

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
is the difference if there is a lotta

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.300 
is the difference if there is a lotta
noise<00:02:09.549> or<00:02:09.819> if<00:02:09.879> there's<00:02:10.090> not<00:02:10.290> but<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.560> think

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
noise or if there's not but I think

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.830 
noise or if there's not but I think
because<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.879> microphone<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.629> actually

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
because this microphone is actually

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.070 
because this microphone is actually
directional<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.849> probably<00:02:16.330> should<00:02:16.689> cut<00:02:16.959> out

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
directional it probably should cut out

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.000 
directional it probably should cut out
most<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.560> noise<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.129> hear<00:02:18.810> so

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
most of the noise that you hear so

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.790 
most of the noise that you hear so
yeah<00:02:21.730> we'll<00:02:22.030> see<00:02:22.300> with<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.200> finished<00:02:23.500> product

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
yeah we'll see with the finished product

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.850 
yeah we'll see with the finished product
but<00:02:24.220> yeah<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.450> pretty<00:02:26.019> damn<00:02:26.260> directional<00:02:26.799> if

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
but yeah it's pretty damn directional if

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.280 
but yeah it's pretty damn directional if
you<00:02:26.950> talk<00:02:27.159> from<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> side<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:28.200> sounds<00:02:29.200> pretty

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
you talk from the side it sounds pretty

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.789 
you talk from the side it sounds pretty
crap<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.360> yeah<00:02:31.360> if<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.959> enjoyed<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.530> video
