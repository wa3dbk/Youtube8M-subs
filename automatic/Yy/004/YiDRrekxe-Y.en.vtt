00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
order to advance to the next spot and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.639 
order to advance to the next spot and
these<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.320> hexagon<00:00:55.920> pieces<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:57.120> contain

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
matching arcs so in this case I threw

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
matching arcs so in this case I threw
this<00:01:01.320> egg<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> match<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> can't

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
this egg and it's not a match so I can't

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
this egg and it's not a match so I can't
move<00:01:03.690> forward<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> would<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> next

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
move forward and it would be the next

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.190
