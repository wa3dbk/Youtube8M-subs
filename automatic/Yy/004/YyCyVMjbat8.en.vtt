that<00:02:49.739> number<00:02:50.130> 94<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.790> make<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> tackle<00:02:51.239> here

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that number 94 can make the tackle here

setting<00:02:56.340> up<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.579> screen<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.060> very<00:02:57.299> important

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
