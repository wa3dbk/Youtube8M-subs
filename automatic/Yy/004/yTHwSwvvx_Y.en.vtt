and then as you see it also adds a lot

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.190 
and then as you see it also adds a lot
of<00:01:13.140> volume<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:13.799> using<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.369> program

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.590 
of volume when you're using the program
not<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:19.939> cover<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
not like that and just to cover up a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.770 
not like that and just to cover up a
little<00:01:21.720> bit<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.170> user<00:01:22.909> esperan<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
little bit on user esperan and in this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
little bit on user esperan and in this
case<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.259> from<00:01:25.560> GSD<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.900> finding<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
case is from GSD it's for finding and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.020 
case is from GSD it's for finding and
for<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> small<00:01:30.840> details<00:01:32.720> actually<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:35.030> don't

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
for the small details actually you don't

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
for the small details actually you don't
need<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.900> wax<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.890> strong<00:01:38.220> but

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
need because this wax is very strong but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
need because this wax is very strong but
I<00:01:38.729> used<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> anyway<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.689> give<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.470> bit

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
I used it anyway to give it a little bit

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.120 
I used it anyway to give it a little bit
of<00:01:40.920> extra<00:01:41.909> shine<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.380> quick<00:01:43.560> tip<00:01:43.799> when

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
of extra shine and just a quick tip when

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
of extra shine and just a quick tip when
you're<00:01:44.220> using<00:01:44.430> her<00:01:44.820> esperan<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:46.229> very

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you're using her esperan it's very

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.080 
you're using her esperan it's very
important<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.280> push<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.790> button

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
important that you don't push the button

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
important that you don't push the button
like<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:49.130> because<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
like this because you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.169 
like this because you
lose<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:52.200> gas<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> container<00:01:53.219> it's

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
lose the the gas in the container it's

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.069 
lose the the gas in the container it's
much<00:01:54.450> better<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.999> use<00:01:56.999> a<00:01:57.030> small<00:01:57.569> push

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
much better if you just use a small push

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:08.749 
much better if you just use a small push
like<00:01:58.740> this<00:02:06.109> yeah<00:02:07.109> I<00:02:07.469> think<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:08.250> enough<00:02:08.549> I
