00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.309
 wireless video to 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.309
 mobile 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.720
 it is installed as the back 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.720
 You can also put the front of the vehicle and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.010
 already wherever you want the camera itself 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.260
 looks like this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.210
 installation in this case I put it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 under the room is mounted on adjustable floors 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.360
 also who have hands they can camera 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.600
 takes off 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.900
 clamps can be installed under the bottom 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.559
 part of the edge of the trunk or bumper where 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.879
 want yourself choose the camera is 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.080
 wireless ie wires chzh 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.260
 car pull no need to connect and 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.489
 very simple takes minutes 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.979
 fifteen-twenty that is from the camera we 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.619
 conduct power connect to the rear 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 stop signal that is not on the stop signal 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.759
 on the back of the car i.e. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 switching on the reverse gear 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.899
 camera power on this camera also 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.240
 there is a transmitter here in this case 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.340
 together here under the skin 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 plastic so that it doesnâ€™t rumble 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.740
 hung out 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 that is, when turning on the reverse gear 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.040
 the transmitter signal transmits to receive 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.860
 some lurking inside the car already 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.190
 directly worth it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.580
 let's see 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.440
 I went the same display can be bought at 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.350
 bundled with this camera is worth it 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.060
 inexpensively 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.590
 in this case I have for the camera here 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.509
 this display here 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.780
 when reverse gear is on 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.780
 we have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.540
 until germany 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.590
 the image is very clear 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 we have a receiver 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.729
 also here for the monitor 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.960
 I placed pasted on mount 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.250
 navigator 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.390
 so level 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.200
 and 4 days 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.200
 it's like it sticks out 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.790
 that is, you can arrange this camera 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.379
 also ahead of the car will be constantly 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.830
 chapter can be included directly 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.709
 connect and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.370
 oh she will 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.370
 signal to us 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.660
 cars 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.520
 also not available in the wired version 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.710
 same camera it looks exactly like that 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.790
 only 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.620
 I'll tell you what you need 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.980
 But through the image quality 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.140
 may be 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.780
 what and the different wired camera can 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.670
 be a little better u wireless though i dont 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.990
 I think here 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.990
 but send type sounds 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.740
 in physics
