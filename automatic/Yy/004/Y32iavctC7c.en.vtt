00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
good protection all these cases come

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.820 
good protection all these cases come
over<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> front<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.239> protect<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> screen<00:02:40.020> so

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
if it happens to drop this is going to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
if it happens to drop this is going to
lift<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.780> off<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.930> ground<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.590> keep<00:02:47.070> your

so<00:02:49.980> that's<00:02:50.160> what<00:02:50.340> my<00:02:50.459> wife<00:02:50.640> uses<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.300> fab

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
so that's what my wife uses the fab

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630 
so that's what my wife uses the fab
shell<00:02:51.870> or<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.410> candy<00:02:52.800> shell<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.190> recommend
