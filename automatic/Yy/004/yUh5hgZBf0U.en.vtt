00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
next time they can get up so we focus a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
next time they can get up so we focus a
lot<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.700> using<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.629> hamstrings<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> pull

those legs down in time I learned a lot

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.139 
those legs down in time I learned a lot
about<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.710> technique<00:00:53.219> behind<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:54.120> only

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
about the technique behind not only

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.350 
about the technique behind not only
kicking<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.230> also<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.640> their<00:00:56.820> dancing

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
kicking but also all of their dancing

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
kicking but also all of their dancing
there's<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.750> many<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.440> intricacies<00:00:59.430> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
there's so many little intricacies and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
there's so many little intricacies and
so<00:01:00.180> many<00:01:00.359> details<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> average<00:01:01.379> person

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so many details that the average person

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
so many details that the average person
would<00:01:02.039> never<00:01:02.309> notice<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> Rockettes

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
would never notice but to the Rockettes

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109 
would never notice but to the Rockettes
is<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.619> important<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.820> think

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
is really important and that I think

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
is really important and that I think
gives<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> uniform<00:01:07.140> look<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
gives it the uniform look at that you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.469 
gives it the uniform look at that you
see<00:01:08.430> when<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> Christmas

Spectacular<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.700> kickline<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.450> thinking

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
Spectacular in the kickline I'm thinking

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.280 
Spectacular in the kickline I'm thinking
what<00:01:13.350> flag<00:01:13.710> goes<00:01:13.979> first<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:15.290> just

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
what flag goes first what just

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350 
what flag goes first what just
remembering<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> sequins<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.729> yeah<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
remembering the sequins and yeah that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
remembering the sequins and yeah that
how<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> counts<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> sequences

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
how all of the counts and the sequences

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
how all of the counts and the sequences
and<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.759> praying<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.330> no<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and I'm just praying that no one is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
and I'm just praying that no one is
messing<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.799> everyone<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.310> together

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
messing up and that everyone is together

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
messing up and that everyone is together
the<00:01:24.630> hardest<00:01:24.990> part<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:25.350> doing<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.830> kicks

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the hardest part about doing the kicks

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.520 
the hardest part about doing the kicks
is<00:01:26.340> making<00:01:26.909> sure<00:01:27.150> they're<00:01:27.479> exactly<00:01:27.990> eye<00:01:28.110> high

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is making sure they're exactly eye high

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.219 
is making sure they're exactly eye high
so<00:01:29.040> you'll<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.400> energized<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> really

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
so you'll get energized and really

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.390 
so you'll get energized and really
feeling<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> next<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.280> know

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
feeling it and the next thing you know

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
feeling it and the next thing you know
your<00:01:32.610> kicks<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.150> too<00:01:33.210> high<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.930> are<00:01:33.990> not
