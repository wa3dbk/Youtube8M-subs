hair<00:02:24.549> as<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.880> pull<00:02:25.150> through<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.530> then<00:02:29.980> let's

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
hair as you pull through and then let's

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.789 
hair as you pull through and then let's
do<00:02:30.610> our<00:02:30.730> body<00:02:30.970> suction<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:32.200> with<00:02:32.349> this<00:02:32.530> one

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
do our body suction now with this one

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:40.160 
do our body suction now with this one
you're<00:02:33.160> going<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.400> go<00:02:33.549> up<00:02:33.819> from<00:02:34.690> below<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.500 

sometimes<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.500> easier<00:02:41.860> with<00:02:42.010> thick<00:02:42.190> hair

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
sometimes this is easier with thick hair

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.059 
sometimes this is easier with thick hair
but<00:02:43.510> my<00:02:43.750> daughter<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.110> pretty<00:02:44.620> thick<00:02:44.829> hair<00:02:45.040> and

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
but my daughter is pretty thick hair and

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.710 
but my daughter is pretty thick hair and
i<00:02:45.310> would<00:02:45.489> actually<00:02:45.640> think<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.120> would<00:02:46.209> even<00:02:46.690> be

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
i would actually think it would even be

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.350 
i would actually think it would even be
a<00:02:46.840> little<00:02:47.079> bit<00:02:47.230> easier<00:02:47.410> with<00:02:48.030> hair<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.060> was<00:02:49.299> a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
a little bit easier with hair that was a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.270 
a little bit easier with hair that was a
tiny<00:02:49.660> bit<00:02:49.870> thinner<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.769> because<00:02:51.069> it's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
tiny bit thinner just because it's

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280 
tiny bit thinner just because it's
pretty<00:02:52.060> tough<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.299> pull<00:02:52.629> through<00:02:52.870> sometimes

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
pretty tough to pull through sometimes

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.860 
pretty tough to pull through sometimes
okay<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.040> there<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.340> have<00:02:54.459> our<00:02:54.609> first<00:02:54.870> four

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
okay so there we have our first four

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.220 
okay so there we have our first four
sections<00:02:56.560> now<00:02:57.160> what<00:02:57.340> we're<00:02:57.489> going<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:57.670> do<00:02:58.230> just
