after you're done scrolling we're going

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.710 
after you're done scrolling we're going

when you guys go on the pearlescent

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.580 
when you guys go on the pearlescent
option<00:01:46.940> its<00:01:47.060> going<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.270> allow<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.410> from

option its going to allow you to so from

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.870 
option its going to allow you to so from
here<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.830> guys<00:01:48.979> can<00:01:49.220> pick<00:01:49.369> any<00:01:49.550> single

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
here you guys can pick any single

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.460 
here you guys can pick any single
pearlescent<00:01:50.420> color<00:01:50.600> with<00:01:50.810> your<00:01:50.960> matte<00:01:51.170> paint

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
pearlescent color with your matte paint

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.080 
pearlescent color with your matte paint
job<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.040> much<00:01:52.250> different<00:01:52.460> than<00:01:52.700> having<00:01:52.910> a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
job this is much different than having a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.999 
job this is much different than having a
metallic<00:01:53.509> color<00:01:53.630> because<00:01:54.229> matte<00:01:54.470> colors<00:01:54.830> are

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
metallic color because matte colors are

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.400 
metallic color because matte colors are
not<00:01:55.190> glossy<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.360> here<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.600> had<00:01:56.780> an<00:01:56.869> orange<00:01:57.080> color

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
not glossy so here I had an orange color

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.719 
not glossy so here I had an orange color
and<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.650> could<00:01:57.800> definitely<00:01:57.979> enhance<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.610> by

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
and I could definitely enhance it by

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.580 
and I could definitely enhance it by
putting<00:01:59.000> for<00:01:59.300> example<00:01:59.780> race<00:02:00.020> yellow<00:02:00.350> color

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
putting for example race yellow color

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.710 
putting for example race yellow color
but<00:02:01.070> here<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.460> like<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.850> dark<00:02:02.060> bluish<00:02:02.360> color

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
but here I have like a dark bluish color

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.210 
but here I have like a dark bluish color
and<00:02:03.020> when<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.170> do<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.470> glitch<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.740> go<00:02:04.009> over<00:02:04.130> to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
and when I do the glitch to go over to

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.859 
and when I do the glitch to go over to
my<00:02:04.310> pearlessence<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.030> could<00:02:05.479> definitely<00:02:05.690> make

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
my pearlessence I could definitely make

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.900 
my pearlessence I could definitely make
it<00:02:06.020> look<00:02:06.259> much<00:02:06.440> different<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.430> trick<00:02:07.759> was

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
it look much different this trick was

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.430 
it look much different this trick was
around<00:02:08.149> before<00:02:08.360> but<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.869> got<00:02:08.959> patched<00:02:09.259> by

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
around before but it got patched by

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.020 
around before but it got patched by
Rockstar<00:02:09.890> for<00:02:10.039> no<00:02:10.130> reason<00:02:10.489> it's<00:02:10.610> really<00:02:10.729> not

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
Rockstar for no reason it's really not

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.760 
Rockstar for no reason it's really not
game<00:02:11.270> breaking<00:02:11.300> at<00:02:11.780> all<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.350> this<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.620> after

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
game breaking at all but this is after

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.130 
game breaking at all but this is after
patch<00:02:13.130> 1.20<00:02:14.000> -<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.270> believe<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.780> works<00:02:14.989> for

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
patch 1.20 - I believe this works for

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.840 
patch 1.20 - I believe this works for
the<00:02:15.200> old<00:02:15.350> gen<00:02:15.530> as<00:02:15.650> well<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.459> was<00:02:16.640> done<00:02:16.790> on

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the old gen as well but this was done on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.760 
the old gen as well but this was done on
the<00:02:17.120> next-generation<00:02:17.480> consoles<00:02:18.110> on<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.320> Xbox

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
the next-generation consoles on the Xbox

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.320 
the next-generation consoles on the Xbox
one<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.430> definitely<00:02:19.610> does<00:02:19.910> work<00:02:19.940> on<00:02:20.270> the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
one and it definitely does work on the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.360 
one and it definitely does work on the
PlayStation<00:02:20.840> 4<00:02:20.870> as<00:02:21.140> well<00:02:21.320> not<00:02:21.890> only<00:02:22.100> does<00:02:22.250> this

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
PlayStation 4 as well not only does this

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.860 
PlayStation 4 as well not only does this
glitch<00:02:22.610> work<00:02:22.880> with<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.150> matte<00:02:23.330> colors<00:02:23.690> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
glitch work with the matte colors it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.540 
glitch work with the matte colors it
works<00:02:24.019> with<00:02:24.140> every<00:02:24.410> single<00:02:24.590> other<00:02:24.800> one<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
works with every single other one so the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.030 
works with every single other one so the
metallics<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.420> crew<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.989> chrome<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.620> also

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
metallics the crew the chrome and also

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.860 
metallics the crew the chrome and also
the<00:02:28.130> classic<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:28.820> for<00:02:29.000> those<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.630> really

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the classic but for those it really

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.420 
the classic but for those it really
doesn't<00:02:30.140> look<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.410> good<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.739> actually<00:02:30.769> looks

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
doesn't look that good it actually looks

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.250 
doesn't look that good it actually looks
the<00:02:31.580> best<00:02:31.790> for<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.120> mattes<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.989> basically

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the best for the mattes it's basically

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.420 
the best for the mattes it's basically
the<00:02:33.380> same<00:02:33.530> exact<00:02:33.860> thing<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.160> I've<00:02:34.280> been

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the same exact thing like I've been

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.800 
the same exact thing like I've been
saying<00:02:34.700> as<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> metallic<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.660> not

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
saying as the metallic but it's not

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.080 
saying as the metallic but it's not
glossy<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.769> small<00:02:37.010> change<00:02:37.310> opens<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:37.880> so

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
glossy and this small change opens up so

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.610 
glossy and this small change opens up so
many<00:02:38.180> possibilities<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.930> make<00:02:39.140> paint<00:02:39.410> jobs

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
many possibilities to make paint jobs

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.440 
many possibilities to make paint jobs
look<00:02:39.769> different<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.340> more<00:02:40.459> unique<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:41.060> lot<00:02:41.360> of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
look different and more unique a lot of

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.820 
look different and more unique a lot of
people<00:02:41.720> actually<00:02:41.840> do<00:02:42.170> prefer<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.530> matte

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
people actually do prefer the matte

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.410 
people actually do prefer the matte
colors<00:02:43.160> but<00:02:43.400> Rockstar<00:02:43.790> unfortunately<00:02:44.269> did

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
colors but Rockstar unfortunately did

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.060 
colors but Rockstar unfortunately did
not<00:02:44.450> put<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.840> pearlescent<00:02:45.380> option<00:02:45.680> into<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
not put the pearlescent option into the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.620 
not put the pearlescent option into the
game<00:02:46.280> which<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.850> why<00:02:46.970> we<00:02:47.120> had<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.390> come<00:02:47.570> out

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
game which is why we had to come out

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.420 
game which is why we had to come out
with<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.900> glitch<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.110> do<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.220> made<00:02:49.400> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
with the glitch to do so so I made a
