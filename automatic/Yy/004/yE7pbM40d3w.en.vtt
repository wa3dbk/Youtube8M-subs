00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
here and way up here so I think Dean

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.710 
here and way up here so I think Dean
really<00:02:33.510> did<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.959> impossible<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:35.720> watching

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
really did the impossible and watching

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.229 
really did the impossible and watching
it<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.709> hard<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.160> believe<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.580> he<00:02:39.090> was

it it's it's hard to believe that he was
able<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.720> sprint<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.440> fast<00:02:40.470> as<00:02:40.980> he<00:02:41.160> did<00:02:41.190> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
able to sprint as fast as he did and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.729
