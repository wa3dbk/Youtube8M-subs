00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.830
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.360
 new video of grand theft auto 'online 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.590
 in which I'm going to teach you the new 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.450
 verified races that he has taken 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.949
 rockstar give my opinion about what has 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.289
 looked like each of them and briefly 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.640
 and also other news that I want 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.990
 count but before the start 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.940
 video I would like to ask you not to 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.750
 forget to like it if you like it without 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.360
 nothing more to add 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.220
 we begin with the novelties 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.590
 tell you that the limit of 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.570
 the crises now is thousands are a 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.090
 news that already has a few 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.949
 days but I wanted to advertise along with 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.300
 this other content since if not 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.980
 would have been isolated would have been very 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.540
 I said little on twitter but for a 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.829
 video I liked to make it more complete not 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.870
 well, tell you also that they have 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.970
 done a steven interview and that is 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.220
 who gives the voice to the protagonist trevor 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.140
 of the gta 5 campaign not only gives the voice 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.850
 it also gives the face and what 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.800
 would be the body shape would be a 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.360
 kind of actor poke that person 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.860
 in the game and what I said has 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.350
 granted an interview to a media 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.480
 called cu tv who have already talked about 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.190
 some interesting things about 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.409
 character about the motivation that has 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.590
 about how he is or what about how he thinks 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.389
 that could have been to improve it and 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.649
 those interested will have the same right now 

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.120
 link on screen to go no os 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.370
 worry that it will not close 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.960
 but you just give it and you 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.730
 will open a new tab 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
 directly to new careers not 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.910
 are the races but also the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.800
 Death games tell you that in general 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.990
 I have been disappointed a few times 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.730
 previous items added 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.470
 verified have been better than better 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.970
 level in this case over all 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.010
 races have gone down a lot the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.050
 and in the case of consignments to 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.730
 death yes we have been able to see some 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.650
 quite interesting but what I want 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.510
 do is go one by one briefly 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.310
 I'm not going to tell myself that he has 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.480
 seemed well beginning with the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.110
 careers we would have one that is called 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.450
 race next to the beach and that is the most 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.010
 disappointing of all is so simple 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.870
 like what a race says next to the 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.970
 beach we are tired of watching careers 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.950
 well and I think that this has been the worst 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.410
 that have included even so good 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.660
 it's going to be one more race so if 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.940
 you like normal races a lot 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.620
 then you can play this gymkhana in the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.770
 motorway is another one too that they have 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.320
 many similarities with another one more is to say 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.700
 that have included two very similar but 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 this one is more entertaining because 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.290
 It has quite a few twists and long stretches 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 distance that allow good well without 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.860
 played with enough friends to do 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.020
 and have fun when you 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.780
 We advance with the slipstream and others but 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.239
 It would not be and would not be 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 a normal race and it's from wiesel to 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.080
 wiesel is the third race that 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.480
 adds that it follows more or less the style of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.819
 the previous one a little bit worse yes it is true 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.890
 that is a bit more boring but it returns 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.110
 to be a normal career are added to 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.690
 these two rush hour and rush that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.830
 normal races are also what I 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.769
 I really hoped it was that they had 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.660
 put something kind I do not know in more jumps more 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.910
 in contrary directions but instead 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.730
 have done have included careers that do not 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.690
 they have nothing of any incentive 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.430
 important finally this long 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.530
 distance 2 follows is very entertaining 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.510
 especially if you play with your friends 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.370
 everything is a career throughout 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.620
 the map is to say that if you do not have much 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.030
 I do not recommend it to you, passing the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.069
 Death games would have the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.739
 heliport of death that is super 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.630
 fun but always playing with little 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.130
 people if you are too much will not be so 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.349
 fun because it's going to be all the time 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.030
 dying then I would not have so much 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.380
 fun hell on horse too 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.660
 it would be fine but just the opposite 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.110
 that the previous one would be better if you are 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.030
 much 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.130
 but if you are few you are not going to see 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.260
 the map the last two that are battle 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.120
 in the refuge and bunbury both the first 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.190
 played with few people like the second 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.630
 they have a lot of fun 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.340
 this is more normal than 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.200
 previous and up to here all the 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.240
 races and all the games to deaths 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.980
 new to finish telling you that I have 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.200
 enough mysteries that I want to upload to 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.030
 an impressive channel 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.860
 that you are not going to believe and tell you that 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.150
 If you want to see them, be attentive to 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.920
 channel without May I hope you have 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.050
 liked do not forget to leave your 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.500
 comment and greetings and even the 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.280
 next 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.280
 goodbye
