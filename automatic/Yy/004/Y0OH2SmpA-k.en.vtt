so<00:03:18.680> basically<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.400> took<00:03:19.460> it<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:19.940> then<00:03:20.660> I

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
so basically I just took it and then I

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.420 
so basically I just took it and then I
found<00:03:21.710> a<00:03:22.220> voice<00:03:23.710> closing<00:03:24.710> sighs<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.190> really

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
found a voice closing sighs I really

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.130 
found a voice closing sighs I really
don't<00:03:25.580> think<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:25.940> even<00:03:26.090> matters<00:03:26.630> but<00:03:26.900> just

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
don't think that even matters but just

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.530 
don't think that even matters but just
in<00:03:27.290> case<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.890> then<00:03:28.240> I<00:03:29.240> end<00:03:29.480> up<00:03:29.890> replacing<00:03:30.890> I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
in case and then I end up replacing I

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.080 
in case and then I end up replacing I
believe<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.750> replaced<00:03:33.310> 39<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.340> believe<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:34.940> is

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
believe I replaced 39 I believe this is

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.200 
believe I replaced 39 I believe this is
the<00:03:35.210> one<00:03:35.470> yes<00:03:36.470> because<00:03:36.920> 819<00:03:37.610> was<00:03:37.820> when<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.090> was

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
the one yes because 819 was when it was

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.920 
the one yes because 819 was when it was
created<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.760> basically<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.210> just<00:03:41.450> renamed<00:03:41.780> the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
created so basically I just renamed the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.400 
created so basically I just renamed the
two<00:03:42.080> files<00:03:42.350> from<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.340> TomTom<00:03:43.790> mr.<00:03:44.210> T<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:44.690> then

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
two files from the TomTom mr. T and then

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.830 
two files from the TomTom mr. T and then
just<00:03:45.740> replaced<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.700> that's<00:03:47.540> why<00:03:47.780> it

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
just replaced it and that's why it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.390 
just replaced it and that's why it
replaced<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.440> weird<00:03:48.620> language<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.220> then<00:03:49.370> I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
replaced that weird language so then I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.580 
replaced that weird language so then I
basically<00:03:49.610> had<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.060> go<00:03:50.240> through<00:03:50.450> all<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
basically had to go through all the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.710 
basically had to go through all the
voices<00:03:51.770> until<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.310> heard<00:03:52.430> mr.<00:03:52.790> t<00:03:52.940> but<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.510> worked

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
voices until I heard mr. t but it worked

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.410 
voices until I heard mr. t but it worked
and<00:03:54.200> that's<00:03:54.980> how<00:03:55.160> once<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:55.670> do<00:03:55.850> that<00:03:55.880> once<00:03:56.300> you

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
and that's how once you do that once you

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.060 
and that's how once you do that once you
replace<00:03:56.540> those<00:03:56.900> files<00:03:58.300> select<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.480> voice

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070
