so<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.380> linear<00:00:01.740> actuator<00:00:02.399> of<00:00:02.550> the

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so this is the linear actuator of the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.200 
so this is the linear actuator of the
building

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
building

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.889 
building
it<00:00:03.990> basically<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:05.130> old<00:00:05.549> printer<00:00:06.120> parts<00:00:06.480> those

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
it basically is old printer parts those

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.070 
it basically is old printer parts those
two<00:00:07.470> rods<00:00:07.799> there<00:00:08.250> are<00:00:08.580> from<00:00:09.389> an<00:00:09.480> old<00:00:09.660> printer

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
two rods there are from an old printer

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.910 
two rods there are from an old printer
and<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:11.190> middle<00:00:11.429> threaded<00:00:11.940> rod<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.570> from<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and that middle threaded rod is from the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.379 
and that middle threaded rod is from the
hardware<00:00:14.340> store<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.700> piece<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.179> stainless

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
hardware store the piece of stainless

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.830 
hardware store the piece of stainless
steel<00:00:15.719> rod<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.230> foot<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> half<00:00:17.220> long

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
steel rod about foot and a half long

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.330 
steel rod about foot and a half long
underneath<00:00:18.840> there<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.010> are

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
underneath there you can see that are

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.870 
underneath there you can see that are
the<00:00:20.520> slides<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> printers<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.880> over

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the slides and the printers and over

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.140 
the slides and the printers and over
here<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:25.140> hard<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.500> see<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> rod<00:00:26.939> goes

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
here it's hard to see but the rod goes

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.179 
here it's hard to see but the rod goes
through<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> T<00:00:27.960> nut<00:00:28.140> underneath<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
through that is a T nut underneath and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.299 
through that is a T nut underneath and
to<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:30.050> I'm<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.349> put<00:00:31.619> some<00:00:31.859> bearings

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to that I'm going to put some bearings

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.580 
to that I'm going to put some bearings
on<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.520> end<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> hold<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> rod<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.350> need<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
on the end to hold the rod but I need to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.080 
on the end to hold the rod but I need to
get<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> spade<00:00:35.040> bit<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> right<00:00:35.610> size<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
get a spade bit of the right size to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.000 
get a spade bit of the right size to
counterbore<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> order<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
counterbore that in order to the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.940 
counterbore that in order to the
bearings<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.520> place<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.469> Christmas<00:00:40.469> day<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
bearings in place and Christmas day so I

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.150 
bearings in place and Christmas day so I
can't<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.440> what<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.890> I've<00:00:44.129> got

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
can't do that but what I do is I've got

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.440 
can't do that but what I do is I've got
Phil's<00:00:45.020> gm8<00:00:46.460> adapter<00:00:47.460> which<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:47.969> hold<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
Phil's gm8 adapter which has hold the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.389 
Phil's gm8 adapter which has hold the
gm8<00:00:48.930> onto<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.230> rod<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
gm8 onto this of the rod and when I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.849 
gm8 onto this of the rod and when I
start<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:56.190> watch<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.859> pull

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
start it up you watch and it will pull

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.950 
start it up you watch and it will pull
the<00:00:59.039> platform<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.820> way<00:01:01.910> now<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.300> GMA<00:01:03.809> it's

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the platform this way now the GMA it's

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.450 
the platform this way now the GMA it's
got<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:05.659> 130<00:01:06.659> 301<00:01:07.229> reduction<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.100> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
got like about 130 301 reduction so this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.310 
got like about 130 301 reduction so this
is<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:09.060> slow<00:01:09.799> probably<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.860> can't<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.580> for

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
is very slow probably I can't use it for

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
is very slow probably I can't use it for
what<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> use<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.509> good

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
what I want to use it for but it's good

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.850 
what I want to use it for but it's good
for<00:01:15.869> testing<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.560> don't<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
for testing because I don't have to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.149 
for testing because I don't have to
fiddle<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.189> stepper<00:01:17.490> motors<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.840> um<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.560> get

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
fiddle with stepper motors to um to get

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039 
fiddle with stepper motors to um to get
this<00:01:20.369> working<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.030> different<00:01:21.420> orders<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this working this different orders are I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
this working this different orders are I
don't<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.799> how<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.130> them<00:01:23.250> yet

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
don't really know how to use them yet

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.160 
don't really know how to use them yet
I'm<00:01:23.490> still<00:01:23.640> learning<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:24.990> can

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I'm still learning but that way I can

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
I'm still learning but that way I can
use<00:01:25.200> an<00:01:25.409> animal<00:01:25.710> regular<00:01:26.100> old<00:01:26.250> motor<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> just

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
use an animal regular old motor and just

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
use an animal regular old motor and just
figure<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.210> how<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.930> works<00:01:28.670> one<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
figure out how it works one of the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240 
figure out how it works one of the
things<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.600> build<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.110> basically<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> just

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
things to build this basically I just

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.109 
things to build this basically I just
build<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.610> box<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.360> MDF<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:35.100> use<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
build a box out of MDF and then use a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.039 
build a box out of MDF and then use a
drill<00:01:36.689> press<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.500> drill<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.549> holes

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
drill press and then drill all the holes

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
drill press and then drill all the holes
there's<00:01:40.049> holes<00:01:40.409> underneath<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.450> things

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
there's holes underneath these things

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
there's holes underneath these things
these<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.170> end<00:01:43.290> caps<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.860> hold<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> rods

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
these little end caps to hold the rods

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
these little end caps to hold the rods
in<00:01:44.579> place<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.720> rod<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> holes<00:01:46.380> are

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
in place but the rod of the holes are

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.370 
in place but the rod of the holes are
perfectly<00:01:46.770> parallel<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.610> way<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.380> then

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
perfectly parallel that way and then

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.480 
perfectly parallel that way and then
what<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.509> build<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.930> sled<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.799> top<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
what I do is build the sled on top of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
what I do is build the sled on top of
the<00:01:53.640> thing<00:01:53.909> when<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.210> done<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.320> basically

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the thing when it's done so basically

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
the thing when it's done so basically
you<00:01:56.219> end<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.430> using<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> jig<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.810> build

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you end up using it as a jig to build

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.300 
you end up using it as a jig to build
the<00:01:58.229> sled<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.560> everything<00:01:59.070> ends<00:01:59.219> up

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the sled and everything ends up

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.500 
the sled and everything ends up
perfectly<00:01:59.700> parallel<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.500> works
