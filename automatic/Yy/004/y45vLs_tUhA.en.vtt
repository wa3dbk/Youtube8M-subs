ukulele ukulele it's for mandolin but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.929 
ukulele ukulele it's for mandolin but
you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.000> also<00:01:03.180> tune<00:01:03.650> wind<00:01:04.820> instruments<00:01:05.820> such

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you can also tune wind instruments such

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.740 
you can also tune wind instruments such
as<00:01:05.970> woodwinds<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.380> flutes<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.450> also<00:01:09.450> brass

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
as woodwinds like flutes and also brass

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170 
as woodwinds like flutes and also brass
like<00:01:10.110> trumpets<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.799> stuff<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.909> reason

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
like trumpets and stuff so the reason

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.899 
like trumpets and stuff so the reason
why<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.390> has<00:01:12.990> no<00:01:13.260> input<00:01:13.830> jack<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.640> no

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
why this has no input jack and no

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.899 
why this has no input jack and no
microphone<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.130> clip<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
microphone is because you clip it on to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
microphone is because you clip it on to
your<00:01:18.000> instrument<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.439> senses<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
your instrument and it senses the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.780 
your instrument and it senses the
vibrations<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.540> instrument<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.790> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
vibrations of the instrument and you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.990 
vibrations of the instrument and you
tune<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.830> turn<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> regular

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
tune it you turn it just like a regular

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
tune it you turn it just like a regular
tuner<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.750> instead<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> don't<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
tuner but instead of you don't have to

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.130 
tuner but instead of you don't have to
plug<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> into<00:01:29.310> anything<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:30.960> have

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
plug it into anything and you don't have

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.539 
plug it into anything and you don't have

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to use the microphone important part

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.310
