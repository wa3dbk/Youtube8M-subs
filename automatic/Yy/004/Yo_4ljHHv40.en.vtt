00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
to get through this hole I'm constantly
being<00:00:57.120> attacked<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.780> there's<00:00:58.350> no<00:00:58.500> way<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
being attacked and there's no way to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
being attacked and there's no way to
even<00:00:58.829> stay<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.460> there<00:00:59.910> before<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.899> just

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
even stay up there before they just

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500 
even stay up there before they just
knock<00:01:01.440> me<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:01.710> kick<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:03.090> don't

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
knock me over kick me around I don't

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.609 
knock me over kick me around I don't
know<00:01:03.600> how<00:01:03.690> much<00:01:03.840> damage<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.290> would<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.500> taken

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
know how much damage I would have taken

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
know how much damage I would have taken
there's<00:01:04.949> no<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.580> ever<00:01:05.790> possible<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
there's no way this is ever possible and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
there's no way this is ever possible and
this<00:01:07.470> brain<00:01:07.799> matter<00:01:08.100> keeps<00:01:08.400> growing<00:01:08.850> back

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
this brain matter keeps growing back

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
this brain matter keeps growing back
over<00:01:09.390> time<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.229> constantly

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
over time so if you're not constantly

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
over time so if you're not constantly
hitting<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> grow<00:01:12.270> even

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
hitting it it's going to grow even

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.850 
hitting it it's going to grow even
bigger<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.799> able

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
bigger and you're not going to be able

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190 
bigger and you're not going to be able
to<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.130> through<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.360> since<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.750> constantly

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to get through that since I'm constantly

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020 
to get through that since I'm constantly
being<00:01:16.470> knocked<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.310> can't<00:01:17.549> stand<00:01:17.820> still

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
being knocked around I can't stand still

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
being knocked around I can't stand still
and<00:01:18.330> constantly<00:01:18.780> hit<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> thing<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.650> can

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and constantly hit this thing so I can

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
and constantly hit this thing so I can
make<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> hole<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:21.540> another<00:01:21.810> nice<00:01:22.080> put

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
make a hole and it's another nice put

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.260 
make a hole and it's another nice put
down<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.680> mother<00:01:23.460> brain<00:01:23.700> doesn't<00:01:24.000> even

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
down that mother brain doesn't even

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.230 
down that mother brain doesn't even
fight<00:01:24.540> back<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:25.170> me<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:26.100> stands<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.939> or

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240
