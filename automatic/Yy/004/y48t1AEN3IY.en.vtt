00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.650
 start of music when you were 11 years old 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 I started not comment like this with a guitar because my sister does class 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.619
 of guitar 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.629
 with teachers at home 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.599
 and then I decided to screen it 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.169
 is at the same time after she dropped out I continued the guitar class with the 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.409
 creditors years 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.259
 and delve a bit I am not giving classical music beyond the bit of 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.189
 sheet music 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.089
 but my business was 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.820
 the venice rock bands that I was listening to as a hubble bikes man 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.289
 I wanted to know how to 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.080
 I played with the songs, right? 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.410
 half an hour later when the father or mother 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.010
 of the Mayan chamber cg black 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 and then I went by the right with teachers who happened to me there 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.310
 has been barred from miranda 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.570
 dog 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.870
 for about nadine 3d 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.610
 and there studying things getting more and more liking increasingly sharp guitar 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 and then how he started his career 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 I always considered myself a disciplined guy in relation to everything there 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.300
 talat because I always played in five to six hours a day 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.260
 and it was not an early forced thing I always had the pleasure of staying 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.630
 Playing so many hours a day. 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.550
 because this is a so so personal title testoni tequila music 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.630
 and know how to choose the exercises to reap the things you are going to study 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.220
 to make it something that gives you pleasure 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.090
 and did not do a boring thing 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.580
 This one is in front of you, you're playing several hours a day. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.050
 this came because I have always had an interest in being a professional musician 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.730
 I had no prospect of 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.700
 iara 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.030
 illusion of being a big country with a rock band or that the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.430
 thing like that 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.770
 at the time he was even for those who live from his music 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.920
 can play avoid running in my life 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.110
 so always 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.570
 I was a guy dedicated to 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.300
 play various styles 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 the fab is a score playing a song of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.090
 even because I also like defeat we exist 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.129
 but if you want to betray your conscience and you are prepared 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.520
 but suddenly one day 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.279
 and it's called vandinho 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.489
 to prepare its management and invites the ready ones with him as happened 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.619
 in the future 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.629
 prepared for all that I always thought would be better 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.419
 m 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.150
 to play the guitar even if it was a song he liked so much 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.479
 saw 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.509
 have to work on something else 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.289
 then it is critical if you know how to choose the technical exercises that you most 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:35.349
 likes the songs you like and transforms 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:41.219
 the exercises in studies where everything that surreal touches a house is a song 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.809
 of that be musical ' 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.449
 because you can keep repeating those ones exercise by 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:47.369
 techniques 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.839
 for several minutes several hours 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.719
 So it was always pleasurable for me, but I'd be back from school 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.459
 irritate and keep playing 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.009
 the whole day 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.349
 and another very important thing as well 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.569
 she knows how to divide the various subjects 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.609
 what do you have in music 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.619
 How can you read agreements? 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.499
 the technique itself that is still going to divide 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.029
 know suite know 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.469
 the alternating apple apple knows how to play with good hands 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.159
 to be touched in a clean way knows how to play with only one important detail 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.179
 emerged 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.339
 is the timbiras search 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:27.740
 and knows about harmony theory is not captured the silly things 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.659
 but this is a series of subjects 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.129
 if you have to sell over the week 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.739
 Why of all of them that you know that you can go deeper 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.299
 It will be difficult these days. 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.549
 with all the commitments of the year and this already 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.390
 at least 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.799
 10 years 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.889
 it is very difficult to maintain the study load 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.399
 that I had when I was 15 years old 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:57.069
 so we'll try the title tell gets ringing up the plane by little to 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.119
 annoying tulum everywhere 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.739
 or suddenly on the street 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.170
 little italy in the country dilma 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.689
 take stand as giving everyone 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.779
 It was a long awaited interview I'm going to be playing here too 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.339
 to always leave until the cause 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.859
 cool because it's suddenly 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.650
 the morning has a commitment that I have to stop 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.850
 with the technique above and suddenly I stayed a week traveling does not give nor 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.199
 to play guitar right 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.249
 it's very complicated this 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:28.169
 But we have to find a way, we have to try. 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.389
 maintain that technical standard li a knowledge also had its first 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.729
 book a thing and would have also been in harmony 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.189
 but the deal is without commenting the hand as every hour has been playing like this 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:43.490
 waiting for something to record 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.029
 to a photo session tauseef playing there 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.830
 not the best is not indicated but at least 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.830
 if he keeps his technique up to date 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.659
 people always ask me what my influences are 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.349
 on the guitar 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.180
 it's a difficult answer 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.370
 Why is it that you only live in phases of the time of the season? 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.559
 this different 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.559
 but I really like the day to hear the advice are for example 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.139
 the works usually without the use mainly the oldest things to 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.610
 of the povinho likes you several 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.830
 satriani 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.800
 we had them for example have the best guitarists who 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.930
 What's up, Nicolas? 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.979
 and understands the subject of his work in the testimony also all the services of 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:30.629
 on duty 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.219
 by citing these Brazilians 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.020
 which have greatly influenced 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.400
 perhaps even more than these foreigners 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.550
 I want hospitals we saw at dances that we were going to attend as 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.970
 model at the time I had class for so many years 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.279
 the spark 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.229
 the eduardo ardanuy 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.330
 the hotel more with the heraldo of the hill in which it is a thing but Brazilian rita 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.189
 the helium delmiro error 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.979
 who recorded several mpb albums in the 70's 80's 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.689
 it is important to mention that we are not obsolete the answer can 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.740
 learn a lot from other musicians from other instruments 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.620
 so I'm a lot of Brazilian promises like kindle paulo 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.819
 bellinati 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.000
 can i come too 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.509
 pianists 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.399
 as if he threatened to review any 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.080
 disgraceful 10 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.110
 and so on is the muscles 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.129
 so virtuoso communities very hermeto pascoal 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.119
 and they have a very strong range very retention of music very 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.569
 is linked to the fall can learn a lot 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.699
 both of Brazilian music and the improvisation of a more ser 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.699
 free 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.999
 besides the work I do with herrera 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.999
 I have a working definition that you could check out in the next video with the 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.430
 new selma music 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.379
 It's a job that I played in the drums and philosophy in the bar. 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:58.889
 that our plus my side of him I like Brazilian music and define together 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:06:59.550
 action 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.380
 we also do so many others 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.849
 by brazil travel through japan 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.430
 where I can show some of my side over date 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.310
 because 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.270
 I gave so many years of classes, I really like to teach 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.639
 and I've had so many students coming 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.680
 they were so good or they did not understand much happiness 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.129
 and even business is pleasurable to me 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.949
 so procon at least with others what I can condemn a little more 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:23.369
 doing this
