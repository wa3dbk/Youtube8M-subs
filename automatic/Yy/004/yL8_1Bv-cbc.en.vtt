00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.660
 doc sitter for two to three years 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.820
 now it's happening to me 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.369
 France to lead dogs to make 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
 guards at home so under present and 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.210
 flight then I first every day 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.730
 half an hour or an hour it depends 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.880
 of the master's need so far from late the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.890
 evening or not and it lasts for a month to 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.210
 fewer balls with and run I had 130 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.100
 euros its origins 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.219
 I think he's starting to have some 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.219
 affection 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.380
 the problem every day at the same time 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.670
 that we can happily I was 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.220
 student in 2 p sale action merchant 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.770
 kept them children or even round 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.540
 my end of the month and finally I am 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.480
 fell beyond the name of an old lady who 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.430
 wanted to walk his sound 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.320
 yorkshire me it's the brilliance of playing 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.810
 with animals we do not really have 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.570
 the impression of working the task 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.710
 easy but my arm hurts 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.509
 it will always be this idea before him to 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.040
 priori I think we can talk to 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.869
 people reassure them in the street when they 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.320
 are afraid do not worry he's 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.409
 nice 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.259
 even if it's a big wolf ah no 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.639
 all a love I think it takes 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.310
 know the dogs to be able to do 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:21.219
 this job there are things to know there 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.509
 basic rules to know and it takes 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.459
 not do any nonsense because not 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.499
 the cat's opinion and to people's lives saw 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.959
 low and pat responsibilities at this time 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:31.190
 that was the same not because it 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.930
 with a big dog like that 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.850
 finally I will not do it if I was scared 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.350
 really really scared and saw 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.690
 currently at my parents so I do not 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.940
 can not do whole weeks of 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.200
 guard of big dogs it is not possible 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.060
 in this case I can keep 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.680
 small dogs and rodent cats 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.390
 there are many animals 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.640
 there is to tell you we even have two 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.920
 hens at home foal cats 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.610
 three dogs turtles and turtles 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.200
 and fish 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.900
 once you've missed mine 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.760
 with whom to play both we start 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.280
 with the calls just now I 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.450
 circumvented the reason with the dog because 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.590
 that I lose to who wants them 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 interviews or things go wrong and I 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.430
 afraid they even have me with him I 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.800
 passed by force or even withhold 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.600
 I can find missions 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.730
 to keep the animals walking them or 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.590
 then do house guards in 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.140
 see you by word of mouth so with 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.390
 the people I know either through the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.440
 websites either with people 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.940
 that I meet in the street in 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.590
 walking companies when we go through 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.860
 a specialized site like the leader 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.570
 gardicanin or other there is always a 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.670
 commission that is taken by the site 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.590
 but it's easier to find 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.580
 missions via their website that 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.100
 by our own means 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.650
 today it's classic you are 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.910
 tired of waiting for him it's a day 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.420
 and do not worry about it 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.420
 the deputy
