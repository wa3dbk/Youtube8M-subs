 violence occurs everywhere in all social classes and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.870
 management 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.629
 a man who assaulted these rare state of world access to the capital 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.040
 at first the intention is to expand in the capital but the intention 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.250
 of the court of justice accompanying the law maria da pena 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.290
 I extend 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.719
 this specialization to all the districts of the state 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.889
 defeated by their new common home 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.229
 the small specialized staff of rio de janeiro 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.919
 on the common stick 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.480
 on nikki sixx and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.769
 a celebration of the materials 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.889
 so there is a service 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.289
 to the situations 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:18.969
 on the 15th 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.279
 to criminal proceedings 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.989
 but as actively transacting the deeds related to violence 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:24.940
 domestic 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.850
 this does not allow judges who do not allow the team that works 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.320
 in the farm areas with global care that is the spirit 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.879
 in the law maria da cliff the psychosocial referral the referral 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.919
 the area of ​​health in the health area 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.559
 legal redirection 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.559
 The judge tries hard for the judge to do 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.839
 than a possible malaise 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:51.089
 not always the result is the desired result overall result 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.439
 to resolve these conflicts 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.190
 which usually occur in one's own home 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.250
 already the end to prevent now has been of the law Maria of the cliff for five years and only 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.869
 now that we realize the overcoming of these specific areas 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.899
 which is the biggest difficulty 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:09.089
 the audited institutions 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:13.589
 specialized staff exists but in terms of budgetary constraints 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.609
 we have to limit actions also by the law it is necessary that there exist 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.479
 those vacancies created by law that there must be 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.779
 judges 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.240
 by law 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.550
 the parade on stage in this complex situation that domestic violence and 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.220
 family 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.220
 it was concluded that the best solution 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.870
 the specialization of vacancies 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.600
 and it is in this sense that I work a court of justice at the same level of the police station 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.730
 specialized in the care of women as 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.100
 the number of candidates can only have taken out the amount charged by justice 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.639
 director 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.500
 the lawyer 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.720
 the police station because it is the first way it has several colors in the real ressacada 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.000
 possibilities she can look for 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.389
 the woman's police station 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.920
 who will make the referral 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.979
 to the forum is the current deputy 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.569
 the net 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.150
 to seek a lawyer she can seek the public defender she can 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:07.559
 driving directly to the vehicle have been 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.010

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.970
 and there are several other protective measures that are granted if there is 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.380
 need for the woman everything will testify depends on the concrete case
