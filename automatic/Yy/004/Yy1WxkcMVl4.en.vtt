00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.740
 a soul tells us about going to have four 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.980
 what about battlefield butterfield 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.030
 the one that passed two bots and the user mod 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.040
 they will have to wait 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.070
 well here in the 'great news' you give a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.010
 contemplate for the moment and introduce 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.189
 battery fer 4 does not contemplate under bots nor 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.000
 dinosaur mode lars gustafsson but that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.010
 he knows sip and his team have preferred 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.540
 focus on the multiplayer in the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.340
 multiple lars gustafsson but the name 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.810
 more strange to creative director of dance 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.060
 has answered the questions asked 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.460
 by the community of players regarding 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.890
 the possibilities of playing against bots 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.580
 attack 04 the followers of the saga 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.610
 they will have to wait says the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.870
 Ais team although is aware of 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.380
 the possibilities of positions like 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.560
 training 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.600
 in the face of online gaming has preferred in 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.110
 focus most of your effort on the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.470
 multiplayer of 64 players both in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.380
 xbox had already been said before as 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.500
 for this fact the things that after playing 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.320
 against virtual levels guided by the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.240
 aunt artificial intelligence program 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.950
 this new in mind that the use of 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.110
 cloud because it is little to access a 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.060
 key graph of the future console 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.520
 microsoft and that instead of fighting 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.770
 against one of her conventional or so 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.170
 we could do against a guide a lot 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.830
 most advanced and intelligent that will inhabit 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.610
 in the cloud itself the boxes nexgen today 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.250
 well be unbeatable imagine the buggy 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.030
 king and the best place in the world combined 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.220
 in 1 s 4 a vision and also program 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.560
 would exploit the new resources of the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.300
 console but not but we in 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.759
 moment says dais we can only wait for 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.000
 enjoy in the near future this 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.000
 option 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.840
 in the bats on 5 a back company 3 or 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420
 anything that can come out at 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.539
 better or maybe maybe it changes from 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.539
 opinion 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.769
 with respect to being able to see dinosaurs in 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.550
 baa3 on 4 the course to which also 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.590
 received some of the previous deliveries 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.120
 of the saga can also go 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.680
 forgetting about these lines about 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.519
 aimed at zero the zombies 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.140
 court because there can not be wines in 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.790
 butterfield like I do not know for sure that 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.489
 there may be everything working the truth is 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.519
 that I'm not healing and not only see if 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.260
 dual as original but of course it's not going to 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:47.970
 have the same meaning and the same 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.970
 history that with crane 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.990
 zombies 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.940
 white two works with one thing that would be 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.560
 a bit difficult to give a separate story 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.230
 of that since also the fun of 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.740
 game is very expensive and imagine is 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.890
 how to create another game again in a 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.310
 video to see worth 4 we will have 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.090
 available on xbox ps3 pc from 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.120
 indrhi no of October 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.120
 and soon after xbox and pc 4 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:30.220
 extra that the woman who is playing this 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.440
 I started 3 profile 4 and this has a 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.849
 level determined there the most interesting 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.180
 is that you can pass that level to 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.800
 Playstation 4 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.220
 I think with your own 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.500
 and from playstation and xbox of freedom 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.750
 what thing that is not necessary anymore 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.030
 that's because well, but I think that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.010
 also that was a very big impact 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.530
 among the playstation 3 players that 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.180
 they go to alex james for bad luck 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.280
 of the times I think that understand this 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.010
 be careful because nothing else and that is already 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.230
 will have all the resources already required 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.670
 this one that has a precision 4 and a 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.170
 structure so I do not think I have 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.450
 no good problem is good news 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.040
 shows us the next news until the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.040
 next and see you
