00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 well let's hope to continue of course and now 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.200
 well what I'm going to tell you adventurers 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.360
 very well let's talk now about this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.370
 new law new provision of the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.680
 national transit agency that all 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.020
 when taking a taxi we must select 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.320
 I do not know that the unit has its 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.600
 Approved taximeter device that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.369
 has many advantages however the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.580
 great mystery is that if these 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.529
 devices can be altered or not 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 that they mark more than the approved rate 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.570
 in the following note we are going to show you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.140
 the answer and we will also indicate them 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.280
 how to identify an altered taximeter 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280
 let's see the chair 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.470
 one of the greatest advantages of 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.510
 approved taximeters is that they are not 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.180
 can alter to mark a value 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.790
 higher than usual to pay is 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 impossible the company did not have us 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.320
 programmed to close the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.809
 meter that I want to tell you to consider 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.090
 this determines the calibration and the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.010
 conception that each taximeter is going to be 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.650
 very driven in a certain vehicle 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 however if the skills of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.630
 some taxi drivers overstep the limits 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.020
 Here's how to tell if 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.000
 a taximeter is altered first you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
 You must know the rates according to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 the routes you take either day or in the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 night each kilometer costs 26 cents 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 second when the car is stopped the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.509
 device must increase a penny 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.820
 every 10 seconds and third the costs of 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.700
 races on the same route can not 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.940
 vary with one or two dollars as normal 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.110
 is that it varies in maximum between 50 and 60 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.180
 cents 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.680
 carlos gualÃ¡n technician of schumi track 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.380
 authorized company to sell these 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.020
 positive states that taximeters do not 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.960
 approved usually have some push buttons 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.290
 to mark more value to this you will be 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.790
 know how turbo is not like the others 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.710
 that are cloudy 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.630
 then the famous bull then they are from 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.179
 brand more then they are used to 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:16.080
 hit and then for the time being 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.080
 our taximeter is marking its success 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.100
 so before taking a taxi 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.320
 outside of which the unit has 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.660
 a taximeter that emits its respective 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.280
 ticket which assures you that the value 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.280
 of his career was just
