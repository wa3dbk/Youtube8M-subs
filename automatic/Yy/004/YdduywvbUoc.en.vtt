00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.560
 Hello everyone, I am laura and today 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.300
 I will make exquisite for you 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.579
 ricotta and spinach tortelli 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 this is a very popular recipe from the 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.270
 vegetarians I mean the design side 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.210
 years however actually for those who have 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.550
 decided to eat only food 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.589
 vegetables is not really tone and therefore 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.809
 I decided to offer you this recipe 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.670
 does not provide nor use them for egg 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 the pasta and some ricotta for the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.589
 stuffed 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.629
 the result, however, is surprisingly 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.460
 similar to that other recipe is from 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.719
 eye view that also from 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 how many in terms of taste 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.829
 obviously let's get to work right away 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 because it's not a recipe of its own 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.199
 fast so let's see what we need 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 to prepare about 30 35 signs that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.830
 are good for 6 people or 5 we are 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.500
 a lot of hunger for pasta you're with 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.369
 300 g of organic durum wheat semolina 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.619
 possibly 150 milliliters of water a 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 half a teaspoon of turmeric and half 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.670
 teaspoon of whole sea salt 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.509
 this too should be avoided 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.700
 full prairie sodium chloride instead 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.720
 we need a liter of milk of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 natural soy so not sweetened 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:39.989
 4 teaspoons of apple vinegar 2 balls 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:42.420
 of spinach already cooked and squeezed one 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:45.630
 garlic clove a nice grated of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.989
 nutmeg salt pepper and two tablespoons 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.840
 yesterday's bankruptcy rasi that will replace 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:54.810
 in a certain sense the parmesan for the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.950
 condiment today we will make the classic butter 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.009
 and sage using of course 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.450
 there was organic ruby but they are excellent 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.490
 also with a tomato sauce and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.560
 basil or with a 6- course ragù 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.550
 a walnut sauce 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.910
 let's see how to proceed first 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.370
 we prepare the pasta for the tortelli 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.790
 add salt and turmeric to the semolina 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.250
 we risk and then add water 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.250
 we knead for at least 5 minutes ad 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 have a nice and homogeneous mixture 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.690
 we cover with transparent film 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.480
 and let us rest for a while 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.430
 time at least half an hour 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.739
 but while the dough rests we prepare the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.319
 our vegetable path practically 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.190
 put in a pot to boil the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.380
 soya milk 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.830
 when it starts to boil we turn off e 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.260
 let's add the choice of 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.900
 of apples and a little bit of salt we leave 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 let's turn the milk let's see 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.980
 immediately will be formed strips of 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.760
 soy type completely cracking this 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.260
 milk 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.990
 we close let it rest one 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.860
 ten minutes after which we put in 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.020
 a colander a white cloth and we fly the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.090
 our soy mix we will see that 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.580
 the serum comes out practically transparent 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.500
 while the attached remains inside 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.410
 of the cloth we can 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.400
 rinse a little bit this cut into 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.920
 so to do go away 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.580
 that taste of vinegar that could 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.050
 stay and then wait for the cloth up 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.430
 to which we do not get a consistency 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.290
 similar to that reported in that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.790
 point we can see the preparation 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.600
 within the classes and provide dates 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.010
 cooked and leave it aside 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.220
 now we prepare spinach with our own 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.530
 we already had them filling 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.630
 then squeeze them down with a 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.570
 knife and then we brown them with 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.890
 a little oil and garlic 1 clove 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.670
 of garlic cut in half so as to 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.620
 raise it easily in a pan 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.660
 shortly after we add the pepper, in short 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.760
 we're like how we like them and there 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.100
 put in a bowl 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.410
 add the ricotta to this point 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.050
 about 150 grams of the revolt that 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.190
 we have prepared should be a 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.870
 a little more than half the food 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.940
 salt pepper and nutmeg 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.030
 let's mix our undercoat and ours 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.790
 filling is ready at this point we pass 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.850
 to make the real tortelli therefore 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.100
 we take our dough we get 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.959
 in conclusion 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
 small pieces to pass gradually into 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.830
 star of velai pasta base 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.890
 they call grandma duck to do le 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.930
 strips and make strips 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.460
 thin enough I arrive until 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.520
 penultimate kakà so not really 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.380
 very thin we give away some squares 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.110
 about 8 9 centimeters 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.980
 put in the center a teaspoon of 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.870
 stuffed we see it triangle and after that 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.270
 helping us with water both on the sides 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.810
 of the square that in the point where it is 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.250
 we meet the time we supply the tortelli 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.230
 at this point the tortelli are ready 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.110
 all that remains is to boil in abundance 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.260
 salt water we prepare in a pan 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.000
 our organic vegetable butter a 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.390
 little bit of extra virgin olive oil e 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.910
 the sage leaves and then when 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.680
 It spent about five minutes anyway 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.130
 touch at the intersection point must 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.020
 be a little soft we mix and one 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.020
 woman we put them in the pan 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.780
 I carry with me when the ravioli is drained 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.700
 a little bit of water pope together and 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.580
 this water will serve us to create also 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.800
 that little room and then we'll say a 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.560
 delight our dish when the 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.170
 salsetta will be just thick in short 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.610
 creamy we can lay them on ours 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.200
 plate decorate with the sage leaf 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.060
 we can offer him a sage leaf 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.330
 with pasta in the if I wanted to make one 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.600
 something a little more sophisticated and ready 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.700
 our tortelli that we can eat 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.760
 if you liked this video, put me there

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.820
 my blog where I transcribed on all 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.200
 ingredients for this procedure 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.200
 recipe to the next hello 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.960
 I don't want that I didn't think
