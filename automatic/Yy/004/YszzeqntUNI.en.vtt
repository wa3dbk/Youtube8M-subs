package of the treo pro was quite unique
as<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.330> see<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:24.840> quite<00:00:25.529> small<00:00:25.829> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
as you can see here it's quite small it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.170 
as you can see here it's quite small it
has<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> lot<00:00:27.149> of<00:00:27.180> them<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.630> phone<00:00:28.380> type<00:00:29.180> unboxing

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
has a lot of them I phone type unboxing

has a lot of them I phone type unboxing
features<00:00:30.540> and<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.800> forgot<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.329> had<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
features and I forgot and I had to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.090 
features and I forgot and I had to
travel<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.440> didn't<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> chance<00:00:34.890> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
travel out so I didn't get a chance to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.180 
travel out so I didn't get a chance to
post<00:00:36.710> some<00:00:38.570> some<00:00:39.570> video<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.800> device

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
post some some video of the device

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.910 
post some some video of the device
itself<00:00:41.429> in<00:00:41.910> action<00:00:42.359> so<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.589> wanted<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
itself in action so I kind of wanted to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.639 
itself in action so I kind of wanted to
do<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> little<00:00:44.399> walkthrough<00:00:44.699> of<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:46.230> device

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
do a little walkthrough of the device

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.489 
do a little walkthrough of the device
just<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.179> it<00:00:48.269> in<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.989> video

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
just so you get a look at it in in video

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.720 
just so you get a look at it in in video
or<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.899> hardware<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.730> there's

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
or so here is the hardware and there's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
or so here is the hardware and there's
the<00:00:53.879> keyboard<00:00:54.300> central<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.320> keyboard<00:00:56.159> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the keyboard central like keyboard and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.649 
the keyboard central like keyboard and
I'll<00:00:56.429> have<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.609> central<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.269> to<00:00:57.329> compare<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
I'll have the central here to compare it

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.809 
I'll have the central here to compare it
with<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.679> it's<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.129> wider<00:00:59.429> than<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
with but it's it's wider than the

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.729 
with but it's it's wider than the
central<00:01:00.179> keyboard<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.929> little<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.530> more

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
central keyboard a little bit more

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.220 
central keyboard a little bit more
spacing<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.609> larger<00:01:02.999> buttons<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:04.080> got

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
spacing the larger buttons it's got

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.630 
spacing the larger buttons it's got
hardware<00:01:04.650> buttons<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> nice<00:01:05.610> thing

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
hardware buttons and the nice thing

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.030 
hardware buttons and the nice thing
about<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.940> hardware<00:01:06.120> buttons<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.690> all<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
about the hardware buttons is all the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
about the hardware buttons is all the
hardware<00:01:08.280> buttons<00:01:08.550> i<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.240> both<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
hardware buttons i think but both the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.540 
hardware buttons i think but both the
sin<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.050> end<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.380> well<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.220> push<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
sin and the end as well if you push the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.110 
sin and the end as well if you push the
function<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.890> additional<00:01:14.120> launching

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
function you get additional launching

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.740 
function you get additional launching
capability<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:16.260> like<00:01:16.440> eight<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:16.740> nine

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
capability so you get like eight or nine

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.260 
capability so you get like eight or nine

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
options for launch for quick launching

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.520 
options for launch for quick launching

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
which actually that's pretty well but

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.780

on<00:02:35.129> there<00:02:35.569> on<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.750> side<00:02:36.959> we've<00:02:37.290> got<00:02:37.319> it's<00:02:38.310> on

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
on there on the side we've got it's on

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.770 
on there on the side we've got it's on
the<00:02:38.549> back<00:02:38.700> but<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.150> kind<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.450> rolls<00:02:39.660> around

to<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.080> side<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.560> speaker<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.250> can

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
to the side as the speaker so you can

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.220 
to the side as the speaker so you can
actually<00:02:41.610> still<00:02:42.239> hear<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.569> when<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:42.870> when

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
actually still hear it when it's when

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.009 
actually still hear it when it's when
it's<00:02:43.260> facedown<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:44.599> that's<00:02:45.599> pretty<00:02:45.780> much<00:02:45.900> it

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
it's facedown and that's pretty much it

it's facedown and that's pretty much it
on<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> hardware<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.549> ahead<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.879> turn

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.770 
applications I did a hard reset I I
don't<00:04:23.520> think<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.700> loaded<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:24.030> any<00:04:24.270> third-party
