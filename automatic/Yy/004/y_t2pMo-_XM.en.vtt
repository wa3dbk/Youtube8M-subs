00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello youtube friends we are here to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.480
 do a little tutorial about sting 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.890
 sorry the program has been opened 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.870
 but as I have no fucking idea 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.429
 how to configure it because I have to do it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.559
 manual in order 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.960
 steam was recently updated by adding 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.960
 one more option that is the fps counter 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.869
 is I think it was a day two like 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.060
 a lot and good the express meter is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.859
 basically it's like now you're going to see 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 but he will show us the images by 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.150
 second that is transmitting our 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.430
 game allen according to game goes from whore to 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 prove to 67 slumps and maybe 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.260
 will show less in order I do not know if the option 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.480
 it is only for those who are in 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.770
 beta but I 'm going to teach you in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.840
 Anyway how to enter beta 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.420
 because it is very simple and it is also super 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.059
 free and all this wrong then sting 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
 parameters that you do not have here and for 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.170
 get into beta you're just going to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.449
 account and look is down here that puts 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.039
 participation in beta and to you we 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.620
 this will come out but why not establish 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.780
 it's easy for me without because I know what 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.790
 I have then good to you to change and you 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.510
 this drop-down menu will come out 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.650
 the information and the whole roll to this 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 dropdown and the beta dismissal 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.260
 this will do is to restart 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.570
 estimate that files are being downloaded again and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.740
 in those files for this post all the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.620
 configuration of which they are working 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.240
 right now this is done for 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.100
 the typical thing that had a game not a beta 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.440
 tester that is what it does then try the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 game before anyone else to see if he has 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.760
 failures and have such a good thing to that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.320
 will therefore add the new options to the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.970
 Beta added some new options and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 you can all try it before anyone else 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.840
 you know before they were put 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 for all the public this is totally 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.670
 you do not have any problems for free and then 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.070
 you go in to activate the frames os 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.200
 you give in a game and here is the option 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 of show in game frames the frames bar 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.990
 you will accept, that is, when you are and 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.729
 simply then to accept 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.110
 ok now I'm going to teach you because 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.710
 example the super meat boy that with 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.149
 extras 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.570
 I've set up before so that it opens up in 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.570
 window 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.090
 it's a game and top left 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.989
 in this case 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.830
 to play games 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.690
 well this has been today's video 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.480
 I hope you liked it like 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.849

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.280

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.330

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.330
 shabby possible
