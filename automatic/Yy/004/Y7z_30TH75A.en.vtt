game this weakness this is not his
weakness<00:04:49.030> weakness<00:04:50.500> but<00:04:51.500> it's<00:04:51.620> not<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:52.250> thing

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
weakness weakness but it's not the thing

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.159 
weakness weakness but it's not the thing
is<00:04:52.639> they<00:04:53.030> don't<00:04:53.060> actually<00:04:53.389> have<00:04:53.569> weaknesses

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
is they don't actually have weaknesses

is they don't actually have weaknesses
in<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.530> game<00:04:54.710> because<00:04:55.099> all<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.639> weapons

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
in this game because all the weapons

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.890 
in this game because all the weapons
with<00:04:56.630> different<00:04:57.050> amounts<00:04:57.349> of<00:04:57.410> damage<00:04:58.900> the

with different amounts of damage the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.839 
with different amounts of damage the
problem<00:05:00.289> is<00:05:00.440> is<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:01.220> basically<00:05:01.610> means

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
problem is is that this basically means

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.029 
problem is is that this basically means
only<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.360> few<00:05:02.599> weapons<00:05:02.960> or<00:05:03.050> anything<00:05:03.289> sounds
