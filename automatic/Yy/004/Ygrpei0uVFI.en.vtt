00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.609 

and<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:18.770> use<00:01:19.220> kind<00:01:19.579> of<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:20.170> flipping<00:01:21.170> kind<00:01:21.470> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 

because<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.230> blend<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> rest<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.160> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
because we have to blend the rest of it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.730 
because we have to blend the rest of it
so<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.060> can't<00:01:36.300> have<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.480> sharp<00:01:36.780> line<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
so you can't have a sharp line that you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700 
so you can't have a sharp line that you
always<00:01:38.100> want<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> use<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.080> flip<00:01:40.080> motion

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
always want to use like a flip motion

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:51.270 
always want to use like a flip motion
out

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.880
