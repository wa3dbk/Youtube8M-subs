00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.420
 jackie where are we going to put 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.420
 the screws 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.119
 and let's try it 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.339
 sign the hill now or using the tournaments 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.339
 that comes with it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.519
 the screws 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.849
 they must reach the end but 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.729
 josé rujano about 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.980
 the thin plywood and then the softening raft 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.810
 if it does with a lot of force 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.990
 is going to pass the lithium 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.210
 If they want 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 make me listen 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 the dogs that you send enrolled in the wood 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 What we can do is 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.420
 after this remove them pay us 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.110
 sign a little to serve all those objects that have been 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
 chonago thirteen stories object this year 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.090
 let it dry time put it back frank 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.780
 that way they will find out 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.300
 more children 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.830
 let's check before continuing 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 bush and the hinges cheeses that hold the ailerons 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.150
 these are the ailerons 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.300
 this month 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.620
 well firm 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.590
 joke that come well attached 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.820
 because 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.260
 we throw a 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 we check all the hinges 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760
 in the two ailerons we do the verification 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.690
 kyla evans move freely 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.850
 at least 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.170
 on a tour 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.140
 bush is from mid centimeters above and another absent 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.820
 in the middle two centimeters below 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.409
 if you do not do it if you do not freely travel the most likely 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 I would like you to touch up 15 buildings 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.790
 maybe team 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.420
 these holes 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.410
 countries not well 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.610
 these recently large enough to allow the control of the spoiler 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 I worked throughout his journey 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.099
 in this case it is not necessary to do anything but it could happen that it was necessary 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.829
 let's put now in the 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.769
 that is the controls that go 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.429
 dbb 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.279
 the hill and command the ailerons 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.260
 until the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.029
 controls of the Andes 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.029
 two elements that we are going to use that lives on the floor 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.009
 let's use 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.580
 we are going to win the room approached us 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.580
 as for the type that also comes along with the sermon 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.869
 and insurance 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.869
 to fix the points of the agreement 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.029
 let's start with 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.179
 the shots 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.179
 in the controls 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 of the eaves 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.969
 how high are we going to export these pieces 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.939
 will influence 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.829
 how much the alirón moves in relation to the movement of sar 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.369
 let's start 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.859
 putting them at a height of approximately 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.989
 about three millimeters 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.039
 from lara the end 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.039
 of the wire 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.539
 It is important that the two pieces 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.029
 at the same distance but the shot went to the environment 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.809
 identically 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.899
 if we were a taller piece and others lower 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:45.899
 one spoiler is going to move more than the other 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.619
 So be it 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.619
 with the new rules 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.149
 there we have 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.149
 two and a half minutes 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.139
 2013 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.199
 the tongue this piece proves 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.039
 looking south 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.039
 let's put together before 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.799
 expand to search 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.799
 vitoria 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.219
 We are going to provide the cuit inc 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.300
 more or less until the middle of the day 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.840
 a little 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840
 after 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.199
 we will have the opportunity if necessary 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.209
 of readjusting it running the most socially inward out 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.009
 let's proceed now to mount the culichi 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.009
 in the shot 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.990
 for now we assemble them like this 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.990
 since we are only going to take the measurement 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.499
 we want everything we are definitely going to put 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.439
 a bit of silicone way 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.900
 to make sure it's not rock 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.919
 the computer that brought 3rd place is not suitable for this function 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.559
 surfaces 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.559
 we are not going to change 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.629
 let's put a horn of this type 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.419
 in such a way that he wants 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.610
 at 90 degrees with respect to the euro 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.499
 alice del cerro 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.499
 later we are going to remove this horn again 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.759
 and we are going to 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.539
 to the correct position but for that we need to extend the radius 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.240
 connecting the receiver 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.259
 for now we leave them like this 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.490
 if we place it 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.490
 at 90 degrees with respect to injuries 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.849
 in this notebook 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.849
 they will go 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.999
 none is ready 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:12.610
 among others you have to fold 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.830
 90 degrees 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.830
 so that karzai in the hole 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.759
 the final decision on Sunday 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.960
 I'm focused 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.800
 so that is aligned
