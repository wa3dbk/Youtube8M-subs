 articles on the site 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.720
 Kazakhoil Administrator 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.080
 our place yes remember them 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.640
 and what later will we 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.270
 often in favor of the father adding new 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.350
 materials even click on the base 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.640
 material 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.480
 document expressed to pages for 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.390
 adding new material and here we are 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.280
 you need to specify in the first title 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.629
 of this material 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.950
 if we look in Ukraine 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.260
 but here's the title of the year 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.490
 then you can copy its price 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.210
 and you put the team if he released 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.820
 internet coin at hand yes what can you 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.860
 take them extra 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.470
 materials are all lyrics from this 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.650
 site yes sample and already take them from there 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.770
 So we are heading further go 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.010
 pseudonym here indicated in principle not 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.410
 necessarily if you specify something 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.930
 here indicate in Latin letters 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.890
 little exactly 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.010
 some short name is permissible from 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.950
 plan 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.210
 do not usually see it 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 and so far I have never experienced such problems 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760
 Further section and category we are not 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.900
 we specify because we add this 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.650
 an article like bondian is in itself 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.030
 does not apply to anyone section of any 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.650
 no categories 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.300
 Old Believers categories we will 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.200
 work when creating follow-up sites 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.930
 here we will always stand it and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.780
 not specified not specified yet means that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.560
 in the article as if we have nowhere in itself 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.729
 relates further here but worth 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.500
 published ie it means that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.880
 after the burial of the article she immediately 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.549
 will appear on the site 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.669
 and this is on the main if may 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.999
 we create the stadium usually as we did 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.339
 relax is not the main thing yes but in this 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.019
 case we create Kotrovsky stadium on 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.519
 which will be on the main page 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.659
 of our site 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.959
 so here we can put on 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.599
 main yes 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.870
 that's what about the parameters even us 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840
 There is a field to add 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.419
 materials such 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.089
 and even here to the familiar to you 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.009
 the volume of programs for example 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.719
 motocross in the cohort of the year 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.369
 to counter that credit can 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.529
 do with terrorism in the economy will 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:50.689
 fine 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.409
 let's try to add something to the text 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.519
 but if we take this text here 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.689
 here we have data 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.359
 And copy Ltd. Kononov field for 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.679
 overtaking 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.019
 so after we left the text 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.279
 we can wow 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.959
 right here start leading and to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.859
 original sample yes 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.029
 that is, we look sedan let's say 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.829
 logistics first side right away 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:14.789
 contain 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.349
 highlighting the response to attacks on the street 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.189
 from the words the first reading of which before 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.620
 we can hide 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.260
 slowly do it 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.220
 weeks they made fat you excrete 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.540
 first word 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.540
 further emotions blue 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.930
 I will highlight the second word Galina color 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.759
 orange and so on outright translate 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.329
 a year ago 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.719
 text in which the price will add to the most 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.439
 the boards that we have here will give 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.109
 and the second option can be made easier 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:48.760
 Yes 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.939
 can 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.709
 leave immediately ready with that Oleg cats 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.459
 i.e. it is removed and delivered straight 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.319
 from here, that is, we are looking at the source code 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.229
 pages and view source text 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.229
 we find i go to our sources 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.649
 so here we went under the turner about 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.519
 on 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.650
 one hundred and forty seventh row and drainage 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.650
 we allocate completely to the end except 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.019
 lockable cell there by faces 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.570
 and insert husband 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.830
 but in the field of action and for the water pure Ashkenazi 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.930
 should clicking our themes 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.480
 present here 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.610
 she immediately six sailors 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.150
 that is, we already have 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.229
 the text is ready yes 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.659
 either the third departure option is also a nightmare 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.469
 copy texts to the source 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.179
 and is inserted during faith or in any 

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:43.289
 another editor we are used to 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.250
 work 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.120
 already through this editor 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.990
 yes bring him to this species which 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.449
 you need and cherished then also copy 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.159
 copies 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.740
 fixing europe 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.740
 now immediately respected format 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.960
 here are the three ways that is the first right 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.990
 here is made the second day just take 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.939
 source 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.639
 and the third is already 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.699
 yes he bring wow 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.800
 somewhere in which transmits a rater on 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.690
 ground floor 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.139
 however kosti ml 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.330
 Well done, choose yourself as you prefer 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.949
 will use the second method 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.150
 because he is the fastest 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.860
 not to linger 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.800
 on the text 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.699
 Here you choose any convenient for you 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.710
 This turned out to be on the stakes of technology but 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.330
 after we left it all tmk million 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.309
 Doll

 the pathology that we need nato 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.430

 She is the first save for us. 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.830
 there are still some not 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.900
 dismantled moments but we'll figure it out and 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.900
 the crowd now let's start save 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.260
 and see appeared we give i 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.599
 here we have the materials manager opened 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.610
