00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
individual spaces of the cubes there you

don't want to overfill it and then in

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.000 
don't want to overfill it and then in
each<00:00:35.090> cube<00:00:35.480> area<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:36.410> would<00:00:36.530> put<00:00:36.680> a<00:00:36.710> couple

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
each cube area you would put a couple

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.009 
each cube area you would put a couple
drops<00:00:37.039> or<00:00:37.550> maybe<00:00:37.820> four<00:00:38.149> drops<00:00:38.660> of<00:00:38.840> food

drops or maybe four drops of food
coloring<00:00:39.469> in<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.219> we<00:00:40.399> use<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.579> variety<00:00:40.879> of

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
coloring in and we use a variety of

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.090 
coloring in and we use a variety of
colors<00:00:41.329> of<00:00:42.429> the<00:00:43.429> food<00:00:43.670> coloring<00:00:44.059> into<00:00:44.359> each<00:00:44.600> or

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
colors of the food coloring into each or

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.240 
colors of the food coloring into each or
for<00:00:46.100> each<00:00:46.190> cube<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:47.480> we<00:00:47.570> use<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.719> variety<00:00:48.250> food

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
for each cube but we use a variety food

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.490 
for each cube but we use a variety food
cards<00:00:49.609> so<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:49.789> have<00:00:50.030> several<00:00:50.989> colors<00:00:51.170> for<00:00:51.410> the

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
cards so you have several colors for the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.750 
cards so you have several colors for the
children<00:00:51.769> to<00:00:51.829> choose<00:00:51.980> from<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.339> paint<00:00:52.579> with

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
children to choose from the paint with

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.270 
children to choose from the paint with
and<00:00:53.089> once<00:00:53.749> you've<00:00:53.989> put<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.499> food<00:00:54.679> coloring<00:00:54.949> in

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
and once you've put the food coloring in

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.489 
and once you've put the food coloring in
and<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:55.969> kind<00:00:56.120> of<00:00:56.239> hard<00:00:56.359> to<00:00:56.480> see<00:00:57.079> because<00:00:57.410> I

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
and it's kind of hard to see because I

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.569 
and it's kind of hard to see because I
have<00:00:57.620> already<00:00:57.679> had<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.010> finished<00:00:58.249> product

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
have already had the finished product

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.819 
have already had the finished product
here<00:00:58.670> but<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.690> put<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.929> food<00:01:00.079> color<00:01:00.320> in<00:01:00.530> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
here but you put the food color in and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.110 
here but you put the food color in and
then<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.010> take<00:01:01.219> one<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:01.399> your<00:01:01.579> craft<00:01:01.820> sticks

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
then you take one of your craft sticks

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.360 
then you take one of your craft sticks
and<00:01:02.719> you<00:01:02.839> would<00:01:02.960> gently<00:01:03.260> stir<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.280> you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
and you would gently stir it and you

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.310 
and you would gently stir it and you
would<00:01:04.460> do<00:01:04.550> that<00:01:04.699> with<00:01:04.850> all<00:01:05.089> of<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.780> ice<00:01:05.930> cube

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
would do that with all of the ice cube

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.610 
would do that with all of the ice cube
tray<00:01:06.620> spots<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.490> here<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:09.110> would<00:01:09.230> then<00:01:09.320> take<00:01:09.380> a

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
tray spots on here you would then take a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.520 
tray spots on here you would then take a
sheet<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.860> tin<00:01:10.130> foil<00:01:10.840> press<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.050> over<00:01:12.290> your<00:01:12.410> ice

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
sheet of tin foil press it over your ice

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.830 
sheet of tin foil press it over your ice
cube<00:01:12.890> tray<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.550> make<00:01:14.180> sure<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.420> press<00:01:14.660> in

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
cube tray and make sure you press in

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.780 
cube tray and make sure you press in
here<00:01:14.870> so<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.440> can<00:01:15.560> see<00:01:15.740> where<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.980> individual

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
here so you can see where the individual

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.720 
here so you can see where the individual
cube<00:01:17.600> markings<00:01:18.230> are<00:01:18.470> on<00:01:18.800> here<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.430> then<00:01:19.610> you

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
cube markings are on here and then you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.990 
cube markings are on here and then you
take<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.000> scissors<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.990> just<00:01:21.130> gently<00:01:22.130> poke<00:01:22.790> or

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
slice a little slit in each cube for

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.330 
slice a little slit in each cube for
where<00:01:26.720> your<00:01:26.840> popsicle<00:01:27.380> stick<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:27.710> going<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.160> go

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
where your popsicle stick is going to go

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.220 
where your popsicle stick is going to go
you<00:01:28.970> don't<00:01:29.090> want<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.390> try<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.600> push<00:01:30.020> the

popsicle stick it's stick itself in
through<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.260> tinfoil<00:01:33.770> because<00:01:34.250> I'll<00:01:34.430> just

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
through the tinfoil because I'll just

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.150 
through the tinfoil because I'll just
rip<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.880> tin<00:01:35.060> foil<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.510> your<00:01:35.660> your<00:01:36.350> popsicle

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
slice it a little bit and you just

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.770 
slice it a little bit and you just
gently<00:01:42.980> slide<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.640> stick<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:44.090> know<00:01:44.180> it'll

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
gently slide in the stick you know it'll

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.070 
gently slide in the stick you know it'll
hold<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.080> shape<00:01:45.320> pretty<00:01:45.650> good<00:01:45.920> sometimes

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
hold the shape pretty good sometimes

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.820 
hold the shape pretty good sometimes
it'll<00:01:48.080> get<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> little<00:01:48.260> bit<00:01:48.380> ripped<00:01:48.650> or

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
it'll get a little bit ripped or

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.130 
it'll get a little bit ripped or
something<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:50.270> can<00:01:50.420> check<00:01:50.690> out<00:01:50.870> it<00:01:50.990> while

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
something but you can check out it while

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.720 
something but you can check out it while
the<00:01:51.380> ice<00:01:51.500> cubes<00:01:51.740> are<00:01:51.860> freezing<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.430> trying<00:01:52.610> to

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
the ice cubes are freezing and trying to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.190 
the ice cubes are freezing and trying to
state<00:01:52.940> straighten<00:01:53.450> up<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.660> sticks<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.170> can

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
state straighten up the sticks you can

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.600 
state straighten up the sticks you can
see<00:01:54.410> here<00:01:54.590> where<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.740> couple<00:01:54.920> had<00:01:55.160> flopped<00:01:55.430> over

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
see here where a couple had flopped over

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.610 
see here where a couple had flopped over
but<00:01:56.030> that's<00:01:56.180> alright<00:01:56.510> they<00:01:56.750> can<00:01:57.170> still<00:01:57.380> paint

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
but that's alright they can still paint

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.370 
but that's alright they can still paint
with<00:01:57.770> them<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.760> so<00:01:59.570> you'll<00:01:59.720> let<00:01:59.870> that<00:02:00.050> freeze

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
with them and so you'll let that freeze

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.800 
with them and so you'll let that freeze
again<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.460> would<00:02:01.550> cover<00:02:01.820> your<00:02:02.000> tray<00:02:02.690> of

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
again and you would cover your tray of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.990 
again and you would cover your tray of
tin<00:02:02.960> foil<00:02:03.200> slice<00:02:03.830> little<00:02:04.250> slices<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.790> each

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
tin foil slice little slices on each

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880 
tin foil slice little slices on each
individual<00:02:05.540> cube<00:02:05.780> after<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.230> press<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.650> spot

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
individual cube after you press the spot

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.650 
individual cube after you press the spot
suits<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.250> could<00:02:07.400> see<00:02:07.610> where<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.000> lines<00:02:08.360> are

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
suits you could see where the lines are

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.070 
suits you could see where the lines are
for<00:02:08.929> each<00:02:09.050> cube<00:02:09.379> and<00:02:09.709> then<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.520> would<00:02:10.610> stick

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
for each cube and then you would stick

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.570 
for each cube and then you would stick
your<00:02:12.080> craft<00:02:12.380> sticks<00:02:12.620> in<00:02:12.800> them<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.160> let<00:02:13.430> it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
your craft sticks in them and let it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.670 
your craft sticks in them and let it
freeze<00:02:13.850> they<00:02:14.450> could<00:02:14.600> adjust<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.110> sticks<00:02:15.350> as

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
freeze they could adjust the sticks as

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.390 
freeze they could adjust the sticks as
by<00:02:16.099> checking<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.640> sat<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:19.040> when<00:02:19.310> that's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
by checking on sat and then when that's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.920 
by checking on sat and then when that's
done<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.030> would<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.390> lift

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
done you would just lift

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.080 
done you would just lift
you<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.620> gunned<00:02:21.859> it<00:02:21.950> like<00:02:22.069> normal<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.790> loosen

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
you know gunned it like normal to loosen

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.479 
you know gunned it like normal to loosen
up<00:02:23.180> your<00:02:23.530> cubes<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.859> then<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.219> would<00:02:25.340> lift

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
up your cubes and then you would lift

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.500 
up your cubes and then you would lift
the<00:02:25.730> tinfoil<00:02:26.769> off<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:28.040> tray<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.670> didn't<00:02:29.390> put

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the tinfoil off the tray I didn't put

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.800 
the tinfoil off the tray I didn't put
coloring<00:02:29.840> Ollie's<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.439> here

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.509 

almost<00:02:33.379> all<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.540> then<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.889> children<00:02:37.340> would

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
almost all and then the children would

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.240 
almost all and then the children would
paint<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:37.939> them<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:39.709> good<00:02:39.889> to<00:02:40.010> get<00:02:40.099> it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
paint with them and it's good to get it

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.539 
paint with them and it's good to get it
a<00:02:40.370> little<00:02:40.549> bit<00:02:40.730> melted<00:02:42.040> before<00:02:43.040> starting

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
a little bit melted before starting

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.339 
a little bit melted before starting
we'll<00:02:43.939> start<00:02:44.180> with<00:02:44.329> a<00:02:44.750> green<00:02:44.959> one<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.230> think

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
we'll start with a green one I think

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.640 
we'll start with a green one I think
here<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.209> does<00:02:47.420> make<00:02:47.720> colors<00:02:48.470> on

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
here and it really does make colors on

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.449 
here and it really does make colors on
here<00:02:48.889> and<00:02:49.220> children<00:02:49.579> can<00:02:49.790> make<00:02:51.189> whatever<00:02:52.189> kind

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
here and children can make whatever kind

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.369 
here and children can make whatever kind
of<00:02:52.609> design<00:02:52.939> that<00:02:53.120> they<00:02:53.269> want<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.169> course

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
of design that they want and of course

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.369 
of design that they want and of course
the<00:02:54.530> more<00:02:54.620> melted<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.099> ice<00:02:55.159> cube<00:02:55.840> gets<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
the more melted the ice cube gets the

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.440 
the more melted the ice cube gets the
more<00:02:57.560> colour<00:02:58.010> its<00:02:58.250> gonna<00:02:58.430> put<00:02:58.700> on<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:02.299> this<00:03:02.389> is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
more colour its gonna put on and this is

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.869 
more colour its gonna put on and this is
food<00:03:02.750> coloring<00:03:03.579> so<00:03:06.189> it's<00:03:07.189> safe<00:03:07.430> for<00:03:07.669> children

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
food coloring so it's safe for children

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.490 
food coloring so it's safe for children
but<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.450> know<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:08.719> don't<00:03:08.810> want<00:03:08.989> them<00:03:09.139> to<00:03:09.290> lick

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
but you know you don't want them to lick

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.009 
but you know you don't want them to lick
it<00:03:09.739> or<00:03:10.099> put<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.419> put<00:03:11.659> them<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.900> their

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
it or put this and put them in their

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.140 
it or put this and put them in their
mouths

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
mouths

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.220 
mouths
so<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.209> may<00:03:14.329> want<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.540> talk<00:03:14.719> about<00:03:14.900> that

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
so you may want to talk about that

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:24.550 
so you may want to talk about that
before<00:03:15.379> you<00:03:15.650> begin<00:03:15.919> this<00:03:16.099> project<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:24.440> can

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
before you begin this project you can

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.780 
before you begin this project you can
see<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:25.040> know<00:03:25.129> they<00:03:25.280> can<00:03:25.430> make<00:03:25.459> some<00:03:25.699> really

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
see you know they can make some really

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.750 
see you know they can make some really
cool<00:03:26.030> stuff<00:03:26.090> if<00:03:26.989> they<00:03:27.139> took<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.440> time<00:03:27.650> and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
cool stuff if they took the time and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.890 
cool stuff if they took the time and
decide<00:03:28.760> what<00:03:29.000> they're<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.389> to<00:03:29.510> make<00:03:29.659> I'm

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
decide what they're going to make I'm

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.659 
decide what they're going to make I'm
just<00:03:30.079> swirling<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.889> around<00:03:30.949> to<00:03:31.280> show<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.519> an

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
just swirling it around to show you an

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.479 
just swirling it around to show you an
example<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:32.209> how<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:33.019> color<00:03:33.260> turns<00:03:33.590> out<00:03:33.889> and

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
example of how the color turns out and

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.789 
example of how the color turns out and
again<00:03:34.729> I<00:03:34.909> put<00:03:35.090> like<00:03:35.269> four<00:03:35.510> four<00:03:36.260> or<00:03:36.290> five<00:03:36.500> drops

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
again I put like four four or five drops

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.500 
again I put like four four or five drops
of<00:03:37.040> food<00:03:37.189> color<00:03:37.459> into<00:03:38.090> each<00:03:39.310> ice<00:03:40.310> cube<00:03:40.699> section

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
of food color into each ice cube section

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.030 
of food color into each ice cube section
here<00:03:41.720> but<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.959> can<00:03:42.139> decide<00:03:42.379> what<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.680> want<00:03:42.889> to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
here but you can decide what you want to

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.189 
here but you can decide what you want to
do<00:03:44.439> for<00:03:45.439> yourself<00:03:45.889> there<00:03:46.810> it's<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.870> lot<00:03:47.989> more

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
do for yourself there it's a lot more
