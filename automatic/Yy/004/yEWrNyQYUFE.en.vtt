00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.540
 edge trimming option 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.540
 lush column 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.360
 Here I have such a sample related 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.080
 magnificent columns now we will cut it 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.660
 edge 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.180
 in order for the tongue to turn out 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.720
 neater I tied a row of columns without 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.470
 nakida because here is the edge of this 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.050
 sample here is such an openwork so that everything was 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.850
 neater now knit our own 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.160
 lush bars the first bar we 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.129
 pull out and column the previous row 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:01:02.120
 here from here from this place we enter 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:01:04.339
 this column 4 times 1 2 3 4 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.580
 And here we will fix from the column 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.910
 a little differently retreat two 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:17.509
 previous row column 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:19.880
 we will enter 3 we will hook a thread and we will knit 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.569
 all that we have on the hook and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.470
 do the tack here is such a column 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.729
 turned out 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.640
 tightly lying on the previous row the same 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.759
 knit further further pull out 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.140
 thread at the entrance to my loop previous 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.739
 Row but under this thread 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:50.200
 bartacks and from here also draw 

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:50.200
 thread four times 1 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.479
 234 we count 2 columns we enter 3 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.119
 knit all the loops and fix here 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.320
 such here are obtained dense 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:18.690
 horizontal bars not very good 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:22.580
 lie on the previous row of posts 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:30.420
 without nakida reminds such a border 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:33.860
 let's another one knit nakid enter 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:42.570
 under the fastening thread 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:53.640
 four times pull the thread three and four 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:57.560
 and in the third to the third column we fix in 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.560
 Generally the whole trick 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:06.660
 such neat columns here I 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.049
 finished up the end of the breaststroke as you see 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.360
 drawing this pattern is symmetrical with two 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.450
 the parties that is, if there are semi jackets 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.190
 swing open all very beautiful also 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.230
 it can be used for legal 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.820
 lines here he will lie very well 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 the only nuance here is this place 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.340
 need to skip the extra column such 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.510
 here is the harness 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.510
 horizontal lush bars
