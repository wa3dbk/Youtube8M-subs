I'm upgrading the ram which I'll be

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
I'm upgrading the ram which I'll be
doing<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:36.930> video<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.440> hard<00:00:37.980> drive<00:00:38.250> which

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460

stuff hmm hope this wasn't going
anywhere<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:35.360> wasn't<00:02:35.600> going<00:02:35.690> anywhere<00:02:35.780> before

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
anywhere it wasn't going anywhere before

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.240 
anywhere it wasn't going anywhere before
so<00:02:36.470> I'm<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.739> leave<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.010> way<00:02:37.160> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
so I'm going to leave it that way and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:49.320 
so I'm going to leave it that way and
open<00:02:40.250> up<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.489> ram<00:02:45.489> there's<00:02:46.489> one<00:02:46.820> stick<00:02:47.180> there

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
open up the ram there's one stick there

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.490 
open up the ram there's one stick there
and<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.450> we<00:02:50.540> open<00:02:50.570> up<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.989> other<00:02:51.110> one<00:02:51.320> this

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
and then we open up the other one this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.320 
and then we open up the other one this
also<00:02:51.739> has<00:02:52.010> instructions<00:02:52.519> i<00:02:52.790> believe<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.180> how

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
also has instructions i believe on how

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.820 
also has instructions i believe on how
to<00:02:53.390> put<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.410> in<00:02:57.580> ya<00:02:58.580> okay<00:02:59.360> so<00:03:00.049> it's<00:03:00.230> certainly

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
to put it in ya okay so it's certainly

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.069 
to put it in ya okay so it's certainly
not<00:03:01.130> hard<00:03:05.680> there's<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.890> two<00:03:07.070> sticks<00:03:07.400> there

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
not hard there's the two sticks there

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:15.520 
not hard there's the two sticks there
and<00:03:10.000> we<00:03:11.000> snap<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:14.170> remove<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.380> old

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
and we snap this and this remove the old

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.390 
and we snap this and this remove the old
ram<00:03:16.329> we<00:03:17.329> pull<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.720> out<00:03:17.840> these<00:03:18.350> are<00:03:18.650> one<00:03:18.980> gigs

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
ram we pull it out these are one gigs

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.190 
ram we pull it out these are one gigs
one<00:03:20.329> gig<00:03:20.600> sticks<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:22.640> don't<00:03:23.180> know<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.480> brand

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
one gig sticks I don't know the brand

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.199 
one gig sticks I don't know the brand
but<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.220> don't<00:03:25.459> think<00:03:25.549> I'd<00:03:25.700> care<00:03:25.910> at<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.150> point

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
but I don't think I'd care at this point

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.949 
but I don't think I'd care at this point
I'll<00:03:26.959> find<00:03:27.320> out<00:03:27.440> later<00:03:28.600> there's<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.870> other

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
I'll find out later there's the other

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.960 
I'll find out later there's the other
stick<00:03:31.299> pretty<00:03:32.299> sweet<00:03:33.070> now<00:03:34.070> we<00:03:34.220> get<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.700> new

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
stick pretty sweet now we get the new

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.509 
stick pretty sweet now we get the new
sticks<00:03:35.329> with<00:03:36.170> our<00:03:36.380> corsair<00:03:38.380> which<00:03:39.380> from<00:03:40.340> my

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
sticks with our corsair which from my

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.900 
sticks with our corsair which from my
research<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.239> good<00:03:41.570> brand

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.720 

so<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:46.080> slide<00:03:46.380> peas<00:03:46.770> in<00:03:47.130> there<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:49.190> snap<00:03:50.190> and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
so we slide peas in there and snap and

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:59.470 
so we slide peas in there and snap and
then<00:03:51.420> we<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.840> same<00:03:52.140> for<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:52.620> and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.370 

since<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.720> RAM<00:04:00.960> is<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:02.990> commonly<00:04:03.990> replaced

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
since the RAM is a commonly replaced

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.120 
since the RAM is a commonly replaced
item<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.010> computers<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:06.170> well<00:04:07.170> whether

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
item in computers and well whether

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.620 
item in computers and well whether
that's<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.520> reason<00:04:08.880> or<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.150> I'm<00:04:09.390> glad<00:04:09.600> I

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
that's the reason or not I'm glad I

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.440 
that's the reason or not I'm glad I
won't<00:04:09.930> have<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.310> go<00:04:11.310> nuts<00:04:11.640> trying<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.120> figure

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
won't have to go nuts trying to figure

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.080 
won't have to go nuts trying to figure
out<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:13.170> it'll<00:04:13.530> work<00:04:13.560> properly<00:04:14.130> because<00:04:14.880> I

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
out if it'll work properly because I

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.880 
out if it'll work properly because I
know<00:04:15.240> for<00:04:15.660> sure<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:17.700> will<00:04:18.080> because<00:04:19.080> it

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
know for sure that it will because it

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.210 
know for sure that it will because it
does<00:04:20.160> support<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:21.060> gigs<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:21.570> there's<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.890> two

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
does support for gigs so there's the two

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.880 
does support for gigs so there's the two
new<00:04:23.370> sticks<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.700> fully<00:04:26.700> in<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:28.560> isn't

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
new sticks in there fully in this isn't

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.340 
new sticks in there fully in this isn't
the<00:04:28.950> way<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.070> planned<00:04:29.810> flip<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:31.140> over<00:04:32.330> Ram<00:04:33.350> yay

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
the way I planned flip this over Ram yay

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.500 
the way I planned flip this over Ram yay
so<00:04:35.100> i<00:04:35.130> won't<00:04:35.280> bore<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.580> with<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.820> details<00:04:35.910> of

so i won't bore you with the details of

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.100 
so i won't bore you with the details of
putting<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.840> back<00:04:36.990> panel<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.470> con<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:38.010> it's<00:04:38.760> in

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
putting the back panel a con but it's in

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.890 
putting the back panel a con but it's in
power<00:04:40.110> on<00:04:43.400> it's<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.550> Christmas<00:04:45.060> tree<00:04:45.360> over<00:04:45.690> here

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
as you can see tell there's a little a

as you can see tell there's a little a
bite<00:04:51.690> out<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:51.900> my<00:04:52.080> keyboard<00:04:52.260> here<00:04:52.710> I'm<00:04:53.130> not

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
bite out of my keyboard here I'm not

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.800 
bite out of my keyboard here I'm not
going<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.580> explain<00:04:53.790> how<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.120> happened<00:04:54.660> it

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
going to explain how that happened it

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.720 
going to explain how that happened it
wasn't<00:04:55.050> technically<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.590> bite<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> then<00:04:56.100> this

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
wasn't technically a bite and then this

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.830 
wasn't technically a bite and then this
whole<00:04:56.910> front<00:04:57.240> panel<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:58.440> currently<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.130> not

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
whole front panel is currently a not

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.300 
whole front panel is currently a not
properly<00:05:00.840> seated<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:04.860> is<00:05:05.010> one<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.250> the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
properly seated so that is one of the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.650 
properly seated so that is one of the
things<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.640> plan<00:05:05.880> on<00:05:06.090> fixing<00:05:06.980> but<00:05:08.030> let's<00:05:09.030> see<00:05:09.390> if

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
things I plan on fixing but let's see if

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.080 
things I plan on fixing but let's see if
the<00:05:10.290> RAM<00:05:10.470> works<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:12.540> four<00:05:13.080> gigs<00:05:13.350> worked

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
the RAM works and the four gigs worked

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.840 
the RAM works and the four gigs worked
sweet<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.990> since<00:05:16.560> i'm<00:05:16.650> using<00:05:16.919> vista<00:05:17.130> 32<00:05:17.700> at
