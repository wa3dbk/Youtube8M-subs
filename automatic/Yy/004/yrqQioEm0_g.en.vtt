00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 you a glamorous make-up and a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 superfood hairstyle as a suggestion for 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.269
 You rock out this year, let's go. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.189
 start I'll start with trailer for 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.320
 make your makeup last well in this 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.210
 year-round than the super special so 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.680
 applied with the tip of his fingers and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.390
 spread all over my face 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.760
 now I come with my base I 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.860
 I chose a long-term basis 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.989
 is also water resistant and the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.360
 fiber brush I apply this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.460
 base all over my face to take all 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.390
 the reds and leave my skin well 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.300
 uniform because it will put a special date 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.100
 deserves a well-made makeup 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.739
 do not forget the neck passes a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.210
 bit in the mouth also now came with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.210
 two collectives 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.549
 This first one that I'm applying is me. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.010
 I tap it, it's the tone of the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.810
 my skin 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.670
 so I look good and I come with a concealer 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.229
 a little more clear just to give a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.790
 illuminated 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.270
 so I choose well in these two 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.450
 collectives to get rid of dark circles and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.600
 left this part of the light and I come 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.060
 with powder now a matiné wood to leave the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.880
 changed skin step below the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.560
 eyes 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.659
 This will help make-up lasts longer. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.899
 also makes the skin more beautiful I like 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.420
 lots of glass, I apply ben there in the face 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.770
 and now I'm going to make a good contour of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.659
 light with bronze 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.689
 so I make the mouth of a fish that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.090
 you already know Annie is right to mark 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.700
 below the lines make the two apples 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.369
 sides of my face center 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.920
 long and now I'll go to my eye I 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.079
 I chose this creamy shadow is a 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.659
 little goldfish she'll be mine 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.880
 basis of my shadow base then I 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.530
 my entire eyelid is 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.330
 in the inner corner and I'll use my 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.340
 browser and a chubby 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.450
 smoking to give a light on marcadinha 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 my body 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.130
 Just to make a fuse to us then 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.660
 You can use a brown shadow too. 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.599
 no problem 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.730
 so I foam in the concave and now I come 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.340
 like the golden glitter shadow and a 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.000
 brush very small and I'll deposit 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.640
 this shadow all over my eyelid 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.829
 I'm going to use this tape, just to 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.019
 make an outer corner more cute 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.470
 so I come with a brown shadow one 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.510
 a little darker and fumagalli my 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.110
 the outer corner in the middle that a 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.489
 drive until you find the tape 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.860
 adhesive well yes ok 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.829
 I already took the tape and I'm going to make a 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.680
 outlined well with my children without 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.329
 kitten where's or anything is just to 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.519
 leave your eyelash root well 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.370
 I really think it leaves the mark. 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.480
 Look more beautiful makes the eye look good 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.139
 then no secret at all. 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.760
 to mark the same root of the eyelashes 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.430
 I'll use a light pencil to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.109
 light down my eyebrow so 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.420
 with the tip of his finger and whiskey 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.280
 mist pencil and I use to vanish 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.090
 along with the brown shadow that people 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.090
 passed before 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.480
 black pencil on the water line must have 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.550
 huh 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.470
 A makeup for the night asks for a look. 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.080
 a little more marked 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.349
 It's a super easy makeup. Guys. 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.170
 you do there without difficulty 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.910
 now comes with this bevelled brush 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.220
 clean and smear pencil that I spent there 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.230
 below my lower lashes 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.260
 so I come along the little corner of the tip 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.560
 eye and pull I apply a little of the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.660
 shadow shouts golden in the inner corner and 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.319
 now with the same bevelled brush and 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.170
 black shadow I foam is below the 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.989
 my lower lashes and along there in 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.389
 up with outlined what I had done 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.489
 I'm coming back with the golden glitter shadow to 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.780
 make that eye pretty powerful as well 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.290
 glamorous, this makeup calls for 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.190
 Good eyebrow eyebrow 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.840
 Give the eyebrow a good eye too. 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.850
 eyelash mask can not miss for 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.610
 this look I also chose a mask 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.039
 lashes waterproof outta no no 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.070
 do not make dirt 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.979
 I opted for a blush it's a good thing 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.150
 skin even to not get the highlight of the 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.770
 eyes to leave a little blush 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.440
 illuminator on how can I miss 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.120
 step there is above where I spent the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.979
 plush with the little brush 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.100
 Illuminator is everything and I'll make a light 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.080
 zine marking is a slight contour in my 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.810
 nose with brass I've ever had 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.580
 last if you do not get scared 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.470
 it's just blurring with the powder brush 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.560
 now a powerful lipstick my nude lipstick 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.050
 This is Luís Gomes's favorite. 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.240
 I love this lipstick because he really is not 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.780
 people 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.060
 It's beautiful and it's for a new year on the beach. 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.150
 I think a braid as an accessory will go 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.300
 superb and combines with this look 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.840
 a little more globe 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.340
 so I just made a side braid 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.349
 understand the tip and give a 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.199
 in this braid with the tip of the 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.379
 fingers even to not get any tighter 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.720
 I'm going to wear a wreath of people 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:52.069
 does not match much with the new imagine 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.199
 white dress with this perfect look and 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.120
 This is the end result of my cigarette. 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.520
 me with me new plan I very much hope that 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.159
 Did you like a happy new year? 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.159

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:07.039
 A lot of health and success, all good to 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:09.500

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.659
 guaranteed success a huge kiss for 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.620
