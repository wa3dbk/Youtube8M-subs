00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
worth 75 points this game does not have

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
worth 75 points this game does not have
a<00:00:26.970> lot<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> achievements<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> point

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
a lot of achievements but the point
