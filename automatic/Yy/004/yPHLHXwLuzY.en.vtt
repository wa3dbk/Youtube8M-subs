00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
777 and I was hoping that a page of

777 and I was hoping that a page of
India<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.170> there<00:03:31.290> was<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> page<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.770> there<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.490> I

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
India and there was a page in there so I

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.810 
India and there was a page in there so I
was<00:03:32.670> lucky<00:03:34.040> then<00:03:35.040> I'll<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.280> come<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.730> of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.280 
here i just get home by the sky this
it's<00:03:39.810> pretty<00:03:40.050> hard<00:03:40.260> game

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it's pretty hard game

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.559 
it's pretty hard game
that's<00:03:41.799> what<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:41.950> said<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.939> scary<00:03:43.239> breeze<00:03:43.450> is

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
that's what I said the scary breeze is

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.780

coming<00:03:43.659> out<00:03:44.049> all<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.379> stuff's<00:03:44.680> happening<00:03:44.799> so

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.069 
coming out all this stuff's happening so
i<00:03:45.819> think<00:03:45.939> the<00:03:46.120> game<00:03:46.269> does<00:03:46.450> get<00:03:46.629> harder<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:46.989> you

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
i think the game does get harder as you

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.429 
i think the game does get harder as you
go<00:03:47.260> on<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.120> think<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:49.450> about<00:03:49.629> about<00:03:49.719> here<00:03:50.109> I
