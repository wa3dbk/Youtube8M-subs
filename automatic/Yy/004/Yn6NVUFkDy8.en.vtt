00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.550
 hello welcome there have been instructive 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.279
 to build your purifier with candles 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.410
 stefan the purifier works by 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.840
 gravity and by means of a candle 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.750
 Ceramic that retains solid particles 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.840
 Suspended in the water eliminates bacteria 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.940
 and microorganisms 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.760
 and reduces the amount of free chlorine 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.060
 noxious chemical agents flavors and 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.570
 unpleasant odors 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.320
 making the cure healthy and 100% safe 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.320
 for human consumption 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.629
 the material to make the purifier is 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.629
 a plastic key with three rope 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.780
 rooms with nut and two gaskets 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.930
 ceramic candle stefani of triple exiÃ³n a 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.570
 stephanie plastic float and two 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.880
 5 liter buckets with grade cap 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.490
 preferably a food color 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.549
 and a translucent the tools that 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.100
 we need are two flat bits one of 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:24.310
 three fourths and one of three eighths a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.470
 berbiquÃ­ and medium sandpaper you 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.240
 We recommend that you prefer the boat 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.000
 above where the water that is stored is stored 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.130
 let's purify it be color and the pot 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.869
 lower where the water is stored and 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.869
 purified is translucent 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.890
 now we are going to work 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.229
 As a first step, let's take the drill 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.820
 three-eighth plane to drill a 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.440
 hole in the bottom of the bucket 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.440
 superior ie the color 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.410
 then with the same drill, the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.410
 center of the bottom cuvette lid 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.600
 it's good to have someone's support 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.600
 two centimeters from the base of the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.450
 lower bucket marks the one to make a 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:19.720
 Drilling with the three-quarter drill 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.940
 this piercing is for the key to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.670
 the last perforations is taken from 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.310
 new one of the bits and two are made 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.010
 holes one on the top of 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.830
 the upper bucket and another one in the part of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.110
 above the lower deck until 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.270
 there is a tiny hole that helps 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.270
 the air intake and avoids the vacuum 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.180
 we almost reached the installation of 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.460
 ceramic filter at this time opens the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.780
 wrap the candle and put the packaging 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.510
 included 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.120
 now leaving the candle to the side and 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.370
 taking the medium sandpaper you will sand the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.470
 holes in the upper tray and the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.600
 lower bucket lid you have to 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.450
 sand until the candle thread passes 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.730
 completely taking care not to force 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.950
 entry of the thread so as not to break the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.890
 bucket the candle is placed inside 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.989
 of the upper bucket making sure of 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.780
 that there is no space left in the base 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.390
 of the candle and the base of the bucket and that 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.430
 their packaging are properly placed and 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.430
 tight in order to avoid spills 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.820
 the lid of the lower tray is placed 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.840
 the second packing and the nut has to 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.840
 stay tight 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.460
 finishing the installation of the candle 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.590
 purifying screw the float to the 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.480
 candle the float allows to optimize the 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.380
 amount of treated water and avoid the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.380
 spill of it 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.570
 Insert the package into the key 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.370
 now screwed without forcing the container 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.610
 then hold the key so that it does not 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.610
 move 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.770
 screw the nut inside the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.200
 container and tighten 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.300
 by the upper bucket on top of the 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.180
 bottom bucket in such a way that the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.290
 antlers are in the same sense 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.100
 make sure the lid of the bucket 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.170
 bottom is tightly closed 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.970
 now you can fill in completely the 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.350
 upper vessel with the water of the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.020
 key 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.240
 after a few moments the water 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.160
 drinking will begin to come out in the form of 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.540
 drip through the hole in the candle 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.550
 ceramics 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.560
 how are you using the candle for the first 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.230
 time when the lower container is 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.760
 full discards the water this will allow 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.710
 eliminate small waste from 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.620
 Ceramic or coal factory 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.410
 activated the purification unit of 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.960
 water is finished, fill it in again 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.100
 tap water allows the water to drain 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.320
 bottom bucket 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.320
 now yes to enjoy purified water 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.879
 to purify more water in 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.379
 less time 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.749
 you can get buckets of 8 liters 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.699
 each one in this case you have to place 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:15.800
 two ceramic candles and two floats 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.930
 you janted 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.599
 If there are spills or the water comes out by another 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.270
 side you can check that the packages 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.129
 are well placed and that the thread of the 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.139
 candle is completely entering the 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.930
 bottom of the upper tray for 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.509
 verify this is important to note that 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:38.180
 There should be no space between the sail and the 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:40.849
 bottom of the container to clean all 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.370
 the parts of the plastic water is used 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.010
 and soap 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.139
 the candle should be washed without detergent or 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.910
 any other chemical since 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.180
 the material is very porous and can be 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.580
 impregnate taste and smell very easily 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.330
 it is necessary to change the candle every six 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.840
 months or every 700 liters of filtered water 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.630
 equivalent to thirty four 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.410
 water jugs but does not have the candle 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:12.740
 ceramics used to the ground waste is a 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:14.479
 excellent soil conditioner fill 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.990
 with water from the tap the container 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.720
 higher 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.860
 the first filtering can take from 8 to 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.140
 12 hours use the key carefully the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.140
 filter should not be placed where 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.510
 hit the sun's rays is possible 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.140
 store the water in safe containers 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.140
 and appropriate 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.820
 ah 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.850
 ah
