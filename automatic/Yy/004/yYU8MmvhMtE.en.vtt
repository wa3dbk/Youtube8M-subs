this<00:00:40.500> video<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.980> wasn't<00:00:41.100> recording<00:00:41.489> at

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

the<00:00:41.579> time<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:42.030> them<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> packet<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:42.750> just

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the time I got them in a packet was just

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
the time I got them in a packet was just
a<00:00:42.930> spare<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> moment<00:00:43.530> thing<00:00:43.649> open<00:00:44.340> impact<00:00:44.640> i

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a spare the moment thing open impact i

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.279 
a spare the moment thing open impact i
thought<00:00:44.910> i'd<00:00:45.000> show<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.360> instead<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> doing

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
thought i'd show this instead of doing

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.020 
thought i'd show this instead of doing

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
i'll rather cash in on them now instead

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.420 
i'll rather cash in on them now instead
of<00:01:24.780> takin<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.229> space<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.710> trade<00:01:26.040> pole<00:01:26.280> which

of takin up space in my trade pole which
could<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.119> potentially<00:01:27.659> filled<00:01:28.350> by

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
could be you know potentially filled by

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.230
