00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
week the damage at twenty-five percent

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.160 
week the damage at twenty-five percent
at<00:02:09.100> 8<00:02:09.220> meters<00:02:09.399> makes<00:02:09.850> this<00:02:10.030> weapon<00:02:10.509> pretty<00:02:10.929> fun

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
though I don't know what it was but if I

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.630 
though I don't know what it was but if I
had<00:02:19.480> anything<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.440> an<00:02:20.650> iron<00:02:21.040> sight<00:02:21.340> with<00:02:21.519> this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
had anything but an iron sight with this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.599 
had anything but an iron sight with this
weapon<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:22.060> didn't<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.840> didn't<00:02:23.019> seem<00:02:23.230> to

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
weapon I didn't it didn't seem to

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.099 
weapon I didn't it didn't seem to
impress<00:02:24.609> me<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.820> much<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.359> didn't<00:02:25.690> help<00:02:25.870> me

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109

with<00:02:26.470> any<00:02:27.130> type<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.400> holographic<00:02:28.269> or<00:02:28.750> or<00:02:29.019> scope

with any type of holographic or or scope

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.930 
with any type of holographic or or scope
for<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:29.980> matter<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.459> only<00:02:31.390> ran<00:02:31.720> around<00:02:31.870> with

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
for that matter I only ran around with

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.449 
for that matter I only ran around with
pirate<00:02:33.940> sites<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.450> aks-74u<00:02:35.320> maybe<00:02:36.250> it's

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
pirate sites on the aks-74u maybe it's

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.400 
pirate sites on the aks-74u maybe it's
something<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.790> do<00:02:36.940> with<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.269> fact<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.630> it

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
something to do with the fact that it

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.130 
something to do with the fact that it
felt<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.769> little<00:02:38.889> bit<00:02:39.040> more<00:02:39.160> natural

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
felt a little bit more natural

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.660 
felt a little bit more natural
and<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.410> didn't<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.100> fact<00:02:41.400> of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
and I didn't really like the fact of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.570 
and I didn't really like the fact of
looking<00:02:42.180> down<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.750> holographic<00:02:43.530> sight<00:02:43.920> maybe

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
looking down a holographic sight maybe

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.640 
looking down a holographic sight maybe
it<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.819> needs<00:02:45.060> some<00:02:45.390> particular<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.200> my<00:02:46.440> own

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it just needs some particular and my own

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.680 
it just needs some particular and my own
personal<00:02:47.069> preference<00:02:47.550> but<00:02:47.700> that's<00:02:48.240> just<00:02:48.450> what

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
personal preference but that's just what

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.790 
personal preference but that's just what
I'm<00:02:48.780> saying<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.319> I'm<00:02:49.380> giving<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> guys<00:02:49.770> my

I'm saying and I'm giving you guys my

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.380 
I'm saying and I'm giving you guys my
opinions<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.550> how<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.880> handled<00:02:51.180> throughout

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
doesn't seem like it is three seconds

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.890 
doesn't seem like it is three seconds
this<00:03:04.140> weapon<00:03:04.680> for<00:03:05.010> whatever<00:03:05.370> reason<00:03:05.970> feels

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900

this weapon for whatever reason feels
like<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.230> reloads<00:03:07.620> very<00:03:07.980> fast<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.670> feels<00:03:08.880> like

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
like it reloads very fast it feels like

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.420 
like it reloads very fast it feels like
you<00:03:09.420> if<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.050> expend<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.650> your<00:03:10.860> magazine<00:03:11.220> all

you<00:03:13.050> reload<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.590> lot<00:03:13.860> more<00:03:14.100> faster<00:03:14.670> than<00:03:14.850> a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
you reload it a lot more faster than a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.390 
you reload it a lot more faster than a
lot<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.360> its<00:03:15.510> other<00:03:15.860> sister<00:03:16.860> weapons<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.310> the

lot of its other sister weapons in the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.910 
lot of its other sister weapons in the
video<00:03:17.940> game<00:03:18.200> now<00:03:19.200> keep<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.680> mind<00:03:19.800> because

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
video game now keep that in mind because

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.460 
video game now keep that in mind because
the<00:03:20.190> fire<00:03:20.370> rate<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.850> only<00:03:21.030> 650<00:03:21.720> rounds<00:03:22.140> per

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the fire rate is only 650 rounds per

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.680 
the fire rate is only 650 rounds per
minute<00:03:22.590> which<00:03:22.800> is<00:03:22.920> kind<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.880> too<00:03:24.090> fast<00:03:24.420> for

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
minute which is kind of not too fast for

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.000 
minute which is kind of not too fast for
a<00:03:24.720> lot<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.959> other<00:03:25.110> standard<00:03:25.500> weapons<00:03:25.680> in

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
a lot of other standard weapons in

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.460 
a lot of other standard weapons in
battlefield<00:03:26.400> 3<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.959> damage<00:03:28.290> rate

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
battlefield 3 but with the damage rate

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.080

at 50 meters kind of lets you kind of be

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.449 
at 50 meters kind of lets you kind of be
crafty<00:03:33.900> with<00:03:34.019> which<00:03:34.320> targets<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.250> try<00:03:35.400> to

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
crafty with which targets you try to

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.790 
crafty with which targets you try to
pick<00:03:35.700> out<00:03:35.850> because<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.660> engage<00:03:36.900> snipers

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
pick out because you can engage snipers
