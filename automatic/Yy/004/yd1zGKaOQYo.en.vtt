00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
how a wall will work so basically there

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.380 
how a wall will work so basically there
are<00:00:14.429> four<00:00:14.730> parts<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.240> Evolver<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:16.379> go<00:00:16.920> down

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
are four parts to Evolver just go down

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.120 
are four parts to Evolver just go down
okay<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:18.990> four<00:00:19.199> parts<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.740> trigger

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
okay we have four parts that trigger

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310 
okay we have four parts that trigger
cylinder<00:00:20.760> hammer<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.330> barrels<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.140> gonna

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
cylinder hammer and barrels so I'm gonna

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.290 
cylinder hammer and barrels so I'm gonna
just<00:00:22.529> show<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.980> pressure<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.119> our

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
just show you the pressure this is our

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.470 
just show you the pressure this is our
trigger<00:00:25.220> trigger<00:00:26.220> sorry<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.090> sorry

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
trigger trigger sorry I'm really sorry

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.030 
trigger trigger sorry I'm really sorry
this<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.439> our<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:29.220> yeah<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.090> hammer

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
this will be our I think yeah the hammer

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.250 
this will be our I think yeah the hammer
this<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> hammer<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:33.360> moves<00:00:33.690> moves

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
this will be the hammer it moves moves

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
this will be the hammer it moves moves
relative<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.130> trigger<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
relative to the trigger we have the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.160 
relative to the trigger we have the
cylinder<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.710> number<00:00:38.129> three<00:00:38.510> let<00:00:39.510> me<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.809> go

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
cylinder at number three let me just go

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.700 
cylinder at number three let me just go
there

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
there

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
there
this<00:00:41.309> will<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> our<00:00:41.790> gun<00:00:42.120> compartment<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
this will be our gun compartment the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.430 
this will be our gun compartment the
cylinder<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.270> barrel<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.750> course<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
cylinder and the barrel of course the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.090 
cylinder and the barrel of course the
mini<00:00:46.649> component<00:00:47.570> that<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.260> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
mini component that will go so so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
mini component that will go so so
basically<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.760> happens<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.390> initially<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
basically what happens is initially the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.439 
basically what happens is initially the
trigger<00:00:52.829> lever<00:00:53.370> pushes<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> hammer

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
trigger lever pushes the hammer

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.350 
trigger lever pushes the hammer
backwards<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:56.160> moves<00:00:56.489> backwards<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
backwards as it moves backwards the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.139 
backwards as it moves backwards the
hammer<00:00:57.660> compresses<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.770> metal<00:00:59.399> spring<00:00:59.670> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
hammer compresses a metal spring this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.920 
hammer compresses a metal spring this
one<00:01:00.420> over<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.840> right<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.930> Presnell

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
one over here right there and Presnell

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.429 
one over here right there and Presnell
spring<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> gun<00:01:04.920> stock<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.869> same<00:01:07.140> time

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
spring in the gun stock at the same time

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
spring in the gun stock at the same time
the<00:01:07.740> trigger<00:01:07.950> rotates<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.119> cylinder<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the trigger rotates the cylinder so the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.440 
the trigger rotates the cylinder so the
next<00:01:10.710> breech<00:01:11.130> chamber<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> positioned<00:01:12.330> in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
next breech chamber is positioned in

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
next breech chamber is positioned in
front<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> gun<00:01:13.200> barrel<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.430> be

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
front of the gun barrel so it will be

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.670 
front of the gun barrel so it will be
just<00:01:14.610> something<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> press

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
just something like this when you press

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.570 
just something like this when you press
the<00:01:16.979> trigger<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:19.590> thing<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.100> pushes<00:01:20.549> down

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the trigger this thing it pushes down

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
the trigger this thing it pushes down
and<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.840> basically<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.380> should<00:01:22.530> understand

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and so basically you should understand

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.700 
and so basically you should understand
that<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.310> bullet<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.000> made<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that a bullet is made this is a the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.340 
that a bullet is made this is a the
bullet<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.130> made<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> two<00:01:26.970> parts<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> due

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
bullet is made out of two parts one due

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
bullet is made out of two parts one due
to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> gunpowder<00:01:28.979> pots<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.579> propellant<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
to the gunpowder pots the propellant and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
to the gunpowder pots the propellant and
one<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> fire<00:01:31.079> firing<00:01:31.650> part<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> wheel

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
one the fire firing part the wheel

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.679 
one the fire firing part the wheel
bullet<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.630> once<00:01:34.640> once<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.880> trigger<00:01:36.270> moves

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
bullet so once once this trigger moves

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.770 
bullet so once once this trigger moves
moves<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.740> backwards<00:01:38.180> gun<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.420> hits

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
moves this thing backwards gun it hits

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.929 
moves this thing backwards gun it hits
this<00:01:40.079> part<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:41.430> there'll<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.759> an

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
this part and then there'll be an

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.149 
this part and then there'll be an
ignition<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> explosion<00:01:42.720> which<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:43.829> ignite

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
ignition and explosion which will ignite

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.690 
ignition and explosion which will ignite
and<00:01:44.490> propel<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:46.310> frontwards<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.549> this

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and propel this one frontwards so this

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.810 
and propel this one frontwards so this
is<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.030> happens<00:01:48.390> let's<00:01:48.720> look<00:01:49.079> closer

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
is what happens let's look closer

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.930 
is what happens let's look closer
we<00:01:50.970> go<00:01:51.120> that<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.840> happens<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.820> you

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
we go that that's what happens so if you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.420 
we go that that's what happens so if you
want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.130> happens

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
want to see that that's what happens

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.770 
want to see that that's what happens
they'll<00:01:59.580> be<00:01:59.729> ignition<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.390> will<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.660> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
they'll be ignition this will be that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.110 
they'll be ignition this will be that
thing<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.200> goes<00:02:01.590> off<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.910> ignition

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
thing that goes off this is the ignition

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.000 
thing that goes off this is the ignition
compartment<00:02:03.840> where<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.080> gunpowder<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.680> left

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
compartment where the gunpowder is left

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.310 
compartment where the gunpowder is left
like<00:02:05.330> hold<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:06.869> will<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.140> our

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
like hold it and this will be our

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.650 
like hold it and this will be our
chamber<00:02:08.190> where<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> propellant<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.149> gone<00:02:09.360> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
chamber where the propellant is gone so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.810 
chamber where the propellant is gone so
we<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.959> press<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> trigger<00:02:10.590> trigger<00:02:11.550> sorry

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
we just press the trigger trigger sorry

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.670
