it and this guess it here and I didn't
want<00:02:16.290> him<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.950> actually<00:02:17.730> wanted<00:02:18.180> them<00:02:18.330> up

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
want him here I actually wanted them up

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.670 
want him here I actually wanted them up
in<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> front<00:02:19.500> down<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.080> then<00:02:22.080> another

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
in the front down here and then another

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.460 
in the front down here and then another
one<00:02:22.950> over<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> corner<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:25.080> instead<00:02:25.350> he

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
one over to the corner but instead he

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.710 
one over to the corner but instead he
put<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.740> extra<00:02:26.010> one<00:02:26.100> right<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.700> which<00:02:27.570> would

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
put the extra one right here which would

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.980 
put the extra one right here which would
be<00:02:27.780> fine<00:02:28.170> except<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:30.020> my<00:02:31.940> FMF<00:02:32.940> fatty<00:02:33.240> well

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
be fine except for now my FMF fatty well

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.170 
be fine except for now my FMF fatty well
this<00:02:34.710> doesn't<00:02:34.920> really<00:02:35.160> fit<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.610> there<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.850> felt

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
this doesn't really fit on there I felt

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.750 
this doesn't really fit on there I felt
kind<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.480> grinding<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.340> I'm<00:02:38.400> gonna<00:02:38.490> have<00:02:38.670> to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
kind of grinding so I'm gonna have to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.820 
kind of grinding so I'm gonna have to
get<00:02:38.880> out<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> grinder

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
get out the grinder

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.230 
get out the grinder
and<00:02:42.770> as<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.160> see<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:46.880> past<00:02:47.880> that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
and as you can see you can get past that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.340 
and as you can see you can get past that
first<00:02:48.420> part<00:02:49.790> but<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:51.450> keeps<00:02:51.660> rubbing<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
first part but just keeps rubbing on the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.120 
first part but just keeps rubbing on the
pipe<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.080> kind<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.440> pisses<00:02:55.680> me<00:02:55.890> off<00:02:55.920> a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
pipe so that kind of pisses me off a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.660 
pipe so that kind of pisses me off a
little<00:02:56.280> bit<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:58.830> happens<00:02:59.180> you<00:03:00.180> know

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
little bit but happens you know

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.000 
little bit but happens you know
I'll<00:03:02.670> figure<00:03:02.959> stock<00:03:03.959> pipe<00:03:04.200> still<00:03:04.500> works<00:03:04.709> will

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
I'll figure stock pipe still works will

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.010 
I'll figure stock pipe still works will
stop<00:03:05.340> pipe<00:03:05.580> still<00:03:05.880> fit<00:03:06.060> down<00:03:06.240> there<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.690> I

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
stop pipe still fit down there so I

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.080 
stop pipe still fit down there so I
might<00:03:07.950> put<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.520> there<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> little

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
might put that on there for a little

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.350 
might put that on there for a little
while<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.690> run<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.380> with<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.680> 34b<00:03:11.520> cuny

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
while and just run it with a 34b cuny

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.810 
while and just run it with a 34b cuny
got<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> grin<00:03:14.030> almost<00:03:15.030> brand<00:03:15.330> new<00:03:15.420> air<00:03:15.690> box<00:03:15.959> from
