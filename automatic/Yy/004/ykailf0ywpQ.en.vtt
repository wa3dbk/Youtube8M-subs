our<00:01:32.670> three<00:01:33.000> basic<00:01:33.420> fundamental<00:01:34.350> practice

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
our three basic fundamental practice

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.350 
our three basic fundamental practice
strategies<00:01:35.310> you're<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> use<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
strategies you're going to use if you

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
strategies you're going to use if you
don't<00:01:36.720> follow<00:01:36.990> these<00:01:37.229> three<00:01:37.500> rules<00:01:37.710> you're

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
don't follow these three rules you're

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.830 
don't follow these three rules you're
just<00:01:38.579> wasting<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.720> gonna

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
just wasting your time you're not gonna

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200 
just wasting your time you're not gonna
learn<00:01:40.049> anything<00:01:40.220> fast<00:01:41.220> anything<00:01:41.670> efficiently

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
learn anything fast anything efficiently

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.969 
learn anything fast anything efficiently
in<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.780> next<00:01:43.110> chapter<00:01:43.439> I'll<00:01:43.590> teach<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> my

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
in the next chapter I'll teach you my

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.550 
in the next chapter I'll teach you my
six<00:01:44.460> step<00:01:44.790> goal<00:01:45.180> setting<00:01:45.540> method<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.049> don't

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
six step goal setting method I don't

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.929 
six step goal setting method I don't
know<00:01:46.619> about<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.189> used<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.579> times

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
know about you but I used to have times

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.810 
know about you but I used to have times
all<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.540> time<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> practice<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.340> hours

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
all the time when I practice like hours

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.359 
all the time when I practice like hours
on<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> piece<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.420> 3-4<00:01:52.200> hours<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.649> I'd<00:01:53.130> walk

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
on a piece like 3-4 hours and I'd walk

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.550 
on a piece like 3-4 hours and I'd walk
out<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> practice<00:01:53.909> room<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.560> what

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
out of the practice room and think what

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.370 
out of the practice room and think what
did<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.070> learn<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.899> seemed<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
did I really learn and it seemed like I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
did I really learn and it seemed like I
couldn't<00:01:58.649> even<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.399> thing<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.969> how

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
couldn't even think of one thing of how

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.760 
couldn't even think of one thing of how
my<00:02:00.479> piece<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> proof<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> seemed<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.649> was

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
my piece and proof it seemed like I was

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
my piece and proof it seemed like I was
just<00:02:01.890> spinning<00:02:02.250> my<00:02:02.280> wheels<00:02:02.369> repeating<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
just spinning my wheels repeating it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.609 
just spinning my wheels repeating it
over<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.960> not<00:02:04.079> making<00:02:04.350> any

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
over and over and not making any

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.889 
over and over and not making any
progress<00:02:04.860> once<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.880> started<00:02:06.180> using<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.630> six

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
progress once I started using the six

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.260 
progress once I started using the six
step<00:02:07.110> system<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.680> started<00:02:08.459> seeing<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:09.239> more

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
step system I started seeing way more

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.059 
step system I started seeing way more
results<00:02:09.750> every<00:02:10.080> practice<00:02:10.470> session<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.890> could

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
results every practice session I could

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.080 
results every practice session I could
say<00:02:11.250> okay<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.270> how<00:02:12.420> improved<00:02:12.810> this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090

the next section I go into extra

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.390 
the next section I go into extra
practice<00:02:46.870> strategies<00:02:47.049> for<00:02:47.920> learning<00:02:48.040> those

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
practice strategies for learning those

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.150 
practice strategies for learning those
specific<00:02:49.180> tricky<00:02:49.599> spots<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.079> songs<00:02:50.290> we've

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
specific tricky spots and songs we've

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.949 
specific tricky spots and songs we've
heard<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.489> one<00:02:51.970> song<00:02:52.239> where<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.810> can

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
heard of that one song where you can

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.289 
heard of that one song where you can
learn<00:02:53.079> it<00:02:53.290> really<00:02:53.829> well<00:02:54.010> except<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.000> one

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
learn it really well except for that one

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.110 
learn it really well except for that one
little<00:02:55.750> part<00:02:56.110> with<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.010> fast<00:02:57.310> arpeggio<00:02:57.879> run

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
little part with the fast arpeggio run

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.020 
little part with the fast arpeggio run
or<00:02:58.690> maybe<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.079> was<00:02:59.170> like<00:02:59.349> an<00:02:59.700> octave<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.790> fast

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
or maybe it was like an octave a fast

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.819 
or maybe it was like an octave a fast
octave<00:03:01.420> run<00:03:01.599> or<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.810> large<00:03:02.049> leap<00:03:02.319> or<00:03:02.500> something

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
octave run or a large leap or something

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.559 
octave run or a large leap or something
and<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.370> just<00:03:03.549> couldn't<00:03:03.760> get<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.090> one<00:03:04.329> part

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
and you just couldn't get that one part

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.869
