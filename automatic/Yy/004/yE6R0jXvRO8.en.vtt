about<00:01:40.079> halfway<00:01:40.320> down<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.670> once<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.939> get

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
about halfway down and then once you get

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.609 
about halfway down and then once you get
to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.390> certain<00:01:42.689> point<00:01:42.990> where<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> want<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
to the certain point where you want to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.319 
to the certain point where you want to
stop<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.220> continue<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> braid<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
stop just continue to braid it as a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
stop just continue to braid it as a
normal<00:01:45.780> braid

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.130 

then<00:01:51.790> you<00:01:51.910> just<00:01:52.090> want<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.300> tie<00:01:52.450> off<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.840> braid

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
then you just want to tie off the braid

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.440 
then you just want to tie off the braid
and<00:01:53.440> then<00:01:53.620> go<00:01:53.830> back<00:01:54.010> in<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.580> pull<00:01:55.210> on<00:01:55.330> the

a<00:01:57.250> little<00:01:57.490> bit<00:01:57.700> more<00:01:57.820> messy<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.690> can<00:01:58.840> do

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
a little bit more messy and you can do

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.840 
a little bit more messy and you can do
this<00:01:59.050> as<00:01:59.200> much<00:01:59.380> as<00:01:59.410> you<00:01:59.560> want<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.040> did<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.460> quite

this as much as you want I did it quite

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.020 
this as much as you want I did it quite
a<00:02:00.880> bit<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:01.450> then<00:02:02.229> you're<00:02:02.380> just<00:02:02.470> gonna<00:02:02.850> pin<00:02:03.850> in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
a bit and then you're just gonna pin in

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.640 
a bit and then you're just gonna pin in
the<00:02:04.120> hair<00:02:04.330> just<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.690> back<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.990> your<00:02:05.170> head<00:02:05.380> and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
the hair just a back of your head and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.750 
the hair just a back of your head and
make<00:02:05.770> sure<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:05.950> get<00:02:06.010> rid<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.430> hair<00:02:06.610> tie

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
make sure you get rid of the hair tie

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.160 
make sure you get rid of the hair tie
cuz<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.090> don't<00:02:07.240> want<00:02:07.390> people<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:08.020> see<00:02:08.140> that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
cuz you don't want people to see that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.830 
cuz you don't want people to see that
and<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:09.820> actually<00:02:10.030> went<00:02:10.300> back<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:10.600> and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and then I actually went back in and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.300 
and then I actually went back in and
messed<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.500> front<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.950> little<00:02:12.190> bit

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
messed up the front just a little bit

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.310 
messed up the front just a little bit
more<00:02:12.490> just<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.209> loosen<00:02:13.390> everything<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:14.020> and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
more just to loosen everything up and

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.400 
more just to loosen everything up and
that<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:18.660> for<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.780> bun<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.170> want<00:02:20.320> to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
that is it so for the bun you want to

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.380 
that is it so for the bun you want to
start<00:02:20.650> by<00:02:20.800> just<00:02:21.010> spraying<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.550> sea<00:02:21.850> salt<00:02:22.030> spray

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
start by just spraying a sea salt spray

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.360 
start by just spraying a sea salt spray
or<00:02:22.660> dry<00:02:22.900> shampoo<00:02:23.320> throughout<00:02:23.709> your<00:02:23.860> hair<00:02:24.070> just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
or dry shampoo throughout your hair just

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.370 
or dry shampoo throughout your hair just
to<00:02:24.520> give<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.670> some<00:02:24.910> more<00:02:25.030> texture<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.140> it'll<00:02:26.290> be

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
to give it some more texture so it'll be

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.620 
to give it some more texture so it'll be
easier<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.739> deal<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.459> then<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.090> throw

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
easier to deal with and then just throw

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.600 
easier to deal with and then just throw
it<00:02:28.750> up<00:02:28.840> into<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.170> high<00:02:29.470> ponytail<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.250> above

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
it up into a high ponytail just above

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.790 
it up into a high ponytail just above
the<00:02:31.000> crown<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.270> your<00:02:31.480> head<00:02:31.680> technically<00:02:32.680> on

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
the crown of your head technically on

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.380 
the crown of your head technically on
the<00:02:32.860> top<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.190> your<00:02:33.280> head

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.759 

so<00:02:41.390> for<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.629> actual<00:02:41.930> bun<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.319> want<00:02:42.439> to<00:02:42.530> stick

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
so for the actual bun you want to stick

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.709 
so for the actual bun you want to stick
your<00:02:42.799> finger<00:02:43.250> through<00:02:43.280> right<00:02:44.239> in<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.540> middle

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
your finger through right in the middle

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.599 
your finger through right in the middle

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
and then just twist your hair around

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.009 
and then just twist your hair around
your<00:02:46.849> finger<00:02:47.209> but<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.540> don't<00:02:47.750> want<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.930> twist

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
your finger but you don't want to twist

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.119 
your finger but you don't want to twist
the<00:02:48.230> hair<00:02:48.409> you're<00:02:48.560> gonna<00:02:48.680> leave<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.950> hair

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
the hair you're gonna leave the hair

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.520 
the hair you're gonna leave the hair
flat<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.760> just<00:02:50.239> circle<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.629> around<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.349> to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
flat and just circle it around and to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.649 
flat and just circle it around and to
form<00:02:51.799> a<00:02:51.950> bun<00:02:52.219> and<00:02:52.519> then<00:02:53.030> just<00:02:53.269> tie<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.480> off<00:02:53.629> with

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
form a bun and then just tie it off with

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.020 
form a bun and then just tie it off with
a<00:02:54.079> rubber<00:02:54.319> band<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:57.370> your<00:02:58.370> bun<00:02:58.549> should<00:02:58.730> end<00:02:58.909> up

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
a rubber band and your bun should end up

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.520 
a rubber band and your bun should end up
looking<00:02:59.120> something<00:02:59.629> along<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.170> lines<00:03:00.379> of

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
looking something along the lines of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.830 
looking something along the lines of
this<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.129> then<00:03:01.489> obviously<00:03:02.480> we're<00:03:02.569> gonna<00:03:02.659> go

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
this and then obviously we're gonna go

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.509 
this and then obviously we're gonna go
back<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.109> with<00:03:03.139> some<00:03:03.439> bobby<00:03:03.560> pins<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.099> just

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
back in with some bobby pins and just

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.339 
back in with some bobby pins and just
pin<00:03:04.819> down<00:03:05.090> any<00:03:05.329> of<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.599> weird<00:03:05.750> lumps<00:03:06.170> or

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
pin down any of the weird lumps or

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.849 
pin down any of the weird lumps or
anything<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:07.069> that's<00:03:07.939> pretty<00:03:08.120> much<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.859> but

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
anything and that's pretty much it but

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.710 
anything and that's pretty much it but
to<00:03:10.069> make<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.310> look<00:03:10.430> more<00:03:10.639> festive<00:03:10.909> we<00:03:11.329> decided

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
to make the look more festive we decided

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.390

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
to go back in and just tie a headband

to go back in and just tie a headband
around<00:03:13.519> her<00:03:13.909> hair<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.599> then<00:03:14.959> bobby<00:03:15.260> pin<00:03:15.470> it

around her hair and then bobby pin it
with<00:03:15.680> some<00:03:15.829> bobby<00:03:15.980> pins<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:16.489> we<00:03:16.879> only<00:03:17.180> tied<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599
