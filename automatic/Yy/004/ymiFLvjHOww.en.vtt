00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay we're back again with the s15 water

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.000 
okay we're back again with the s15 water
pump<00:00:04.859> removal<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:06.480> had<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> bit<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.710> problem

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
pump removal we had a bit of a problem

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.890 
pump removal we had a bit of a problem
where<00:00:08.340> we<00:00:08.519> have<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.670> remove<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.480> power

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
where we have to remove the power

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.759 
where we have to remove the power
steering<00:00:10.320> pump<00:00:11.059> and<00:00:12.059> its<00:00:12.809> framework<00:00:13.259> because

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
steering pump and its framework because

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.330 
steering pump and its framework because
it's<00:00:14.190> blocking<00:00:15.030> our<00:00:15.509> access<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.130> water

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
it's blocking our access to the water

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.640 
it's blocking our access to the water
pump<00:00:17.609> completely<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.449> we<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.900> remove<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
pump completely so we have to remove the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.310 
pump completely so we have to remove the
power<00:00:20.160> steering<00:00:20.550> pump<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.289> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
power steering pump so what I'm going to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.590 
power steering pump so what I'm going to
show<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.529> now<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.910> also<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
show you now is and we also have to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240 
show you now is and we also have to
loosen<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> air<00:00:25.590> conditioning

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
loosen up the air conditioning

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.080 
loosen up the air conditioning
compressor<00:00:26.660> to<00:00:27.660> frame<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:29.010> mounting<00:00:29.789> frame

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
compressor to frame the mounting frame

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.900 
compressor to frame the mounting frame
because<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.320> also<00:00:31.619> holds<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.550> steering

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
because that also holds the steering

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.930 
because that also holds the steering
pump<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.719> well<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.309> here's<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> bolts<00:00:35.760> let

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
pump on as well so here's the bolts let

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.930 
pump on as well so here's the bolts let
me<00:00:36.030> show<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.210> where<00:00:36.450> they're<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:38.820> can

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
me show you where they're at and we can

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.450 
me show you where they're at and we can
go<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.270> there

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460

enough away from this opening where you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.540 
enough away from this opening where you
can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> power<00:02:08.429> steering<00:02:09.259> compressor

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
can see the power steering compressor

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.850 
can see the power steering compressor
chassis<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:12.300> behind<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.810> AC<00:02:13.020> frame

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
chassis was behind the AC frame

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.030 
chassis was behind the AC frame
so<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.820> am<00:02:15.060> able<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.510> pull<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.990> away<00:02:16.550> now<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.860> we

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
so I am able to pull it away now and we

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.240 
so I am able to pull it away now and we
can<00:02:20.220> set<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.580> aside<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:22.890> long<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.130> we

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
can set this aside just as long as we

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.790 
can set this aside just as long as we
don't<00:02:23.400> lose<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.830> AC<00:02:26.040> bolt<00:02:27.260> but<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.560> nice

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
don't lose the the AC bolt but the nice

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.370 
don't lose the the AC bolt but the nice
thing<00:02:28.830> about<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.820> exposes

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.660 

it<00:02:37.380> also<00:02:37.530> exposes<00:02:38.310> our<00:02:38.600> inline<00:02:39.600> fuel<00:02:39.990> filter

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
it also exposes our inline fuel filter

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.300 
it also exposes our inline fuel filter
so<00:02:41.670> while<00:02:41.910> we're<00:02:42.090> doing<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.980> power<00:02:43.980> steering

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
so while we're doing this power steering

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.000 
so while we're doing this power steering
pump<00:02:44.790> excuse<00:02:45.600> me<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.990> water<00:02:46.740> pump

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
pump excuse me the water pump

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.070 
pump excuse me the water pump
replacement<00:02:47.330> we're<00:02:48.330> also<00:02:48.480> going<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:48.990> ahead

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
replacement we're also going to go ahead

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.640 
replacement we're also going to go ahead
and<00:02:49.350> replace<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.710> inline<00:02:50.580> fuel<00:02:50.940> filter

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
and replace the inline fuel filter

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.230 
and replace the inline fuel filter
because<00:02:52.650> about<00:02:52.920> fifty<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.459> seventy<00:02:53.790> thousand

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
because about fifty to seventy thousand

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.530 
because about fifty to seventy thousand
miles<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.840> filter<00:02:55.230> will<00:02:55.380> get<00:02:55.530> clogged<00:02:55.830> up

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
miles that filter will get clogged up

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.080 
miles that filter will get clogged up
it's<00:02:57.540> hard<00:02:57.780> enough<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.170> get<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.880> hasn't

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
it's hard enough to get to and it hasn't

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.480 
it's hard enough to get to and it hasn't
been<00:03:00.300> changed<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.990> probably<00:03:01.350> 50<00:03:01.650> 70<00:03:02.040> thousand

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
been changed in probably 50 70 thousand

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.770 
been changed in probably 50 70 thousand
miles<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.030> don't<00:03:03.090> want<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.390> be<00:03:03.480> stranded

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
miles and I don't want to be stranded

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.290 
miles and I don't want to be stranded
out<00:03:04.050> on<00:03:04.230> some<00:03:04.500> highway<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.910> we're<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> go

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
out on some highway so we're going to go

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.660 
out on some highway so we're going to go
ahead<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.510> replace<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:07.020> as<00:03:07.230> well<00:03:07.490> so<00:03:08.490> for

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
ahead and replace that as well so for

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.850 
ahead and replace that as well so for
now<00:03:08.820> our<00:03:09.620> major<00:03:10.620> goal<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.850> get<00:03:12.090> these<00:03:12.860> get

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
now our major goal is to get these get

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.090 
now our major goal is to get these get
these<00:03:14.010> Torx<00:03:14.490> head<00:03:14.610> bolts<00:03:15.570> out<00:03:15.990> of<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.770> water

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
these Torx head bolts out of the water

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.720 
these Torx head bolts out of the water
pump<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:18.200> get<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.320> off<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.769> unit<00:03:20.100> clean<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.550> up

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
pump and get it off the unit clean it up

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.190 
pump and get it off the unit clean it up
and<00:03:21.530> take<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.709> water<00:03:22.890> hoses<00:03:23.220> off<00:03:24.200> naturally

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
and take the water hoses off naturally

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.600 
and take the water hoses off naturally
there's<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.980> lot<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.250> antifreeze

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
there's going to be a lot of antifreeze

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.820 
there's going to be a lot of antifreeze
is<00:03:26.970> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.209> come<00:03:27.360> pouring<00:03:27.660> out<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.560> we're

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
is going to come pouring out so we're

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.740 
is going to come pouring out so we're
going<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.980> want<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.220> bucket<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.750> maybe<00:03:31.709> a

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
going to want to bucket and maybe a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.979 
going to want to bucket and maybe a
antifreeze<00:03:34.370> bin<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:36.269> collect<00:03:36.600> all<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
antifreeze bin to collect all the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.229 
antifreeze bin to collect all the
drippings

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
drippings

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.370 
drippings
so<00:03:39.239> next<00:03:40.019> episode<00:03:40.850> we'll<00:03:41.850> come<00:03:42.060> back<00:03:42.239> also<00:03:43.080> by

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
so next episode we'll come back also by

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.520 
so next episode we'll come back also by
the<00:03:43.440> way<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.920> lifted<00:03:44.820> up<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.269> air<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:46.260> air

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
the way I lifted up the air the air

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.410 
the way I lifted up the air the air
cleaner<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.610> give<00:03:47.760> me<00:03:47.910> more<00:03:48.120> room<00:03:48.360> to

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
cleaner just to give me more room to

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.660 
cleaner just to give me more room to
work<00:03:48.600> around<00:03:49.019> behind<00:03:49.320> here<00:03:49.620> we'll<00:03:50.370> put<00:03:50.550> that

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
work around behind here we'll put that

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.630 
work around behind here we'll put that
back<00:03:51.180> down<00:03:51.209> later<00:03:51.739> but<00:03:52.739> next<00:03:53.040> episode<00:03:53.430> we'll

back down later but next episode we'll
have<00:03:53.820> these<00:03:54.030> hoses<00:03:54.780> loosened<00:03:55.470> up<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:56.700> I'll

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
have these hoses loosened up and I'll

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.860 
have these hoses loosened up and I'll
also<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.390> these<00:03:57.600> Torx<00:03:58.050> head<00:03:58.850> bolts<00:03:59.870> pretty

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
also have these Torx head bolts pretty

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.420 
also have these Torx head bolts pretty
much<00:04:01.050> taken<00:04:01.500> out<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:01.980> we<00:04:02.070> can<00:04:02.190> start

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
much taken out so that we can start

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.090 
much taken out so that we can start
replacing<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.030> water<00:04:03.209> pump<00:04:03.709> okay<00:04:04.709> that's<00:04:04.980> it

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
replacing the water pump okay that's it

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.370 
replacing the water pump okay that's it
for<00:04:05.130> now
