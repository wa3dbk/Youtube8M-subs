 human in the art of furniture 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.699

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.369
 naked of solid forms with feminine attributes tremendously 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.169

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.869
 extremities 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.640
 the specialists discuss if they are realistic representations about 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 symbols 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.630
 what it certainly manifests is a great power of abstraction when figuring the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.350
 part of the whole 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.890
 the venus de willendorf is one of the most famous measures 10 centimeters and 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.890

 in 1875 marcelino sanz de sautuola started some prospections in a cave 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.230
 located in a meadow called altamira in the town of epis pieres municipality of 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.740
 santillana del mar 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.200
 did not give importance to the first figures found but three years 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.810
 then he resumed the excavations what he did in the summer of 1879 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.990
 it would be his daughter Maria who realized the existence of painted figures on 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.090
 ceiling of the room that continued the place where he was digging 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.540

 nine anthropomorphs several hands and almost a hundred signs 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.910
 undoubtedly the most characteristic image of altamira is the bison 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.610
 dated in the Magdalenian era 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.550
 it is considered that the objective of these figures would be to secure the court 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.410
 Mesopotamian criticism will be one of the most artistic manifestations 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.410
