00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
out as a you remove all power pack so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
out as a you remove all power pack so
that's<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> resurfacing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that's the resurfacing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.289 
that's the resurfacing
don't<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
don't really have to put it up on a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
don't really have to put it up on a
hoist<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.840> pull<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.950> spent

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
hoist you just pull it out and it spent

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
hoist you just pull it out and it spent
two<00:01:26.189> hours<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.759> set<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.540> what's<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
two hours and it set and then what's the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200 
two hours and it set and then what's the
horsepower<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.770> put<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
horsepower is that put in here this one

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.840 
horsepower is that put in here this one
now<00:01:30.360> turn<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.750> horsepower<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.850> seating

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
now turn on one horsepower and seating

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
now turn on one horsepower and seating
capacity<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> moment<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.770> quick

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
capacity this one at the moment is quick

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.940 
capacity this one at the moment is quick
with<00:01:35.100> 33<00:01:35.790> 6<00:01:36.299> plus<00:01:36.630> standards<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.740> again

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
