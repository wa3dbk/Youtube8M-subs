 and from my blog that will take you 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.760
 directly to the tabs where 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.510
 will be 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.470
 [Music]

 [Music] 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.300
 post what does it directly serve the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.710
 person 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.710

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.710
 to leave them instantly 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.539
 what it is the entire entry where they are 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.789

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.440
 and what not 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.620
 in the description of this program 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.590
 and the ok downloads simply give it 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.790
 click on a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.790
 5 seconds 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.400
 so you can download 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.880
 the server will never be this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.080
 the same on this side as you can see 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.070
 they will be able to download it ok once done 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 They will have this and their 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.230
 downloaded files to your desktop 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.670
 where you what you want to have 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 they will simply give right and extract here 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.770
 once extracted it will leave you this 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.470
 installer and as he quotes here 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.480
 install it as task manager 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.980
 okay 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.730
 we are just going to execute it as 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.730
 administrator 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.549
 we will get this message will ask us 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:15.739
 permission we indicate that if we are not 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.200
 will request a language choose yours in 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.049
 my case is Spain and I give it an accept 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.900
 once in accepting I did not know what is the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.680
 installed assistant welcomes us 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.230
 to what is the consequent program 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.780
 We accept the agreements of the contract if 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.610
 you want to read what you do to the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.410
 incident 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:45.360
 in the version of our malwarebytes 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.810
 next in the link where you will stay 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.640
 our program in the folder that is 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.640
 receive will position on the hard disk the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.640
 following 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.430
 since it tells us to confirm new 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.950
 click on the next one and if you want 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.430
 select a different folder then 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.170
 click on browse ok here only the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.770
 name of the folder where 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.970
 will install the following one creates one with 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.109
 the desktop 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.430
 it will be all without any 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.100
 install 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.120
 [Music] 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.820
 is to update if we can leave 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.840
 to be updated as is the 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.760
 program but first let's create what 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.490
 we will remove to execute it 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.940
 we are going to finalize the disposal of this 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.330
 oven 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.580
 as it does not tell here on the tab 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.600
 says of that activity deactivate the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.180
 antivirus this tells us so that we 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.180
 cause problems to be old 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.550
 we will arrive in disable tigris 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.060
 for 15 minutes it will be enough once 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.740
 is activated during virus we click 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.160
 right and run as administrator 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:18.290
 [Music] 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.290
 will ask us for permission say yes 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.970
 we take away the music if you do not like it and 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.280
 here we can generate another kind of 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.900
 codes but we're not going to go something 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.870
 our smith or malware 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.870
 we already execute our program 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.720
 wait permission we say that if here the 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.880
 database is obsolete since 518 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.280
 days and will be updated now we give you that 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.460
 not because 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.940
 what we are going to do is first create it 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.940
 Y 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.840
 as we can see here I do not think 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.420
 because I already had it installed 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:09.130
 previously but yes no 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.130
 we say to you it comes out 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.840
 then you will have to go out to that one 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.900
 window to activate from the window 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.710
 active river will come out a small box 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.890
 who will ask us for the 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.980
 and the being since it is simply here 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.420
 this one we will position it in the first and 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.260
 is in action again in the second 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.840
 war 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.300
 we will start to activate and that will be all 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.180
 has thrown away and I recommend that after 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.090
 of that we restarted our 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.490
 computer so that it does not cause us 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.200
 problems ok to our has been everything 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.350
 friends, I hope you liked them
