00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 héloïse friends let's learn to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.960
 to draw riley from vice versa to the nose or 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.679
 sting at the colossus for this drawing I 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.080
 need paper to the manga deleter of a 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.260
 pencil an eraser possibly a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.380
 several liner precision eraser 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.390
 someone's or two-colored sizes of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.029
 colored pencils and finally a role 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 auction I begin by schematizing the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 face by a circle then I go along and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.579
 I detail little by little their is then 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.950
 it's a series of multicolored drawings 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.780
 most of the buildings will be 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.059
 almost always the same thing I you 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.210
 lets watch the videos to see the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.690
 nuances between the different 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.210
 others 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.149
 in this purpose I use any matter min 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 Japanese mono brand shaker 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.320
 if you're interested we did a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.629
 presentation on this product then riley 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.410
 is the heroine of vice versa the new 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.710
 pixar movie 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.329
 most of the film is recorded and that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.699
 explain his reactions 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.530
 to make our decisions simple 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.600
 governed by 5 cents in sadness joy 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.340
 suddenly and anger it's a movie 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.450
 intelligent with a reading grid 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.549
 deep 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.799
 children will see a whole story 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.990
 room and parents will remember 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.070
 that they are and disarming and will be 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.470
 expected 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.570
 it's a movie accessible to everyone 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.330
 and weirdly we also find it very 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.050
 mature pixar signs a fabulous movie 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.850
 couric see him especially since there is another 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.990
 little gem that is premiered 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.050
 part of the movie 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.420
 the short film there then all the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.610
 cinemas do not necessarily go short 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.440
 footage so inquire if you 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.080
 want to see it absolutely for drawing 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.820
 I opted for a very childish style 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.920
 looks simple affair like that but does not 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.990
 you do not trust it's also a lot of 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.940
 to do childish drawings 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.100
 sometimes the simplest drawings 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.649
 is more taf than it looks 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.680
 as a background I make hens that 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.340
 represents in the movie the memories of 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.350
 wrinkled 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.440
 and then some banks the echoes 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.970
 ostomatized with the feelings of rake a 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.950
 Once the sketch is over I attack 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.260
 colleagues I 'm going to use the neo 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.030
 picot light iii 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.690
 it's a Japanese liner that does not have 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 sore 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.340
 I start with the frame with the line up 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.620
 the biggest 2.0 then I realize the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.480
 line of the character with a liner of 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.280
 size 0.5 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.100
 it is not the finest that the liner 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.350
 exists a 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.800
 there are even finer liners 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.750
 like the 0.03 so I chose euro5 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.210
 because I thought the traits were 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.640
 saw a lot better on videos than 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.270
 I recommend size 0 2 size 0 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.830
 3 if you start otherwise if you have 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.200
 more means the top is still 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.580
 to have a set of several sizes of 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.700
 liner is always useful 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.370
 once the finished line I erase thanks 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.890
 to a rubber eraser I advise you to 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.190
 the duster free range of faber castell or 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.500
 the Japanese range we have committed 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.140
 carefully not to forget 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.320
 areas still pencil if not during the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.670
 colonization or risk drooling 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.660
 the pencil 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.250
 when it's not so bad if you 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.400
 do not press too much on your pencil 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.520
 a certain place but if he put himself 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.470
 too much pencil on your chew that can 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.940
 to be putting on when I'm hooked 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.090
 by the colorization we are at pico 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.440
 colored then it's a Japanese felt 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.930
 with a brush tip he points 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.330
 fine it is a felt years that I like 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.420
 a lot because it's a felt that has not 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.480
 the big breeze in tai chi let's be honest 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.550
 is not often used separately in 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.780
 highly experienced designers 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.220
 although we use quite rare even 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.920
 film clip is very useful for 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.870
 details and the brush tip is more 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.520
 for supermarkets and make 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.510
 effects we also made a presentation 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.010
 of this product if you're interested 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.470
 click on this frame the fee is 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.120
 as simple with many colors 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.040
 by the way if you count the number of 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.300
 felt there was more than usual 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.060
 yet the drawing does not look 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.370
 complex it must be said that vice versa is 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.590
 a very colorful film and it shows on this 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.330
 drawing then usually I you 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.549
 advise to take paper the 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.410
 high-madness works at the felt but for 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.780
 this series of drawings we are or pico 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.210
 color i will use manga paper 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.830
 director so that's the benefits and the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.670
 cons 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.890
 I started with the disadvantages 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.350
 so this is a type of paper that sees 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.410
 a little more than paper attacks 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.810
 So if you want to use must 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.830
 longer fuck better 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.740
 return to laërt 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.240
 otherwise it also benefits gold on the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.860
 paper where you need to make the outlines 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.320
 last because otherwise this map 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.060
 and this is not the case with this paper you 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.430
 can do that outlines first 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.560
 by the way, that's what we do and the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.780
 colo after ski still much more 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.510
 practical and more natural for 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.810
 beginners keep in mind that in 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.870
 this video is using paper 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.240
 director given to the country that we line 3 and 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.180
 of ulm and colored pimples in this 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.200
 configuration the outlines in black do not 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.690
 drool no more 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.150
 surprise other products that's 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.590
 other conditions and so at the level of 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.550
 made it will not be the same thing it 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.340
 will have to test 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.410
 color maps or not once the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.050
 place colors and I add nuances 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.400
 in colored pencil then pencils 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.530
 of colors of the school range 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.600
 should do it since these are 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.730
 additions of fairly light nuances 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.110
 there is that white pencil that should 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.340
 to be rather fine art ranges or 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.860
 otherwise you can also take a 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.230
 pencil on it in white I finalize the 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.270
 drawing with touches of light at 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.490
