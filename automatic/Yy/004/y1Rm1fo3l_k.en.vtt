00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.080
 grilling is a cooking technique that 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:17.050
 it is used for any type of food yes 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.390
 can grill fish meat vegetable you can 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.369
 shouting on the grill you can wake up a 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 fire alive and you can grill like 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.200
 we will shout these vegetables 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.579
 simply with a pan made in 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.070
 grill on high heat or plate 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.489
 first after cutting 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.320
 carefully the vegetables in this way 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.690
 which I think lasts faster and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.239
 well you have to do it of a thickness not 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.850
 too not too excessive they can 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.300
 we do not color the eggplant well 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.800
 nothing but making washers with 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.899
 its peel 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.390
 otherwise it would be smashed 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.640
 completely this is therefore also of 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.680
 a thickness of about half a centimeter 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.570
 then we also make the onion that is 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.030
 very good very good barbecue 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 let's do this even slightly 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.909
 a little more often I should say almost of a 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.100
 centimeter and we are so ready with the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.090
 cut vegetables 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.619
 now we just have to have 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.869
 foresight the only difficult thing to 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.970
 this procedure is to have the grid a 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.340
 right temperature right temperature 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:35.020
 say not too excessive but neither 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.930
 low we go to put the oil not so much 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.210
 absolutely otherwise it goes to fry 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.060
 it goes to boil and we will have some vegetables 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:49.450
 boiled boiled as you see now precisely 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:55.360
 well the pan we are going to remove 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:05.320
 this excess oil we take the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:10.899
 zucchini, the pepper, the aubergine and the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.329
 onion rest all on the pa of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.970
 bottom of the pan and let's go to 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:22.000
 check the heat status of the pa 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.690
 of the same thing ray say that it is a lot 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.110
 good and obvious this is unfortunately a 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.870
 dish that will create some smoke at home 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.670
 however it would be enough to light up the maximum 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.140
 the aspirator that surely everyone of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.390
 you will have on the kitchen and we try to 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.390
 make collect as much smoke as possible 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:56.700
 they are well cooked 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.190
 desired we can arrange them 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:05.250
 also turn off let's put them on 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:09.830
 always single or service dish 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.590
 now these grilled vegetables don't 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.770
 they do not need marinating 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.040
 such as fish for meat 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:25.980
 therefore for fish meat it is better to use 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 a marinade before grilling this 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:38.070
 way now to be able to finish in beauty a 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:41.490
 extra virgin olive oil wire on top and le 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.420
 our vegetables are ready to be 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.450
 eat 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.450
