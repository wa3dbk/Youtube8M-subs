encounter and Blackrock descent this is
probably<00:00:39.260> one<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.710> top<00:00:39.860> five<00:00:40.190> most

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
probably one of the top five most

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.340 
probably one of the top five most
difficult<00:00:41.000> five-man<00:00:41.480> achievements<00:00:41.930> in<00:00:42.230> my

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
difficult five-man achievements in my

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.630 
difficult five-man achievements in my
opinion<00:00:42.910> simply<00:00:43.910> because<00:00:44.320> requires<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.710> pretty

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
opinion simply because requires a pretty

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.410 
opinion simply because requires a pretty
strong<00:00:47.000> gear<00:00:47.620> everyone<00:00:48.620> in<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.769> group<00:00:49.420> plus

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
strong gear everyone in the group plus

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.049 
strong gear everyone in the group plus
proper<00:00:50.839> cool<00:00:51.050> down<00:00:51.199> usage<00:00:51.640> there<00:00:52.640> may<00:00:52.760> be<00:00:52.790> some

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
proper cool down usage there may be some

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.200 
proper cool down usage there may be some
strategies<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.720> revolve<00:00:54.199> around<00:00:55.000> using<00:00:56.000> two

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
strategies that revolve around using two

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.240 
strategies that revolve around using two
tanks<00:00:56.600> two<00:00:56.900> healers<00:00:57.229> I<00:00:57.470> wanted<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.830> try<00:00:58.070> that

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
tanks two healers I wanted to try that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.549 
tanks two healers I wanted to try that
numerous<00:00:59.150> was<00:00:59.930> able<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.199> get<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.350> group

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
numerous was able to get the group

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.619 
numerous was able to get the group
composition<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:02.089> didn't<00:01:02.269> find<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.449> way<00:01:02.570> to

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
composition so we didn't find a way to

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.960 
composition so we didn't find a way to
do<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.869> with<00:01:02.989> one<00:01:03.019> tank<00:01:03.409> when<00:01:03.589> he<00:01:03.739> learned<00:01:03.970> and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
do it with one tank when he learned and

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.310 
do it with one tank when he learned and
it<00:01:05.089> really<00:01:05.239> just<00:01:05.299> revolves<00:01:05.750> around<00:01:05.840> proper

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
it really just revolves around proper

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.010 
it really just revolves around proper
cool<00:01:06.619> down<00:01:06.799> that<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.189> want<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.520> change<00:01:07.790> that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
cool down that you want to change that

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.820 
cool down that you want to change that
so<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:09.830> end<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.490> achievement<00:01:11.060> requires

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
so to that end the achievement requires

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.260 
so to that end the achievement requires
allowing<00:01:12.830> all<00:01:13.070> three<00:01:13.369> Twilight<00:01:13.759> so<00:01:13.909> let's<00:01:14.060> go

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
allowing all three Twilight so let's go

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.260 
allowing all three Twilight so let's go
to<00:01:14.900> transform<00:01:15.470> into<00:01:15.619> evolved<00:01:15.950> version

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
to transform into evolved version

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.249 
to transform into evolved version
filling<00:01:17.270> all<00:01:17.509> three<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.810> those<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:18.110> all

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
filling all three of those of all

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.990 
filling all three of those of all
versions<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:18.979> then<00:01:19.159> killing<00:01:19.369> Portland<00:01:19.880> as

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
versions and then killing Portland as

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.230 
versions and then killing Portland as
normal<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.500> there's<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.890> huge<00:01:22.400> amount<00:01:22.549> of<00:01:22.850> spike

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
normal so there's a huge amount of spike

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.310 
normal so there's a huge amount of spike
PPS<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:24.049> can<00:01:24.229> come<00:01:24.409> in<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.070> tank<00:01:25.310> so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
PPS that can come in on the tank so

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.870 
PPS that can come in on the tank so
again<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.439> need<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.679> utilize<00:01:28.549> proper

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
again you need to utilize proper

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.660 
again you need to utilize proper
cooldowns<00:01:29.649> so<00:01:30.649> basically<00:01:30.950> what<00:01:31.070> we<00:01:31.159> did<00:01:31.340> is

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
cooldowns so basically what we did is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.419 
cooldowns so basically what we did is
for<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.240> first<00:01:32.450> one<00:01:32.659> is<00:01:32.689> grood<00:01:33.079> tank<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.619> use<00:01:34.399> a

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
for the first one is grood tank I use a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.059 
for the first one is grood tank I use a
bark<00:01:34.909> skin<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.509> then<00:01:36.200> follow<00:01:36.499> that<00:01:36.649> up<00:01:36.710> with

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
bark skin and then follow that up with

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.450 
bark skin and then follow that up with
survival<00:01:37.670> instincts<00:01:38.179> and<00:01:38.689> then<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.590> then<00:01:39.859> in

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
survival instincts and then I then in

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.020 
survival instincts and then I then in
the<00:01:40.909> first<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.390> all<00:01:41.509> is<00:01:41.780> basically<00:01:42.170> done<00:01:43.030> for

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
the first of all is basically done for

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.469 
the first of all is basically done for
the<00:01:44.119> second<00:01:44.479> people<00:01:45.490> wave<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.520> paladin<00:01:47.030> healer

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
the second people wave a paladin healer

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.599 
the second people wave a paladin healer
so<00:01:47.990> he<00:01:48.259> uses<00:01:48.439> both<00:01:48.859> his<00:01:49.069> cooldowns<00:01:49.280> let<00:01:50.179> me<00:01:50.380> and

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
so he uses both his cooldowns let me and

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.379 
so he uses both his cooldowns let me and
once<00:01:52.840> those<00:01:53.840> are<00:01:53.899> up<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:55.009> Twilight<00:01:55.609> the<00:01:56.149> vault

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
once those are up the Twilight the vault

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:57.910 
once those are up the Twilight the vault
version<00:01:56.719> would<00:01:56.869> normally<00:01:57.200> not<00:01:57.319> be<00:01:57.469> dead<00:01:57.649> but

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
version would normally not be dead but

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.859 
version would normally not be dead but
we<00:01:58.039> use<00:01:58.219> blood<00:01:58.549> loss<00:01:58.759> Time<00:01:59.240> Warp<00:01:59.479> during<00:01:59.749> that

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
we use blood loss Time Warp during that

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.059 
we use blood loss Time Warp during that
time<00:02:00.109> so<00:02:00.499> that<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:00.979> pretty<00:02:01.310> much<00:02:01.429> done<00:02:03.069> the

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
time so that it is pretty much done the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.219 
time so that it is pretty much done the
other<00:02:04.159> thing<00:02:04.369> note<00:02:04.639> is<00:02:04.969> that<00:02:04.999> as<00:02:05.780> soon<00:02:05.990> as<00:02:06.139> they

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
other thing note is that as soon as they

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.749 
other thing note is that as soon as they
evolve<00:02:06.409> spawns<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:07.069> will<00:02:07.159> try<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.369> use<00:02:07.520> shadow

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
evolve spawns it will try to use shadow

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.559 
evolve spawns it will try to use shadow
strike<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.709> great<00:02:09.890> idea<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:11.390> ready

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
strike so it's a great idea to be ready

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.600 
strike so it's a great idea to be ready
to<00:02:11.660> interrupt<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.170> immediately<00:02:12.590> as<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:13.459> will

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
to interrupt that immediately as I will

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.110 
to interrupt that immediately as I will
lower<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.030> heat<00:02:14.150> spike<00:02:14.390> dama<00:02:14.630> have<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> group

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
lower the heat spike dama have a group

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.270 
lower the heat spike dama have a group
most<00:02:17.120> tanks<00:02:17.420> save<00:02:18.260> perhaps<00:02:18.500> Palin<00:02:19.040> should<00:02:19.190> be

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
most tanks save perhaps Palin should be

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.949 
most tanks save perhaps Palin should be
able<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.490> enter<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.819> buy<00:02:20.000> them<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.300> much

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.160 

the<00:02:23.959> gun<00:02:24.140> both<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.470> our<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.950> our<00:02:25.129> cooldowns<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the gun both of our of our cooldowns and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.000 
the gun both of our of our cooldowns and
got<00:02:28.040> lust<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> second<00:02:29.420> one<00:02:29.540> dies<00:02:30.010> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
got lust and so the second one dies and

agility<00:03:06.230> potion<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:08.450> that's<00:03:08.720> pretty<00:03:09.049> much

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
agility potion and that's pretty much

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.539 
agility potion and that's pretty much
plenty<00:03:09.799> of<00:03:09.890> time<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.519> finish<00:03:10.670> them<00:03:10.910> up<00:03:12.549> but

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
plenty of time to finish them up but

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.759

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
even so you can see that healer is

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.420 
even so you can see that healer is
pretty<00:03:16.370> much<00:03:16.489> out<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.670> man<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.959> it's<00:03:18.829> it's

pretty much out of man and it's it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.680 
pretty much out of man and it's it's
extremely<00:03:20.390> taxing<00:03:20.660> on<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.560> intern<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:23.269> just

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
extremely taxing on the intern so just

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.199 
extremely taxing on the intern so just

decently<00:03:32.900> geared<00:03:33.170> groups<00:03:33.440> healers<00:03:34.040> should<00:03:34.880> be

decently geared groups healers should be

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.420 
decently geared groups healers should be

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
interrupting the evolved then she will
