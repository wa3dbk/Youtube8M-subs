00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.619
 police officers from afar 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.539
 I look like a dog something well 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.289
 in the dark they are looking for closer 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:31.949
 look like a bear he goes on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.600

 I call the police and now I had to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.960
 only the territory of the building near offices 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 migration management and

 combed the territory brought 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.109
 service dog 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.129
 however in the conditions of a large number 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.780
 foreign smells and huge 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.670
 territory she did little to help 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.770
 it turned out the search engines several times 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 passed by the beast that lurked in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 ditch in dense thickets 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.890
 it was discovered only in the fifth 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 one o'clock in the evening and here it is where the place or and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 real triangle here don't wait here 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.400
 here here are the bellies and the broken ones 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.950
 tagged and the conclusion is good that these 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.350
 trees are not here somewhere poured into a pool thin 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.170
 then they stuck here the body remained 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.380
 here it was safe for the surrounding 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.210

 four times all this time pupils 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.270

 sent to the study veterinarians 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.340
 hunters there is an assumption why 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.110
 the animal was close to people 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.659
