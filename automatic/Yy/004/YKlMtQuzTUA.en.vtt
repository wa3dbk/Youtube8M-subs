00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.910
 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 today a very cool little recipe 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.970
 to do 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.490
 almost all of them that I pass are 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.020
 easy to make is not even the recipe for 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.780
 today is a broth of garlic broth leek one I 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.200
 I love garlic for those who do not want 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.530
 getting fat is a good request as well 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.039
 what you need is two 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 peeled large potatoes are not peeled and 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.170
 chopped 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.230
 It is a relief for the garlic, but you can 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.329
 take advantage of the leaves and the stalk 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 All right then here I have one 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:58.620
 garlic pork whole parsley august two 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 You can choose the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.450
 chicken broth vegetable broth I 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.689
 I have here vegetable soup 4 tablespoons 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.600
 of olive oil soup a little 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.579
 certain pepper that broth has to have a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.759
 Pepper at least I like 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.709
 a liter of good water are these 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.770
 ingredients you need for the 

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:24.569
 Today's recipe is a broth these days. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.969
 now 'cold' too good then a 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.450
 broth is always a good order also for 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.520
 The ones I love Caldi to those who are 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.310
 also a good regret 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.929
 which always complemented one that finishes 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.689
 getting a little more caloric 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:47.630
 Good. Let's go in a pot. Let's go. 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.630
 put one quart of water 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.740
 and the two broth will not dissolve the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.990
 broth in this water do not let people boil 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:13.400
 Look at a pot then you'll put the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:18.130
 olive oil and will take back the garlic but good 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:25.070
 after that he had the garlic removed 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:27.610
 add the potatoes mentioned and the cauby 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.610
 also 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.600
 good in the end we need it 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.600
 need in the end we will correct the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.520
 jump and I like 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.520
 I'll add a little pepper 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.000
 good now both panela and let semi 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:03:00.170
 do not spill boil 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.840
 cook the battles people then after 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.870
 who cooked potato we're going to hit this 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.510
 broth here in the blender 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.070
 it will actually turn into a cream and we 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.550
 cause or care because it's hot to 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.550
 do not get burned 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.790
 good then it goes back to the pan 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.890
 to correct the salt if necessary and 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.240
 put a parsley does not put a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.710
 little partner 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.750
 now you're leaving or getting a little bit 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.500
 of salsa and leave a little to 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.290
 decorate before serving right lock 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.840
 Look how she turned into a cream one. 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.260
 delicious broth 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.530
 let me give her a quick wound 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.880
 Look how beautiful it is to become a cream. 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.740
 Broth 10 did not close the door however 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.740
 what we do 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.880
 You do not have to run the cars. 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.299
 only the broth tablets of 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.270
 vegetables the rapid ova hotel fast fire 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.270
 It's just to put on some panties. 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.889
 Look, let's just see here how the 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.190
 our broth now also for those who like 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:40.120
 can serve with an alley that alley you 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.800
 will fry the alley into small pieces and can 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.780
 also serve with the pieces of bacon 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.470
 and only then will not it get so light on 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.770
 table but it will look good 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.940
 Good, and it looks good 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.190
 a garlic broth can also speak 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:03.610
 cream of the radio for obvious that turned a 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:08.100
 cream so delicious, we are wonderful 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:13.950
 out of series for the cold days then 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.950
 warms the body and soul too 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.440
 another thing that can be from a toast 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.320
 I made a wholegrain bread toast here. 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.320
 everything is light - the bank but also 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.120
 little bits will not do anything 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.120
 on a map not small white pieces 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.690
 It's not going to kill, it's just going to give a little taste. 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.690
 Special 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.830
 bread toast 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.730
 You can do it a little bit. 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.280
 Japanese butter and olive oil go through 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.840
 front which gives a very special flavor 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.530
 on toast 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.080
 a cool tip is rosemary put a 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.170
 little joy brings people to the oven 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.290
 This broth is wonderful. 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:10.610
 try what your car does in 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.500
 home and then call me, this is 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.680
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.260
 Today's recipe I'm leaving though. 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.830
 next big kiss encounter with god 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.830
