fibroblasts product being injected in
acne<00:00:11.309> scarring<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.230> had<00:00:13.349> mentioned

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
acne scarring and so as I had mentioned

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.670 
acne scarring and so as I had mentioned
in<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.950> previous<00:00:14.160> video<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:16.350> interesting

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
in a previous video it's an interesting

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.740 
in a previous video it's an interesting
process<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> first<00:00:17.789> personalized<00:00:18.390> cell

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
process it's the first personalized cell

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.359 
process it's the first personalized cell
therapy<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.529> basically<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.340> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
therapy and basically what we do is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.429 
therapy and basically what we do is
about<00:00:20.670> three<00:00:20.939> months<00:00:21.060> previous<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.140> date

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
about three months previous to this date

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.710 
about three months previous to this date
we<00:00:22.680> obtain<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.550> skin<00:00:23.820> biopsy<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.330> sent

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
we obtain a little skin biopsy that sent

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.370 
we obtain a little skin biopsy that sent
off<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.990> lab<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.220> patient's<00:00:27.090> own

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
off to a lab and the patient's own

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.200 
off to a lab and the patient's own
fibroblasts<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> collagen<00:00:28.949> producing<00:00:29.519> cell<00:00:29.880> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
fibroblasts a collagen producing cell is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.540 
fibroblasts a collagen producing cell is
actually<00:00:30.960> cultured<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.399> we

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually cultured there and so then we

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.250 
actually cultured there and so then we
get<00:00:32.730> two<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.390> these

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
get two of these

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.610 
get two of these
CC<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.579> got<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.180> milliliter<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.840> product<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
CC so got one milliliter of product that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.959 
CC so got one milliliter of product that
are<00:00:37.710> teeming<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.190> millions<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> these

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
are teeming with millions of these

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.520 
are teeming with millions of these
active<00:00:39.450> fibroblasts<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.379> then

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
active fibroblasts that are then

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
active fibroblasts that are then
re-injected<00:00:41.250> into<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> patient<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.450> order<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
re-injected into the patient in order to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.560 
re-injected into the patient in order to
produce<00:00:43.200> more<00:00:43.379> collagen<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.520> fill<00:00:45.120> fine

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
produce more collagen and fill fine

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
produce more collagen and fill fine
lines<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> textural<00:00:46.680> changes<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> area

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
lines and textural changes in the area

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160 
lines and textural changes in the area
and<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:48.750> superficial

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and so it's a really superficial

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
and so it's a really superficial
injection<00:00:49.980> technique<00:00:50.370> we're<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> use

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
injection technique we're going to use

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340 
injection technique we're going to use
it<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> acne<00:00:52.020> scarring

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it on a little bit of acne scarring

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
it on a little bit of acne scarring
atrophic<00:00:52.770> acne<00:00:53.309> scarring<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> cheek

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
atrophic acne scarring in the cheek

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
atrophic acne scarring in the cheek
region<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.829> you're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
region right now and so you're going to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180 
region right now and so you're going to
see<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.670> very<00:00:57.239> superficially<00:00:58.190> creating

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
see me just very superficially creating

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.210 
see me just very superficially creating
a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.489> slab

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.000 

and<00:01:08.640> sort<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> coating<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.630> area<00:01:10.110> allowing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and sort of coating that area allowing

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.720 
and sort of coating that area allowing
those<00:01:11.130> fibroblasts<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:13.100> make<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> nice<00:01:14.400> little

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
those fibroblasts to make a nice little

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.820 
those fibroblasts to make a nice little
new<00:01:14.970> home<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.660> produce<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.200> collagen<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
new home and produce some collagen in

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
new home and produce some collagen in
the<00:01:16.920> areas<00:01:17.310> where<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.670> acne<00:01:18.030> scarring<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the areas where the acne scarring is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:44.430 
the areas where the acne scarring is
present

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:54.820 

already<00:01:45.190> about<00:01:45.400> halfway<00:01:45.670> done

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.130 

and<00:01:55.370> this<00:01:55.520> will<00:01:55.700> be<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.970> first<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.450> three<00:01:56.810> sets

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
and this will be the first of three sets

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.450 
and this will be the first of three sets
of<00:01:57.410> treatments<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:57.980> we<00:01:58.190> do<00:01:58.340> for<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.670> patient

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
of treatments that we do for the patient

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.550 
of treatments that we do for the patient
and<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.640> takes<00:02:01.910> several<00:02:02.240> weeks<00:02:02.390> two<00:02:02.900> months<00:02:02.930> to

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
and it takes several weeks two months to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.730 
and it takes several weeks two months to
start<00:02:03.770> seeing<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.430> textural<00:02:05.000> change<00:02:05.740> produce

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
start seeing the textural change produce

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
start seeing the textural change produce
from<00:02:07.100> this

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.030 

and<00:02:17.300> here's<00:02:17.569> last<00:02:17.900> injection

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.300 

good<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:26.569> so<00:02:27.500> that's<00:02:27.590> will<00:02:27.890> be<00:02:27.920> for

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
good all right so that's will be for

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.530 
good all right so that's will be for
acne<00:02:28.640> scarring<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.239> want<00:02:29.420> more
