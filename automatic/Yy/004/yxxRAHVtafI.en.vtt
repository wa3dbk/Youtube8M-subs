00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:48.600 

you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.570 

we<00:00:49.610> come<00:00:49.850> into<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:50.240> world<00:00:50.540> with<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.950> innate

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
we come into this world with the innate

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.640 
we come into this world with the innate
abilities<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.510> learn<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.900> interact<00:00:54.020> with

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
abilities to learn to interact with

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.130 
abilities to learn to interact with
other<00:00:55.660> sentient<00:00:56.660> beings

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
other sentient beings

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.940 
other sentient beings
suppose<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.260> had<00:01:00.380> to<00:01:00.410> interact<00:01:00.530> with<00:01:00.860> other

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
suppose you had to interact with other

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.620 
suppose you had to interact with other
people<00:01:01.400> by<00:01:01.520> writing<00:01:01.730> little<00:01:01.910> messages<00:01:02.090> to

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
people by writing little messages to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.080 
people by writing little messages to
them<00:01:04.630> it'd<00:01:05.630> be<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.780> real<00:01:06.050> pain<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.820> that's<00:01:07.970> how

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
them it'd be a real pain and that's how

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.550 
them it'd be a real pain and that's how
we<00:01:08.150> interact<00:01:08.360> with<00:01:08.600> computers<00:01:08.720> it's<00:01:09.410> much

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
we interact with computers it's much

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.350 
we interact with computers it's much
easier<00:01:09.890> just<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.100> talk<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.340> them<00:01:10.490> it's<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:10.940> so

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
easier just to talk to them it's just so

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.860 
easier just to talk to them it's just so
much<00:01:11.510> easier<00:01:11.570> yeah<00:01:12.970> if<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.270> computers<00:01:14.690> could

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
much easier yeah if the computers could

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.890 
much easier yeah if the computers could
understand<00:01:15.260> what<00:01:15.380> we're<00:01:15.530> saying

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
understand what we're saying

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.000 
understand what we're saying
and<00:01:17.900> for<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.290> need<00:01:18.320> really<00:01:18.740> good<00:01:18.890> speech

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
and for that you need really good speech

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.460 
and for that you need really good speech
recognition<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:20.540> first<00:01:20.780> speech<00:01:21.020> recognition

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
recognition the first speech recognition

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.930 
recognition the first speech recognition
system<00:01:22.010> was<00:01:22.190> developed<00:01:22.580> by<00:01:22.700> Bell

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
system was developed by Bell

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.420 
system was developed by Bell
Laboratories<00:01:23.240> in<00:01:23.810> 1952<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:25.160> could<00:01:25.310> only

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
Laboratories in 1952 it could only

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.760 
Laboratories in 1952 it could only
recognize<00:01:25.520> numbers<00:01:26.450> spoken<00:01:26.479> by<00:01:26.930> one<00:01:27.050> person

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
recognize numbers spoken by one person

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.249 
recognize numbers spoken by one person
in<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.250> 1970s<00:01:29.180> Carnegie<00:01:29.540> Mellon<00:01:29.930> came<00:01:30.140> out

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
in the 1970s Carnegie Mellon came out

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.960 
in the 1970s Carnegie Mellon came out
with<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.410> harpy<00:01:30.950> system<00:01:31.190> which<00:01:31.520> was<00:01:31.670> able<00:01:31.820> to

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
with a harpy system which was able to

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.600 
with a harpy system which was able to
recognize<00:01:32.030> over<00:01:32.600> 1000<00:01:33.470> words<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.009> could

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
recognize over 1000 words and could

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.430 
recognize over 1000 words and could
recognize<00:01:34.759> different<00:01:35.479> pronunciations<00:01:35.509> of

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
recognize different pronunciations of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.670 
recognize different pronunciations of
the<00:01:36.500> same<00:01:36.800> word<00:01:37.100> tomato<00:01:38.080> tomahto<00:01:39.080> speech

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
the same word tomato tomahto speech

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.499 
the same word tomato tomahto speech
recognition<00:01:40.070> continued<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.940> 80s<00:01:40.970> with

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
recognition continued in the 80s with

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.090 
recognition continued in the 80s with
the<00:01:41.660> introduction<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.350> hidden<00:01:42.500> Markov

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
the introduction of the hidden Markov

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.680 
the introduction of the hidden Markov
model<00:01:43.550> which<00:01:43.970> used<00:01:44.300> a<00:01:44.420> more<00:01:44.630> mathematical

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
model which used a more mathematical

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.740 
model which used a more mathematical
approach<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.920> analyzing<00:01:46.070> soundwaves<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.240> led

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
approach to analyzing soundwaves and led

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.940 
approach to analyzing soundwaves and led
to<00:01:47.780> many<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.229> breakthroughs<00:01:48.410> we<00:01:48.920> have

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
to many of the breakthroughs we have

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.640 
to many of the breakthroughs we have
today<00:01:49.240> you're<00:01:50.240> taking<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.720> very<00:01:50.750> raw<00:01:51.020> audio

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
today you're taking in very raw audio

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.740 
today you're taking in very raw audio
waveforms<00:01:51.880> like<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.030> get<00:01:53.210> from<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.480> microphone

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
waveforms like you get from a microphone

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.310 
waveforms like you get from a microphone
on<00:01:54.170> your<00:01:55.010> phone<00:01:55.220> or<00:01:55.640> whatever<00:01:55.940> we<00:01:56.870> chop<00:01:57.170> it

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
on your phone or whatever we chop it

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.830 
on your phone or whatever we chop it
into<00:01:57.500> small<00:01:57.650> pieces<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.730> it<00:01:59.480> tries<00:01:59.810> to

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
into small pieces and it tries to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.610 
into small pieces and it tries to
identify<00:02:00.670> which<00:02:01.670> phoneme<00:02:02.000> was<00:02:02.900> spoken<00:02:03.200> in

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
identify which phoneme was spoken in

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.190 
identify which phoneme was spoken in
that<00:02:03.680> last<00:02:03.860> piece<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.700> speech<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.630> phoneme<00:02:06.050> is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
that last piece of speech so phoneme is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.450 
that last piece of speech so phoneme is
the<00:02:06.320> kind<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.530> primitive<00:02:07.040> unit<00:02:07.310> for

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
the kind of primitive unit for

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.389 
the kind of primitive unit for
expressing<00:02:07.720> words<00:02:09.070> ha-ah

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
expressing words ha-ah

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.030 
expressing words ha-ah
oh<00:02:11.320> wow<00:02:12.820> toh<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.239> then<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.560> will<00:02:15.739> want<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
oh wow toh and then it will want to

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.160 
oh wow toh and then it will want to
stitch<00:02:16.310> those<00:02:16.610> together<00:02:16.790> into<00:02:17.510> likely<00:02:17.959> words

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
stitch those together into likely words

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.039 
stitch those together into likely words
like<00:02:18.620> Palo<00:02:19.070> Alto<00:02:19.220> speech<00:02:20.030> recognition<00:02:20.540> today

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
like Palo Alto speech recognition today

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.750 
like Palo Alto speech recognition today
is<00:02:21.200> quite<00:02:21.440> good<00:02:21.830> at<00:02:21.980> transcribing<00:02:22.489> what

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
is quite good at transcribing what

I mean today everybody can interact one
thing<00:02:50.630> though<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.810> still<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.950> infancy<00:02:52.010> is

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
thing though is still in the infancy is

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.550 
thing though is still in the infancy is
they<00:02:52.730> understanding<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:53.959> need<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.170> far<00:02:54.440> more

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
they understanding we need a far more

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.800 
they understanding we need a far more
sophisticated<00:02:54.770> language

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
sophisticated language

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.420 
sophisticated language
any<00:02:55.959> model<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.440> understands<00:02:57.220> what<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
any model that understands what the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.190 
any model that understands what the
sentence<00:02:57.760> means<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.720> we're<00:02:58.900> still<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.110> very

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
sentence means and we're still a very

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.830 
sentence means and we're still a very
long<00:02:59.590> way<00:02:59.650> from<00:02:59.860> having<00:03:00.160> that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.810 

our<00:03:07.840> ability<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.320> use<00:03:08.530> language<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:09.190> one<00:03:09.700> of

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
our ability to use language is one of

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.770 
our ability to use language is one of
the<00:03:09.910> things<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.360> helps<00:03:10.600> us<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:10.750> culture

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the things that helps us have culture

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.140 
the things that helps us have culture
it's<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:13.960> of<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> things<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.530> helps<00:03:14.800> us

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
it's one of the things that helps us

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.340 
it's one of the things that helps us
pass<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.360> traditions<00:03:16.480> from<00:03:16.960> one<00:03:17.170> generation

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
pass on traditions from one generation

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.000 
pass on traditions from one generation
to<00:03:18.070> another<00:03:19.110> figuring<00:03:20.110> out<00:03:20.230> about<00:03:20.710> how<00:03:20.980> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
to another figuring out about how the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.580 
to another figuring out about how the
system<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.760> language<00:03:22.330> works<00:03:22.570> even<00:03:23.530> though

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
system of language works even though

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.190 
system of language works even though
that<00:03:23.800> seems<00:03:24.100> like<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> really<00:03:24.640> easy<00:03:24.730> problem

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
that seems like a really easy problem

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.540 
that seems like a really easy problem
turns<00:03:26.200> out<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.470> be<00:03:26.560> one<00:03:26.710> that's<00:03:26.860> really<00:03:27.130> hard

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
turns out to be one that's really hard

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.150 
turns out to be one that's really hard
but<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.330> every<00:03:28.810> baby<00:03:28.960> has<00:03:29.290> cracked<00:03:29.680> by<00:03:30.100> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
but that every baby has cracked by the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.720 
but that every baby has cracked by the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
time they're two years old yes there's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
two LS yeah ell Li and then language is

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.220 
two LS yeah ell Li and then language is
extremely<00:03:39.160> complex<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.270> sophisticated<00:03:40.450> from

I<00:03:48.670> have<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.090> be<00:03:49.210> careful<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.870> offend<00:03:49.990> the

I have to be careful not to offend the

I have to be careful not to offend the
dinosaur<00:03:51.090> language<00:03:52.090> has<00:03:52.240> so<00:03:52.450> many<00:03:52.540> different

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
dinosaur language has so many different

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.270 
dinosaur language has so many different
layers<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.470> that's<00:03:53.710> why<00:03:53.920> it's<00:03:54.070> such<00:03:54.220> a

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
layers and that's why it's such a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.580 
layers and that's why it's such a
difficult<00:03:54.760> problem<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.960> present<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.410> human

human brain a far far better things like
language<00:04:01.330> understanding<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:02.230> they're<00:04:02.860> still

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
language understanding and they're still

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.950 
language understanding and they're still
a<00:04:03.070> lot<00:04:03.250> better<00:04:03.310> at<00:04:03.550> pattern<00:04:03.730> recognition<00:04:03.960> so

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
a lot better at pattern recognition so

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.660 
a lot better at pattern recognition so
whether<00:04:05.170> or<00:04:05.260> not<00:04:05.380> we<00:04:05.590> replicate<00:04:06.100> exactly<00:04:06.250> what

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
whether or not we replicate exactly what

whether or not we replicate exactly what
the<00:04:06.850> brain<00:04:06.940> does<00:04:07.710> to<00:04:08.710> understand<00:04:09.190> language

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
the brain does to understand language

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.500 
the brain does to understand language
and<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.570> understand<00:04:10.989> speech<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:13.180> still<00:04:13.450> a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
and to understand speech is still a

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.130 
and to understand speech is still a
question<00:04:16.530> for<00:04:17.530> many<00:04:17.770> many<00:04:18.100> years<00:04:18.750> we<00:04:19.750> believed

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
question for many many years we believed

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.159 
question for many many years we believed
that<00:04:20.609> neural<00:04:21.609> networks<00:04:22.090> should<00:04:22.630> work<00:04:22.960> better

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
that neural networks should work better

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.680 
that neural networks should work better
than<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.530> dumb<00:04:24.400> existing<00:04:24.430> technology<00:04:25.000> that's

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
than the dumb existing technology that's

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.780 
than the dumb existing technology that's
basically<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.050> table<00:04:26.350> lookup<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.010> then<00:04:27.070> in

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
basically just table lookup and then in

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.290 
basically just table lookup and then in
2009<00:04:28.480> two<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.530> my<00:04:29.650> students<00:04:30.280> with<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> little

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
2009 two of my students with a little

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.680 
2009 two of my students with a little
input<00:04:31.450> from<00:04:31.600> me<00:04:32.010> got<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.160> working<00:04:34.000> better<00:04:34.300> and

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
input from me got it working better and

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.210 
input from me got it working better and
the<00:04:35.050> first<00:04:35.290> time<00:04:35.470> it<00:04:35.620> just<00:04:35.650> worked<00:04:35.980> a<00:04:36.100> little

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
the first time it just worked a little

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.740 
the first time it just worked a little
bit<00:04:36.430> better<00:04:36.610> but<00:04:36.850> then<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.090> was<00:04:37.210> obvious<00:04:37.419> that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
bit better but then it was obvious that

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.120 
bit better but then it was obvious that
this<00:04:38.140> could<00:04:38.290> be<00:04:38.380> developed<00:04:38.740> something<00:04:38.919> will

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
this could be developed something will

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.430 
this could be developed something will
work<00:04:39.220> much<00:04:39.460> better<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:40.690> brain<00:04:40.840> has<00:04:41.230> these

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
work much better the brain has these

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.380 
work much better the brain has these
gazillions<00:04:41.500> of<00:04:42.400> neurons<00:04:42.730> or<00:04:42.910> computing<00:04:43.300> in

recently<00:05:00.430> people<00:05:01.390> got<00:05:01.630> features<00:05:02.470> by<00:05:02.650> hand

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
recently people got features by hand

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.400 
recently people got features by hand
engineering<00:05:03.419> they<00:05:04.419> looked<00:05:04.720> at<00:05:04.870> sound<00:05:05.140> waves

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
engineering they looked at sound waves

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.920 
engineering they looked at sound waves
they<00:05:05.710> did<00:05:06.400> Fourier<00:05:06.640> analysis<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.510> they<00:05:07.600> tried

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
they did Fourier analysis and they tried

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.900 
they did Fourier analysis and they tried
to<00:05:08.050> figure<00:05:08.200> out<00:05:08.320> what<00:05:09.010> features<00:05:09.340> should<00:05:09.640> we

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
to figure out what features should we

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.250 
to figure out what features should we
feed<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.450> pattern<00:05:10.690> recognition<00:05:11.140> system

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
feed to the pattern recognition system

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260 
feed to the pattern recognition system
and<00:05:11.950> the<00:05:12.040> thing<00:05:12.190> by<00:05:12.310> neural<00:05:12.580> networks<00:05:12.910> is<00:05:13.120> they

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
and the thing by neural networks is they

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.700 
and the thing by neural networks is they
learn<00:05:13.510> their<00:05:13.690> own<00:05:13.720> features<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.470> in

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
learn their own features and in

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.740 
learn their own features and in
particular<00:05:14.800> they<00:05:15.010> can<00:05:15.850> learn<00:05:16.060> features<00:05:16.210> and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
particular they can learn features and

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.000 
particular they can learn features and
then<00:05:17.020> they<00:05:17.140> can<00:05:17.289> learn<00:05:17.410> features<00:05:17.470> of<00:05:17.890> features

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
then they can learn features of features

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.620 
then they can learn features of features
and

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
and

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.090 
and
learn<00:05:19.110> features<00:05:19.320> of<00:05:19.530> features<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.980> features

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
learn features of features of features

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.670 
learn features of features of features
and<00:05:20.640> that's<00:05:21.420> like<00:05:21.630> with<00:05:21.840> huge<00:05:22.080> improvement<00:05:22.620> to

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
and that's like with huge improvement to

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.380 
and that's like with huge improvement to
speech<00:05:22.890> recognition<00:05:23.070> but<00:05:23.790> you<00:05:23.880> can<00:05:23.970> also<00:05:24.090> use

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
speech recognition but you can also use

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.240 
speech recognition but you can also use
them<00:05:24.600> for<00:05:24.630> language<00:05:25.140> understanding<00:05:25.710> tasks

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
them for language understanding tasks

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.180 
them for language understanding tasks
and<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:27.090> way<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.270> do<00:05:27.480> this<00:05:27.660> is<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:29.160> represent

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
and the way you do this is you represent

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.630 
and the way you do this is you represent
words<00:05:29.910> in<00:05:30.690> very<00:05:31.260> high<00:05:31.440> dimensional<00:05:31.680> spaces<00:05:32.160> we

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
words in very high dimensional spaces we

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.910 
words in very high dimensional spaces we
can<00:05:32.670> now<00:05:33.030> deal<00:05:33.360> with<00:05:33.390> analogies<00:05:33.750> where<00:05:34.680> word

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
can now deal with analogies where word

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.610 
can now deal with analogies where word
is<00:05:35.100> represented<00:05:35.670> as<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.790> list<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.300> numbers<00:05:36.620> so

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
is represented as a list of numbers so

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.740 
is represented as a list of numbers so
for<00:05:37.770> example<00:05:38.130> if<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.310> take<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.820> list<00:05:39.510> of<00:05:39.630> 100

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
for example if I take the list of 100

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.710 
for example if I take the list of 100
numbers<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.350> represents<00:05:40.530> Paris<00:05:41.420> and<00:05:42.420> I

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
numbers that represents Paris and I

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.070 
numbers that represents Paris and I
subtract<00:05:43.380> from<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.890> France<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:45.330> I<00:05:45.450> add<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.990> it

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
subtract from it France and I add to it

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.260 
subtract from it France and I add to it
Italy<00:05:46.290> and<00:05:46.740> if<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.430> look<00:05:47.610> at<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.850> numbers<00:05:48.120> I've

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
Italy and if I look at the numbers I've

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.900 
Italy and if I look at the numbers I've
got<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:49.230> closest<00:05:49.680> thing<00:05:49.950> is<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.610> list<00:05:50.790> of

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
got the closest thing is the list of

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.600 
got the closest thing is the list of
numbers<00:05:51.030> that<00:05:51.210> represents<00:05:51.330> Rome<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:53.250> by<00:05:53.400> first

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
numbers that represents Rome so by first

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.740 
numbers that represents Rome so by first
converting<00:05:53.880> words<00:05:54.150> into<00:05:54.450> these<00:05:54.690> numbers

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
converting words into these numbers

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.190 
converting words into these numbers
using<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.470> neural<00:05:55.740> net<00:05:56.420> you<00:05:57.420> can<00:05:57.450> actually<00:05:57.780> do

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
using a neural net you can actually do

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.880 
using a neural net you can actually do
this<00:05:58.320> analogical<00:05:58.590> reasoning<00:05:59.220> I<00:06:00.830> predict<00:06:01.830> that

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
this analogical reasoning I predict that

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.040 
this analogical reasoning I predict that
in<00:06:02.010> the<00:06:02.100> next<00:06:02.190> five<00:06:02.580> years<00:06:02.640> will<00:06:03.420> become<00:06:03.540> clear

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
in the next five years will become clear

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.290 
in the next five years will become clear
that<00:06:04.320> these<00:06:04.950> big<00:06:05.280> deep<00:06:05.490> neural<00:06:05.520> networks<00:06:06.210> with

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
that these big deep neural networks with

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.420 
that these big deep neural networks with
the<00:06:06.510> new<00:06:06.660> learning<00:06:06.990> algorithms<00:06:07.470> are<00:06:08.130> going<00:06:08.190> to

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
the new learning algorithms are going to

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.260 
the new learning algorithms are going to
give<00:06:08.550> us<00:06:08.640> much<00:06:08.850> better<00:06:09.030> language

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
give us much better language

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.480 
give us much better language
understanding<00:06:12.740> when<00:06:13.740> we<00:06:13.860> started<00:06:14.160> out<00:06:14.310> we

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
understanding when we started out we

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.480 
understanding when we started out we
thought<00:06:14.670> that<00:06:14.880> things<00:06:15.000> like<00:06:15.210> chess<00:06:15.270> or

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
thought that things like chess or

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.580 
thought that things like chess or
mathematics<00:06:17.490> or<00:06:17.790> logic<00:06:18.330> those<00:06:19.200> are<00:06:19.380> going<00:06:19.530> to

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
mathematics or logic those are going to

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.620 
mathematics or logic those are going to
be<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.830> things<00:06:20.010> that<00:06:20.100> were<00:06:20.250> really<00:06:20.430> hard<00:06:20.730> not

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
be the things that were really hard not

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.720 
be the things that were really hard not
that<00:06:21.870> hard<00:06:22.170> I<00:06:22.440> mean<00:06:22.560> we<00:06:22.740> can<00:06:22.920> end<00:06:23.130> up<00:06:23.280> with<00:06:23.520> the

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
that hard I mean we can end up with the

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.730 
that hard I mean we can end up with the
machine<00:06:24.060> that<00:06:24.270> actually<00:06:24.420> can<00:06:24.900> do<00:06:25.230> chess<00:06:25.260> as

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
things that we felt were going to be

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.670 
things that we felt were going to be
easy<00:06:29.310> for<00:06:29.730> a<00:06:30.180> computer<00:06:30.510> system<00:06:30.840> like

just<00:06:54.560> when<00:06:54.740> we<00:06:54.920> fiddle<00:06:55.100> a<00:06:55.460> little<00:06:55.490> with<00:06:55.850> what

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
just when we fiddle a little with what

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.550 
just when we fiddle a little with what
we<00:06:56.150> already<00:06:56.180> know<00:06:56.570> but<00:06:56.600> when<00:06:56.960> we<00:06:57.110> discover

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
we already know but when we discover

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.230 
we already know but when we discover
something<00:06:57.680> completely<00:06:58.670> new<00:06:58.880> and<00:06:58.910> unexpected

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
something completely new and unexpected

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.440 
something completely new and unexpected
I<00:07:00.020> think<00:07:00.620> once<00:07:01.520> you<00:07:01.670> kind<00:07:02.000> of<00:07:02.090> are<00:07:02.210> in<00:07:02.270> the

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
I think once you kind of are in the

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.390 
I think once you kind of are in the
ballpark<00:07:02.600> of<00:07:03.200> human<00:07:03.470> level<00:07:03.560> performance<00:07:03.740> that

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
ballpark of human level performance that

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:14.810 
ballpark of human level performance that
will<00:07:04.670> be<00:07:04.730> pretty<00:07:06.370> remarkable
