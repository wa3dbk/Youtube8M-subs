with that you could never win that just
regularly<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:06.190> kind<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:06.970> do<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
regularly you kind of have to do that a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.770 
regularly you kind of have to do that a
lot<00:03:10.450> easier<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:12.280> instance<00:03:12.569> with<00:03:13.569> that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
lot easier like for instance with that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:24.929 
lot easier like for instance with that
glitch<00:03:14.250> i<00:03:15.420> ugly

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:31.600 

my<00:03:25.939> biggest<00:03:26.900> drop<00:03:27.670> 106.5<00:03:28.670> feet<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:31.400> from

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
my biggest drop 106.5 feet just from

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.660 
my biggest drop 106.5 feet just from
that<00:03:31.790> that's<00:03:32.090> from<00:03:32.329> jumping<00:03:32.780> off<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.200> side

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
that that's from jumping off the side

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.199 
that that's from jumping off the side
like<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.209> start<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.870> mega<00:03:36.230> ramp<00:03:37.209> which

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
like of the start of the mega ramp which

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.760 
like of the start of the mega ramp which
I'm<00:03:38.420> try<00:03:38.810> right<00:03:39.409> now

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
I'm try right now

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.860 
I'm try right now
it's<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.820> hardest<00:03:42.120> drop<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.720> game

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
it's the hardest drop in the game

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.750 
it's the hardest drop in the game
because<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.320> requires<00:03:43.650> like<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.920> really<00:03:44.550> good

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
because it requires like a really good

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.730 
because it requires like a really good
timing<00:03:45.270> with<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.210> will<00:03:48.840> attempt<00:03:49.500> it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
timing with this so I will attempt it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.450 
timing with this so I will attempt it
again

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.890 

that's<00:03:53.460> really<00:03:54.090> hard<00:03:54.330> now<00:03:55.850> if<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.390> lend<00:03:57.660> it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
that's really hard now if you lend it

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
that's really hard now if you lend it
and<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:59.070> landed<00:03:59.420> that's<00:04:00.420> good<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:01.620> shows

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
and you landed that's good that shows

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.539 
and you landed that's good that shows
you<00:04:01.950> did<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.460> and<00:04:02.700> my<00:04:03.120> arm<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:06.270> my

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:18.690 

one<00:04:09.549> extra<00:04:11.579> snack

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.620 

but<00:04:19.350> I'm<00:04:20.350> just<00:04:20.500> learn<00:04:20.830> that<00:04:21.070> trick<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:22.270> then

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
but I'm just learn that trick and then

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.510 
but I'm just learn that trick and then
I'll

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
I'll

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.960 
I'll
the<00:04:25.520> dog<00:04:25.910> run<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:28.220> good<00:04:28.400> shine

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.330 

ok<00:04:33.970> i<00:04:34.000> will<00:04:34.330> now<00:04:34.539> try<00:04:35.229> it

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.000 

yeah<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:40.780> there<00:04:40.990> ya<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:44.320> isn't<00:04:44.740> really<00:04:44.860> what
