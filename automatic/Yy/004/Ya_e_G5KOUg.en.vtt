00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
chronomaly crystal skull triple Cromley

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.450 
chronomaly crystal skull triple Cromley
crystal<00:00:35.460> bones<00:00:36.230> these<00:00:37.230> cards<00:00:37.739> basically<00:00:38.070> go

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
crystal bones these cards basically go

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.860 
crystal bones these cards basically go
hand<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.760> hand

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870

these are basically the nine staple
phenomenally<00:00:49.770> cards<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:50.789> gonna<00:00:50.910> play<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
phenomenally cards are gonna play and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.130 
phenomenally cards are gonna play and
then<00:00:51.449> you're<00:00:51.539> gonna<00:00:51.629> play<00:00:51.899> two<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.559> no<00:00:52.800> three

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140

then you're gonna play two or no three
Cromley<00:00:55.140> moy<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> basically<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:58.219> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
Cromley moy this is basically the the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.389 
Cromley moy this is basically the the
gear<00:00:59.940> dia<00:01:00.120> accelerator<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.440> then

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
gear dia accelerator for them and then

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.070 
gear dia accelerator for them and then
you<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.699> golden<00:01:03.000> jet<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.420> into<00:01:03.629> rank<00:01:03.809> fives

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you use golden jet to go into rank fives

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.640 
you use golden jet to go into rank fives
or<00:01:04.589> even<00:01:05.070> rank<00:01:05.250> six<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.960> then<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> still<00:01:07.439> have

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
or even rank six and then I still have

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.020 
or even rank six and then I still have
my<00:01:07.860> catapult<00:01:08.280> zone<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.260> rock<00:01:10.740> theme

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
my catapult zone because this rock theme

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
my catapult zone because this rock theme
so<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.060> still<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.689> revival<00:01:13.260> golem<00:01:13.560> two

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so I still have my two revival golem two

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.800 
so I still have my two revival golem two
is<00:01:14.220> enough<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.850> first<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.299> thinking<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
is enough at first I was thinking of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
is enough at first I was thinking of
running<00:01:15.930> three<00:01:16.290> again<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:17.000> two<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.210> seems

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
running three again but two just seems

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.649 
running three again but two just seems
to<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.600> fine<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.320> put<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> double

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
to be just fine because I put in double

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.310 
to be just fine because I put in double
fossil<00:01:21.659> Dyna<00:01:23.479> these<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.659> now<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.080> my

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
chronomaly deck out from the heroic one

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.789 
chronomaly deck out from the heroic one
because<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.750> wanted<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.259> heroics<00:01:28.680> as
