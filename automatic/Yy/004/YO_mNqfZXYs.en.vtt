00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.260 
this I just find spheres easier to work
with<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.190> like<00:02:07.340> though<00:02:07.490> if<00:02:07.610> they<00:02:07.790> look<00:02:08.030> in

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
with and I like though if they look in

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.860 
with and I like though if they look in
the<00:02:08.390> characters<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:08.960> reflections<00:02:10.870> where

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
the characters I reflections where

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.240 
the characters I reflections where
planes<00:02:12.740> can<00:02:13.160> look<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.430> bit<00:02:13.670> odd<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.540> me<00:02:15.250> again

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
planes can look a bit odd to me again

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.130 
planes can look a bit odd to me again
this<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> matter<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.330> personal<00:02:17.630> taste<00:02:17.840> in

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
this is a matter of personal taste in

where I want it to be and then I can

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.000 
where I want it to be and then I can
move<00:03:53.879> my<00:03:53.940> spheres<00:03:54.739> off-camera<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.709> if<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.829> want

move my spheres off-camera and if I want

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.289 
move my spheres off-camera and if I want
to<00:03:59.129> ensure<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.400> they<00:03:59.579> remain<00:03:59.730> off-camera

to ensure that they remain off-camera
even<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.870> move<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.349> can<00:04:01.560> take<00:04:01.739> my<00:04:01.769> light

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
even if I move it I can take my light

this default camera it translated in

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.259 
this default camera it translated in
appropriately<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.470> first<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.829> will<00:04:10.889> say<00:04:11.269> change
