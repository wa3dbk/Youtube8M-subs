00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
providing I will knock the air shake see

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.090 
providing I will knock the air shake see
it<00:03:25.269> will<00:03:25.569> go<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.380> can<00:03:26.560> see<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:26.829> movement

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
it will go on you can see this movement

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:36.860 
it will go on you can see this movement
near<00:03:27.639> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.210 

and<00:03:37.870> go<00:03:39.300> as<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.360> normally<00:03:40.720> would<00:03:40.960> and<00:03:41.470> there

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
and go as you normally would and there

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.780 
and go as you normally would and there
you<00:03:42.640> have<00:03:42.850> success<00:03:43.740> yeah<00:03:44.740> it's<00:03:45.310> all<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.550> bit

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
you have success yeah it's all a bit

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.580 
you have success yeah it's all a bit
tight<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.450> coming<00:03:46.960> together<00:03:47.110> but<00:03:47.470> that's

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
tight and coming together but that's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.940 
tight and coming together but that's
just<00:03:48.180> restricting<00:03:49.180> movement<00:03:49.560> more<00:03:50.560> moving

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
just restricting movement more moving

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.240 
just restricting movement more moving
you<00:03:51.100> have<00:03:51.130> more<00:03:52.060> chance<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.570> have<00:03:53.040> I'm<00:03:54.040> not

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
you have more chance you have I'm not

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.080 
you have more chance you have I'm not
getting<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.730> off<00:03:54.880> yeah<00:03:55.870> she's<00:03:56.350> letting<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.190> get

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
getting it off yeah she's letting it get

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.870 
getting it off yeah she's letting it get
your<00:03:58.360> bar<00:03:58.660> off<00:03:58.990> does<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.070> be<00:04:00.160> easier<00:04:00.520> to<00:04:00.640> get<00:04:00.760> it

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
your bar off does it be easier to get it

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.560 
your bar off does it be easier to get it
off<00:04:01.030> while<00:04:01.630> it's<00:04:01.810> on<00:04:01.960> the<00:04:01.990> vehicle<00:04:03.360> then<00:04:04.360> once

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
off while it's on the vehicle then once

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.840 
off while it's on the vehicle then once
you've<00:04:04.720> taken<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:05.140> fall<00:04:05.410> down<00:04:05.650> not<00:04:06.460> only<00:04:06.490> that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
you've taken a fall down not only that

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.060 
you've taken a fall down not only that
you'll<00:04:07.450> be<00:04:07.600> able<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.870> turn<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.920> you're

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
there you go if you turn that you can

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.130 
there you go if you turn that you can
see<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:17.410> will<00:04:17.680> not<00:04:19.080> coming<00:04:20.080> off<00:04:20.670> now<00:04:22.140> it

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
there you have it that idea now could be

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.399 
there you have it that idea now could be
jammed<00:06:07.159> in<00:06:07.310> there<00:06:07.460> no<00:06:08.270> it's<00:06:08.539> not<00:06:08.659> big<00:06:08.990> already

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409
