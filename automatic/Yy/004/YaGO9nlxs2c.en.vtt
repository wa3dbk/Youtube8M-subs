a large one and they were both in the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.780 
a large one and they were both in the
front<00:00:10.110> well<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> cable<00:00:11.040> snapped<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.730> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
front well the cable snapped on the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.780 
front well the cable snapped on the
smaller<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:14.160> larger<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.549> has<00:00:14.639> been

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
smaller one and the larger one has been

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.189 
smaller one and the larger one has been
tugging<00:00:14.969> us<00:00:15.210> ever<00:00:15.389> since<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> smaller

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
tugging us ever since and the smaller

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.480 
tugging us ever since and the smaller
one<00:00:16.410> disappeared<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:16.980> I've<00:00:17.039> been<00:00:17.160> told<00:00:17.340> that

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
one disappeared and I've been told that

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.580 
one disappeared and I've been told that
it's<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> back<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> ship<00:00:18.410> and<00:00:19.410> that's

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it's in the back of the ship and that's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.550 
it's in the back of the ship and that's
all<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.010> I've<00:00:20.400> been<00:00:20.550> told<00:00:20.760> well<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.359> found<00:00:21.539> it

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.140 

there<00:00:25.560> she<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
there she is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:35.750 
there she is
the<00:00:27.150> dab<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> hole<00:00:29.779> she's<00:00:30.779> tied<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:35.640> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the dab the hole she's tied on and it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.049 
the dab the hole she's tied on and it
looks<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> boats<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.540> way

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
looks like the boats going that way

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.110 
looks like the boats going that way
this<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.600> keeping<00:00:43.140> us<00:00:43.320> straight<00:00:44.120> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
this one is keeping us straight it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.569 
this one is keeping us straight it's
keeping<00:00:45.450> our<00:00:45.600> tail<00:00:45.840> from<00:00:46.110> swinging<00:00:46.579> it's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
keeping our tail from swinging it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
keeping our tail from swinging it's
probably<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.030> Reverse<00:00:48.360> looks<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.020> it's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
probably in Reverse looks like it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:59.010 
probably in Reverse looks like it's
definitely<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.620> Reverse

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.360 

I<00:00:59.110> wonder<00:00:59.860> if<00:00:59.890> that's<00:01:00.100> because<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.980> realized

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
I wonder if that's because they realized

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.960 
I wonder if that's because they realized
that<00:01:03.550> we<00:01:03.820> needed<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.300> or<00:01:04.510> because<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.700> back

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
that we needed it or because the back

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.610 
that we needed it or because the back
cable<00:01:07.420> snapped<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.440> they<00:01:08.530> couldn't<00:01:10.410> hmm

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
cable snapped and they couldn't hmm

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.490 
cable snapped and they couldn't hmm
I<00:01:12.330> couldn't<00:01:13.330> tell<00:01:13.570> us<00:01:13.600> any<00:01:13.930> more<00:01:13.960> it's<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> good

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
I couldn't tell us any more it's a good

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.180 
I couldn't tell us any more it's a good
question

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
question

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.180 
question
either<00:01:15.820> way<00:01:16.060> it's<00:01:16.210> probably<00:01:17.140> it's<00:01:17.800> definitely

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
either way it's probably it's definitely

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.560 
either way it's probably it's definitely
helping<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.670> imagine<00:01:19.090> but<00:01:19.210> it's<00:01:19.330> probably

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
helping I imagine but it's probably

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.170 
helping I imagine but it's probably
slowing<00:01:19.930> us<00:01:20.050> down<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.229> little<00:01:20.380> bit<00:01:20.560> as<00:01:20.680> well

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
slowing us down a little bit as well

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.050 
slowing us down a little bit as well
because<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.620> extra<00:01:23.620> drag<00:01:23.920> we<00:01:24.250> got<00:01:24.400> one<00:01:24.580> tugboat

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
because of extra drag we got one tugboat

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.800 
because of extra drag we got one tugboat
pulling<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:26.550> Carnival<00:01:27.550> Cruise<00:01:27.760> Line<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
pulling a Carnival Cruise Line and the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.050 
pulling a Carnival Cruise Line and the
tugboat<00:01:29.050> now<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.400> time<00:01:30.550> what's<00:01:30.729> keeping

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
tugboat now but this time what's keeping

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.400 
tugboat now but this time what's keeping
us<00:01:31.180> straight<00:01:31.390> which<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.570> good<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.960> looks<00:01:35.259> like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
us straight which is good it looks like

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.660 
us straight which is good it looks like
that's<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.710> Coast<00:01:35.920> Guard<00:01:36.130> out<00:01:36.220> there<00:01:36.400> hope

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
that's the Coast Guard out there hope

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:46.880 
that's the Coast Guard out there hope
you<00:01:36.790> can<00:01:36.940> see<00:01:37.149> them<00:01:37.770> keeping<00:01:38.770> an<00:01:38.860> eye<00:01:38.950> on<00:01:39.160> us

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.280 

there<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.550> go

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
there you go

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
there you go
far<00:01:49.980> away<00:01:50.480> looks<00:01:51.480> like<00:01:51.690> we<00:01:52.560> went<00:01:52.740> hit<00:01:52.980> a<00:01:53.010> bit<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
far away looks like we went hit a bit of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.640 
far away looks like we went hit a bit of
some<00:01:54.750> rain<00:01:57.800> tent<00:01:58.800> city<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.580> Lido<00:02:00.180> deck<00:02:00.650> it's

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
some rain tent city on Lido deck it's

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.160 
some rain tent city on Lido deck it's
just<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.040> ninth<00:02:02.310> deck<00:02:02.720> much<00:02:03.720> people<00:02:04.080> are

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
just the ninth deck much people are

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
just the ninth deck much people are
sleeping<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:04.940> I'm<00:02:05.940> pretty<00:02:06.180> sure<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
sleeping up there I'm pretty sure that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.670 
sleeping up there I'm pretty sure that
they're<00:02:06.720> not<00:02:06.840> ready<00:02:07.080> for<00:02:07.110> rain

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
they're not ready for rain

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.230 
they're not ready for rain
I<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.880> didn't<00:02:09.090> look<00:02:09.149> like

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
I would not they didn't look like

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.710 
I would not they didn't look like
anybody<00:02:09.570> was<00:02:09.840> moving<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:12.120> hopefully<00:02:12.630> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
anybody was moving so hopefully it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.600 
anybody was moving so hopefully it
doesn't<00:02:12.900> rain<00:02:13.080> part<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.100> me<00:02:14.190> hopes<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.460> does

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
doesn't rain part of me hopes it does

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.420 
doesn't rain part of me hopes it does
because<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.390> warm<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.310> don't<00:02:17.310> want

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
because it's a little warm I don't want

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.950 
because it's a little warm I don't want
it<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.580> rain<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.760> them<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.540> hopefully<00:02:18.840> they

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
it to rain on them so hopefully they

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.510 
it to rain on them so hopefully they
move<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.320> then<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.500> rains<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:21.690> right<00:02:22.520> back

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
move and then it rains all right back

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.880 
move and then it rains all right back
for<00:02:23.730> more
