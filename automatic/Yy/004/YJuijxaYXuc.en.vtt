00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and cut evolution two and half and they

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.550 
and cut evolution two and half and they
combine<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.490> that's<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.760> is<00:01:18.380> one<00:01:19.380> and

that they seriously cut down on one

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.460 
that they seriously cut down on one
especially<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:26.540> cut<00:03:27.540> down<00:03:27.569> on<00:03:27.720> two<00:03:28.019> but<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.439> a

especially and cut down on two but to a

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.830 
especially and cut down on two but to a
lesser<00:03:28.590> extent<00:03:29.040> removed<00:03:29.939> some<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.510> parts

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
lesser extent removed some of the parts

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.379

that<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.109> can<00:03:31.349> put<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.560> your<00:03:31.709> stuff<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:33.060> have

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
that you can put on your stuff to have

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.819 
that you can put on your stuff to have
different<00:03:33.810> weapons<00:03:34.169> although<00:03:34.620> they<00:03:34.769> still

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
different weapons although they still

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.259 
different weapons although they still
have<00:03:35.189> a<00:03:35.220> few<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.579> there<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.909> I<00:03:35.970> think<00:03:36.180> they

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
have a few in there and I think they

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.339

have<00:03:36.299> one<00:03:36.569> new<00:03:36.750> one<00:03:38.180> but<00:03:39.180> all<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.450> all<00:03:39.540> what

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
have one new one but all in all what

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.849 
have one new one but all in all what
they<00:03:40.530> do<00:03:40.590> do<00:03:41.129> is<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.879> solid<00:03:42.709> what<00:03:43.709> they

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
they do do is pretty solid what they

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.509 
they do do is pretty solid what they
take<00:03:44.099> out<00:03:44.510> they<00:03:45.510> shouldn't<00:03:45.900> have<00:03:46.519> considering
