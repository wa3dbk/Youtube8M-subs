00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.799
 next installation video of alpha 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.710
 show media live gamer portable today 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.140
 I tell you the pc free mode so the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.240
 Standalone mode because that is actually 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 indeed almost unique to the device you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 it can be synonymous completely without pc 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 Do what you do in addition 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.279
 needs is a sd card and otherwise 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.920
 all the cables I already have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 are in the process so nothing new device at 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 the sd card falls you must 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.670
 Pay attention that one must be a class 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 10 product so be welcome 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.700
 a bit more expensive that has to be 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 be fast enough with it you too 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.640
 can record hd videos so the sd 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.309
 card comes in quite simply behind here 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.739
 until it snaps in nicely so then before 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.239
 you even gets going you have to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.739
 switch to pc free mode as 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.369
 Standalone that is on the right 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.970
 page 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.220
 where does she place small sd card is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.010
 so that works too so i have 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.430
 now here is the xbox 360 since that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 means I close the directly over hdmi 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 on 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.150
 that means i need the components 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 cable not the one supplied is that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.650
 could we just now what to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.400
 example also for the ps3 for example 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.720
 but we do not need it that way 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.270
 we connect the xbox 360 via hdmi 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.000
 we do that here and of course here 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.119
 hdmi on hdmi in and then need 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.369
 of course, an exit 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.280
 this is it to your television or 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.200
 monitor depending on that comes to the hdmi 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.960
 mini hdmi out well and now missing 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.329
 of course something else 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.939
 it is the power for the device 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.659
 The money is just part of the money directly 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.959
 on the console that he is simply called 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.069
 the usb cable to so the usb cable and he 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.519
 Just connect it to the free one 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.190
 USB port to somewhere now at the xbox 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.660
 for example and that's it and that's it 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.989
 the part starts to blink 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.790
 I looked the same time the xbox to the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.440
 Of course , it flashes wild now 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.980
 As if that was an error 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.930
 But it is not because it needs one 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.500
 little bit so it's high quality now 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.459
 it is ready red so in pc mode 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.980
 glows blue in pc free mode lights 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.060
 it's red 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.239
 and that means that part of the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.840
 mission is done and you can now 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.280
 actually gamble and if you join 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.700
 the right place since squeezed 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.930
 just the device and it starts 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.810
 to pulsate and it takes the gamepads 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.319
 which is currently running on the screen 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.420
 so then you press it again and 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.959
 then it is stopped again 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.290
 so and now there is one more 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:18.519
 a nice extra feature and that 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.540
 There are two headphones here 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.150
 rifle 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.609
 that is once a sound input and 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.040
 a sound output so one can 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.690
 you're doing the sound output now 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.370
 Can you somehow what I do not 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.829
 stereo connect whatever 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.079
 if you also just the sound 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.450
 Want to spend somewhere that 's cool 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.190
 However, the sound of the sound input 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:46.660
 there you can the microphone behind 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:50.680
 connect and have 1 like me now 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.090
 Of course, here, of course, needs little ones 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.090
 suitcase beside with with jack connection 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.489
 then you can speak your language 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.959
 record if you want to the videos 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.810
 that will be completely in a video 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.440
 packed it has one though 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.419
 disadvantage 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.990
 you almost need a preamplifier 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.640
 for that was 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.320
 it may be that the level of yours 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.040
 microphone is too quiet 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.180
 that is with me for example the case 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.220
 speak with a preamplifier 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.510
 Switched between could be just that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.950
 whole level a bit then 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.150
 maybe he would have to do a bit 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.220
 but basically you can try 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.470
 also let's play videos without pc 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.290
 to record 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.840
 Of course, as long as the SD card here 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:41.210
 there is sufficient good as much for 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.170
 connection now I show you how 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:49.730
 you can configure the whole pc 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.960
 because you can also share that with her 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.340
 can set what kind of a 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.720
 resolution you want to have because could 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.480
 nothing is really less here 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.540
 adjust that is actually yes 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.210
 simply because you have to go ahead 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.500
 make on the pc to you turn on the part 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.520
 it goes back to the pc mode 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.450
 the pc 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.450
 logically 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:22.250
 and it shines blue that means it is 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.259
 connected to the pc like that and it is 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:32.340
 ready to fire is lit now 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:34.259
 Going blue all the time and I have to 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.210
 Look here quickly and you call at the pc 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:42.300
 the cover media pc pc free utility exe 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.710
 on this and this utility m 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.840
 the program is at the reck 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.280
 Central is doing that is just in 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.870
 subdirectory then you just have to 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.169
 look at your plate where that 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.110
 is installed and there in one 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.970
 subdirectory you will find the pc 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.100
 free utility here you can then 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.550
 set which resolution is to have 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.830
 should be 27 p or 10 80 am and you 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.800
 can adjust what with which one 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.599
 bit rate you are recording there 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.789
 lower actually little sense 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:18.090
 the best is also the highest 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.900
 this is to take the 16 mb each 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.750
 second 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.740
 there indicates that the file size 120 mb 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.090
 per minute is yes that's ok 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.340
 I play all the things I need 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.360
 simply the higher frame rate, yes, unfortunately 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.460
 it does not go higher 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.349
 that is, if you are really tall 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.940
 quality on life you want it you have to 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.740
 but again s.pc operate because there 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.180
 can you start with 60 mbit without 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.590
 Basically it was already at the pc 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.770
 free mode if you like that 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.449
 configured what I have a field 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.210
 exactly if this is not so with you here 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:54.930
 you seem to need that here 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.400
 everything comes the firmware version 9 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.570
 which is available on a media support 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.849
 side because without the unions the newest 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.949
 firmware you have only 27 p and 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.980
 Lower to lower 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:10.100
 That's why it's always nice 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.640
 stay up to date and then you have 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.630
 also have fun with your videos too 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.360
 completely without a pc 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.570
 In that sense it's good and a lot 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.570
 fun
