00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.620
 incredible exclusive signed item 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.110
 lo iaio s1 the first smartphone of the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.890
 home with qualcomm quad core processor 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.390
 snapdragon 600 with 1.7 gigahertz like 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.640
 we always thank the audio point.it 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.550
 for sending us this symbol and time 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.019
 we proceed to unboxing as always 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 review will be published in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 coming weeks the box of if one is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 equal to that of g5 then the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 phone we talked about already 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 a few weeks ago and for which we have 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 already published a complete review 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.120
 therefore also in this case an opening 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.440
 a book and as we will see itself 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.140
 positioning of the elements then 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 sideways micro usb cable and socket 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.379
 current with the European adapter and al 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.280
 center the phone with the booklets below 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.280
 of education 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:21.260
 well we see the phone the size 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.650
 of the s1 are of 138 for 69 x 9 mm of 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.470
 thickness for a total weight of 173 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.690
 grams battery including battery not 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.390
 it is removable 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.960
 as we had already anticipated and the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.660
 phone supports only one sim 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.100
 can be inserted here I already show you 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:46.220
 just use a simple is a certain 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.400
 like that of the iPhone to extract the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 sim tray of a mycosis but exactly 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.900
 and insert the sim 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.820
 this is one of the aspects that will disappoint 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.950
 most of our say 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.960
 voters who are used to call 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.160
 however also due to the need for telephones 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.800
 dual sim 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.860
 good feelings at first contact 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.410
 They are definitely good you feel 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.750
 immediately solidity and high 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.370
 quality of materials but it is a must 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.310
 emphasizing now we are used to it 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.330
 to the quality of the products and of the daughter 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.410
 yo 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.800
 some have defined this s1 as the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.130
 main rival of the csio mi mitri 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.200
 obviously excluded classic rivals 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.650
 those already known as for example 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.810
 lot n 1 in the month mx3 could be 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.239
 but a low cost rival in a certain 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.739
 sense considered the excellent relationship 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:50.930
 yab yum s1 price quality let's go 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:53.000
 to turn on the phone the frame that 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.790
 surrounds the phone of course also in 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.340
 this case is in steel though 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.880
 however we are used to this style 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.880
 iaio 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.680
 the back is in plastic 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.120
 rubberized this too which helps 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.120
 also protect the phone 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.920
 here we see that already from the release 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.640
 we can understand that however the Roma is 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.380
 a personalized rom from iago 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 a very beautiful customization 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.290
 and that in any case goes to exalt even the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.560
 display dl quality 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:46.620
 how can you see the responsiveness of the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:53.519
 touch and excellent very fluid and not there 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:55.110
 no fuss I have to admit 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.209
 guys I couldn't resist the temptation 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.130
 and before raising this video already given 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.500
 a peek at the phone making a 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:10.799
 first test to everything and for this time vi 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:13.350
 I will show the result here it is 25.400 39 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.420
 points an exceptional score 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.320
 especially for a smartphone from 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.060
 price that still remains relatively 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.270
 accessible with regard to 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.190
 characteristics of the ioio s1 like 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.280
 we have already mentioned the processor is a 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.630
 qualcomm snapdragon at 600 from 1.7 ghz 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:37.919
 quad core with a 5 inch display 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.220
 with 1900 resolution 20 x 1080 and then 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.440
 Full HD 2 GB RAM 32GB memory 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.910
 internal not expandable because it is not 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.270
 present a slot for the micro sim 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:52.050
 dual sony rear camera from 13 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.860
 megapixel with led flash and front from 2 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.539
 megapixel battery from just two thousand e 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.770
 three hundred million so perhaps the only one 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.080
 appearance on which the phone could 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.210
 sin a little but we'll see clearly later 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.340
 more specifically in the review 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.219
 how does this phone behave with one 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.219
 battery from tomorrow 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:11.930
 700,000 per hour NFC support and recharge 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.729
 wireless that unfortunately we cannot 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.139
 try because we do n't have the tools 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:21.610
 suitable at this time we try to 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.610
 make into photos we use 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.610
 directly 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.530
 first look at the quality of the 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.980
 scrap this case the photo looks a little 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.440
 dark but also because he cannot listen 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.350
 the level of detail the quality 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:50.280
 they look very very good as you can 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:56.260
 see also the room is completely 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.450
 customized by ok we see it 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.870
 Quick look at browsing I insert the 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.870
 Easter 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:19.960
 well 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.820
 music china punto.it will probably be 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.730
 need to change the keyboard 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:30.220
 change the keyboard and install one 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.780
 international though this is however 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.960
 however, Chinese characters remain 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.810
 some fine settings between the touch 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:46.120
 also the very seems very fluid 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:49.480
 very fast petty same speech for 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.270
 the double tap however clearly these 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.020
 it's only first impressions though 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.990
 however I have no doubt that the phone 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:04.380
 powered by a snapdragon processor 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:04.380
 600 of great satisfactions 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.150
 well guys it's all for now and there 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.380
 I refer to the full review that it is 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.230
 been published in the next ones 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.050
