00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
ones available my father would know the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
ones available my father would know the
answer<00:02:11.069> because<00:02:11.220> he<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> craftsman<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
answer because he is a craftsman in the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.980 
answer because he is a craftsman in the
car

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
car

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.410 
car
in<00:02:13.050> turn<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:14.160> all<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:14.730> let's<00:02:15.060> open<00:02:15.150> up

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
in turn and all of that so let's open up

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.670 
in turn and all of that so let's open up
a<00:02:15.540> couple<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.080> these<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.560> see

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
a couple more of these so you can see

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.760 
a couple more of these so you can see
some<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> variations<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> got

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
some of the variations in this so I got

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.420 
some of the variations in this so I got
this<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:21.680> decima<00:02:22.680> doesn't<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.010> bass<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
this one decima doesn't have bass in it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.560 
this one decima doesn't have bass in it
but<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> nice<00:02:24.120> different

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
but you can see is a nice different

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.020 
but you can see is a nice different
color<00:02:24.770> very<00:02:25.770> finely<00:02:26.250> made<00:02:26.430> everything<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
color very finely made everything is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.970 
color very finely made everything is
made<00:02:27.210> in<00:02:27.360> limited<00:02:27.720> runs<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.500> they<00:02:28.620> don't<00:02:28.800> just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
made in limited runs so they don't just

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.220 
made in limited runs so they don't just
spew<00:02:29.700> out<00:02:29.790> tons<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.540> tons<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.810> tons<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.140> these

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
spew out tons and tons and tons of these

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.900 
spew out tons and tons and tons of these
they<00:02:31.530> make<00:02:32.070> sure<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.430> they're<00:02:32.610> they're<00:02:32.880> all

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
they make sure that they're they're all

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.580 
they make sure that they're they're all
done<00:02:33.150> right<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.450> they're<00:02:33.540> all<00:02:33.720> handmade<00:02:34.230> in

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
done right and they're all handmade in

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.310 
done right and they're all handmade in
the<00:02:34.650> USA<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:35.820> they're<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:36.840> outsourced

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
the USA so they're not outsourced

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.910 
the USA so they're not outsourced
anywhere<00:02:37.680> else<00:02:37.860> they're<00:02:38.160> finely<00:02:38.910> crafted<00:02:39.920> and
