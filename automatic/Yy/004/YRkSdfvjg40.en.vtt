00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.050
 there was once in a country called 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:31.750
 dragonland a dragon that was not green 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.240
 like all the others but pink 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.550
 this dragon was getting up every day 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.640
 very early and picked up all the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.330
 raspberries from the country after he sat down 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.400
 under a tree and ate them all by 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.400
 that this dragon had the skin 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.290
 jolines we already have with him all the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.780
 raspberries give us a few bags 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.650
 at that time our little dragon 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.990
 he took all the ones that are left 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.990
 and he put them in his mouth with a bang 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.130
 and selfish you are never let us try them 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.009
 I'm sorry but I got up early 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.530
 to catch them not like you who 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.140
 you spend the whole morning sleeping 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.860
 the dragons got angry with him and 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.420
 they started singing 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.420
 because we enjoy 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.070
 Hahaha 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.070
 in the next pink link tired of 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.190
 to make fun of him he thought about painting 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 his whole body green 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.659
 I already bought the painting and I'm going to 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.650
 house to paint me to see what I have left 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.860
 the pink dragon went home 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.530
 and the whole body was painted green 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.530
 When I finish , the sun goes down 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.039
 walk what good it had been that 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.729
 I'm glad that they will not go back to 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.729
 put with me 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.790
 once I 'm dry but 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.959
 I'm very hot I think I'm going to go 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.959
 to the lake to take a dip 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.480
 the little dragon realized that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.890
 when all the paint is in the water 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.890
 green had been removed 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.380
 of boer is expressed that inviting you 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.380

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.100
 and look now we are equal 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.670
 green but if we see as always 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.730
 two 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.150
 it's true I've taken all the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.150
 painting 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.599
 we have left the water 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.599
 I left them green 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.379
 very sad in the honorable one went 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.840
 running home that night vexing 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.569
 he could not sleep 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.959
 he had taken all his things for nights 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.959
 was 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:38.740
 'I do not go through a river on a mountain and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.740

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.020

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.209
 but when he arrived in the city he 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.420
 mind that everyone had him 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.420

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:08.330

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.630

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.920
 the poor dragon began to move away from the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.590
 very upset city 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.960
 I was so tired of walking and walking 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.310
 throughout the day he supported himself 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.950
 nothing 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.010
 when he was falling asleep he heard a 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.010
 noise 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.650

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.930
 sleep with us on the farm next door 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.050

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.550

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:05.070
 I need to rest my name 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.710
 our little dragon was very 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.009
 Taste with your new animal friends and 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.279
 these with his new friend the pink dragon 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.589
 but when the banker when going to look for 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:18.779
 his animals saw the dragon there 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:20.210
 scared a lot and threw him out of there 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.930
 indicates 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.289
 out of here the goal did not have you know 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.319
 animals 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.729
 not if I do not want to kill animals 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:34.860
 They are my friends and I would never hurt them 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:38.639

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.129
 of the animals out outside here 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.810
 the pink dragon said goodbye to his friends 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.960
 and he died and got stained looking for a place 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.530
 where it was well decided 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.680
 he started to walk and walk he went through 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.590
 one mountain and another and another also crossed 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.300
 a river and he was so tired that he stayed 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.300
 in a tree and he fell asleep 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.639
 how tired is everything 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.950
 while the dragon was asleep 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.260
 he dreamed with all his friends the dragons 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.580
 I am also with the lake LÃ¡car 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.980

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:20.810

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.340
 the pink dragon took the path of 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:43.150
 back home after all day walking 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.150
 on the horizon he saw Dragolandia 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.900
 I see from hollande already being at my house 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.030
 he continued his way to that of aland and 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:57.630
 when he arrived the first thing he saw was all 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.630
 the famous ones had eaten us 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:05.879
 raspberries indicate that I wanted to 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.289
