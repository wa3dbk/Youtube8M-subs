keep doing that since it worked and then

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.850 
keep doing that since it worked and then
very<00:00:59.510> flexible<00:00:59.899> player<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:00.440> just<00:01:00.559> went<00:01:00.680> with

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
very flexible player so I just went with

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.680

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
the tube back to trying hard counter

like<00:01:04.930> if<00:01:05.649> you're<00:01:05.770> going<00:01:05.890> along<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.430> game<00:01:06.640> in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
like if you're going along the game in

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.100 
like if you're going along the game in
good<00:01:06.970> position<00:01:07.390> it's<00:01:07.479> not<00:01:07.570> very<00:01:07.750> easy<00:01:07.899> to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
good position it's not very easy to

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.499 
good position it's not very easy to
people<00:01:08.560> so<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.159> figured<00:01:09.610> it's<00:01:09.759> worth<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:10.060> risk

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
people so I figured it's worth the risk

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.440 
people so I figured it's worth the risk
indeed<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:11.530> know<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.729> it's<00:01:13.119> something

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
indeed you know it's it's something

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.480 
indeed you know it's it's something
really<00:01:14.049> intelligent<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.619> think<00:01:14.890> because<00:01:15.250> you

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
really intelligent I think because you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.249 
really intelligent I think because you
never<00:01:15.729> do<00:01:15.970> these<00:01:16.119> two<00:01:16.329> facts<00:01:16.600> right<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.110> it's

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
never do these two facts right and it's

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.260 
never do these two facts right and it's
a<00:01:17.350> hard<00:01:17.590> map<00:01:17.799> you're<00:01:18.460> down<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.789> game<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.210> the

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
a hard map you're down a game in the

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.179 
a hard map you're down a game in the
series<00:01:19.539> if<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.229> think<00:01:20.439> it<00:01:20.560> built<00:01:21.009> your

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
series if you think it built your

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.130 
series if you think it built your
confidence<00:01:21.789> to<00:01:21.970> get<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.330> first<00:01:22.600> win<00:01:22.840> so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
confidence to get that first win so

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.560 
confidence to get that first win so
easily<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.799> don't<00:01:24.729> know<00:01:24.820> if<00:01:24.939> it<00:01:25.030> affected<00:01:25.390> me<00:01:25.539> so

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
easily I don't know if it affected me so

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.210 
easily I don't know if it affected me so
much<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:25.960> affected<00:01:26.229> him<00:01:26.470> threw<00:01:26.740> him<00:01:26.799> off<00:01:27.070> his

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
much it affected him threw him off his

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.130

lost<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.350> reader<00:01:47.530> when<00:01:47.709> he<00:01:47.770> really<00:01:47.979> shouldn't

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
lost the reader when he really shouldn't

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.010 
lost the reader when he really shouldn't
have<00:01:48.399> but<00:01:49.000> he<00:01:49.119> still<00:01:49.330> did<00:01:49.479> enough<00:01:49.659> damage<00:01:49.689> to

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
have but he still did enough damage to

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.350 
have but he still did enough damage to
the<00:01:50.200> rush<00:01:50.349> was<00:01:50.530> worth<00:01:50.709> it<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.939> again<00:01:52.179> I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
the rush was worth it but again I

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.059 
the rush was worth it but again I
figured<00:01:52.750> he'd<00:01:52.899> either<00:01:53.020> go<00:01:53.289> a<00:01:53.319> fast<00:01:53.740> second

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
figured he'd either go a fast second

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.800 
figured he'd either go a fast second
expansion<00:01:54.340> or<00:01:54.610> really<00:01:54.819> fast<00:01:55.030> arbiters<00:01:55.479> just

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
expansion or really fast arbiters just

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.589 
expansion or really fast arbiters just
you<00:01:56.080> know<00:01:56.310> general<00:01:57.310> abusive<00:01:57.729> play<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.569> I

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
you know general abusive play so I

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.699 
you know general abusive play so I

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
counter push and well it worked his

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.440 
counter push and well it worked his
Reaper<00:02:02.709> scarabs<00:02:03.159> they<00:02:03.340> weren't<00:02:03.640> great<00:02:03.819> and<00:02:04.119> I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
Reaper scarabs they weren't great and I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.149 
Reaper scarabs they weren't great and I
managed<00:02:04.959> to<00:02:04.990> spread<00:02:05.170> my<00:02:05.380> tanks<00:02:05.649> well<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.069> get

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
managed to spread my tanks well and get

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.009 
managed to spread my tanks well and get
a<00:02:06.189> mind<00:02:06.429> surround<00:02:06.729> on<00:02:06.880> his<00:02:07.030> goons<00:02:07.209> and<00:02:07.569> he<00:02:07.869> did

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
a mind surround on his goons and he did

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.630 
a mind surround on his goons and he did
double<00:02:08.259> expand<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:08.950> he<00:02:09.039> didn't<00:02:09.280> have<00:02:09.399> enough

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
double expand so he didn't have enough

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.030 
double expand so he didn't have enough
units<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:10.119> really<00:02:10.329> hold<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.600> rush<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.470> after

think<00:03:12.829> okay<00:03:13.220> if<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.459> i<00:03:13.670> saw<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.269> he's<00:03:14.359> so<00:03:14.480> good

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
think okay if you i saw but he's so good

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.420 
think okay if you i saw but he's so good
dt<00:03:14.930> draw<00:03:15.140> cuz<00:03:15.319> it's<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:15.650> good<00:03:15.829> yeah<00:03:16.250> it's

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
dt draw cuz it's so good yeah it's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.970 
dt draw cuz it's so good yeah it's
enough<00:03:16.720> events<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:17.900> it's<00:03:18.500> enough<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.829> an

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
enough events but it's enough of an

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.599 
enough events but it's enough of an
investment

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
investment

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.339 
investment
I<00:03:19.700> think<00:03:19.910> his<00:03:20.030> robotics<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:20.959> they<00:03:21.169> already

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
I think his robotics so they already

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.830 
I think his robotics so they already
finished<00:03:21.829> yeah<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.970> time<00:03:23.209> for<00:03:23.359> our<00:03:23.450> class<00:03:23.630> was

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
finished yeah the time for our class was

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.210 
finished yeah the time for our class was
still<00:03:24.019> working<00:03:24.230> yeah<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:24.889> he<00:03:24.980> would<00:03:25.099> have

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
still working yeah so he would have

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.460 
still working yeah so he would have
gotten<00:03:25.370> back<00:03:25.519> like<00:03:25.669> what<00:03:25.849> 250<00:03:26.299> minerals

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
gotten back like what 250 minerals

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.790 
gotten back like what 250 minerals
really<00:03:28.650> he<00:03:28.800> had<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.070> go<00:03:29.160> through<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.760> one

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
really he had to go through that one

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.240 
really he had to go through that one
now<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.420> DT<00:03:32.780> drop<00:03:33.050> coming<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.650> mean<00:03:34.070> it's

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
now with the DT drop coming I mean it's

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.100 
now with the DT drop coming I mean it's
one<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.060> most<00:03:35.150> powerful<00:03:35.390> moves<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.020> entire

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
one of most powerful moves the entire

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.040 
one of most powerful moves the entire
game<00:03:36.730> what<00:03:37.730> what<00:03:38.060> did<00:03:38.210> you<00:03:38.330> want<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.900> do

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
game what what did you want to do

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.960 
game what what did you want to do
exactly<00:03:39.710> to<00:03:40.010> counter<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.550> know<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.700> lot

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
exactly to counter that you know a lot

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.760 
exactly to counter that you know a lot
of<00:03:41.060> people<00:03:41.330> they<00:03:41.450> over<00:03:41.780> count<00:03:42.020> in<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.200> DT<00:03:42.500> drop

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
of people they over count in the DT drop

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.350 
of people they over count in the DT drop
when<00:03:43.130> they<00:03:43.250> see<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.520> coming<00:03:43.820> what<00:03:44.150> do<00:03:44.270> you

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
when they see it coming what do you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.910 
when they see it coming what do you
think<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.660> just<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.140> right<00:03:45.350> line<00:03:45.590> you're

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
think is just the right line you're

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.070 
think is just the right line you're
going<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.310> one<00:03:46.460> factor<00:03:46.850> expansion<00:03:47.420> well

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
going for one factor expansion well

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.050 
going for one factor expansion well
harmony<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.740> actually<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.310> pretty<00:03:49.520> decent<00:03:49.730> map

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
harmony is actually a pretty decent map

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.400 
harmony is actually a pretty decent map
to<00:03:50.180> defender<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.570> guess<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.110> pretty<00:03:51.290> small

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
to defender I guess it's a pretty small

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.920 
to defender I guess it's a pretty small
main<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.490> can<00:03:52.640> call<00:03:52.790> off<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.240> expansion

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
main and you can call off the expansion

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.930 
main and you can call off the expansion
with<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.410> two<00:03:54.650> buildings<00:03:54.980> like<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.880> you

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
with the two buildings like that so you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.730 
with the two buildings like that so you
only<00:03:56.120> need<00:03:56.210> like<00:03:56.480> three<00:03:57.050> turrets<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.620> get

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
only need like three turrets to get

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.880 
only need like three turrets to get
really<00:03:58.010> total<00:03:58.340> coverage<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.820> I<00:03:58.850> got<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.180> best

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
really total coverage and I got the best

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.440 
really total coverage and I got the best
Academy<00:04:00.890> just<00:04:01.040> in<00:04:01.190> case<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.730> got<00:04:01.910> through<00:04:02.150> and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
Academy just in case you got through and

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.230 
Academy just in case you got through and
to<00:04:02.750> allow<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.080> timing<00:04:03.380> push<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.400> yeah<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:05.120> think

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
to allow it timing push so yeah I think

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.090 
to allow it timing push so yeah I think
yeah<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.720> freeter<00:04:06.050> is<00:04:06.170> cover<00:04:06.380> defense

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
yeah the freeter is cover defense

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.520 
yeah the freeter is cover defense
Academy<00:04:07.340> now<00:04:08.120> when<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.510> got<00:04:08.690> your<00:04:08.990> tanks<00:04:09.320> down

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
Academy now when you got your tanks down

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.190 
Academy now when you got your tanks down
next<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.100> his<00:04:10.250> expansion<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.240> that<00:04:11.480> off<00:04:11.690> with

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
next to his expansion in that off with

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.410 
next to his expansion in that off with
that<00:04:12.320> little<00:04:12.500> tiny<00:04:12.620> chope<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.370> just<00:04:13.880> cannot<00:04:14.210> be

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
that little tiny chope it just cannot be

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.120 
that little tiny chope it just cannot be
stopped

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
stopped

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.380 
stopped

feeling<00:04:31.760> right<00:04:31.970> then<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.510> was<00:04:32.990> happy<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.470> course

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
feeling right then I was happy of course

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.740 
feeling right then I was happy of course
but<00:04:33.950> really<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.490> by<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.030> time<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.360> sat<00:04:35.540> in<00:04:35.690> the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
but really I by the time I sat in the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.959 
but really I by the time I sat in the
dark<00:04:35.930> job<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.320> was<00:04:36.560> pretty<00:04:37.460> sure

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.419 

so<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:41.479> kind<00:04:41.929> of<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.169> ramped<00:04:42.889> up<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.039> it<00:04:43.309> it

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:43.429 
so I kind of like ramped up to it it

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:44.919 
so I kind of like ramped up to it it
wasn't<00:04:43.550> just<00:04:43.729> one<00:04:43.999> moment<00:04:44.149> of<00:04:44.360> realization

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:44.929 
wasn't just one moment of realization

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:46.809 
wasn't just one moment of realization
that<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.110> wanted<00:04:45.499> but<00:04:45.679> obviously<00:04:46.429> I'm<00:04:46.610> happy

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
that I wanted but obviously I'm happy
