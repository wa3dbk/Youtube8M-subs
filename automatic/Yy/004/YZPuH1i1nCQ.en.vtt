00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.460
 pre history 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.580
 hello my little lover sit 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.680
 merge rollers more than once you come across 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 situations in which 1 underdeveloped 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.580
 team mate during the game 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.490
 there was an anal fire due to 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.929
 whom he was pouring at the very beginning today 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.360
 I want to talk about such situations 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.429
 because if that happens then 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.940
 only in my team and only in the game on 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.649
 framed tee oh why me exactly you 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.630
 play and miraculously pull 8 10 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.909
 minute under my game 2 composition on 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.560
 leading clandestine activities followed 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.530
 Pretty looking for a game and you get one 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.270
 reward 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.310
 so here I am about this what to do if you 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.869
 turned out to be in this situation and how 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.790
 act properly to keep 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.469
 adequate chance of winning I will not be in 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.090
 this video is dry analytics but only 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.509
 I want to share my experience to give 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.649
 some tips 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.390
 The first is probably not the most important 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.009
 merge moral and what's the opposite for 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.960
 me when we were in the minority and 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.840
 sometimes this one acts as a challenge with 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.159
 the main question you can oh all yes it is me 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.579
 the same uyebok which remains 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.079
 the latter does not want to pour make 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.820
 yourself in this situation play more 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.130
 focused on the opponent this alignment 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.230
 only relaxes and pleases what is clear to you 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:17.140
 on hand and after a couple of his deaths him 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.940
 perdak begins to burn brighter comets so 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.049
 Here you are tuned to unwind all guts 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.579
 an opponent of the chandelier 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.079
 but first you need to estimate the peak 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.980
 Itâ€™s worth comparing an opponent 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.989
 carry potential 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.549
 if your situation is worse than that 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.410
 delay the game is not worth to start 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.480
 need to be distributed over the next five 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.239
 minutes on all three lines with the possibility 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.739
 make as many pharma yes it is 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.510
 in five minutes you can get 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.370
 free and gold sliver and buy 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.370
 and then try to twitch 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.060
 as you can see from kerry in the team was only 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.050
 sf agree not the best option against 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.330
 jagger and templar 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.010
 so the opponent will splitpush 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.170
 strain and run hard after him not 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.560
 makes sense for this is a divorce for a while not 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.300
 in your favor you need them as quickly as possible 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.460
 pick up goods for goods for free 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.050
 roshana and kill the homeless minority and 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.430
 only in this way can you do it 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.080
 defeat them in the main teamfights or need 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.730
 You can try hi-speed push for 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.410
 control the liver if he is of course 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.760
 suitable heroes can something 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.140
 oppose the enemy 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.400
 and if the hands of ass then we go further 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.200
 the main thing is not to keep keep 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.360
 build to win key team fights 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.550
 with the team do not disdain me 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.200
 not much time and while the enemies are in 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.260
 tavern you can tear down the side and 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 get a good advantage already 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.220
 Overall, the enemy no longer understands that 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.170
 happens and swam and well that in this 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.360
 the game I played with a friend on the topic of Mary 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.250
 apathy mayor i have 4,300 whatever 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.060
 much but maybe my experience to you 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.650
 handy and if you demolished the sides but 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.930
 a couple of temate is about to be killed not 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.880
 try to save them is a good exchange 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.730
 and jump under the train hoping to recover 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.670
 no sense next scuffle need 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.290
 carry out full 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.450
 make the enemy suffer arrange 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.340
 conveyor gaming! 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.200
 make another side of what will put them 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 a hopeless situation where you need to 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.650
 make them once again mistaken and throne 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.930
 will fall as a whole with a competent assessment 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.209
 situations and understanding how you can 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.620
 to realize the minority we more than once 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.780
 Proven professional teams 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.000
 when after mendoza or podelki 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.800
 the Internet according to the rules of the tournament players 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.090
 makes finish play in the minority and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.090
 they cope 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.860
 so do not whine and play 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.660
 After all, this is your way to high mmr y and on 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.030
 paths of movement happen and such situations 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.180
 the truth is not for me too much of an hour 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.130
 did you even want to make a guide on 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.290
 another hero but happened out of plan 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.080

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.150
 video in front of the girls and want 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.919
 know what you think about it because 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.720
 give the usual low priority for such 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.180
