this segment is about how to repair a
puncture<00:00:04.560> tube<00:00:04.859> by<00:00:05.130> applying<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.759> patch<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:08.420> have

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
puncture tube by applying a patch I have

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.789 
puncture tube by applying a patch I have
a<00:00:09.480> tube<00:00:10.070> that<00:00:11.070> went<00:00:11.700> flat<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> road<00:00:12.799> but

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
a tube that went flat on the road but

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.010 
a tube that went flat on the road but
it's<00:00:13.950> apparently<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.759> slow<00:00:15.150> leak<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.809> I've

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it's apparently a slow leak because I've

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.859 
it's apparently a slow leak because I've
been<00:00:16.199> partially<00:00:16.800> inflated<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.150> don't

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
been partially inflated it and I don't

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
been partially inflated it and I don't
hear<00:00:19.080> any<00:00:19.260> air<00:00:19.410> coming<00:00:19.680> out<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.359> I'm<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.539> to

hear any air coming out so I'm going to
go<00:00:21.750> ahead<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.320> dump<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.519> pail<00:00:24.119> of

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
go ahead and dump it into a pail of

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
go ahead and dump it into a pail of
water<00:00:24.920> look<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.160> bubbles<00:00:26.779> aha

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.179 

right<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> I've<00:00:31.500> got<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.830> bubbles<00:00:31.980> coming

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
right here I've got some bubbles coming

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:43.590 
right here I've got some bubbles coming
out<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.739> look<00:00:34.950> closely<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.520> see<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> hole

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.150 

need<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.690> let<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.989> air<00:00:45.170> out<00:00:45.199> now<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.070> I

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
need to let the air out now so that I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.009 
need to let the air out now so that I
don't<00:00:46.969> have<00:00:47.180> any<00:00:47.390> inward<00:00:47.809> pressure<00:00:50.019> it's

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
don't have any inward pressure it's

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.959 
don't have any inward pressure it's
going<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.260> keep<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.590> patch<00:00:51.769> from<00:00:52.100> seating

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
going to keep the patch from seating

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.119 
going to keep the patch from seating
itself<00:00:53.769> dry<00:00:54.769> it<00:00:54.829> thoroughly<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.620> in<00:00:57.739> my<00:00:57.890> patch

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
itself dry it thoroughly and in my patch

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.490 
itself dry it thoroughly and in my patch
kit<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:59.019> have<00:01:00.019> sandpaper<00:01:00.550> using<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.640> sandpaper

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
kit I have sandpaper using the sandpaper

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.649 
kit I have sandpaper using the sandpaper
to<00:01:03.500> rough<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.009> area<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:07.700> have<00:01:07.820> got<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.360> tube

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
to rough in the area you have got a tube

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.590 
to rough in the area you have got a tube
of<00:01:08.810> glue<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:09.380> carry<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.340> nail<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.880> my<00:01:10.909> patch<00:01:11.240> kit

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
of glue I carry a nail in my patch kit

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.160 
of glue I carry a nail in my patch kit
as<00:01:11.720> well<00:01:11.750> because<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.979> glue<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.460> sealed<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.960> I

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
as well because the glue is sealed and I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.859 
as well because the glue is sealed and I
need<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.440> puncture<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.509> so<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.690> can

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
need to puncture it so that I can

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.219 
need to puncture it so that I can
withdraw<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.380> glue<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:21.140> reason<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.679> carry<00:01:22.310> an

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
withdraw the glue the reason I carry an

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.710 
withdraw the glue the reason I carry an
uncultured<00:01:24.229> tube<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.310> glue<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:25.759> because<00:01:26.119> now

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
uncultured tube of glue is because now

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.230 
uncultured tube of glue is because now
that<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:27.140> open<00:01:27.429> within<00:01:28.429> about<00:01:28.550> four<00:01:29.030> weeks

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
that it's open within about four weeks

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.850 
that it's open within about four weeks
it's<00:01:29.539> going<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.780> be<00:01:29.899> dry<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.380> hard<00:01:30.679> and

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
it's going to be dry and hard and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.450 
it's going to be dry and hard and
unusable<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.869> I<00:01:33.670> apply<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.729> glue<00:01:36.159> nice<00:01:37.159> and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
unusable so I apply the glue nice and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.760 
unusable so I apply the glue nice and
liberally<00:01:39.729> lots<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.940> glue<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:44.530> place<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
liberally lots of glue and place the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.359 
liberally lots of glue and place the
patch<00:01:48.490> roll<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:50.060> be<00:01:50.180> sure<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.659> it's

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
patch roll it on to be sure that it's

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.850 
patch roll it on to be sure that it's
nice<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.399> tight<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:54.140> there<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:54.860> have<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:56.860> wait

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
nice and tight and there we have it wait

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.609 
nice and tight and there we have it wait
a<00:01:57.890> couple<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.280> minutes<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.409> you'll<00:02:00.409> be<00:02:00.530> able

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
a couple of minutes and you'll be able

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.420 
a couple of minutes and you'll be able
to<00:02:00.920> inflate<00:02:01.310> your<00:02:01.340> tube<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.969> full<00:02:02.149> pressure
