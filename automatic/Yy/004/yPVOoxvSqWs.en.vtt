00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 I find that like the laptop or the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.040
 dredge 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.370
 death is an excellent subject of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.370
 sketches 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.260
 but it's curious let me 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.930
 to surprise me with the word of this expression 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.630
 starving a starving death it's a 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.950
 pleonasm a brat goes on as one 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.950
 was saying little born of beginning 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.490
 obviously, one says that the dead 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.740
 are his deceased as the winged 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.290
 births are beginnings dudes they 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.300
 all the dead are ends every 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.110
 alive are not me I recognize 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.110
 that they are not very fine 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.850
 gold on the existence of a life after the 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.949
 dead there are two streams of thought with 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.890
 several trends first of all there are 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.009
 have they been acquired that do not have 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:15.670
 of existential anxiety that they have 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:18.009
 anxieties exists having I have a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.840
 atheist friends really to say but 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:25.860
 completely down to fundamentalists a 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.920
 so eager ekoko the head the teapot 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 crimes said like that after death there 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.659
 nothing and that's it 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:47.969
 here there is a life after death is this 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:55.709
 that atheists died once the water 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:56.880
 make the head and another who believe in 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.640
 A life after the death 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.859
 so some philosophers already some 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.899
 philosophers of ancient greece who for 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:09.899
 most and all but all are 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:12.540
 today unfortunately died were for the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.420
 most was homosexual which has nothing 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.170
 to see but he believed in a life 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.170
 posterior 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.190
 vegetarians believe in reincarnation 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.520
 but maybe this vegetarians get 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.520
 plant 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.840
 as for cannibals and well some 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.330
 cannibal what downright would have a 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.410
 carnage on the other hand other second 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.170
 way of thinking 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.450
 others what had a life after so 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.620
 as such some experts 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.380
 vatican internationals who believes 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.000
 an eternal life 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.640
 but what is not without asking 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.920
 some serious questions 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.040
 it is there and eternal if for how many 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.040
 time 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.650
 do those who die young are 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.150
 longer dead in other words 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.690
 do the young dead to the most 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:33.320
 great hopes of death after 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.330
 a few hundred million years 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.510
 do the deceased remember 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.040
 their life and after how long 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.040
 found in monotonous death 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.410
 and when they arrive 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:56.670
 the skin is what happy widows 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.510
 are happy to find their husband and 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.870
 Conversely 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.040
 are the happy departed 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.019
 happy to see their widows 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.269

 die for dead okay but dead 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.960
