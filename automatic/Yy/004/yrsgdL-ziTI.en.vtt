00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
what that is is a articulating

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.810 
what that is is a articulating
suspension<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.409> second-to-none<00:01:14.400> as

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
suspension that that second-to-none as

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.950 
suspension that that second-to-none as
far<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.530> traction<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
far as how well the traction is when it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.719 
far as how well the traction is when it
it<00:01:18.409> will<00:01:18.590> allow<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:18.979> have<00:01:19.159> all<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.580> wheels

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.130 
it will allow you to have all the wheels
on<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.060> ground<00:01:20.210> even<00:01:20.479> if<00:01:20.690> you<00:01:20.780> have<00:01:20.869> one

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
on the ground even if you have one

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.710 
on the ground even if you have one
that's<00:01:21.350> up<00:01:21.470> 18<00:01:22.369> 19<00:01:22.850> 20<00:01:23.180> inches<00:01:23.450> off<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.600> ground

that's up 18 19 20 inches off the ground

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.620 
that's up 18 19 20 inches off the ground
versus<00:01:24.229> how<00:01:24.590> calls<00:01:24.890> crazy<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.300> actually

good configuration that way we

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.219 
good configuration that way we
weight-wise<00:01:54.700> we're<00:01:55.700> using<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:56.030> steel<00:01:56.240> cab<00:01:56.539> so

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
weight-wise we're using a steel cab so

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.540 
weight-wise we're using a steel cab so
we're<00:01:57.410> comparable<00:01:57.950> there<00:01:58.070> forward

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550
