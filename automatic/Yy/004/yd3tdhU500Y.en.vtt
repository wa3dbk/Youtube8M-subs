I'm<00:00:13.590> here<00:00:13.799> today<00:00:15.830> to<00:00:16.830> describe<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.640> extreme

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
I'm here today to describe the extreme

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.640 
I'm here today to describe the extreme
series<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.080> rackets<00:00:19.529> for<00:00:19.770> head<00:00:20.689> we<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.990> three

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
series of rackets for head we have three

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.150 
series of rackets for head we have three
rackets<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.760> series<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:25.109> first<00:00:25.590> model

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
rackets in this series the first model

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.849 
rackets in this series the first model
is<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.550> extreme<00:00:27.180> mitt<00:00:27.660> Plus<00:00:27.930> actually<00:00:28.560> more

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
is the extreme mitt Plus actually more

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.650 
is the extreme mitt Plus actually more
accurate<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.340> called<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> IG<00:00:30.060> extreme<00:00:30.480> that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
accurate it called the IG extreme that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
accurate it called the IG extreme that
plus<00:00:30.840> IG<00:00:31.170> refers<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:32.130> Agra<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the carbon fibers in the hoop of the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
the carbon fibers in the hoop of the
racket<00:00:57.120> down<00:00:57.420> through<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> shaft<00:00:58.140> area<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
racket down through the shaft area and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.910 
racket down through the shaft area and
the<00:01:00.149> other<00:01:00.329> key<00:01:00.629> technology<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.770> these

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the other key technology in these

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.320 
the other key technology in these
rackets<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.000> d3o<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> smart

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
rackets is the d3o which is the smart

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.050 
rackets is the d3o which is the smart
material<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.520> material<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
material and that is the material that

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.990 
material and that is the material that
actually<00:01:09.630> adjusts<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.979> nature<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> your

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
actually adjusts to the nature of your

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.060 
actually adjusts to the nature of your
shot<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:13.170> example<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> hit<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> very

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
shot so for example if you hit a very

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.550 
shot so for example if you hit a very
aggressive<00:01:14.790> shot<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.750> molecules<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
aggressive shot the molecules of that

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.340 
aggressive shot the molecules of that
smart<00:01:16.979> material<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.580> d3o<00:01:18.000> bind<00:01:18.570> together<00:01:18.780> in

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
smart material or d3o bind together in

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.039 
smart material or d3o bind together in
the<00:01:19.830> throat<00:01:20.070> area<00:01:20.420> stiffening<00:01:21.420> up<00:01:21.570> giving<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the throat area stiffening up giving you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
the throat area stiffening up giving you
more<00:01:22.290> power<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> other<00:01:23.700> hand<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.060> you're

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
more power on the other hand if you're

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.210 
more power on the other hand if you're
hitting<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.630> softer<00:01:25.350> shot<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.390> drop<00:01:27.390> shot

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
hitting a softer shot like a drop shot

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
hitting a softer shot like a drop shot
volley<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.369> something<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.090> effect<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
volley or something of that effect that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
volley or something of that effect that
you<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.229> maximum<00:01:31.590> touch<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> feel<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you want maximum touch and feel then you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.249 
you want maximum touch and feel then you
will<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.770> response<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:36.259> rackets

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
will get that as a response the rackets

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
will get that as a response the rackets
come<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.560> two<00:01:37.650> three<00:01:37.860> head<00:01:38.040> sizes<00:01:38.310> actually
