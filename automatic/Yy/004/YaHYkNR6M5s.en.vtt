milliamp hour battery it's a very large
battery<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:15.030> let's<00:01:16.030> look<00:01:16.119> at<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.330> worst<00:01:16.540> case

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
battery and let's look at the worst case

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.899 
battery and let's look at the worst case
scenario<00:01:17.320> say<00:01:17.920> you're<00:01:18.130> charging<00:01:18.549> through<00:01:18.759> the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
scenario say you're charging through the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.090 
scenario say you're charging through the
USB<00:01:19.240> cable<00:01:19.439> that's<00:01:20.439> connected<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:20.920> your

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.310 
USB cable that's connected to your
computer<00:01:21.280> that's<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.390> slowest<00:01:22.900> charge<00:01:23.170> you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
computer that's the slowest charge you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.390 
computer that's the slowest charge you
could<00:01:23.470> do<00:01:23.619> on<00:01:23.799> this<00:01:24.280> device<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.810> takes

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
could do on this device and it takes

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.670 
could do on this device and it takes
probably<00:01:27.400> eight<00:01:27.939> hours<00:01:28.390> maybe<00:01:29.079> even<00:01:29.259> longer

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
probably eight hours maybe even longer

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.819 
probably eight hours maybe even longer
maybe<00:01:30.159> eighty<00:01:30.490> nine<00:01:30.820> hours<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.680> get<00:01:32.799> a

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
maybe eighty nine hours you can get a

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.050 
maybe eighty nine hours you can get a
full<00:01:33.070> charge<00:01:33.340> off<00:01:33.549> of<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:35.820> I'll<00:01:36.820> show

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
full charge off of that and I'll show

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.270 
full charge off of that and I'll show
you<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.270> best<00:01:37.659> way<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.619> fastest<00:01:39.100> way<00:01:39.130> to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.410 
phone okay and I guess while we're on
the<00:02:09.580> topic<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:10.179> could<00:02:10.989> go<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> little<00:02:11.410> bit<00:02:12.120> over

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
the topic we could go a little bit over

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.750 
the topic we could go a little bit over
about<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.810> battery<00:02:14.110> life<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:15.040> battery<00:02:15.400> life

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
about the battery life the battery life

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.470 
about the battery life the battery life
is<00:02:16.440> fantastic<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:18.190> uh<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.970> know<00:02:19.000> don't

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
is fantastic but uh you know don't

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.290 
is fantastic but uh you know don't
expect<00:02:20.160> miracles<00:02:21.160> either<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:23.880> I've<00:02:24.880> seen

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
expect miracles either so the I've seen

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.680 
expect miracles either so the I've seen
you<00:02:25.810> know<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.440> go<00:02:27.040> through<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:28.120> usage<00:02:28.540> of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
you know I I go through the usage of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.160 
you know I I go through the usage of
this<00:02:28.840> film<00:02:29.080> pretty<00:02:29.440> heavily<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.690> I've<00:02:31.690> seen

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
this film pretty heavily and I've seen

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.760 
this film pretty heavily and I've seen
as<00:02:32.709> short<00:02:33.250> as<00:02:33.569> maybe<00:02:34.569> 12<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.200> half<00:02:35.230> hours

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
as short as maybe 12 and a half hours

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.449 
as short as maybe 12 and a half hours
with<00:02:36.730> about<00:02:37.000> sixty<00:02:37.810> percent<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.069> screen

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
with about sixty percent of the screen

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.740 
with about sixty percent of the screen
being<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.209> about<00:02:41.610> about<00:02:42.610> 28<00:02:43.120> hours<00:02:43.300> of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
being on and about about 28 hours of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.400 
being on and about about 28 hours of
like<00:02:44.250> light<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.459> moderate<00:02:45.850> use<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:46.959> is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
like light to moderate use so that is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.300 
like light to moderate use so that is
you<00:02:48.220> know<00:02:48.720> leaps<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.140> bounds<00:02:50.230> better<00:02:50.709> than

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
you know leaps and bounds better than

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.789 
you know leaps and bounds better than
what<00:02:51.700> i'm<00:02:51.819> used<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.209> on<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> galaxy<00:02:52.750> device<00:02:53.170> I've

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
what i'm used to on a galaxy device I've

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.840 
what i'm used to on a galaxy device I've
had<00:02:54.069> Galaxy<00:02:54.549> devices<00:02:54.730> off<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:56.170> know<00:02:56.850> become

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
had Galaxy devices off you know become

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.759 
had Galaxy devices off you know become
fully<00:02:58.360> drained<00:02:58.810> while<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.769> was<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:02.410> it

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
fully drained while I was like on on it

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:03.990 
fully drained while I was like on on it
playing<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.130> game<00:03:03.340> for<00:03:03.549> three<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.970> half

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
playing a game for three and a half

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.229 
playing a game for three and a half
hours<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:05.319> since<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:06.519> know<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.940> probably

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
hours but since you know you probably

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.840 
hours but since you know you probably
won't<00:03:07.810> be<00:03:07.930> playing<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.830> game<00:03:09.100> 12<00:03:09.549> hours

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
won't be playing a game 12 hours

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.360 
won't be playing a game 12 hours
straight<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.569> even<00:03:11.350> if<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.769> play<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> game

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
straight on it even if you play a game

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.490 
straight on it even if you play a game
for<00:03:12.400> three<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.940> half<00:03:12.970> hours<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:14.110> still

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
for three and a half hours you still

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.030 
for three and a half hours you still
have<00:03:14.950> some<00:03:15.430> resting<00:03:15.850> time<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:17.110> I'd<00:03:17.769> say

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
have some resting time so I'd say

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.490 
have some resting time so I'd say
realistically<00:03:18.850> worst<00:03:19.570> case<00:03:19.810> scenario<00:03:20.350> you

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
realistically worst case scenario you

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.319 
realistically worst case scenario you
could<00:03:20.650> expect<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.310> use<00:03:21.549> it<00:03:21.730> for<00:03:21.760> about<00:03:21.970> 12

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
could expect to use it for about 12

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.259 
could expect to use it for about 12
hours<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.810> that's<00:03:23.410> about<00:03:23.760> four<00:03:24.760> times<00:03:24.970> longer

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
hours and that's about four times longer

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.000 
hours and that's about four times longer
than<00:03:25.510> I've<00:03:25.810> ever<00:03:25.840> experienced<00:03:26.769> with<00:03:26.920> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
than I've ever experienced with the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.840 
than I've ever experienced with the
device<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:28.709> that's<00:03:29.709> all<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:29.980> want<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.519> talk
