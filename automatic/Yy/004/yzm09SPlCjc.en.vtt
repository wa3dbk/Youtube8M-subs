00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.700 
ah I heard that somewhere and I found it
to<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.090> true<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:57.720> if<00:01:57.900> you're<00:01:57.990> using<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.470> rent

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to be true so if you're using the rent

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.470 
to be true so if you're using the rent
down<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.980> m16<00:01:59.400> you<00:02:00.030> should<00:02:00.180> try<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
down the m16 you should try out the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.590 
down the m16 you should try out the
holographic<00:02:00.840> sight<00:02:01.280> I've<00:02:02.280> noticed<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.760> pretty

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
holographic sight I've noticed a pretty

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.000 
holographic sight I've noticed a pretty
big<00:02:03.720> improvement<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:06.170> luckily<00:02:07.170> some<00:02:07.440> kids<00:02:07.890> on

the<00:02:15.210> brick<00:02:15.450> wall<00:02:15.630> isn't<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.990> very<00:02:16.080> good<00:02:16.230> spot<00:02:16.410> I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
the brick wall isn't a very good spot I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.430 
the brick wall isn't a very good spot I
shouldn't<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.250> stayed<00:02:17.760> here<00:02:17.940> very<00:02:18.300> long<00:02:18.480> can

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
shouldn't have stayed here very long can

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
guys with my last couple bursts and

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.110 
guys with my last couple bursts and
running<00:03:28.140> around<00:03:28.200> my<00:03:28.980> ppt<00:03:29.250> Dasom<00:03:29.730> which<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.060> a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
running around my ppt Dasom which is a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.570 
running around my ppt Dasom which is a
really<00:03:30.330> good<00:03:30.600> reliable<00:03:31.350> secondary<00:03:31.800> I'd<00:03:32.430> use

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
really good reliable secondary I'd use

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.860 
really good reliable secondary I'd use
it<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.820> silencer<00:03:33.330> until<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.660> get<00:03:33.780> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
it with a silencer until you get the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.600 
it with a silencer until you get the
extended<00:03:33.959> mags<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.190> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
extended mags on it and then the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.660 
extended mags on it and then the
extended<00:03:35.970> mags<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.250> really<00:03:38.400> powerful

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
extended mags and it is really powerful

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.440 
extended mags and it is really powerful
probably<00:03:39.270> better<00:03:39.540> than<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.780> few<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.470> SMGs

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
probably better than a few of the SMGs

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.030 
probably better than a few of the SMGs
it<00:03:42.450> probably<00:03:42.720> could<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.870> an<00:03:43.020> SMG<00:03:43.290> primary<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it probably could be an SMG primary so I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.510 
it probably could be an SMG primary so I
pick<00:03:47.160> up<00:03:47.250> an<00:03:47.340> ak-47<00:03:48.500> i'm<00:03:49.500> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> use<00:03:50.400> them

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
pick up an ak-47 i'm going to use them

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.010 
pick up an ak-47 i'm going to use them

like walks anda lunches at me while I'm
on<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.419> ground<00:04:43.720> seems<00:04:44.290> like<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.680> night<00:04:44.860> just

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
on the ground seems like the night just

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.690 
on the ground seems like the night just
like<00:04:45.280> its<00:04:46.060> magnetic<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.050> just<00:04:47.400> goes<00:04:48.400> straight

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
like its magnetic and just goes straight

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.370 
like its magnetic and just goes straight
to<00:04:48.970> my<00:04:49.000> body<00:04:49.360> wherever<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.020> am<00:04:51.990> like<00:04:52.990> that's<00:04:53.169> why

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
I think it's like kind of cheap not just

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.590 
I think it's like kind of cheap not just
cuz<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.160> launch<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:57.880> just<00:04:58.060> seems<00:04:58.210> like<00:04:58.390> it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
cuz of the launch it just seems like it

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.550
