here another thing I don't see is any

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.469 
here another thing I don't see is any
sort<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.310> power<00:01:29.640> system<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
sort of you know power system here so I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.179 
sort of you know power system here so I
literally<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.500> could<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.799> keep<00:01:32.009> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
literally think I could just keep this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
literally think I could just keep this
close<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> entire<00:01:32.759> time<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.570> I'll<00:01:34.200> survive

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
close the entire time and I'll survive

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.280 
close the entire time and I'll survive
this<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.170> don't

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.090 
this I think I can actually I don't
there's<00:01:37.920> no<00:01:38.090> sort<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.180> power<00:01:39.360> system<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.170> don't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
there's no sort of power system I don't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
there's no sort of power system I don't
know<00:01:41.189> how<00:01:41.509> maybe<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> says<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> the
