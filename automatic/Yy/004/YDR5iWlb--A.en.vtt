00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.400
 yes gentleman Cup now times a test 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.189
 before and that is me and maybe also 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.250
 you noticed that the females in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.830
 The bucket was totally gaudy orange and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 when I put it in the basin then 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.010
 just in quotation marks yellow yes 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.510
 and if it has noticed me 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 also written here out of the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.310
 facebook groups and will probably 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 next to blue light lie that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.910
 by the stop blue comes 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 complementary color to yellow and orange 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 that's just because orange 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.540
 not coming out that way anymore and that's why 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.969
 I have now started a try 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.020
 and have my eco all over here 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.940
 blue leds sometimes taped black so that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.750
 So that's it still needs to have white leds 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.760
 and now grab the times in the pool and 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:01:00.000
 then I'm curious if the fish 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.809
 because orange are as with the blue 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.430
 Of course, everyone has so light now 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.060
 a bit crumpled because they think 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:19.890
 what is he up to now? 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:21.600
 it comes so jump a bit 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.850
 in the light so you a bit something 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.290
 able to see 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.729
 It is still yellow orange 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.100
 So it can not be in the light now 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.500
 necessarily lie very well now 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.040
 they definitely tick orange 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.049
 look beautiful but definitely 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.149
 not as orange as ever maybe 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.270
 it is also due to the green of the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.090
 glass at this 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.710
 float glass or they are not easy 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.760
 said the others also had a husband 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.650
 and for now all yellow 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.230
 you do not know if it had an idea 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.200
 why this could be because post 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.770
 comment otherwise wish you all 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.550

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.550
