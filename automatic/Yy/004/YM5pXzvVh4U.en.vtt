the<00:03:50.290> one<00:03:50.410> thing<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.740> did<00:03:50.920> notice<00:03:50.950> is<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.490> they

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the one thing I did notice is that they

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.020 
the one thing I did notice is that they
did<00:03:51.970> tend<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:53.050> flake<00:03:53.800> at<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.070> top<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.340> my<00:03:54.760> lip

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
did tend to flake at the top of my lip

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.020 
did tend to flake at the top of my lip
so<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.810> kind<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.320> have<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.530> reapply<00:03:57.070> every<00:03:57.520> hour

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
so I kind of have to reapply every hour

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.110 
so I kind of have to reapply every hour
or<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.660> maybe<00:03:59.440> half<00:03:59.800> hour<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.550> that's<00:04:00.880> not<00:04:01.060> too

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
or so maybe half hour so that's not too

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.390 
or so maybe half hour so that's not too
too<00:04:01.540> bad<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.750> don't<00:04:02.080> mind<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.380> but<00:04:02.709> these<00:04:03.340> are
