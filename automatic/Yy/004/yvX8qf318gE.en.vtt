use<00:02:32.799> as<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.860> base<00:02:34.190> for<00:02:34.730> Psaltis<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:36.250> casseroles

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
use as a base for Psaltis and casseroles

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.059 
use as a base for Psaltis and casseroles
anything<00:02:40.099> like<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.519> can<00:02:40.670> see<00:02:40.849> that<00:02:41.150> mountain

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
anything like you can see that mountain

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.520 
anything like you can see that mountain
in<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.280> pan<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.510> that's<00:02:47.720> why<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:47.930> not<00:02:48.200> unique

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
in the pan so that's why it's not unique

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.589 
in the pan so that's why it's not unique
if<00:02:48.890> your<00:02:49.099> meat<00:02:49.280> they<00:02:49.549> come<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:50.060> can<00:02:50.299> slice

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
if your meat they come and you can slice

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:59.470 
if your meat they come and you can slice
it<00:02:51.129> so<00:02:52.129> this<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.519> sort<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.849> like<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:54.049> spread<00:02:58.480> ok

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
it so this is sort of like to spread ok

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.990 
it so this is sort of like to spread ok
so<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.079> we're<00:03:00.290> going<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.470> add<00:03:01.000> the
