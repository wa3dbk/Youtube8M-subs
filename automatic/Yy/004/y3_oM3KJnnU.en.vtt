00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
later like I said before all these are
the<00:01:54.360> replays<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> game<00:01:55.229> automatically

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the replays that the game automatically

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.730 
the replays that the game automatically
records<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.750> simply<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> double

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
records and you simply have to double

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
records and you simply have to double
click<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.520> execute<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.210> using

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
click it and it will execute it using

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.240 
click it and it will execute it using
the<00:02:00.509> game<00:02:00.810> client<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.469> previously<00:02:02.009> stated

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the game client like previously stated

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.609 
the game client like previously stated

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so you don't have to convert files or

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.109 
so you don't have to convert files or
anything<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.610> should

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
anything like that it should

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.809 
anything like that it should
automatically<00:02:06.810> use<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.710> World<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.099> Tanks<00:02:08.250> exe

enough I believe I have covered
everything<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.090> time<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.600> one<00:03:36.780> thing<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:36.989> did

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
everything this time the one thing I did

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.960 
everything this time the one thing I did
not<00:03:37.350> cover<00:03:37.560> last<00:03:37.829> time<00:03:38.040> was<00:03:38.459> simply<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.940> fact

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
not cover last time was simply the fact

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.600 
not cover last time was simply the fact
of<00:03:39.329> how<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.750> open<00:03:40.350> these<00:03:40.530> files<00:03:40.590> like<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.549> said

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
of how to open these files like I said

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.949 
of how to open these files like I said
it<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:41.910> important<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.360> keep<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.630> mind<00:03:42.690> these

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
it is important to keep in mind these

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.050 
it is important to keep in mind these
are<00:03:43.019> not<00:03:43.290> video<00:03:43.739> files<00:03:44.130> these<00:03:44.670> are<00:03:44.820> game

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
are not video files these are game

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.720 
are not video files these are game
execution<00:03:45.660> files<00:03:46.049> so<00:03:46.590> these<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:47.130> no<00:03:47.370> video

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
execution files so these have no video

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.210 
execution files so these have no video
properties<00:03:48.060> in<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.959> themselves<00:03:49.220> there

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
properties in and of themselves there

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.560 
properties in and of themselves there
might<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.640> converter<00:03:50.970> out<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.329> in<00:03:51.420> fact

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
might be a converter out there in fact

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.880 
might be a converter out there in fact
I've<00:03:51.810> heard<00:03:52.049> there<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.350> converter<00:03:52.709> out

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
I've heard there is a converter out

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.520 
I've heard there is a converter out

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
how it works to be honest but it does

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.900 
how it works to be honest but it does
