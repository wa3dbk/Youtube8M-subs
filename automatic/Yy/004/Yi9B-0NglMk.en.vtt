traveling bit sort of cooked cards no se
passe<00:02:44.220> yeah<00:02:45.220> there's<00:02:45.490> there's<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.880> little

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
passe yeah there's there's a little

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.440 
passe yeah there's there's a little
lever<00:02:47.890> right<00:02:48.160> there<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:48.790> when<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.270> car

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
lever right there and so when the car

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.060 
lever right there and so when the car
comes<00:02:49.600> flying<00:02:49.930> by<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.140> opens<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.620> up<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:50.950> then

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
comes flying by it opens it up and then

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.460 
comes flying by it opens it up and then
it<00:02:51.220> keeps<00:02:51.430> spinning<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.810> basically<00:02:53.110> runs

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
it keeps spinning and it basically runs

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.890 
it keeps spinning and it basically runs
itself<00:02:53.740> down<00:02:54.160> but<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.850> said<00:02:54.880> we<00:02:55.240> could<00:02:55.450> set

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
itself down but like I said we could set

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.570 
itself down but like I said we could set
this<00:02:56.020> up<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.350> different<00:02:56.650> configurations<00:02:56.800> we

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
this up in different configurations we

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.090 
this up in different configurations we
didn't<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.900> loop<00:02:59.590> Duluth<00:02:59.890> air

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
didn't have to have the loop Duluth air

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.530 
didn't have to have the loop Duluth air
we<00:03:00.520> could<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.850> done<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.000> all<00:03:01.180> different<00:03:01.450> ways

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
we could have done it all different ways

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.590 
we could have done it all different ways
and<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.470> more<00:03:02.620> sets<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:03.340> then<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
and the more sets that you have then the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.630 
and the more sets that you have then the
different<00:03:05.040> ways<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.370> set<00:03:06.550> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
different ways that you can set the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.730 
different ways that you can set the
track<00:03:06.820> up<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.750> can<00:03:07.930> connect<00:03:08.290> them<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.590> mix

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
track up you can connect them and mix

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.250 
track up you can connect them and mix
and<00:03:08.920> match<00:03:09.070> them<00:03:10.290> anything<00:03:11.290> else<00:03:11.530> no<00:03:11.620> thanks

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
and match them anything else no thanks

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.570 
and match them anything else no thanks
