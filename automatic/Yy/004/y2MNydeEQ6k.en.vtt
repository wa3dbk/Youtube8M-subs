00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
one thing I want to just let you guys

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
know of right now this control freaks

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
know of right now this control freaks
are<00:01:11.849> very<00:01:12.030> important<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.479> use<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.899> don't<00:01:13.080> have

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
are very important to use you don't have

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.139 
are very important to use you don't have
to<00:01:13.860> use<00:01:14.039> and<00:01:14.280> per<00:01:14.399> se<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.849> they're<00:01:15.119> very

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
to use and per se but they're very

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.880 
to use and per se but they're very
useful<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.899> as<00:01:16.349> you<00:01:16.440> can<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.709> have<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
useful and as you can see I have a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.400 
useful and as you can see I have a
control<00:01:17.220> freak<00:01:17.429> right<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> have

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
control freak right here and then I have

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.130 
control freak right here and then I have
a<00:01:19.440> regular<00:01:20.090> joystick<00:01:21.090> right<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.539> and<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
a regular joystick right here and the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.300 
a regular joystick right here and the
reasoning<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.679> is<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.099> is

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
reasoning for that is because this is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.740 
reasoning for that is because this is
the<00:01:23.459> joystick<00:01:23.910> you'll<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.179> aim<00:01:24.509> with

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the joystick you'll actually aim with

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.770 
the joystick you'll actually aim with
and<00:01:25.069> so<00:01:26.069> as<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.459> see<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.149> look<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.539> in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and so as you can see if you look at in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.540 
and so as you can see if you look at in
that<00:01:27.990> perspective<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:28.800> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.039> that<00:01:29.069> my

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that perspective you can see that my

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.940 
that perspective you can see that my
control<00:01:30.209> freak<00:01:30.420> joystick<00:01:31.319> is<00:01:31.440> obviously<00:01:31.740> like

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
control freak joystick is obviously like

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.490 
control freak joystick is obviously like
twice<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> length<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.720> helps<00:01:34.050> me<00:01:34.200> aim<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
twice the length and that helps me aim a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.499 
twice the length and that helps me aim a
lot<00:01:34.709> better<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:35.819> I'm<00:01:35.970> holding<00:01:36.330> my

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
lot better because when I'm holding my

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.139 
lot better because when I'm holding my
controller<00:01:37.280> I'll<00:01:38.280> kind<00:01:38.489> of<00:01:38.550> put<00:01:38.940> into<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
controller I'll kind of put into this

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.089 
controller I'll kind of put into this
kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> perspective<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.679> I'm<00:01:40.770> aiming

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:41.099 
kind of perspective and when I'm aiming

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:43.070 
kind of perspective and when I'm aiming
I'm<00:01:41.220> kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.819> aiming<00:01:42.239> like<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
I'm kind of aiming like that and

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.550 
I'm kind of aiming like that and
whenever<00:01:43.739> I<00:01:43.920> move<00:01:44.660> my<00:01:45.660> joystick<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.349> I<00:01:46.410> move

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
whenever I move my joystick when I move

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.650 
whenever I move my joystick when I move
it<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.709> little<00:01:46.739> bit<00:01:47.099> it's<00:01:47.789> more<00:01:47.970> precise<00:01:48.450> as

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
it a little bit it's more precise as

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.910 
it a little bit it's more precise as
what<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:48.840> trying<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.140> pretty<00:01:49.349> basic<00:01:49.560> alee<00:01:49.739> get

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
what I'm trying to pretty basic alee get

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.589 
what I'm trying to pretty basic alee get
out<00:01:50.039> it's<00:01:50.459> more<00:01:50.640> precise<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.239> you'll<00:01:51.360> need<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
out it's more precise and you'll need to

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.089 
out it's more precise and you'll need to
be<00:01:51.690> more<00:01:51.840> precise<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.530> joystick<00:01:52.709> at

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
be more precise with this joystick at

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.580 
be more precise with this joystick at
all<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.789> that's<00:01:53.940> one<00:01:54.119> thing<00:01:54.300> but<00:01:54.539> one<00:01:55.170> thing<00:01:55.440> if

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
all so that's one thing but one thing if

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.199 
all so that's one thing but one thing if
you<00:01:55.739> want<00:01:56.039> if<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.250> take<00:01:56.819> call<00:01:57.030> duty

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
you want if you take call duty

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:58.580 
you want if you take call duty
relatively<00:01:57.720> seriously<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.259> want<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
relatively seriously and you want to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.010 
relatively seriously and you want to
really<00:01:58.830> get<00:01:59.580> better<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.090> great<00:02:00.569> thing<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
really get better a great thing to do is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
really get better a great thing to do is
purchase<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.590> scuf<00:02:01.830> controller<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.550> is

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
purchase the scuf controller this is

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.430 
purchase the scuf controller this is
what<00:02:02.789> i<00:02:02.849> use<00:02:02.879> right<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.259> need<00:02:04.379> a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
what i use right here you don't need a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.050 
what i use right here you don't need a
scuf<00:02:04.709> controller<00:02:05.129> a<00:02:05.190> lot<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.429> pros<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.910> not

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
scuf controller a lot of pros do not

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
scuf controller a lot of pros do not
even<00:02:06.209> use<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.599> scuf<00:02:06.840> controller<00:02:07.289> well<00:02:07.500> most

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
even use the scuf controller well most

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.249 
even use the scuf controller well most
of<00:02:08.190> them<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.580> probably<00:02:09.360> I'd<00:02:09.599> say<00:02:09.629> ninety

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
of them do probably I'd say ninety

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.620 
of them do probably I'd say ninety
percent<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.590> them<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.039> some<00:02:11.450> even<00:02:12.450> don't

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
percent of them do and some even don't

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.790 
percent of them do and some even don't
even<00:02:12.660> use<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.020> powell<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.620> basically

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
even use the powell so it's basically

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
even use the powell so it's basically
not<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> skull<00:02:14.490> but<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> scuff<00:02:15.360> is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
not a skull but this is what a scuff is

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.240 
not a skull but this is what a scuff is
right<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.590> pals<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.040> back

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
right here you can see pals in the back

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.730 
right here you can see pals in the back
and<00:02:17.760> basically<00:02:17.940> when<00:02:18.330> you're<00:02:18.420> holding

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
and basically when you're holding

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.140 
and basically when you're holding
control<00:02:19.130> you're<00:02:19.280> holding<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:19.850> like<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.120> am

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
control you're holding it just like I am

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.270 
control you're holding it just like I am
right<00:02:20.270> now<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.710> can<00:02:21.800> see<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.010> my<00:02:22.220> two

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
right now and you can see that my two

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.490 
right now and you can see that my two
middle<00:02:22.580> fingers<00:02:22.670> here<00:02:23.150> are<00:02:23.300> on<00:02:23.810> paddle<00:02:24.230> so

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
middle fingers here are on paddle so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.860 
middle fingers here are on paddle so
instead<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.640> people<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.030> some<00:02:26.450> without

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
instead of what people are some without

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.140 
instead of what people are some without
ass<00:02:27.020> cuffs<00:02:27.230> due<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.530> jump<00:02:27.710> shot<00:02:28.000> what<00:02:29.000> they<00:02:29.090> do

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
ass cuffs due to jump shot what they do

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.360 
ass cuffs due to jump shot what they do
right<00:02:29.300> here<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.930> it'll<00:02:30.710> hold<00:02:30.890> their<00:02:31.070> control

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
right here is it'll hold their control

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.100 
right here is it'll hold their control
like<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.000> whenever<00:02:32.480> they<00:02:32.720> go<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.870> jump

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
like this and whenever they go to jump

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.260 
like this and whenever they go to jump
shot<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:33.440> have<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.820> when<00:02:35.150> their

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
shot they have to do this so when their

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.400 
shot they have to do this so when their
jump<00:02:35.510> shot<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.840> you're<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.080> middle<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.320> a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
jump shot and you're in the middle of a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.080 
jump shot and you're in the middle of a
gunfight<00:02:36.800> they<00:02:37.310> cannot<00:02:37.580> end<00:02:37.790> with<00:02:37.940> this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
gunfight they cannot end with this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.520 
gunfight they cannot end with this
anymore<00:02:38.510> they<00:02:38.810> could<00:02:38.960> have<00:02:38.990> they<00:02:39.320> have<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
anymore they could have they have to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.470 
anymore they could have they have to
take<00:02:39.680> three<00:02:39.980> thing<00:02:40.190> off<00:02:40.340> click<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.240> then<00:02:41.300> go

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
take three thing off click and then go

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.630 
take three thing off click and then go
back<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.500> always<00:02:42.740> notice<00:02:43.070> when<00:02:43.340> people

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
back and you always notice when people

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.490 
back and you always notice when people
sometimes<00:02:44.330> choke<00:02:44.720> going<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> fight<00:02:45.290> because

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
sometimes choke going to fight because

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.320 
sometimes choke going to fight because
of<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:45.920> you'll<00:02:46.370> always<00:02:46.640> notice<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> but

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
of that you'll always notice that but

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.840 
of that you'll always notice that but
with<00:02:47.510> when<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.710> have<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.890> scuff<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.460> can<00:02:49.700> see

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
with when you have a scuff you can see

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.040 
with when you have a scuff you can see
it's<00:02:49.970> lined<00:02:50.120> up<00:02:50.180> like<00:02:50.270> this<00:02:50.450> instead<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.960> doing

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
it's lined up like this instead of doing

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.680 
it's lined up like this instead of doing
that<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:52.370> just<00:02:52.580> take<00:02:52.730> my<00:02:53.240> middle<00:02:53.480> finger

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
that you just take my middle finger

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.900 
that you just take my middle finger
right<00:02:53.780> here<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.740> click<00:02:55.010> boom<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.730> you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
right here and just click boom and you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.810 
right here and just click boom and you
just<00:02:56.300> work<00:02:56.720> on<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.430> that's<00:02:58.430> one<00:02:58.610> big<00:02:58.790> thing

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820
