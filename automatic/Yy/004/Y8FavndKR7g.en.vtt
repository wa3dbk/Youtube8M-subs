at a scan this one is designed

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
at a scan this one is designed
specifically<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.439> zoom<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:29.340> their

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
specifically for the zoom on their

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
specifically for the zoom on their
website<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.420> know<00:00:30.539> what<00:00:30.750> specific

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
website I don't know what specific

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.060 
website I don't know what specific
differences<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> does<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> zoom<00:00:33.270> but

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
differences it does for the zoom but

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
differences it does for the zoom but
since<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> zoom<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.690> got

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
since I have a zoom and it can and I got

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
since I have a zoom and it can and I got
this<00:00:37.110> specific<00:00:37.680> cable<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> also

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
this specific cable for it you can also

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.389 
this specific cable for it you can also
get<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.110> cable<00:00:40.649> without<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> headphone

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
get this cable without the headphone

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.810 
get this cable without the headphone
monitoring<00:00:41.820> jack<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.629> highly<00:00:43.170> highly

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
monitoring jack but I highly highly

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.170 
monitoring jack but I highly highly
recommend<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> audio<00:00:47.850> level

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
recommend it because the audio level

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
recommend it because the audio level
that<00:00:48.270> you're<00:00:48.420> recording<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.579> different

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that you're recording here is different

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
that you're recording here is different
than<00:00:50.969> what's<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.899> out<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.500> into<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
than what's going out and into the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
than what's going out and into the
camera<00:00:55.250> because<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.789> monitoring<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
camera because this is monitoring by the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.360 
camera because this is monitoring by the
volume<00:00:58.170> control<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> recording

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
volume control and not the recording

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.389 
volume control and not the recording
levels<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> monitor<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
levels so you will have to monitor the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.750 
levels so you will have to monitor the
audio<00:01:02.989> levels<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.379> camera<00:01:04.710> itself<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.280> on

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
audio levels on the camera itself and on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.070 
audio levels on the camera itself and on
the<00:01:05.820> zoom<00:01:06.210> h4n<00:01:06.360> separately<00:01:08.840> right<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:09.990> I'm

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the zoom h4n separately right now I'm

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.710 
the zoom h4n separately right now I'm
recording<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.060> rode<00:01:12.060> videomic<00:01:12.479> pro

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
recording with the rode videomic pro

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
recording with the rode videomic pro
directly<00:01:13.650> into<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.159> camera<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:15.090> too<00:01:15.360> pleased

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
directly into the camera not too pleased

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.730 
directly into the camera not too pleased
with<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> quality<00:01:17.270> even<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> backup<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
with the quality even as a backup so I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.660 
with the quality even as a backup so I
was<00:01:20.130> looking<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:22.310> make<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:23.430> life<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
was looking at a way to make my life a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
was looking at a way to make my life a
little<00:01:23.790> easier<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.420> record<00:01:25.049> audio<00:01:25.380> directly

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
little easier and record audio directly

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.550 
little easier and record audio directly
to<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> video<00:01:26.729> files<00:01:27.119> instead<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.869> doing<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to the video files instead of doing the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.950 
to the video files instead of doing the
synchronizing<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.250> post<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.840> other

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
synchronizing in post and the other

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.060 
synchronizing in post and the other
thing<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.590> gives<00:01:31.799> me<00:01:31.979> an

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
thing that this is this gives me an

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.300 
thing that this is this gives me an
additional<00:01:32.280> backup<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.229> audio<00:01:34.860> files

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
additional backup I have my audio files

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.210 
additional backup I have my audio files
here<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> audio<00:01:37.590> file<00:01:37.890> that's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
here and then the audio file that's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.060 
here and then the audio file that's
attached<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.060> video<00:01:39.420> file<00:01:39.770> for<00:01:40.770> me<00:01:40.890> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
attached to the video file for me so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.560 
attached to the video file for me so
what<00:01:41.189> we'll<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.670> we'll<00:01:42.030> plug<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
what we'll do now is we'll plug this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.429 
what we'll do now is we'll plug this
into<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:44.119> mic<00:01:45.119> input<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> camera

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
into the mic input on the camera

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.819 
into the mic input on the camera
unplug<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.189> rode<00:01:47.579> videomic<00:01:47.939> pro<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
unplug the rode videomic pro and this is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.429 
unplug the rode videomic pro and this is
going<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.899> rode<00:01:52.890> ntg-3<00:01:53.880> boom<00:01:54.119> mic

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
going out to a rode ntg-3 boom mic

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.160 
going out to a rode ntg-3 boom mic
that's<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> usually<00:01:55.799> use

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
that's what I usually use

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.240 
that's what I usually use
obviously<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.500> quality<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.860> lot<00:01:59.009> better

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
obviously like that quality a lot better

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.760 
obviously like that quality a lot better
than<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> rode<00:01:59.790> videomic<00:02:00.119> pro<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.439> let's<00:02:01.590> test

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
than the rode videomic pro so let's test

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.440 
than the rode videomic pro so let's test
it<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:03.500> okay<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it out okay as you can see here the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.920 
it out okay as you can see here the
audio<00:02:06.780> should<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> little<00:02:08.190> different

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
audio should be a little different

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.300 
audio should be a little different
this<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.170> recording<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:14.110> ntg-3<00:02:15.140> road<00:02:15.650> mic

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
this is recording to the ntg-3 road mic

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.750 
this is recording to the ntg-3 road mic
instead<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.390> rode<00:02:17.870> videomic<00:02:18.470> pro<00:02:21.579> this<00:02:22.579> is

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
instead of the rode videomic pro this is

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.619 
instead of the rode videomic pro this is
recording<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.650> SD<00:02:25.189> card<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.060> then

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
recording to the SD card here and then

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.960

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
to do anything differently but I will

thing<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.190> keep<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.459> mind<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.150> said

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
thing to keep in mind like I said

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.440 
thing to keep in mind like I said
earlier<00:03:05.690> is<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.379> levels<00:03:06.799> are<00:03:07.069> different

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
earlier is that the levels are different

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.379 
earlier is that the levels are different
this<00:03:08.450> level<00:03:08.780> here<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.459> recording<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> SD

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
this level here is recording to the SD

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.319 
this level here is recording to the SD
card<00:03:11.629> but<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.290> audio<00:03:13.099> level<00:03:13.370> coming<00:03:13.400> out<00:03:13.819> will

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
card but the audio level coming out will

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.050 
card but the audio level coming out will
be<00:03:14.359> different<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:16.310> adjust<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:16.730> through

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
be different and you adjust that through

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.119 
be different and you adjust that through
the<00:03:17.180> volume<00:03:17.569> as<00:03:17.780> opposed<00:03:18.109> to<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.560> recording

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
the volume as opposed to the recording

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.319 
the volume as opposed to the recording
level<00:03:20.349> so<00:03:21.349> you'll<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.709> monitor<00:03:22.099> that<00:03:22.329> on

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
level so you'll have to monitor that on

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.920 
level so you'll have to monitor that on
the<00:03:23.540> camera<00:03:23.870> itself<00:03:25.510> separately<00:03:26.510> hopefully

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the camera itself separately hopefully

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.050 
the camera itself separately hopefully
your<00:03:27.079> camera<00:03:27.500> has<00:03:27.650> been<00:03:27.680> upgraded<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.549> monitor

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
your camera has been upgraded to monitor

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.750 
your camera has been upgraded to monitor
audio<00:03:29.209> levels<00:03:29.859> so<00:03:30.859> let<00:03:31.370> me<00:03:31.459> know<00:03:31.549> what<00:03:31.669> you
