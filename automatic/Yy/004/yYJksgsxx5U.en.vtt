00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.719 
if you wanted to do the dried
cranberries<00:04:29.289> I'd<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.590> fine<00:04:33.870> what's<00:04:34.870> your<00:04:35.729> I

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
cranberries I'd be fine what's your I

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.730 
cranberries I'd be fine what's your I
think<00:04:37.240> you'd<00:04:37.360> probably<00:04:37.389> probably<00:04:38.319> put<00:04:38.650> them

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
think you'd probably probably put them

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.740 
think you'd probably probably put them
in<00:04:38.949> maybe<00:04:39.220> if<00:04:39.819> you<00:04:39.940> wanted<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.240> mix<00:04:40.389> them<00:04:40.569> with

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
in maybe if you wanted to mix them with

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.659 
in maybe if you wanted to mix them with
the<00:04:42.780> yeah<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:44.110> apple<00:04:44.830> pie<00:04:45.009> filling<00:04:45.069> so<00:04:45.550> they

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
the yeah the apple pie filling so they

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.520 
the yeah the apple pie filling so they
have<00:04:45.819> a<00:04:45.849> little<00:04:46.210> covering<00:04:46.750> because<00:04:47.259> whenever

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
have a little covering because whenever

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.219 
have a little covering because whenever
you<00:04:47.860> bake<00:04:48.039> with<00:04:48.699> raisins<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.780> know<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.020> ones

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
you bake with raisins you know the ones

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.420 
you bake with raisins you know the ones
that<00:04:50.409> are<00:04:50.500> especially<00:04:50.800> if<00:04:51.039> you're<00:04:51.129> doing<00:04:51.340> like

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
that are especially if you're doing like

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.589 
that are especially if you're doing like
a<00:04:51.870> raisin<00:04:52.870> muffin<00:04:53.680> or<00:04:54.099> you<00:04:54.940> know<00:04:55.030> some<00:04:55.389> kind<00:04:55.569> of

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
a raisin muffin or you know some kind of

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.149 
a raisin muffin or you know some kind of
bread<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:55.810> want<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.080> push<00:04:56.229> those<00:04:56.469> raisins<00:04:56.949> in

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
bread you want to push those raisins in

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.070 
bread you want to push those raisins in
so<00:04:57.370> they<00:04:57.520> don't<00:04:57.699> they're<00:04:58.240> not<00:04:58.270> blackened<00:04:58.930> so<00:04:59.050> I

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
so they don't they're not blackened so I

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.570 
so they don't they're not blackened so I
think<00:04:59.349> if<00:04:59.409> you<00:04:59.500> mix<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.889> raisins<00:05:00.310> or<00:05:00.490> the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
think if you mix the raisins or the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.580 
think if you mix the raisins or the
cranberries<00:05:01.060> with<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.569> the<00:05:02.050> pie<00:05:02.259> filling

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
cranberries with the the pie filling

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.689 
cranberries with the the pie filling
that<00:05:02.680> would<00:05:02.830> give<00:05:02.949> them<00:05:03.099> a<00:05:03.190> little<00:05:03.340> bit<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.610> a

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
that would give them a little bit of a

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.159 
that would give them a little bit of a
coating<00:05:06.090> sound<00:05:07.090> good<00:05:07.300> okay<00:05:07.840> we're<00:05:07.990> going<00:05:08.080> to
