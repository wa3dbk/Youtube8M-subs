joist over and the pipe which is working
out<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.699> diameter<00:00:41.179> will<00:00:41.390> run<00:00:41.660> through<00:00:41.899> into

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
out that diameter will run through into

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.240 
out that diameter will run through into
the<00:00:42.289> next<00:00:42.530> run<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:42.739> then<00:00:42.829> we'll<00:00:42.980> have<00:00:43.039> another

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
the next run and then we'll have another

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.040 
the next run and then we'll have another
thing<00:00:43.429> another<00:00:43.850> notch<00:00:44.149> out<00:00:44.359> and<00:00:44.719> run<00:00:44.899> through

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
thing another notch out and run through

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.419 
thing another notch out and run through
an<00:00:45.170> another<00:00:45.379> loop<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.829> then<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:45.949> notch<00:00:46.160> or<00:00:46.309> that

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
an another loop and then a notch or that

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.090 
an another loop and then a notch or that
way<00:00:46.929> every<00:00:47.929> square<00:00:48.140> foot<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.440> floor<00:00:48.589> has<00:00:48.920> a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
way every square foot to the floor has a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.889 
way every square foot to the floor has a
bit<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.460> pipe<00:00:49.640> underneath<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.179> and<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.449> heat

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
bit of pipe underneath it and the heat

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.869 
bit of pipe underneath it and the heat
will<00:00:50.929> be<00:00:51.079> evenly<00:00:51.379> spread<00:00:51.710> theoretically<00:00:52.460> so

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
will be evenly spread theoretically so

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.270 
will be evenly spread theoretically so

finished article here so this is a
mixture<00:01:04.370> of<00:01:04.460> sand<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:04.909> cement<00:01:05.120> which<00:01:06.079> is<00:01:06.259> 30

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
mixture of sand and cement which is 30

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.940 
mixture of sand and cement which is 30
mil<00:01:06.920> deep<00:01:07.159> that's<00:01:07.520> three<00:01:07.700> centimeters<00:01:08.950> inside

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
mil deep that's three centimeters inside

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.980 
mil deep that's three centimeters inside
are<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.369> plastic<00:01:11.149> pipes<00:01:11.509> which<00:01:11.750> have<00:01:11.899> an

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
are the plastic pipes which have an

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.080 
are the plastic pipes which have an
aluminium<00:01:12.170> core<00:01:12.890> which<00:01:13.610> eggs<00:01:13.790> are<00:01:13.909> very

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
aluminium core which eggs are very

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.420 
aluminium core which eggs are very
strong<00:01:14.380> through<00:01:15.380> which<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.829> hot<00:01:16.009> Wars<00:01:16.189> runs

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
strong through which the hot Wars runs

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.580 
strong through which the hot Wars runs
and<00:01:16.790> it's<00:01:16.969> very<00:01:17.180> complicated<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.930> me<00:01:18.049> that's<00:01:18.409> a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
and it's very complicated to me that's a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.200 
and it's very complicated to me that's a
pump<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.219> pushes<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.579> water<00:01:19.610> around<00:01:19.939> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
pump and it pushes the water around the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.340 
pump and it pushes the water around the
floor<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.659> great<00:01:20.930> thing<00:01:20.960> about<00:01:21.140> these

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
floor but the great thing about these

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.819 
floor but the great thing about these
manifolds<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.520> can<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.570> can<00:01:23.810> adjust<00:01:24.259> them

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
manifolds is you can you can adjust them

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.670 
manifolds is you can you can adjust them
so<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.219> different<00:01:25.640> areas<00:01:25.759> of<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.240> room

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
so the different areas of the room

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.630 
so the different areas of the room
receive<00:01:27.680> heat<00:01:27.829> at<00:01:27.979> different<00:01:28.250> times<00:01:28.369> now<00:01:28.490> this

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
receive heat at different times now this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.429 
receive heat at different times now this
is<00:01:28.759> an<00:01:28.880> open<00:01:29.180> panel<00:01:29.570> room<00:01:29.719> it'll<00:01:29.930> be<00:01:30.049> my<00:01:30.170> living

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
is an open panel room it'll be my living

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.889 
is an open panel room it'll be my living
room<00:01:30.469> so<00:01:30.979> we<00:01:31.670> don't<00:01:31.850> need<00:01:32.090> different<00:01:32.360> areas<00:01:32.780> to

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
room so we don't need different areas to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.660 
room so we don't need different areas to
be<00:01:32.990> Easter<00:01:33.320> today<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.100> car<00:01:34.310> from<00:01:34.490> an

that night I do of this of this silence
meant<00:01:52.250> here<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.609> that<00:01:52.840> it's<00:01:53.840> an<00:01:54.200> insulation

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
meant here is that it's an insulation

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.410 
meant here is that it's an insulation
layer<00:01:54.859> in<00:01:55.100> itself<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.939> very<00:01:56.119> strong<00:01:56.390> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
layer in itself is it very strong and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.999 
layer in itself is it very strong and
very<00:01:56.539> unfortunate<00:01:56.960> when<00:01:57.320> walking<00:01:57.530> on<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.890> on

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
very unfortunate when walking on it on

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.830 
very unfortunate when walking on it on
top<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.250> us<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.490> course<00:01:58.579> we'll<00:01:58.759> go<00:01:58.880> my<00:01:59.060> solid

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
top of us of course we'll go my solid

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.010 
top of us of course we'll go my solid
wood<00:02:00.020> floor<00:02:00.429> but<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.460> heat<00:02:01.759> is<00:02:01.969> is<00:02:02.329> is<00:02:02.719> is

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
wood floor but the heat is is is is

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.959 
wood floor but the heat is is is is
spread<00:02:03.469> evenly<00:02:03.649> through<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.250> mixture<00:02:04.700> right

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
spread evenly through the mixture right

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.389 
spread evenly through the mixture right
and<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.780> retains<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.380> heat<00:02:06.409> as<00:02:06.649> well<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:07.070> that

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
and it retains the heat as well and that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.040 
and it retains the heat as well and that
of<00:02:07.490> course<00:02:07.520> comes<00:02:07.880> up<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:08.240> into<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.630> item<00:02:08.990> to

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
of course comes up then into the item to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.830 
of course comes up then into the item to
the<00:02:09.110> one<00:02:09.259> point<00:02:09.500> below<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:11.660> the

the one point below is the is the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.100 
the one point below is the is the
the<00:02:13.290> foam<00:02:13.590> layer<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.099> has<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:15.110> look

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the foam layer that has a look

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.100 
the foam layer that has a look
polystyrene<00:02:16.920> yes<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:18.300> like<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.900> layer

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
polystyrene yes it's like that the layer

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.050 
polystyrene yes it's like that the layer
on<00:02:19.260> top<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.769> foil<00:02:20.160> yes<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.910> that

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
on top is like a foil yes and that

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.970 
on top is like a foil yes and that
reflects<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.480> reflects<00:02:22.170> any<00:02:22.290> backup<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.830> all

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
reflects that reflects any backup so all

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.070 
reflects that reflects any backup so all
the<00:02:23.099> heat<00:02:23.220> comes<00:02:23.459> up<00:02:23.640> great<00:02:24.090> all<00:02:24.959> right

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
the heat comes up great all right

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.630 
the heat comes up great all right
there's<00:02:25.500> gonna<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.709> hanging<00:02:26.040> here<00:02:26.250> yes

pipes<00:02:38.400> these<00:02:38.970> qualified<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.690> basically

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
pipes these qualified so basically

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.800 
pipes these qualified so basically
plastic<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.099> an<00:02:41.190> aluminium<00:02:41.340> layer<00:02:42.330> inside

of a plastic bin aluminium then casting

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.690 
of a plastic bin aluminium then casting
this<00:02:45.329> stops<00:02:45.599> absorption<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.380> oxygen<00:02:47.130> into<00:02:47.579> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
into the central heating water which

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.500 
into the central heating water which
would<00:02:50.519> happen<00:02:50.790> if<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.000> was<00:02:51.090> no<00:02:51.209> aluminium

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
would happen if there was no aluminium

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.150 
would happen if there was no aluminium

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
feel just plastic pipes and that leads

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.670 
feel just plastic pipes and that leads
to<00:02:53.220> bubbles<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.750> central<00:02:55.319> heating<00:02:55.590> water

to bubbles in the central heating water
and<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.069> why<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.549> bleed<00:02:56.730> your

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and that's why you have to bleed your

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.190 
and that's why you have to bleed your
radiators<00:02:57.360> from<00:02:57.510> time<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> time<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.049> the

radiators from time to time in the
conventional<00:02:58.650> system<00:02:59.040> great<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> should

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
conventional system great you should

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.339 
conventional system great you should
have<00:02:59.549> your<00:02:59.670> radiators<00:03:00.209> anyone<00:03:00.660> well<00:03:01.079> well

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
have your radiators anyone well well

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.960 
have your radiators anyone well well
exactly<00:03:01.620> out<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:02.129> you'd<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.519> bleed<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
exactly out but you'd have to bleed the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
exactly out but you'd have to bleed the
sort<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.269> top<00:03:03.420> floor<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.989> central<00:03:04.470> et

neutral base units they look as if

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.990 
neutral base units they look as if
they're<00:03:27.840> plastic<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.410> actually<00:03:28.829> would<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
they're plastic but actually would and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.129 
they're plastic but actually would and
they're<00:03:30.239> made<00:03:30.389> from<00:03:30.540> wood<00:03:30.930> from<00:03:31.049> a

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
they're made from wood from a

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.199 
they're made from wood from a
sustainable<00:03:31.590> forest<00:03:31.889> that<00:03:32.190> triple<00:03:32.700> glazed<00:03:32.910> so

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
sustainable forest that triple glazed so

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.660 
sustainable forest that triple glazed so
you've<00:03:33.359> got<00:03:33.650> two<00:03:34.650> air<00:03:34.829> pockets<00:03:35.250> between<00:03:35.549> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
you've got two air pockets between the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.949 
you've got two air pockets between the
three<00:03:35.849> panes<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.239> glass<00:03:36.299> which<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
three panes of glass which is like a

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.349 
three panes of glass which is like a
double<00:03:37.410> thermos<00:03:37.799> fast<00:03:37.980> yes<00:03:38.459> now<00:03:39.090> and

double thermos fast yes now and

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.659 
double thermos fast yes now and
interestingly<00:03:39.810> enough<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.040> effect<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.489> these

interestingly enough the effect of these

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.780 
interestingly enough the effect of these
windows<00:03:42.389> +<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.109> is<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.470> wood<00:03:43.709> fiber<00:03:44.010> if<00:03:44.609> you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
windows + this is the wood fiber if you

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.909 
windows + this is the wood fiber if you
film<00:03:45.030> board<00:03:45.239> which<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.630> 50<00:03:46.260> mil<00:03:46.440> thick<00:03:46.709> there

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
film board which is 50 mil thick there

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.430

heat transfer from outside and inside to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.960 
heat transfer from outside and inside to
outside<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.560> it's<00:03:52.709> very<00:03:53.069> very<00:03:53.190> cool<00:03:53.579> yeah<00:03:53.819> and

more importantly you'd like to also see

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.440 
more importantly you'd like to also see
a<00:03:55.650> brief<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:55.980> out<00:03:56.099> there<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.700> frosty<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.329> in

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
a brief it out there so frosty and in

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.780 
a brief it out there so frosty and in
here<00:03:57.630> how<00:03:57.930> do<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.169> feel<00:03:58.349> like<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.859> like<00:03:59.669> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
here how do I feel like it's like the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.089 
here how do I feel like it's like the
heat<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.209> staying<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.690> but<00:04:00.959> also<00:04:01.109> it<00:04:01.560> feels

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
heat is staying in but also it feels

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.309 
heat is staying in but also it feels
very<00:04:02.160> soundproofed<00:04:03.060> as<00:04:03.239> well<00:04:03.419> like<00:04:03.599> very<00:04:04.200> much

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
very soundproofed as well like very much

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.960 
very soundproofed as well like very much
so<00:04:04.530> we'll<00:04:04.680> know<00:04:04.889> echoing<00:04:05.250> like<00:04:05.489> they<00:04:05.639> do<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:05.819> a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
so we'll know echoing like they do on a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.460 
so we'll know echoing like they do on a
regular<00:04:06.329> building<00:04:06.870> sites<00:04:07.109> that<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.440> builders

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
regular building sites that the builders

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.710 
regular building sites that the builders
now<00:04:07.980> when<00:04:08.190> they<00:04:08.280> come<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.880> they<00:04:09.450> turn

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
now when they come in and they turn

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.690 
now when they come in and they turn
bigger<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.109> 6<00:04:10.500> sort<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:10.859> builders<00:04:11.130> lights<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.549> so

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
bigger I 6 sort of builders lights on so

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.530 
bigger I 6 sort of builders lights on so
you<00:04:11.790> can<00:04:11.819> see<00:04:11.970> what<00:04:12.060> they're<00:04:12.209> doing<00:04:12.510> here

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
often you turn on your heating our day

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.460 
often you turn on your heating our day
like<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.120> or<00:04:30.330> how<00:04:30.480> high<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.750> have<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.290> turn

like this or how high you have to turn

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.710 
like this or how high you have to turn
it<00:04:31.620> without<00:04:31.830> really<00:04:32.310> needing<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.910> what<00:04:33.270> the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
it without really needing to what the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.880 
it without really needing to what the
way<00:04:33.840> we'll<00:04:34.050> be<00:04:34.080> able<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.320> sort<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.530> measure<00:04:34.710> it

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
way we'll be able to sort of measure it

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.920 
way we'll be able to sort of measure it
is<00:04:35.010> just<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.400> see<00:04:35.580> how<00:04:35.910> much<00:04:36.090> gas<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.510> boilers

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
is just to see how much gas the boilers

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.510 
is just to see how much gas the boilers
use<00:04:37.170> because<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.740> all<00:04:37.830> these<00:04:37.920> insula<00:04:38.340> Tory

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
use because of all these insula Tory

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.100 
use because of all these insula Tory
measures<00:04:38.790> were<00:04:38.940> using<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.630> temperatures

you've<00:05:06.120> got<00:05:06.300> what<00:05:06.570> five<00:05:06.750> important<00:05:07.169> on<00:05:07.230> that

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
you've got what five important on that

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.930 
you've got what five important on that
side<00:05:07.590> but<00:05:07.710> you've<00:05:07.830> got<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:07.980> natural<00:05:08.790> wool

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
side but you've got the natural wool

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.670 
side but you've got the natural wool
insulation<00:05:09.240> here<00:05:09.780> well<00:05:09.960> actually<00:05:10.110> they<00:05:10.470> work

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
insulation here well actually they work

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.680 
insulation here well actually they work
just<00:05:10.710> as<00:05:11.070> well<00:05:11.100> welcome<00:05:11.910> we've<00:05:12.120> got<00:05:12.270> both<00:05:12.419> here

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
just as well welcome we've got both here

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.240 
just as well welcome we've got both here
actually<00:05:12.900> because<00:05:13.290> if<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.530> look<00:05:13.710> closely<00:05:14.010> you

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
actually because if you look closely you

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.100 
actually because if you look closely you
got<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.490> wood<00:05:14.640> fiber<00:05:14.880> panel<00:05:15.300> beneath<00:05:15.510> yes

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
got the wood fiber panel beneath yes

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.650 
got the wood fiber panel beneath yes
then<00:05:16.320> we've<00:05:16.440> got<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> lambs<00:05:16.980> wall<00:05:17.220> insulation

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
then we've got the lambs wall insulation

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.700 
then we've got the lambs wall insulation
then<00:05:18.660> you've<00:05:18.810> got<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.020> plasterboard<00:05:19.380> layer

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
then you've got the plasterboard layer

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.740 
then you've got the plasterboard layer
and<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:19.919> course<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.280> plaster<00:05:21.150> will<00:05:21.270> go<00:05:21.390> on<00:05:21.540> top

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
and of course the plaster will go on top

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.480 
and of course the plaster will go on top
yes<00:05:21.990> but<00:05:22.320> that<00:05:22.650> will<00:05:22.800> also<00:05:22.919> happen<00:05:23.160> on<00:05:23.370> that

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
yes but that will also happen on that

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.650 
yes but that will also happen on that
wall<00:05:23.640> it's<00:05:23.820> just<00:05:23.970> that<00:05:24.090> this<00:05:24.180> one's<00:05:24.390> for<00:05:24.510> other

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660

living spaces are you can put insulation
funnily<00:05:32.040> enough<00:05:32.040> this<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.550> why<00:05:32.790> on<00:05:33.090> the
