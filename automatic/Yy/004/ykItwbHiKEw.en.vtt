00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
in my opinion so far we've seen

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
in my opinion so far we've seen
government's<00:01:14.400> trying<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.270> restrict<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
interaction with this sort of ecosystem

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.090 
interaction with this sort of ecosystem
with<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> startup<00:01:18.390> ecosystem<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.680> two

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
with the startup ecosystem to two

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
with the startup ecosystem to two
aspects<00:01:20.610> funding<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.439> legislation<00:01:22.610> now<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
aspects funding and legislation now I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.010 
aspects funding and legislation now I
mean<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.220> Silicon<00:01:26.640> Oasis<00:01:27.090> they

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
mean we see this with Silicon Oasis they

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.360 
mean we see this with Silicon Oasis they
don't<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.570> laws<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.920> lost

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
tend to fit startups into a box which is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.950 
tend to fit startups into a box which is
counterproductive<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:38.460> innovation<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> means

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
counterproductive to innovation it means

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.510 
counterproductive to innovation it means
that<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.440> less<00:01:40.560> business<00:01:41.070> models<00:01:41.340> work

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that you have less business models work

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
that you have less business models work
with<00:01:41.760> it<00:01:41.909> means<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.630> frameworks

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
with it means we have more frameworks

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.430 
with it means we have more frameworks
that<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.979> deal<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.140> funding<00:01:46.140> I

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
that you have to deal with and funding I

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.230 
that you have to deal with and funding I
mean<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.100> has<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.700> positive<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
mean it has it's it's positive and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.300 
mean it has it's it's positive and
negative<00:01:48.630> side<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:48.990> government<00:01:49.770> funding

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
negative side I think government funding

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.820 
negative side I think government funding
of<00:01:50.490> startups<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:52.430> initiatives<00:01:53.430> like

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
of startups and of initiatives like

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.160 
of startups and of initiatives like
oasis500<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:56.640> Internet<00:01:57.450> city<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.750> Dubai<00:01:57.930> is

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
oasis500 and Internet city in Dubai is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530 
oasis500 and Internet city in Dubai is
very<00:01:58.590> important<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.090> should<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
very important but there should be a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.899 
very important but there should be a
push<00:02:00.869> towards<00:02:01.650> better<00:02:02.630> towards<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.900> know

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
push towards better towards you know

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.600 
push towards better towards you know
creating<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.210> ecosystem<00:02:06.420> where<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.080> have

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
creating an ecosystem where you have

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
creating an ecosystem where you have
creativity<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:09.269> they<00:02:09.539> main<00:02:09.810> factor<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
creativity are they main factor of it I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.890 
creativity are they main factor of it I
mean<00:02:10.769> this<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.489> very<00:02:11.599> important<00:02:12.599> in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
mean this is this is very important in

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.710 
mean this is this is very important in
London<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.040> think<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.670> happen<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
London and I think it can happen in the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.940 
London and I think it can happen in the
Middle<00:02:15.930> East<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.319> think<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.860> be

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
Middle East I think this can be

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.320 
Middle East I think this can be
transferred<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.459> leaf<00:02:17.819> because<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.209> have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
transferred to the leaf because we have

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.000 
transferred to the leaf because we have
a<00:02:18.360> lot<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> creative<00:02:19.019> people<00:02:19.409> we<00:02:19.590> are<00:02:19.709> yeah

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
a lot of creative people we are yeah

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.550 
a lot of creative people we are yeah
huge<00:02:20.909> human<00:02:21.330> capital<00:02:21.780> which<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.140> very

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
huge human capital which is very

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.890 
huge human capital which is very
intelligent
