what the past we were planning to work

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.390 
what the past we were planning to work
on<00:00:08.790> was<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.299> L<00:00:09.450> entries<00:00:09.889> for<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> starting

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
on was the L entries for the starting

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.419 
on was the L entries for the starting
area<00:00:11.520> for<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.879> for<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.300> humans<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
area for the for the humans and for that

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.570 
area for the for the humans and for that
particular<00:00:15.120> something<00:00:15.300> we<00:00:15.510> decided<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
particular something we decided to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.820 
particular something we decided to
overhaul<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.300> tree<00:00:18.509> style<00:00:18.840> but<00:00:19.349> I'd<00:00:19.410> also<00:00:19.560> try

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
overhaul the tree style but I'd also try

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.389 
overhaul the tree style but I'd also try
to<00:00:19.860> keep<00:00:20.099> it<00:00:20.250> into<00:00:20.700> the<00:00:21.470> original<00:00:22.470> country<00:00:23.070> so

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
to keep it into the original country so

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.420 
to keep it into the original country so
there's<00:00:23.880> not<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> big<00:00:24.470> contrast<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.800> players

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
there's not a big contrast some players

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.810 
there's not a big contrast some players
that<00:00:26.880> appreciate<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> old<00:00:27.720> world<00:00:27.989> can<00:00:28.259> still

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
that appreciate the old world can still

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.950 
that appreciate the old world can still
hop<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.270> feel<00:00:30.450> like<00:00:30.570> nothing's<00:00:30.899> changed

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
hop in and feel like nothing's changed

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.990 
hop in and feel like nothing's changed
but<00:00:31.380> something<00:00:31.680> looks<00:00:31.829> nicer<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.850> don't

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
but something looks nicer and they don't

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.690 
but something looks nicer and they don't
know<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.190 

one<00:00:42.700> of<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.880> most<00:00:43.059> difficult<00:00:43.300> parts<00:00:43.870> of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
one of the most difficult parts of

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.780 
one of the most difficult parts of
making<00:00:44.440> any<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.980> these<00:00:45.100> zones<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
making any of these zones is the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.630 
making any of these zones is the
lighting<00:00:46.300> it's<00:00:46.870> very<00:00:47.230> hard<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.710> do<00:00:47.949> I<00:00:48.129> had<00:00:48.520> to

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
lighting it's very hard to do I had to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.549 
lighting it's very hard to do I had to
light<00:00:48.850> everything<00:00:49.239> with<00:00:49.570> this<00:00:49.750> light<00:00:50.110> spirits

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
light everything with this light spirits

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.830 
light everything with this light spirits
that<00:00:50.680> were<00:00:50.879> difficult<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.000> move<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.449> hard<00:00:52.660> to

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
that were difficult to move and hard to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.610 
that were difficult to move and hard to
save<00:00:53.519> no<00:00:54.519> zone<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.059> circular<00:00:55.629> so<00:00:55.839> I<00:00:55.900> just<00:00:56.140> asked

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
save no zone is circular so I just asked

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.079 
save no zone is circular so I just asked
one<00:00:56.769> of<00:00:56.800> our<00:00:57.010> programmers<00:00:57.580> if<00:00:57.730> I<00:00:57.790> could<00:00:57.970> just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
one of our programmers if I could just

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.960 
one of our programmers if I could just
outline<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.019> zone<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.860> attach<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.460> light<00:01:00.730> to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
outline a zone and attach the light to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.729 
outline a zone and attach the light to
it<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.660> he<00:01:01.750> said<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.080> know<00:01:02.170> what<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:02.350> think<00:01:02.650> we

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
it and he said you know what I think we

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.710 
it and he said you know what I think we
can<00:01:02.769> do<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.640> he<00:01:04.119> came<00:01:04.269> up<00:01:04.330> with<00:01:04.600> this

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
can do that and he came up with this

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.050 
can do that and he came up with this
great<00:01:04.930> tool<00:01:05.430> where<00:01:06.430> here<00:01:06.580> you<00:01:06.610> can<00:01:06.850> see<00:01:07.030> a

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
great tool where here you can see a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.840 
great tool where here you can see a
Kalimdor<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:08.020> could<00:01:08.470> just<00:01:08.650> outline<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.159> zone<00:01:09.550> and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
Kalimdor I could just outline a zone and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.700 
Kalimdor I could just outline a zone and
attach<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.420> light<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.140> throw<00:01:11.470> some

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
attach the light to it and throw some

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.170 
attach the light to it and throw some
light<00:01:11.890> Spears<00:01:12.190> in<00:01:12.399> there<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.700> wanted<00:01:13.030> to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
light Spears in there if I wanted to

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.420 
light Spears in there if I wanted to
this<00:01:13.600> is<00:01:13.810> huge<00:01:14.170> for<00:01:14.470> me<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.890> thought<00:01:15.220> it'd<00:01:15.399> be

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
this is huge for me I thought it'd be

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.270 
this is huge for me I thought it'd be
kind<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.759> cool<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.000> show<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.450> off<00:01:16.979> big<00:01:17.979> change

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
kind of cool to show that off big change

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.999 
kind of cool to show that off big change
another<00:01:19.090> big<00:01:19.420> change<00:01:19.630> we<00:01:19.899> have<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.410> something

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
another big change we have is something

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.790 
another big change we have is something
we<00:01:21.130> call<00:01:21.369> live<00:01:21.940> update<00:01:22.600> where<00:01:23.350> here<00:01:23.530> we<00:01:23.619> are<00:01:23.770> I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
we call live update where here we are I

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.190 
we call live update where here we are I
can<00:01:24.070> paint<00:01:24.340> inside<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.000> editor<00:01:25.360> but<00:01:25.930> I<00:01:26.020> can

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
can paint inside the editor but I can

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.160 
can paint inside the editor but I can
also<00:01:26.470> see<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.190> happening<00:01:27.729> live<00:01:28.060> in-game<00:01:28.539> at

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
also see it happening live in-game at

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.580 
also see it happening live in-game at
the<00:01:29.410> same<00:01:29.740> time<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.750> easily<00:01:32.110> we<00:01:32.470> would

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
the same time this is easily we would

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:44.190 
the same time this is easily we would
have<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.890> build<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.340> Train<00:01:37.050> now<00:01:38.050> we<00:01:38.110> can<00:01:43.200> think

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
have to build the Train now we can think

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.230 
have to build the Train now we can think
of<00:01:44.380> whole<00:01:44.830> push-and-pull<00:01:45.160> mountains<00:01:45.849> up<00:01:46.030> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
of whole push-and-pull mountains up and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.089 
of whole push-and-pull mountains up and
down<00:01:46.420> while<00:01:46.840> we<00:01:46.990> have<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.140> character<00:01:47.500> sitting

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
down while we have a character sitting

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.859 
down while we have a character sitting
right<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.340> top<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> mountain<00:01:49.270> or<00:01:49.450> beside

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
right on top of the mountain or beside

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.389 
right on top of the mountain or beside
it<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.319> we<00:01:50.410> can<00:01:50.560> instantly<00:01:51.009> get<00:01:51.220> that

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
it and we can instantly get that

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.240 
it and we can instantly get that
relationship<00:01:52.349> so<00:01:53.349> it's<00:01:53.500> been<00:01:53.679> extremely

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
relationship so it's been extremely

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.600 
relationship so it's been extremely
useful<00:01:54.429> just<00:01:55.030> for<00:01:55.179> setting<00:01:55.810> up<00:01:56.039> vistas<00:01:57.039> for

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
useful just for setting up vistas for

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.350 
useful just for setting up vistas for
creating<00:01:58.090> Pio<00:01:58.869> eyes

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
creating Pio eyes

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.760 
creating Pio eyes
landmarks<00:02:01.360> all<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:01.840> sort<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.229> thing<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.560> just

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
landmarks all that sort of thing it just

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.800 
landmarks all that sort of thing it just
gives<00:02:02.979> us<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.280> really<00:02:03.489> quick<00:02:04.060> way<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.390> get

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
gives us a really quick way to get

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.990 
gives us a really quick way to get
feedback<00:02:05.140> on<00:02:05.440> what<00:02:05.920> we're<00:02:06.130> doing<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.729> since

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
feedback on what we're doing and since

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.210 
feedback on what we're doing and since
we<00:02:07.239> are<00:02:07.420> building<00:02:07.959> such<00:02:08.380> large-scale

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
we are building such large-scale

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.030 
we are building such large-scale
features<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:10.179> mean<00:02:10.599> it's<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:10.869> great<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.770> know

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
features I mean it's just great you know

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.820 
you're gonna see in the game so we've
really<00:03:26.210> worked<00:03:26.510> hard<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.960> making<00:03:27.680> this

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
really worked hard on making this

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.940 
really worked hard on making this
special<00:03:28.720> first<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:29.930> wanted<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.320> do<00:03:30.470> something

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
special first we wanted to do something

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.650 
special first we wanted to do something
like<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.370> mouse<00:03:31.610> room<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.300> know<00:03:32.390> big

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
like the mouse room you know big

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.260 
like the mouse room you know big
swirling<00:03:33.290> water<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.490> we<00:03:34.730> thought<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.150> would

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
swirling water and we thought that would

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.290 
swirling water and we thought that would
be<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.450> way<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.720> go<00:03:36.610> wasn't<00:03:37.610> quite<00:03:38.000> working

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
be the way to go wasn't quite working

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.940 
be the way to go wasn't quite working
out<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.600> think<00:03:38.780> there's<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.110> slide<00:03:39.440> here<00:03:39.650> coming

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
out I think there's a slide here coming

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.890 
out I think there's a slide here coming
up<00:03:40.040> we<00:03:40.730> weren't<00:03:40.970> sure<00:03:41.150> we<00:03:41.300> liked<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.510> we

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
up we weren't sure we liked that we

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.240 
up we weren't sure we liked that we
thought<00:03:42.050> we'd<00:03:42.260> go<00:03:42.440> with<00:03:42.470> something<00:03:43.040> more<00:03:43.190> like

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
thought we'd go with something more like

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.420 
thought we'd go with something more like
more<00:03:44.150> traditional<00:03:44.690> like<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.280> portal<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.400> some

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
more traditional like the portal of some

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.930 
more traditional like the portal of some
kind<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:48.110> we<00:03:48.230> thought<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.620> would<00:03:48.770> look<00:03:49.760> into

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
kind so we thought we would look into

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.210 
kind so we thought we would look into
some<00:03:50.240> of<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.540> twilight<00:03:51.260> hammer<00:03:51.530> stuff<00:03:51.920> and

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
some of the twilight hammer stuff and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.860 
some of the twilight hammer stuff and
started<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.700> make<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:52.880> portal<00:03:53.270> like<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.630> and

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
started to make a portal like that and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.140 
started to make a portal like that and
that's<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.230> direction<00:03:54.410> we<00:03:54.800> went<00:03:55.010> in<00:03:55.150> these

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
that's the direction we went in these

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.070 
that's the direction we went in these
are<00:03:56.300> some<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.660> early<00:03:56.989> concepts<00:03:59.080> and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
are some of the early concepts and

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.510 
are some of the early concepts and
here's<00:04:00.320> some<00:04:00.500> progression<00:04:01.040> shots<00:04:03.250> no<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:04.430> has

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
here's some progression shots no one has

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.370 
here's some progression shots no one has
ever<00:04:04.670> seen<00:04:05.000> this<00:04:05.150> hardly<00:04:05.540> anybody<00:04:05.959> on<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.230> our

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
ever seen this hardly anybody on the our

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.630 
ever seen this hardly anybody on the our
team<00:04:06.650> has<00:04:06.830> seen<00:04:07.010> this

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.640 

so<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.849> was<00:04:14.030> our<00:04:14.180> final<00:04:14.359> login<00:04:14.840> string<00:04:15.109> but

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
so that was our final login string but

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.689 
so that was our final login string but
hold<00:04:15.980> on<00:04:16.660> hold<00:04:17.660> on<00:04:17.840> thank<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.829> thank<00:04:19.340> you

hold on hold on thank you thank you

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.900 
hold on hold on thank you thank you
we<00:04:20.539> like<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:21.019> lot<00:04:21.430> but<00:04:22.430> then<00:04:22.580> we<00:04:22.669> didn't

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
we like this a lot but then we didn't

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.360 
we like this a lot but then we didn't
like<00:04:23.060> it

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
like it

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.010 
like it
we<00:04:25.370> felt<00:04:25.729> that<00:04:25.820> nobody<00:04:26.570> would<00:04:26.810> really

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
we felt that nobody would really

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.830 
we felt that nobody would really
understand<00:04:27.710> who<00:04:28.099> the<00:04:28.460> twilight<00:04:28.880> hammer<00:04:29.120> was

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
understand who the twilight hammer was

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.080 
understand who the twilight hammer was
it's<00:04:30.289> high<00:04:30.979> level<00:04:31.310> content<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:31.880> wouldn't

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
it's high level content you wouldn't

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.950 
it's high level content you wouldn't
even<00:04:32.150> see<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.710> we<00:04:33.800> actually<00:04:33.949> started<00:04:34.160> over

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
even see it so we actually started over
