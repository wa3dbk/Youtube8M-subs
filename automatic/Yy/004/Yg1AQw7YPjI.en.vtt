00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
there's an actual device connected to it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
there's an actual device connected to it
again<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.080> off<00:01:13.619> switch

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
again you have your on and off switch

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.370 
again you have your on and off switch
which<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:16.140> little

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
which as you can see right now a little

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
which as you can see right now a little
LED<00:01:16.650> indicator<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:17.909> indicate

LED indicator is on which will indicate

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
LED indicator is on which will indicate
that<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> device<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.080> getting<00:01:19.409> power<00:01:19.590> which

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that the device is getting power which

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
that the device is getting power which
as<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.450> charging<00:01:21.810> sound<00:01:22.380> with

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
as you can see it's charging sound with

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.810 
as you can see it's charging sound with
hema<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> also<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.549> ahead<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
hema so you can also go ahead and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.429 
hema so you can also go ahead and
connect<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> second<00:01:24.540> Apple<00:01:24.840> product<00:01:25.259> which

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
connect the second Apple product which

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
connect the second Apple product which
again<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:25.950> something<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.450> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960 
again is not something you you know we
usually<00:01:28.140> find<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> USB<00:01:29.100> hub<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.790> don't

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
usually find on a USB hub they don't

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.130 
usually find on a USB hub they don't
have<00:01:30.060> enough<00:01:30.240> power<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.810> ahead<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
have enough power to go ahead and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
have enough power to go ahead and
support<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.159> multiple<00:01:32.670> product

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
support you know multiple product

multiple phones you know as they require
additional<00:01:35.460> power<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> something

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
additional power so this is something
