00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.530
 And is super Sakai provisional 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.530
 Only you name method 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 Hello everyone 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.810
 Ah, it's the method border 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:32.099
 But I is a translation made to enclose that spring horse racing has changed is Well held from this week 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 Nakayama last year and so on especially, but it is very often affected by heavy rain this time 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.839
 It is easy to be generally difficult to parken, though 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.220
 If the road is strong, there will be more cases where markets live on betting tickets 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.320
 If you Well that per the reference to all means I pedigree 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.610
 I think the Fu that I want will be out with Ben set 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.150
 Well this week seems to be the effect of the rain, but Saturday will be held in Hanshin, Arlington 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.489
 calf 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:57.489
 I would like to anticipate Nakayama Memorial and these two everyday, so please look forward to everyone 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.550
 Then what kind of Arlington cup I think that I would like to predict here 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.360
 It will be the main things that Bari deeply last year tree Archimedes I was hit Well child tickets 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.540
 Well, it's a very solid and over-riding, interesting and exciting race. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.140
 Bloodly 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 a 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.579
 I think that it is one battle that I want to win by all means 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.289
 It is the poisoned butterfly of the encounter Don cup , but it is this 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:31.409
 It is a race that is performed exclusively by Mime students, but in fact the content is a race for which special suitability is required. 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.860
 That's a very interesting trick, isn't it? 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:40.150
 If you think that it is a mile battle, and emphasize it with an eye-opening ability, you can expect so much 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:45.160
 Aim the door texture and type I Toka 1004 love staying power without obtaining the target and surprisingly addictive 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.560
 It's Tweet 1006, but this race is that special fitness is asked 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.090
 I think I it's an interesting point of 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.800
 The Tteyuu horse in the Well with a strong packet to a dedicated I for example Well is to prove it 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.140
 The other to was that Well this just last year has come to favorite also checking of Maya army Archimedes 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.690
 Minna 1001 low and Well around here in the ducking of Love suspension of water supply to get 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.680
 If it is a very strong duel, a strong pedigree often wears a dedicated duel for cats 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.700
 That there is 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.900
 Furthermore, oneself has left an actual as it is actually as it is 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.980
 Last year Well it is that it has become the betting ticket two pieces every year to Fu such horses is 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.819
 Borimi What might 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.480
 ko by a 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:26.069
 I was good at the 2-year-old stakes and I like this 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.549
 Because success and Irma goodwill by not winning a dedicated race and very to Kohashi 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:35.099
 There is a tendency to say that it is a race that demands 1004 points while being this holy war 6 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.810
 This year from the point of being 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.610
 Well, let's change it like this before 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.209
 I think it seems like this Goto will go up as a good choice of 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:51.310
 Or a How about Well ikea Speaking of which Kaosumosu and 5 par Mori 's that affected individuals to 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:55.510
 Mud is also Well, the problem I'd be good at rugby Being Enben and ki burger of this Taga 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.800
 It's because I 'm pulling, but each one is good, but the Tagano emblem is a forward run 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.180
 I bought 1000 yen, and in the lovely case Keio seems to be 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.960
 Mother and mother dance in the dark is included in the horse that is doing 1004 weapons so design etc. 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.550
 is not it 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.570
 Or also this which way it's I'm a little I popularity to halfway these two horses sell such of Moara 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.310
 It is no 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:17.270
 Lovely some money that I wonder not very tasty was a popular half-hearted 10 times before and after 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.819
 It is to think you Taga Roh emblem is also halfway it a little Well Nehonto say 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.060
 became 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:26.010
 So I think that it may be bought if this is over 200,000 yen 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.590
 Probably the most and become much that he would not worth Nde not go up there 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.730
 I can not go, but ki Barbe's favorite this year 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:36.269
 It does not only use a dedicated from the debut c from this mean is I own it comes to 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.319
 The same Admirya Moon birth piece as one day last year's e-mail 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.090
 And pedigree manner also issued a high performance in even thousand and four as of this horse's own performance 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.239
 Are 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.440
 In this 6 battles where 1004 aptitude is required 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:52.910
 I think that it can be bought well and this is probably the least popular person 9 difference 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.420
 It can be judged that it is worthwhile to buy even a small amount of money 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.420
 That's why 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.740
 deji 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.730
 Well then, Saturday's notable pick-up horse pick- up I'd like to pick up a race after Nakayama tomorrow 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.610
 think 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:18.650
 It's a turf 2000 meter race, but I've made it my favorite to get individual catchers 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:21.920
 Nakayama Shiba 2000m is a big success that it will go over a steep slope twice from the start to the goal 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.610
 Very demanding stamina from mobile 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.560
 There are more cases where simple speed types stick at the end or stop 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.600
 In that sense, it is the point to aim at the blood with stamina, but the child of this star 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.940
 While dad called until the top of the front of the Roberto-based positive Author 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.540
 Child-mer 8 of Opera House and Kotekote but is a creature pedigree ponderous Don'ashi duel What 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.810
 is not it 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.500
 Instead, it is a formula that only stamina is bold 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.400
 I think that 2000 meters of Nakayama is correct, so I use it in the bar debut game several times 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.590
 But I have only this and it's mixed so I have a performance from my debut match 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.940
 More Whoo embezzle because it is almost impossible that the issue 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:01.060
 That is getting better embezzle in stock up is used in the first match so it can be seen from the pedigree 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.860
 Crushing defeat was of the all each of rather I I think that so much do not have to worry about 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.280
 It should be emphasized as a pedigree that the performance up 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.210
 Well, in the pedigree, it was everyone 5 who was the other party duel 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:17.750
 I Nde had come also inner frame Well It just is where there is no popular 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.750
 I 'm thinking that it might be interesting to try this a little 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.120
 Hm 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.120
 Hmmm 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:49.740
 Because it is to say boo 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:53.070
 Science and check something like that to reverse it Nde there is the impression that if I wish but if we and 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:58.530
 There is a shame that people who can do it can win in Bakken 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:01.250
 It is said that I want you to make a horse race technique 1 room which will die 100,000 by the usage and first form by all means Kansai area 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.250
 I think the Fu 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.800
 Well, I also participate in horse racing exciting site Horse Square every week 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:15.690

 A mail magazine that interprets the main race from its own perspective 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:26.050
 Major League Ball 22 is the second 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:32.250
 In addition, I also publicize this Sunday's fundraising race which Kazuki recommends per me free of charge

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:39.810

 Let's try it hard for everyone this week, but it was just squid
