complete<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.920> start<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.250> solder<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:16.279> the

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
complete I start to solder the the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.689 
complete I start to solder the the
speaker<00:00:18.779> port<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.189> haven't<00:00:20.460> done<00:00:20.520> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
speaker port to it I haven't done that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
speaker port to it I haven't done that
yet<00:00:21.529> but<00:00:22.529> um<00:00:22.850> right<00:00:23.850> right<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.990> got<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.350> all

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
soldered up as you can see there's a lot

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.979 
soldered up as you can see there's a lot
of<00:00:30.119> wires<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:31.070> pretty<00:00:32.070> messy<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:33.149> that

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of wires it's pretty messy all that

guys can see it and you guys are seeing
some<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> pictures<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.540> very

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
some of the pictures it's you very

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.869 
some of the pictures it's you very
really<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.410> something<00:00:44.070> point<00:00:44.809> right<00:00:45.809> here

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
really good something point right here

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.770 
really good something point right here
there's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.170> PCB<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.610> use<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> coop<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
there's a PCB I use the coop for all the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
there's a PCB I use the coop for all the
ground<00:00:52.020> anything<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.370> grounds<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:53.910> are

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
ground anything all the grounds that are

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.459 
ground anything all the grounds that are
on<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.520> VGA<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.180> even<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
on a be on the VGA or even here and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.380 
on a be on the VGA or even here and
that's<00:00:58.649> also<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.460> also<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that's also it's going also with the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.939 
that's also it's going also with the
audio<00:01:00.690> ports<00:01:01.020> also<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> connect<00:01:01.710> all

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
audio ports also going to connect all

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.830 
audio ports also going to connect all
the<00:01:02.190> audio<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.270> grounds<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the audio all the grounds are going to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.750 
the audio all the grounds are going to
be<00:01:03.930> connected<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.799> pretty<00:01:05.670> much

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
be connected to this all pretty much

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.359 
be connected to this all pretty much
everything's<00:01:06.240> connected<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
everything's connected so it's a

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
everything's connected so it's a
constant<00:01:08.369> flow<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> used

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
constant flow on what I used

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.249 
constant flow on what I used
I<00:01:13.100> had<00:01:14.100> several<00:01:14.670> razors<00:01:15.240> laying<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
I had several razors laying around that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.740 
I had several razors laying around that
so<00:01:16.680> one<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.549> room<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.570> really

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
so one of the more like room was really

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.249 
so one of the more like room was really
messed<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> side<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
messed up on the side so I just I you I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
messed up on the side so I just I you I
cut<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:23.900> everything<00:01:24.900> else<00:01:25.640> except<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
cut off everything else except the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.719 
cut off everything else except the
circle<00:01:27.150> apart<00:01:28.009> that's<00:01:29.009> why<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.549> like

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
circle apart that's why you see like

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
circle apart that's why you see like
right<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> kind<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> circle<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
right there you kind of see a circle I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.390 
right there you kind of see a circle I
don't<00:01:31.860> know<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.380> not<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.829> good<00:01:35.100> as

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
don't know how it was not as good as

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.940 
don't know how it was not as good as
most<00:01:36.240> others<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:38.030> yeah<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.720> used<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
most others but yeah it's I used the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
most others but yeah it's I used the
circle<00:01:41.310> part<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.729> had<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> wires<00:01:42.869> cut<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
circle part and had all the wires cut to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.430 
circle part and had all the wires cut to
that<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.979> worked<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
that and worked really well and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.160 
that and worked really well and
I'll<00:01:48.440> show<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.010> works<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:50.170> tested

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
I'll show you that it works and I tested

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.780 
I'll show you that it works and I tested
it<00:01:51.440> already<00:01:51.740> already<00:01:52.130> my<00:01:52.340> screen<00:01:52.729> because

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
it already already my screen because

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.060 
it already already my screen because
I've<00:01:53.030> flickers<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.479> little<00:01:53.750> bit<00:01:53.840> at<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.500> solder

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
I've flickers a little bit at the solder

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.250 
I've flickers a little bit at the solder
the<00:01:55.940> mod<00:01:56.120> a<00:01:56.150> little<00:01:56.330> bit<00:01:56.420> better<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:56.960> right

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
the mod a little bit better but right

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.670 
the mod a little bit better but right
now<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.530> does<00:01:57.680> work<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.720> hooked<00:01:59.720> up<00:01:59.900> place<00:02:00.500> I

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
now it does work just hooked up place I

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:34.350 
now it does work just hooked up place I
show<00:02:00.890> you

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.540 

okay

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.509 

all<00:02:39.550> right<00:02:39.989> it's<00:02:40.989> all<00:02:41.200> hooked<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.099> right<00:02:42.340> now

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
all right it's all hooked up right now

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.900 
all right it's all hooked up right now
you<00:02:42.550> see<00:02:43.000> there's<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:44.940> cable<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:47.470> my<00:02:47.910> computer

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
you see there's the cable to my computer

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.960 
you see there's the cable to my computer
monitor<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.330> everything<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.790> probably

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
monitor and everything and I probably

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.520 
monitor and everything and I probably
got<00:02:52.120> my<00:02:52.209> fans<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.870> stay<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.230> there<00:02:53.379> and<00:02:53.470> it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
got my fans to stay in there and it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.009 
got my fans to stay in there and it
works<00:02:53.680> very<00:02:53.800> well<00:02:53.950> has<00:02:54.310> my<00:02:54.670> Xboxes<00:02:55.629> show<00:02:55.870> off

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
works very well has my Xboxes show off

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:04.690 
works very well has my Xboxes show off
anymore<00:02:58.799> okay<00:02:59.799> let's<00:03:00.010> turn<00:03:00.190> us<00:03:00.340> on

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.100 

so<00:03:05.240> plugged<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:06.190> think<00:03:07.780> no<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:08.930> not

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
so plugged in I think no it's not

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.660 
so plugged in I think no it's not
alright

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.500 

everything<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:16.760> that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:30.140 

okay<00:03:21.370> turned<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:23.470> watch<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.620> screen

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.289 

all<00:03:30.659> right<00:03:30.810> turn<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:32.340> light<00:03:32.489> turn<00:03:32.700> green<00:03:32.760> I

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
all right turn the light turn green I

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.270 
all right turn the light turn green I
should<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.349> coming<00:03:34.590> up<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.980> stick<00:03:35.159> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
should be coming up in you stick in

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.539 
should be coming up in you stick in
there<00:03:35.400> go

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.300 

when<00:03:45.549> I<00:03:45.610> tested<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.090> last<00:03:46.450> night<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.769> was<00:03:47.829> I

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
when I tested it last night and it was I

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.490 
when I tested it last night and it was I
played<00:03:48.730> several<00:03:49.720> games<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.349> make<00:03:50.470> sure

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
played several games just to make sure

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.949 
played several games just to make sure
when<00:03:50.799> she<00:03:50.980> off<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.549> it<00:03:51.790> did<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.420> I'm<00:03:52.599> pretty

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
when she off and it did it so I'm pretty

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.920 
when she off and it did it so I'm pretty
happy<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.730> do<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.209> anymore<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:57.689> it<00:03:58.689> was

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
happy and do that anymore and it was

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.020 
happy and do that anymore and it was
flickering<00:03:59.579> sometimes<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.700> little<00:04:00.879> bit<00:04:01.000> I

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
flickering sometimes a little bit I

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.789 
flickering sometimes a little bit I
think<00:04:01.209> it's<00:04:01.480> probably<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.109> wires<00:04:02.319> moving

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
think it's probably the wires moving

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.349 
think it's probably the wires moving
around<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.220> guess<00:04:03.400> or<00:04:03.609> some<00:04:03.819> of<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:03.939> wires<00:04:04.150> are

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
around I guess or some of the wires are

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.899 
around I guess or some of the wires are
touching<00:04:04.629> something<00:04:04.810> else<00:04:05.609> I'll<00:04:06.609> fix<00:04:06.849> that

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
touching something else I'll fix that

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.199 
touching something else I'll fix that
right<00:04:07.090> hand<00:04:07.450> select<00:04:07.959> require<00:04:08.319> something<00:04:08.680> that

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
right hand select require something that

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.869 
right hand select require something that
separate<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:12.489> works<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.799> fans<00:04:15.489> below

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
separate it it works and the fans below

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.210 
separate it it works and the fans below
it<00:04:16.030> perfectly<00:04:16.449> now<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.720> good<00:04:17.229> look<00:04:17.650> at<00:04:17.769> her<00:04:17.979> flow

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
it perfectly now a good look at her flow

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.430 
it perfectly now a good look at her flow
and<00:04:18.459> feel<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.269> hot<00:04:19.479> air<00:04:19.660> coming<00:04:19.930> out<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.139> it

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
and feel that hot air coming out of it

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.230 
and feel that hot air coming out of it
and<00:04:22.770> I'm<00:04:23.770> going<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:24.010> probably<00:04:24.130> put<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:25.030> lid

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
and I'm going to probably put the lid

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.330 
and I'm going to probably put the lid
back<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.930> side<00:04:26.139> right<00:04:26.350> here<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:27.990> close

back in on the side right here and close

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.290 
back in on the side right here and close
hopefully<00:04:30.340> we'll<00:04:30.460> be<00:04:30.550> done<00:04:30.729> by<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.090> and

hopefully we'll be done by that and
closed<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.930> closed<00:04:32.139> all<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.590> should<00:04:33.550> be

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
closed and closed all that should be

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.330 
closed and closed all that should be
done<00:04:34.110> hopefully<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.380> stays<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.979> works<00:04:36.130> this
