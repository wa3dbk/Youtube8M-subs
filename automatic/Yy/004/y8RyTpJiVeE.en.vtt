00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.569
 another daily there is a situation second with chest complaints on anton 

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:19.300
 to admit 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.960
 with the rules or otherwise 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 can allow this powerful role to become one 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.289
 this works with the electronic stability program in sp ts 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.449
 from the very beginning 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.400
 for this it does not give any other element to the engines and possibly 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.750
 offer to acceleration 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 psp consists of the following components 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.990
 a speed sensor for every team 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.310
 by a speedometer it measures the rotation of the call to its own 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.960
 greenhouse 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.200
 we send book sensor records the driver's bands 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.520
 the control they devices calculated from the sensor signals when and how it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.150
 must be drastic 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 the hydraulic unit discusses the brake pressure in cycling 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.070
 what happens with the first steering movements 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.800
 the driver must quickly turn to the left 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.500
 this brings the control group sensor to the top of the isbn control device 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.680
 however, when the speedometers signal that the volvo 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.820
 that is, it extends straight but the ones that stood 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.670
 the fractions of seconds greatly reduced the interest that spd those left 18 hours 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.500
 this makes the desired counterforce cause so that the vehicle needs to be driven 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 follow up 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.970
 what happens when submitting 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.820
 when steer against the roll but keep working out on the left lane 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.320
 utrecht makes the call on sending 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 to break out with the back to the left 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.310
 geerti moment to the right is stronger than the driver saved 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.800
 in this case the interest first in the left front wheel 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.000
 time moment is reduced 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.640
 instead of getting into the slip, the vehicle remains stable thanks to that sp
