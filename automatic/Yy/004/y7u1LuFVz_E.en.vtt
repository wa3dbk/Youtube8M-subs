and<00:00:58.690> you<00:00:59.649> know<00:00:59.769> we<00:00:59.920> have<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.190> box<00:01:00.460> floating

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
and you know we have this box floating

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.899 
and you know we have this box floating
up<00:01:01.059> here<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.659> it's<00:01:01.870> plane<00:01:02.109> miss<00:01:02.320> first<00:01:02.909> it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
up here so it's plane miss first it

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.120 
up here so it's plane miss first it
requires<00:01:04.300> two<00:01:04.809> people<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.470> get<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.650> box<00:01:05.860> to

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
requires two people to get a box to

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.990 
requires two people to get a box to
float<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:08.409> person<00:01:08.830> holds<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> teleporter

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
float one person holds the teleporter

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.800 
float one person holds the teleporter
the<00:01:10.390> other<00:01:10.630> person<00:01:11.140> holds<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.830> crate<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:13.479> put

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
the other person holds a crate you put

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.310 
the other person holds a crate you put
the<00:01:14.850> crate<00:01:15.850> in<00:01:16.720> between<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.680> top<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.870> let

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
the crate in between the top and you let

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.380 
the crate in between the top and you let
go<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.830> teleporter<00:01:21.490> so<00:01:21.520> that<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:22.030> stays

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
go of the teleporter so that it stays

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.450 
go of the teleporter so that it stays
floating<00:01:22.930> on<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.140> crate<00:01:23.410> you<00:01:23.980> delete<00:01:24.310> the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
floating on the crate you delete the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.310 
floating on the crate you delete the
crate<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.120> teleporter<00:01:25.720> space<00:01:25.960> floating

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
crate so the teleporter space floating

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.800 
crate so the teleporter space floating
and<00:01:26.740> then<00:01:26.830> put<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.130> new<00:01:27.460> crate<00:01:27.760> in<00:01:28.150> between<00:01:28.660> them

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
and then put a new crate in between them

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.580 
and then put a new crate in between them
so<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.390> that's<00:01:31.750> how<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:31.930> get<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.290> crate

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
so that so that's how you get this crate

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.470 
so that so that's how you get this crate
to<00:01:32.710> float<00:01:32.890> then<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.250> jump<00:01:33.580> off<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:34.120> land<00:01:34.330> on

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
to float then you jump off and land on

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.100 
to float then you jump off and land on
the<00:01:34.630> teleporters<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.620> are<00:01:35.800> down<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the teleporters that are down here and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.250 
the teleporters that are down here and
these<00:01:41.110> teleporters<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:42.040> all<00:01:42.220> two-way

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
these teleporters are all two-way

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.710 
these teleporters are all two-way
receivers<00:01:44.260> they<00:01:45.190> are<00:01:45.550> on<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.030> same<00:01:46.210> channel

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
receivers they are on the same channel

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.810 
receivers they are on the same channel
and<00:01:46.870> they<00:01:46.990> are<00:01:47.110> all<00:01:47.320> pointing<00:01:47.860> up<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:48.310> that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
and they are all pointing up so that

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.280 
and they are all pointing up so that
when<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.090> exit<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.720> exit<00:01:50.050> up<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
when you exit that you exit up and it

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.380 
when you exit that you exit up and it
was<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.740> if<00:01:54.130> you're<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.520> host<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:55.180> bounce

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
was you if you're a host you bounce

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.170 
was you if you're a host you bounce
higher<00:01:55.630> than<00:01:55.900> everyone<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.710> that's<00:01:57.400> fun<00:01:57.850> I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
higher than everyone so that's fun I

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.600 
higher than everyone so that's fun I
guess<00:01:58.450> Potter<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.750> this<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:02.980> an<00:02:03.250> polina

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
guess Potter and this is just an polina

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.840 
guess Potter and this is just an polina
fun<00:02:03.940> right<00:02:04.210> here

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.970 

we<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.780> lose<00:02:14.080> momentum

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
we if you lose momentum

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.280 
we if you lose momentum
you<00:02:15.430> put<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> teleporter<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.140> can

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
you put a teleporter so that you can

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.490 
you put a teleporter so that you can
just<00:02:17.470> go<00:02:17.590> right<00:02:17.650> back<00:02:17.830> up<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> top
