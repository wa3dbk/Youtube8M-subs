charms on now the charms have got little

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.189

loops<00:00:43.969> on<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.269> top<00:00:44.449> so<00:00:44.600> I<00:00:44.659> could<00:00:44.870> just<00:00:44.959> thread

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
loops on the top so I could just thread

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.049 
loops on the top so I could just thread
them<00:00:45.379> straight<00:00:45.620> onto<00:00:45.799> the<00:00:45.979> elastic<00:00:46.459> but<00:00:46.969> it

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
them straight onto the elastic but it

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.430 
them straight onto the elastic but it
makes<00:00:47.209> them<00:00:47.359> a<00:00:47.389> bit<00:00:47.510> sort<00:00:47.719> of<00:00:47.780> stiff<00:00:48.139> and<00:00:48.350> they

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
makes them a bit sort of stiff and they

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.689 
makes them a bit sort of stiff and they
don't<00:00:48.620> really<00:00:48.739> hang<00:00:49.010> very<00:00:49.280> nicely<00:00:49.429> so<00:00:49.639> I'm

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
don't really hang very nicely so I'm

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.969

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.439 
going to put them on jump rings first so
just<00:00:52.010> like<00:00:52.519> we've<00:00:52.639> done<00:00:52.760> with<00:00:52.819> all<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.179> others

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449

with<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.680> before<00:01:49.160> when<00:01:49.730> you're<00:01:49.850> not<00:01:50.030> this

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
with this before when you're not this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.970 
with this before when you're not this
the<00:01:50.450> knots<00:01:50.660> just<00:01:50.930> slide<00:01:51.170> undone<00:01:51.620> so<00:01:51.830> that's

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
the knots just slide undone so that's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.250 
the knots just slide undone so that's
why<00:01:52.130> I've<00:01:52.220> got<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.460> nail<00:01:52.610> varnish<00:01:52.790> here<00:01:53.300> so

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
why I've got the nail varnish here so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.360 
why I've got the nail varnish here so
I'm<00:01:54.380> going<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.560> pull<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.770> tight<00:01:54.980> now<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.190> can

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
I'm going to pull that tight now you can

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.620 
I'm going to pull that tight now you can
actually<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.760> quite<00:01:55.880> tough<00:01:56.180> for<00:01:56.390> this<00:01:56.450> it's

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
actually be quite tough for this it's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.000 
actually be quite tough for this it's
stronger<00:01:56.990> than<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.200> looks<00:01:57.440> you<00:01:57.590> can<00:01:57.740> really

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
stronger than it looks you can really

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.100 
stronger than it looks you can really
pull<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.280> quite<00:01:58.550> tight<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:59.210> then<00:01:59.900> I'm<00:01:59.990> going

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
pull it quite tight and then I'm going

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.130 
pull it quite tight and then I'm going
to<00:02:00.140> do<00:02:00.230> a<00:02:00.290> second<00:02:00.710> knot<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.360> again<00:02:02.600> pull<00:02:02.960> that

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
to do a second knot and again pull that

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.050 
to do a second knot and again pull that
tight<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.800> while<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.460> keep<00:02:04.670> pulling<00:02:05.000> it

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
tight and while you keep pulling it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.310 
tight and while you keep pulling it
tight<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.270> once<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.510> let<00:02:05.630> go<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.020> they<00:02:06.140> can

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
tight so once you let go of it they can

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.010 
tight so once you let go of it they can
ping<00:02:06.620> undone<00:02:06.980> so<00:02:07.730> I've<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.660> some<00:02:08.840> clear

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
ping undone so I've just got some clear

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.530 
ping undone so I've just got some clear
nail<00:02:09.200> varnish<00:02:09.649> here<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.910> if<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.150> see<00:02:11.180> I'm

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
nail varnish here and if you see I'm

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.240 
nail varnish here and if you see I'm
literally<00:02:11.959> just<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.350> dab<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:12.980> bit

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
literally just going to dab a little bit

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.900 
literally just going to dab a little bit
of<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> knot<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.670> leave<00:02:16.880> that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
of that on the knot and then leave that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.770 
of that on the knot and then leave that
to<00:02:17.209> dry

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
to dry

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.690 
to dry
I<00:02:17.810> find<00:02:18.740> nail<00:02:18.920> varnish<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.220> bit<00:02:19.400> easier<00:02:19.610> than

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
I find nail varnish a bit easier than

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.160 
I find nail varnish a bit easier than
the<00:02:19.790> glue<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.030> can<00:02:20.300> use<00:02:20.480> glue<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.900> super

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
the glue you can use glue and super

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.570 
the glue you can use glue and super
glues<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:21.560> if<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.740> get<00:02:21.860> superglue<00:02:22.310> actually

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
glues but if you get superglue actually

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.220 
glues but if you get superglue actually
on<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> glass<00:02:23.030> beads<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.510> dries<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> kind<00:02:24.140> of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
on the glass beads it dries a kind of

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.230 
on the glass beads it dries a kind of
frosted<00:02:24.650> look<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.610> it's<00:02:25.730> not<00:02:25.820> quite<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.060> good

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
frosted look so it's not quite so good

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.880 
frosted look so it's not quite so good
I'm<00:02:26.570> not<00:02:26.780> going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.990> cut<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.260> just<00:02:27.320> shakes<00:02:27.740> it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
I'm not going to cut that just shakes it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.800 
I'm not going to cut that just shakes it
hasn't<00:02:28.160> dry<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:28.940> essentially<00:02:29.390> once<00:02:29.570> that's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
hasn't dry but essentially once that's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.780 
hasn't dry but essentially once that's
dry<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:30.950> trim<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.250> ends<00:02:31.459> off<00:02:31.580> close

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
dry you can just trim the ends off close

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.030 
dry you can just trim the ends off close
to<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.090> knot<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:33.350> they've<00:02:33.560> got<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> little

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
to the knot and they've got a little

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:44.500 
to the knot and they've got a little
sort<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.730> semi<00:02:34.970> charmbracelet

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510
