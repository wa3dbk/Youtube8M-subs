I've done I've woken the dragon I just
recently<00:01:22.830> found<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.610> don't<00:01:23.700> have

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
recently found out that you don't have

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.109 
recently found out that you don't have
to<00:01:24.150> wake<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> dragon<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> sword

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
to wake up the dragon to get the sword

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
to wake up the dragon to get the sword
you<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> creep<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> it's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you just have to creep up to it and it's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.550 
you just have to creep up to it and it's
the<00:01:29.340> very<00:01:29.610> first<00:01:30.119> one<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the very first one right there there it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.429 
the very first one right there there it
is<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> dragon's<00:01:33.119> shield<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> just

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is now the dragon's shield is just

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
is now the dragon's shield is just
beyond<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> problem<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.000> can't

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
beyond that but the problem is you can't

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.660 
beyond that but the problem is you can't
get<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.439> without<00:01:37.590> waking<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> dragon<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
get it without waking the dragon and it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.859 
get it without waking the dragon and it
will<00:01:38.880> probably<00:01:39.119> kill<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
will probably kill you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.840 
will probably kill you
so<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.530> stores<00:01:40.829> straight<00:01:41.159> sword<00:01:41.460> right<00:01:41.640> there

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so a stores straight sword right there

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
so a stores straight sword right there
is<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> easiest<00:01:42.479> way<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.350> don't

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
is the easiest way to get that you don't

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690 
is the easiest way to get that you don't
even<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> wake<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> dragon<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.640> I'm

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
even have to wake the dragon so I'm

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.490 
even have to wake the dragon so I'm

is really really awesome the stat
scaling<00:02:27.810> isn't<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.410> greatest<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:30.560> as<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
scaling isn't the greatest but as you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.949
