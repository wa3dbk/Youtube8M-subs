about<00:00:21.529> EMP<00:00:22.130> grenades<00:00:22.520> and<00:00:22.759> we're<00:00:22.849> gonna<00:00:22.939> touch

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
about EMP grenades and we're gonna touch

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.620 
about EMP grenades and we're gonna touch
briefly<00:00:23.390> on<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.720> Recon<00:00:24.080> perk<00:00:25.119> but<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:26.419> main

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
briefly on the Recon perk but the main

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.179 
briefly on the Recon perk but the main
reason<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:26.990> wanted<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.230> focus<00:00:27.439> on<00:00:27.560> EMP<00:00:27.919> grenades

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
reason I wanted to focus on EMP grenades

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.009 
reason I wanted to focus on EMP grenades
in<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:28.430> video<00:00:28.699> is<00:00:28.850> because<00:00:29.180> they<00:00:29.420> seem<00:00:29.810> to<00:00:29.930> be

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
in this video is because they seem to be

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.490 
in this video is because they seem to be
underused<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:30.859> they<00:00:30.980> are<00:00:31.189> extremely

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
underused and they are extremely

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.660 
underused and they are extremely
extremely<00:00:33.500> awesome<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.370> have<00:00:34.489> them<00:00:34.580> in

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
extremely awesome and I have them in

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.540 
extremely awesome and I have them in
like<00:00:34.790> every<00:00:35.059> kit<00:00:35.269> so<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.470> start<00:00:36.680> out<00:00:36.860> what<00:00:37.340> are

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
like every kit so to start out what are

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.009 
like every kit so to start out what are
the<00:00:37.699> EMP<00:00:38.059> grenades<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.570> what<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.720> they<00:00:38.809> do

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
the EMP grenades and what do they do

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.160 
the EMP grenades and what do they do
um<00:00:39.519> well<00:00:40.519> EMP<00:00:40.970> grenades<00:00:41.239> are<00:00:41.360> miniature<00:00:41.690> emps

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
um well EMP grenades are miniature emps

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.069 
um well EMP grenades are miniature emps
and<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:42.739> they<00:00:42.860> are<00:00:43.040> best<00:00:43.460> suited<00:00:43.850> for<00:00:44.210> taking

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
and so they are best suited for taking

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.860 
and so they are best suited for taking
out<00:00:45.170> equipment<00:00:45.410> as<00:00:45.710> you'll<00:00:45.920> see<00:00:46.100> here<00:00:46.840> there<00:00:47.840> I

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.299 
out equipment as you'll see here there I
just<00:00:47.989> took<00:00:48.260> out<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.440> Sam<00:00:48.739> turret<00:00:49.010> without

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
just took out a Sam turret without

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.740 
just took out a Sam turret without
getting<00:00:49.520> anywhere<00:00:49.820> near<00:00:49.879> it<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:50.390> for<00:00:50.570> those<00:00:50.690> of

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
piece of enemy equipment you do have to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.590 
piece of enemy equipment you do have to
get<00:00:53.780> near<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:55.280> shoot<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.239> if<00:00:56.450> it's

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
get near it and shoot it if it's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.900 
get near it and shoot it if it's
something<00:00:56.870> like<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:57.020> bouncing<00:00:57.350> betty<00:00:57.469> or<00:00:57.910> knife

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
something like a bouncing betty or knife

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.760 
something like a bouncing betty or knife
it<00:00:59.149> if<00:00:59.300> it's<00:00:59.480> something<00:00:59.809> like<00:00:59.840> a<00:01:00.050> Sam<00:01:00.559> turret

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
it if it's something like a Sam turret

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.910 
it if it's something like a Sam turret
and<00:01:01.039> if<00:01:01.160> it's<00:01:01.340> an<00:01:01.460> assault<00:01:01.730> drone<00:01:02.559> it<00:01:03.559> takes

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
and if it's an assault drone it takes

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.010 
and if it's an assault drone it takes
forever<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.550> kill<00:01:04.789> it<00:01:04.940> but<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.239> single<00:01:05.539> EMP

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
forever to kill it but a single EMP

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.600 
forever to kill it but a single EMP
grenade<00:01:06.289> will<00:01:06.440> take<00:01:06.590> out<00:01:06.770> each<00:01:07.070> of<00:01:07.340> those

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
grenade will take out each of those

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.050 
grenade will take out each of those
things<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:10.190> take<00:01:10.340> them<00:01:10.460> out<00:01:10.550> from<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.820> range

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
things and take them out from a range

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.800 
things and take them out from a range
now<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:12.410> EMP<00:01:12.649> grenades<00:01:13.070> will<00:01:13.970> air<00:01:14.210> burst<00:01:14.479> so

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
now the EMP grenades will air burst so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.529 
now the EMP grenades will air burst so
they're<00:01:14.930> not<00:01:15.020> like<00:01:15.170> stun<00:01:15.530> grenades<00:01:15.860> but<00:01:16.539> they

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
they're not like stun grenades but they

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.270 
they're not like stun grenades but they
so<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:18.289> have<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.590> time<00:01:18.830> that's<00:01:19.039> you<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.220> to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
so you have to time that's you have to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.760 
so you have to time that's you have to
be<00:01:19.340> reasonably<00:01:20.000> close<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:20.599> here<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.590> also

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
be reasonably close but here you also

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.910 
be reasonably close but here you also
notice<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:23.300> not<00:01:24.080> only<00:01:24.349> does<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:24.500> take<00:01:24.740> out

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
notice that not only does it take out

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.830 
notice that not only does it take out
that<00:01:25.399> IMS<00:01:25.910> but<00:01:26.209> when<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.479> take<00:01:26.660> out<00:01:26.810> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
that IMS but when it you take out a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.279 
that IMS but when it you take out a
killstreak<00:01:27.140> boom<00:01:27.709> and<00:01:28.039> adds<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.670> your<00:01:29.289> kill

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
killstreak boom and adds to your kill

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.400 
killstreak boom and adds to your kill
tree<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.830> your<00:01:30.979> point<00:01:31.039> streaks<00:01:31.490> so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
tree so to your point streaks so

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.930 
tree so to your point streaks so
bouncing<00:01:33.410> Betties<00:01:33.649> obviously<00:01:34.160> claymores

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
bouncing Betties obviously claymores

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.190 
bouncing Betties obviously claymores
won't<00:01:35.090> add<00:01:35.209> yours<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.599> will<00:01:35.720> take<00:01:35.929> them<00:01:36.050> out

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
won't add yours it will take them out

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.419 
won't add yours it will take them out
but<00:01:36.349> it<00:01:36.440> won't<00:01:36.500> add<00:01:36.679> to<00:01:36.800> your<00:01:36.890> kill<00:01:37.099> streak<00:01:37.340> but

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
but it won't add to your kill streak but

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.660 
but it won't add to your kill streak but
if<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.610> take<00:01:37.789> out<00:01:37.970> enemy<00:01:38.390> kill<00:01:38.990> streaks<00:01:39.670> such

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
if you take out enemy kill streaks such

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.449 
if you take out enemy kill streaks such
as<00:01:40.849> this<00:01:40.940> recon<00:01:41.300> drone<00:01:41.539> in<00:01:41.690> here<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:43.220> will<00:01:43.310> get

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
as this recon drone in here you will get

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.240 
as this recon drone in here you will get
an<00:01:43.580> extra<00:01:43.670> point<00:01:44.030> on<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.869> yours<00:01:45.229> point<00:01:45.890> streets

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
an extra point on to yours point streets

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.219 
an extra point on to yours point streets
so<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.880> hattington<00:01:47.179> off<00:01:47.390> it's<00:01:47.750> like<00:01:47.929> carrying

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
so the hattington off it's like carrying

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.080 
so the hattington off it's like carrying
around<00:01:48.319> an<00:01:48.739> extra<00:01:48.950> kill<00:01:49.459> in<00:01:49.610> your<00:01:49.700> pocket<00:01:50.030> if

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
around an extra kill in your pocket if

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.809 
around an extra kill in your pocket if
you<00:01:50.119> come<00:01:50.300> across<00:01:50.479> an<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.869> kill<00:01:51.050> streak

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
you come across an in the kill streak

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.729 
you come across an in the kill streak
which<00:01:52.819> is<00:01:53.030> even<00:01:53.899> more<00:01:53.929> effective<00:01:54.500> when<00:01:54.649> you

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
which is even more effective when you

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:55.630 
which is even more effective when you
pair<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.039> with

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
pair it with

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.270 
pair it with

them<00:02:04.849> back<00:02:05.030> got<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.229> bitch<00:02:06.500> um<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:08.239> think<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
them back got you bitch um I think the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.719 
them back got you bitch um I think the
things<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:09.950> can<00:02:10.099> take<00:02:10.250> out<00:02:10.399> recon

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
things to do so you can take out recon

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.460 
things to do so you can take out recon
drones<00:02:11.000> in<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.180> air<00:02:11.300> with<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.780> EMP<00:02:12.140> grenade

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
drones in the air with the EMP grenade

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.119 
drones in the air with the EMP grenade
which<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.099> extremely<00:02:13.760> useful<00:02:14.950> here's<00:02:15.950> another

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
which is extremely useful here's another

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.420 
which is extremely useful here's another
example<00:02:16.310> after<00:02:16.760> we've<00:02:17.000> done<00:02:17.209> fully<00:02:17.569> impede

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
example after we've done fully impede

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.960 
example after we've done fully impede
they<00:02:19.430> think<00:02:19.580> they're<00:02:19.670> going<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.819> take

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
they think they're going to take

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.640 
they think they're going to take
advantage<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.780> recon<00:02:21.140> drone<00:02:21.350> action

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
advantage of a little recon drone action

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.990 
advantage of a little recon drone action
but<00:02:21.890> no

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
but no

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.990 
but no
so<00:02:23.959> uh<00:02:23.989> so<00:02:24.650> yeah<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:25.190> basically<00:02:25.819> like

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
so uh so yeah it's basically like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.580 
so uh so yeah it's basically like
carrying<00:02:26.390> around<00:02:26.450> an<00:02:26.720> extra<00:02:26.840> point<00:02:27.349> stick<00:02:27.500> in

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
carrying around an extra point stick in

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.720 
carrying around an extra point stick in
your<00:02:27.650> pocket<00:02:27.709> for<00:02:28.159> that<00:02:28.280> reason<00:02:28.549> they<00:02:28.610> only

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
your pocket for that reason they only

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.190 
your pocket for that reason they only
give<00:02:28.879> you<00:02:28.940> one<00:02:29.150> instead<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.480> two<00:02:29.569> what's<00:02:30.049> done

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
give you one instead of two what's done

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.589 
give you one instead of two what's done
here's<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.920> effects<00:02:31.310> when<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.970> EMP

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
here's the effects when you get EMP

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.600 
here's the effects when you get EMP
grenaded<00:02:32.989> there's<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.260> tiny<00:02:33.650> tiny<00:02:34.010> bit<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.370> stun

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
grenaded there's a tiny tiny bit of stun

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.580 
grenaded there's a tiny tiny bit of stun
then<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.239> return<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.599> normal<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:35.989> your<00:02:36.140> EMP

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
then you return to normal but your EMP

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.259 
then you return to normal but your EMP
for<00:02:36.890> an<00:02:37.190> amount<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.489> time<00:02:37.580> you'll<00:02:37.819> see<00:02:37.940> here<00:02:38.120> my

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
for an amount of time you'll see here my

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.150 
for an amount of time you'll see here my
radar<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.629> gone<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.989> my<00:02:39.049> reticle<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.069> my

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
radar is gone and my reticle and my

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.770 
radar is gone and my reticle and my
holographic<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.910> gone<00:02:41.060> until<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.420> wears<00:02:41.540> off

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
holographic is gone until it wears off

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.610 
holographic is gone until it wears off
so<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.700> also<00:02:43.819> works<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.299> a<00:02:44.330> Sun<00:02:44.959> check<00:02:45.230> so

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
so and it also works as a Sun check so

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.650 
so and it also works as a Sun check so
here<00:02:46.519> you'll<00:02:46.700> see<00:02:46.849> it<00:02:46.970> paired<00:02:47.150> with<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.330> Recon

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
here you'll see it paired with the Recon

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.360 
here you'll see it paired with the Recon
perk<00:02:48.430> pay<00:02:49.430> attention<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.569> mini-map<00:02:51.069> as<00:02:52.069> in

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
perk pay attention to the mini-map as in

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.550 
perk pay attention to the mini-map as in
here<00:02:52.730> if<00:02:52.879> you're<00:02:53.420> using<00:02:53.629> recon<00:02:54.140> then

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
here if you're using recon then

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.220 
here if you're using recon then
explosive<00:02:55.370> damage<00:02:55.790> will<00:02:56.480> paint<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.049> enemies

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
explosive damage will paint the enemies

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.839 
explosive damage will paint the enemies
on<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.379> mini-map<00:02:57.650> like<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.920> full<00:02:58.280> Blackbird

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
on the mini-map like a full Blackbird

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.509 
on the mini-map like a full Blackbird
like<00:02:59.090> not<00:02:59.299> like<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.480> advanced<00:02:59.959> UAV<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:01.010> they

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
like not like the advanced UAV but they

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.619 
like not like the advanced UAV but they
will<00:03:01.670> be<00:03:01.819> constantly<00:03:02.239> refreshing<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.459> and

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
will be constantly refreshing and and

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.270 
will be constantly refreshing and and
that<00:03:05.629> is<00:03:05.810> an<00:03:05.930> extremely<00:03:06.379> useful<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
that is an extremely useful and and the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.280 
that is an extremely useful and and the
reason<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.519> do<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.790> with<00:03:08.060> EMP<00:03:08.599> grenades<00:03:08.930> even

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
reason I do that with EMP grenades even

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.280 
reason I do that with EMP grenades even
though<00:03:09.970> any<00:03:10.970> kind<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.450> grenade<00:03:11.720> including

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
though any kind of grenade including

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.839 
though any kind of grenade including
stuns<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.799> flashes<00:03:13.220> will<00:03:13.340> also<00:03:13.609> have<00:03:13.760> this

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
stuns and flashes will also have this

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.930 
stuns and flashes will also have this
effect<00:03:14.379> is<00:03:15.379> because<00:03:15.829> EMP<00:03:16.129> grenades<00:03:16.459> throw<00:03:16.730> as

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
effect is because EMP grenades throw as

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.729 
effect is because EMP grenades throw as
fast<00:03:16.970> as<00:03:17.480> stuns<00:03:17.780> used<00:03:18.109> to<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.410> previous

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
fast as stuns used to in previous

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.500 
fast as stuns used to in previous
college<00:03:19.040> games<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.549> they<00:03:19.970> slowed<00:03:20.239> down<00:03:20.359> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
college games so they slowed down the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.110 
college games so they slowed down the
full<00:03:20.690> stun<00:03:20.930> grenade<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.920> throw<00:03:22.340> us<00:03:22.459> fastest

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
full stun grenade to throw us fastest

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.780 
full stun grenade to throw us fastest
flashbangs<00:03:23.629> but<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.980> EMP<00:03:25.129> grenade<00:03:25.489> throws

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
flashbangs but the EMP grenade throws

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.129 
flashbangs but the EMP grenade throws
quickly<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.269> it's<00:03:26.390> good<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.540> stun<00:03:26.870> checks

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
quickly so it's good for stun checks

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.920 
quickly so it's good for stun checks
really<00:03:27.470> quick<00:03:27.650> without<00:03:27.889> quick-draw<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.930> here

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
really quick without quick-draw and here

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.720 
really quick without quick-draw and here
I<00:03:30.109> just<00:03:30.349> really<00:03:31.010> quickly<00:03:31.190> you'll<00:03:31.400> see<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.609> guy

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
I just really quickly you'll see the guy

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.759 
I just really quickly you'll see the guy
paint<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.030> mini-map<00:03:32.389> recon<00:03:33.079> Pro<00:03:33.349> does<00:03:33.590> this

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
paint on mini-map recon Pro does this

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.860 
paint on mini-map recon Pro does this
where<00:03:34.069> when<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.310> shoot<00:03:34.579> someone<00:03:34.880> they<00:03:35.239> get

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
where when you shoot someone they get

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.620 
where when you shoot someone they get
painted<00:03:36.169> on<00:03:36.260> your<00:03:36.410> mini-map<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.359> that<00:03:38.359> doesn't

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
painted on your mini-map so that doesn't

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.520 
painted on your mini-map so that doesn't
have<00:03:38.720> anything<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.959> do<00:03:39.079> with<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.230> grenades

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
have anything to do with the grenades

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.629 
have anything to do with the grenades
but<00:03:39.709> since<00:03:39.889> we're<00:03:39.980> talking<00:03:40.069> about<00:03:40.190> recon

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
but since we're talking about recon
