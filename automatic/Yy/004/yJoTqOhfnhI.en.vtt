idiosyncrasies of each kit that you've
recorded<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:16.140> my<00:04:17.140> first<00:04:17.380> experience<00:04:17.950> when<00:04:18.070> I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
recorded and my first experience when I

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.900 
recorded and my first experience when I
set<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:19.330> drum<00:04:19.690> set<00:04:19.900> up<00:04:20.230> right<00:04:20.680> there<00:04:20.919> without

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
set that drum set up right there without

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.870 
set that drum set up right there without
turning<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.450> key<00:04:22.660> on<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.290> in<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.680> room<00:04:23.919> it

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
turning the key on it in that room it

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.050 
turning the key on it in that room it
presented<00:04:26.310> probably<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.460> biggest<00:04:27.760> and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
presented probably the biggest and

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.990 
presented probably the biggest and
fullest<00:04:28.450> sound<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:28.900> have<00:04:29.020> had<00:04:29.290> in<00:04:29.620> there

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
fullest sound that I have had in there

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.880 
fullest sound that I have had in there
automatically<00:04:31.000> with<00:04:31.150> no<00:04:31.180> work<00:04:31.810> you<00:04:32.770> know

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
automatically with no work you know

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.969 
automatically with no work you know
without<00:04:33.900> really<00:04:34.900> fine-tuning<00:04:35.560> things<00:04:35.800> you

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
without really fine-tuning things you

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.290 
without really fine-tuning things you
know<00:04:36.070> there<00:04:36.340> was<00:04:36.430> my<00:04:36.550> first<00:04:36.789> experience

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
know there was my first experience

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.180 
know there was my first experience
the<00:04:37.360> kid<00:04:37.569> I<00:04:37.599> set<00:04:37.930> it<00:04:38.020> up<00:04:38.139> moved<00:04:38.770> everything<00:04:39.009> out

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
the kid I set it up moved everything out

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.219 
the kid I set it up moved everything out
of<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.370> way<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:40.210> there's<00:04:40.389> no<00:04:40.569> microphones<00:04:41.110> in

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
of the way and there's no microphones in

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.330 
of the way and there's no microphones in
a<00:04:41.289> room<00:04:41.470> right<00:04:41.500> now<00:04:41.800> is<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:42.069> my<00:04:42.190> first

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
a room right now is this my first

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.369 
a room right now is this my first
experience<00:04:42.819> hearing<00:04:43.120> these<00:04:43.599> drums<00:04:43.960> in<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.199> room

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
experience hearing these drums in a room

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.270 
experience hearing these drums in a room
that<00:04:44.409> I<00:04:44.560> play<00:04:44.860> in<00:04:44.979> every<00:04:45.099> day<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:46.379> it<00:04:47.379> was<00:04:47.620> by

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
that I play in every day and it was by

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.879 
that I play in every day and it was by
far<00:04:48.310> superior<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:50.229> anything<00:04:50.500> I've<00:04:50.740> ever

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
far superior to anything I've ever

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.050 
far superior to anything I've ever
played<00:04:51.099> enough<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:54.190> then<00:04:54.550> when<00:04:54.669> I<00:04:54.699> started

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
played enough and then when I started

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.029 
played enough and then when I started
getting<00:04:55.180> into<00:04:55.360> tuning<00:04:55.870> them<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.139> I<00:04:56.199> found<00:04:56.830> it

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
getting into tuning them and I found it

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.369 
getting into tuning them and I found it
very<00:04:57.069> easy<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:58.000> kind<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.900> go<00:04:59.050> different

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
very easy to kind of go different

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.600 
very easy to kind of go different
directions<00:04:59.800> with<00:04:59.949> him<00:05:00.069> I<00:05:00.159> would<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.520> know

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
directions with him I would you know

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.490 
directions with him I would you know
make<00:05:00.789> him<00:05:00.879> real<00:05:01.060> soggy<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.690> huge<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.259> then<00:05:02.409> I

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
make him real soggy and huge and then I

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.290 
make him real soggy and huge and then I
would<00:05:02.710> okay<00:05:03.220> this<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.520> great<00:05:03.699> sound<00:05:04.060> let<00:05:04.240> me

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
would okay this is a great sound let me

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.909 
would okay this is a great sound let me
see<00:05:04.419> what<00:05:04.539> I<00:05:04.569> can<00:05:04.750> do<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:04.990> make<00:05:05.560> them<00:05:05.680> ring<00:05:05.889> a

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
style like so you don't have to work

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.800 
style like so you don't have to work
that<00:05:08.949> hard<00:05:09.009> you<00:05:09.490> know<00:05:09.969> it's<00:05:10.120> easy<00:05:10.360> this<00:05:10.750> is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
that hard you know it's easy this is

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
easy now but I'm a recording tip I

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.839 
easy now but I'm a recording tip I
haven't<00:05:17.740> experienced<00:05:18.430> anything<00:05:18.580> like<00:05:18.699> it

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
haven't experienced anything like it
