00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.400
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 Igor I am an expert on plants and today 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.700
 I will tell you about how to divide large 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.700
 old bushes of peonies 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.820
 the easiest and most importantly reliable 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.640
 peon breeding method is to divide 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.590
 big bush well here we would have 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.480
 double function we were asked to dig 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.369
 here we are digging it up now and 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.210
 divide show you how it's done 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.820
 right 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.190
 the best time for these operations is 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.379
 end of summer september to mid october 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.270
 months here we have just the beginning of curls 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.750
 we will deal with this first thing 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.430
 need to start need to tie him 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.720
 stems need to be tied in order to 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.360
 digging does not damage the kidneys growth 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.910
 on the sledka we tied a bush we take pruner 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.670
 and prune all the stalks we don't need 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.140
 we cut off about two thirds 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.780
 you can even three quarters that is 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.960
 small stumps are left above ground 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.420
 sometimes it happens so that peony bush happens 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.689
 big enough and hard to dig 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.600
 whole for this take wooden kun 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:15.159
 can use a hammer put on 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.560
 the center of the bush and just beat it 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.329
 breaks into two parts after 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.090
 the same each piece neatly separately 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.810
 I take out now we take a shovel and start 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.799
 digging in our bush peony from all sides 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.020
 digging carefully try not 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.659
 damage the roots once again they are with us and 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.579
 so will be damaged but we try to 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.779
 all sides neatly undermine him 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.469
 so that it can be easily 

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:41.020
 get out well here now we fall him 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.049
 shovel he already hit him and try 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 pull out can help with second hand 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.399
 From my take out here you see the root 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.649
 system of course some roots 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.810
 we broke off nothing terrible peonies 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.099
 Success is good enough moves 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.039
 now we need to clear the ground of him 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:01.659
 itâ€™s better to use a hose and with 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.789
 using water jet of water 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.169
 wash this one over here from 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.060
 the roots thing in this is done in order 

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:08.460
 to better see our legal system 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.620
 and how are you not right 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.240
 why do we wash off under running water 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.040
 because if you take your hands off 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.810
 earth you are quite possible here these little buds 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400
 the most prices can actually loop 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.470
 damage the roots of course not the kidneys 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.360
 it is possible therefore to make water easier 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:28.710
 convenient next step take sharp 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.590
 garden knife and stick cut about 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.920
 in half our rhizomes do not be afraid if 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 something hurt nothing scary every 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.150
 mate, in turn, also divide 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 in half now when we divided our 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.530
 bushes we have clearly seen on what 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.690
 how many buds remove the stems of this year 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.210
 we do not need them and we must delete them 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.420
 old black roots 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.980
 they are absolutely not needed we give one 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.230
 our word our de Lena divine form 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.140
 here are some of the plots we have 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.290
 should get about 3-4 fat 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.710
 root out see that we have 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.930
 rotten we removed that are damaged 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.270
 cut a little nothing terrible them 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.820
 length should be anywhere from 10 to 20 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.200
 centimeters here these roots and 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.900
 necessarily somewhere three or four buds 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.270
 here they are three buds here on this seedlings 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 there is a kidney try not to hurt 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.160
 because it is from them the next 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.290
 year you grow your peony well and finally 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.550
 the last stage here these are our plots already 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.620
 separated cooked we must 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.350
 plant keep in mind when you share 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.090
 peony bush to separate parts of the fossa for 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.530
 landing for the future is taken to cook 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.000
 in advance, that is, this gap 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.790
 time should be short enough 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.710
 so god forbid not to dry up the roots of us 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.020
 here are 4 holes dug a look at now 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.950
 described the basic principle of planting these 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.390
 the uppermost buds should be 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.270
 covered ground about centimeters at 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.120
 five so keep in admit lower 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.860
 and fall asleep the earth then on it you between 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.680
 you have no winter after you 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.690
 planted their plots plots necessarily 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.580
 pour them necessarily this indispensable 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.069
 water the condition abundantly well 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.390
 the earth completely surrounded all the roots 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.700
 Well, what else can you add if all the same 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.380
 you are afraid to have hard frosts in winter 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.440
 grumble here before offensive 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.919
 frost froze with a layer 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.500
 sawdust 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.760
 a layer of peat compost good then they 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.860
 exactly normal winters 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.570
 still want to say such a thing when 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.669
 landing here when landing do not choose 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.220
 carefully place why peonies do not like 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.660
 transplant here I think next year here 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.400
 these peonies that we planted they 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.889
 grow but they bloom most likely 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.790
 you will not dislike this pylons but already 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.790
 in a year everything will be fine 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.230
 Well, I say goodbye to this, see 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.270
 our video plots 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.640
 and even better subscribe to our channel 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.360
 on youtube and wish you beautiful 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.360
 peonies
