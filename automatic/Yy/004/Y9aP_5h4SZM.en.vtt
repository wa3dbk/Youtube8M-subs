vegetables one of the problems with
using<00:00:12.790> walks<00:00:13.210> is<00:00:13.600> that<00:00:14.320> they<00:00:14.440> take<00:00:14.680> up<00:00:14.890> too

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700

I<00:01:12.300> will<00:01:13.300> be<00:01:13.450> twisting<00:01:13.990> this<00:01:14.170> quarter<00:01:14.650> in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
I will be twisting this quarter in

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.440 
I will be twisting this quarter in
square<00:01:15.310> steel<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:16.570> get<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.440> effect<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
square steel to get this effect the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.500 
square steel to get this effect the
twisting<00:01:19.990> can<00:01:20.200> be<00:01:20.320> done<00:01:20.530> with<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> wrench

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
twisting can be done with a wrench

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.610 
twisting can be done with a wrench
although<00:01:22.510> I<00:01:22.810> prefer<00:01:23.800> using<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.640> tap<00:01:25.060> handle<00:01:25.620> out

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
although I prefer using a tap handle out

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.950 
although I prefer using a tap handle out
of<00:01:26.890> my<00:01:27.100> temp<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.850> I<00:01:28.060> said<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:31.420> twisting<00:01:31.870> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
of my temp and I said when twisting the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.520 
of my temp and I said when twisting the
metal<00:01:32.260> it's<00:01:32.620> difficult<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.370> keep<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.670> straight

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
metal it's difficult to keep it straight

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.910 
metal it's difficult to keep it straight
the<00:01:35.530> tap<00:01:35.799> handle<00:01:36.250> makes<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.909> bit<00:01:37.299> easier

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the tap handle makes this a bit easier

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.969 
the tap handle makes this a bit easier
compared<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.040> using<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.970> wrench<00:01:40.860> heating<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
compared to using a wrench heating the

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.230 
compared to using a wrench heating the
steel<00:01:42.040> up<00:01:42.549> to<00:01:42.909> red-hot<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:44.440> then<00:01:45.000> turning<00:01:46.000> the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
steel up to red-hot and then turning the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.670 
steel up to red-hot and then turning the
handle<00:01:48.060> moving<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.330> heat<00:01:49.510> further<00:01:50.350> back

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
handle moving the heat further back

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.070 
handle moving the heat further back
towards<00:01:51.340> me

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.680 

trying<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.920> keep<00:01:55.100> consistent<00:01:55.760> pressure<00:01:56.000> on

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690

trying to keep consistent pressure on
the<00:01:57.080> handle<00:01:57.500> I'm<00:01:57.980> using<00:01:58.640> for<00:01:59.030> twisting<00:01:59.480> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the handle I'm using for twisting the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.640 
the handle I'm using for twisting the
middle<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:04.250> twist<00:02:04.580> can<00:02:04.880> be<00:02:05.000> tighter<00:02:05.300> as<00:02:05.840> in

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
middle the twist can be tighter as in

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.830 
middle the twist can be tighter as in
closer<00:02:07.340> together<00:02:07.670> or<00:02:08.920> looser<00:02:09.920> as<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:11.300> further
