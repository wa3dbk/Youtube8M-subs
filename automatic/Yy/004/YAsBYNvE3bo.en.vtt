different<00:01:29.320> settings<00:01:29.710> there<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:31.030> then<00:01:31.119> you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
different settings there and then you

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.660 
different settings there and then you
can<00:01:31.360> add<00:01:31.540> devices<00:01:31.930> here<00:01:32.619> just<00:01:33.040> by<00:01:33.190> hitting<00:01:33.340> add

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
can add devices here just by hitting add

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.150 
can add devices here just by hitting add
and<00:01:34.060> then<00:01:34.420> these<00:01:34.750> are<00:01:34.930> things<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.260> already

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
and then these are things that already

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.070 
and then these are things that already
set<00:01:36.400> up<00:01:36.430> I<00:01:36.640> believe<00:01:36.910> so<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.600> can<00:01:37.750> just<00:01:37.900> go

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
set up I believe so you can just go

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.040 
set up I believe so you can just go
through<00:01:38.110> when<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.860> add<00:01:39.040> new<00:01:39.479> device<00:01:40.479> robot

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
through when you add new device robot

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.800 
through when you add new device robot
cleaner<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.340> different<00:01:42.670> items

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.370 

and<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.650> an<00:01:49.799> AC<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:51.320> don't<00:01:52.320> know

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and so there's an AC there I don't know

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.850 
and so there's an AC there I don't know
if<00:01:52.440> it'll<00:01:52.650> load<00:01:53.869> probably<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.400> excuse<00:01:56.400> me<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
if it'll load probably not excuse me and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.170 
if it'll load probably not excuse me and
that's<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> that's<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.369> smart<00:01:59.670> home<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.170> thanks
