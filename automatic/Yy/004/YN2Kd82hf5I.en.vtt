close but still no cigar I wish there
was<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.459> lift<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:04.910> top<00:04:05.590> I'm<00:04:06.590> sure<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.980> the

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
was a lift to the top I'm sure that the

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.559 
was a lift to the top I'm sure that the
third<00:04:07.280> time<00:04:07.580> would<00:04:07.819> have<00:04:07.879> been<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.120> charm<00:04:08.420> but

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
third time would have been the charm but

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.180 
third time would have been the charm but
I've<00:04:08.690> only<00:04:08.780> got<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:09.050> few<00:04:09.349> trips<00:04:09.590> up<00:04:09.800> this<00:04:09.980> hill
