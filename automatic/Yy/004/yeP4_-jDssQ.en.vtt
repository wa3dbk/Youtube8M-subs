all<00:00:01.860> right<00:00:01.979> guys<00:00:02.129> what<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:02.730> did<00:00:02.909> was<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.510> the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
all right guys what we did was in the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.130 
all right guys what we did was in the
front<00:00:03.899> here<00:00:04.910> we<00:00:05.910> took<00:00:06.060> system<00:00:06.420> broken<00:00:06.810> chunks

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
front here we took system broken chunks

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.390 
front here we took system broken chunks
of<00:00:07.200> brick<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.410> whatnot<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:07.980> just<00:00:08.189> kind<00:00:08.370> of

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
of brick and whatnot and just kind of

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.589 
of brick and whatnot and just kind of
stack<00:00:08.639> them<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.880> around<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> front<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
stack them in around the front of the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.299 
stack them in around the front of the
barrel<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> take<00:00:11.099> another

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
barrel and we're going to take another

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.249 
barrel and we're going to take another
little<00:00:11.519> piece<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.849> sheet<00:00:12.000> metal<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.630> cut

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
little piece of sheet metal here and cut

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.919 
little piece of sheet metal here and cut
it<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> where<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.009> put<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.929> right

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
it up to where we can put it in right

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.390 
it up to where we can put it in right
here<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.619> figured<00:00:16.920> those<00:00:17.010> bricks<00:00:17.310> that

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
here but I figured those bricks that

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.480 
here but I figured those bricks that
help<00:00:17.900> absorb<00:00:18.900> some<00:00:19.199> heat<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.560> radiate<00:00:20.250> tomb

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
help absorb some heat and radiate tomb

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.150 
help absorb some heat and radiate tomb
extra<00:00:20.760> heat<00:00:21.140> then<00:00:22.140> we'll<00:00:22.260> put<00:00:22.439> sheet<00:00:22.830> metal<00:00:23.070> up

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
extra heat then we'll put sheet metal up

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.769 
extra heat then we'll put sheet metal up
in<00:00:23.250> front<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.789> try<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> keep<00:00:24.180> as<00:00:24.330> much<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
in front to try to keep as much of the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.009 
in front to try to keep as much of the
cold<00:00:25.170> air<00:00:25.320> out<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.599> I<00:00:27.599> will<00:00:27.779> catch

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
the window we've got two plywood boards

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.129 
the window we've got two plywood boards
that<00:04:00.639> are<00:04:00.699> cut<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.000> fit<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.480> window<00:04:01.780> with

that are cut to fit in the window with
insulation<00:04:02.590> in<00:04:02.889> between<00:04:03.190> them<00:04:03.599> I'll<00:04:04.599> probably

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
insulation in between them I'll probably

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.390 
insulation in between them I'll probably
come<00:04:05.019> back<00:04:05.139> at<00:04:05.319> some<00:04:05.440> point<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.829> seal<00:04:06.069> up<00:04:06.099> all

all around the edge of the windows and
around<00:04:10.750> here<00:04:11.310> but<00:04:12.310> let<00:04:12.489> me<00:04:12.519> take<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.879> inside

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
around here but let me take you inside

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.930 
around here but let me take you inside
the<00:04:13.239> house<00:04:13.480> here<00:04:14.459> ensure<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.609> looks<00:04:15.790> like

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
the house here ensure it looks like

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.020 
the house here ensure it looks like
inside

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.920 

hopefully<00:04:23.030> it's<00:04:23.120> going<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.300> be<00:04:23.390> light<00:04:23.780> enough

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
hopefully it's going to be light enough

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
hopefully it's going to be light enough
to<00:04:24.110> see<00:04:25.690> right<00:04:26.690> here<00:04:26.900> this<00:04:27.260> is<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.530> inside<00:04:27.920> of

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
to see right here this is the inside of

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.020 
to see right here this is the inside of
the<00:04:28.070> window<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:30.100> I've<00:04:31.100> got<00:04:31.340> just<00:04:31.580> one<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:31.910> them

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
the window and I've got just one of them

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.990 
the window and I've got just one of them
a<00:04:32.060> dryer<00:04:32.300> vents<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:34.460> way<00:04:34.580> when<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.820> air<00:04:34.970> is

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
a dryer vents that way when the air is

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000 
a dryer vents that way when the air is
coming<00:04:35.240> out<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:38.300> lifts<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.720> up<00:04:38.840> these<00:04:39.740> here

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
coming out it lifts it up these here

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.740 
coming out it lifts it up these here
lift<00:04:40.460> up<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.790> here<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.030> coming<00:04:41.300> out<00:04:41.420> and<00:04:41.450> then

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
lift up and here is coming out and then

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.550 
lift up and here is coming out and then
whenever<00:04:41.930> there's<00:04:42.200> no<00:04:42.290> air<00:04:42.500> flow<00:04:43.990> then<00:04:44.990> as<00:04:45.170> we

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
whenever there's no air flow then as we

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.410 
whenever there's no air flow then as we
can<00:04:45.680> push<00:04:45.920> them<00:04:46.040> down<00:04:46.070> about<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.060> keep<00:04:47.240> any

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
can push them down about to keep any

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.310 
can push them down about to keep any
extra<00:04:47.810> cold<00:04:48.080> air<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.290> we<00:04:48.470> don't<00:04:48.620> want<00:04:48.830> out

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
extra cold air that we don't want out

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.840 
extra cold air that we don't want out
that's<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.410> plan<00:04:51.620> anyway<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:52.280> we're<00:04:52.640> going<00:04:52.730> to

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
that's the plan anyway so we're going to

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.200 
that's the plan anyway so we're going to
get<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.970> fire<00:04:53.150> going<00:04:53.420> in<00:04:53.540> here<00:04:54.370> see<00:04:55.370> if<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.490> works

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.880 

okay<00:04:59.210> got<00:04:59.930> a<00:04:59.960> little<00:05:00.050> bit<00:05:00.200> of<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.290> fire<00:05:00.470> going

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
okay got a little bit of a fire going

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.770 
okay got a little bit of a fire going
looks<00:05:01.460> like<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.700> chimney<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:02.150> drafting<00:05:02.630> real

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
looks like the chimney is drafting real

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.230 
looks like the chimney is drafting real
good<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.970> took<00:05:04.970> some<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:07.370> duct<00:05:07.970> insulation

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
good I took some that duct insulation

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.100 
good I took some that duct insulation
that<00:05:09.020> we<00:05:09.110> had<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.880> wrapped<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.210> around<00:05:11.300> this

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
that we had and I wrapped it around this

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.200 
that we had and I wrapped it around this
duck<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.590> goes<00:05:12.830> into<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.280> house<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:13.910> I<00:05:13.940> try

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
duck this goes into the house so I try

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.080 
duck this goes into the house so I try
not<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.360> lose<00:05:14.540> any<00:05:14.720> heat<00:05:15.190> or<00:05:16.190> minimal<00:05:16.910> heat

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
not to lose any heat or minimal heat

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.750 
not to lose any heat or minimal heat
anyway<00:05:17.300> while<00:05:17.540> is<00:05:17.630> traveling<00:05:18.580> now<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.610> think

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
anyway while is traveling now I think

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.980 
anyway while is traveling now I think
what<00:05:19.910> we're<00:05:20.000> going<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.210> do<00:05:20.270> next<00:05:20.450> is<00:05:20.690> just<00:05:20.840> take

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
what we're going to do next is just take

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.990 
what we're going to do next is just take
these<00:05:21.110> loose<00:05:21.440> tax<00:05:21.680> breaks<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.520> we<00:05:22.670> got<00:05:22.820> this

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
these loose tax breaks that we got this

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.790 
these loose tax breaks that we got this
pile<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.330> bricks<00:05:23.450> just<00:05:23.720> pile<00:05:24.260> as<00:05:24.410> many<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.710> them

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
pile of bricks just pile as many of them

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.410 
pile of bricks just pile as many of them
around<00:05:25.600> around<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.780> edge<00:05:27.230> here<00:05:27.970> between<00:05:28.970> here

these little bench propped open here and
you<00:06:42.189> can<00:06:42.339> definitely<00:06:42.459> feel<00:06:42.909> heat<00:06:44.189> coming<00:06:45.189> out

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
you can definitely feel heat coming out

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.239 
you can definitely feel heat coming out
of<00:06:45.339> the<00:06:45.429> vent<00:06:46.469> there<00:06:47.469> may<00:06:47.559> be<00:06:47.589> a<00:06:47.739> little<00:06:47.919> smoke

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.249 
of the vent there may be a little smoke

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:50.009 
of the vent there may be a little smoke
tube<00:06:48.489> where<00:06:48.789> it's<00:06:48.939> burning<00:06:49.239> off<00:06:49.389> of<00:06:49.539> the<00:06:49.629> the

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:50.019 
tube where it's burning off of the the

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:51.089 
tube where it's burning off of the the
inside<00:06:50.289> of<00:06:50.319> the<00:06:50.409> pipe<00:06:50.589> that's<00:06:50.860> why<00:06:50.949> we're

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:51.099 
inside of the pipe that's why we're

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.369 
inside of the pipe that's why we're
doing<00:06:51.189> it<00:06:51.339> now<00:06:51.519> we<00:06:51.939> got<00:06:52.089> some<00:06:52.300> other<00:06:53.019> windows

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.379 
doing it now we got some other windows

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.869 
doing it now we got some other windows
open<00:06:53.649> so<00:06:53.679> if<00:06:53.949> there<00:06:54.099> is<00:06:54.159> any<00:06:54.339> smoke<00:06:54.550> to<00:06:54.669> get<00:06:54.789> you

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 
open so if there is any smoke to get you

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.409 
open so if there is any smoke to get you
in<00:06:54.969> here<00:06:55.089> they<00:06:55.269> can<00:06:55.419> get<00:06:55.539> out<00:06:56.639> and<00:06:57.639> there<00:06:58.329> you

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
in here they can get out and there you

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:04.249 
in here they can get out and there you
go<00:06:58.479> y'all<00:06:59.429> and<00:07:00.429> then<00:07:00.519> you<00:07:00.579> turn<00:07:00.699> out<00:07:00.909> good<00:07:02.069> so<00:07:03.069> I

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
go y'all and then you turn out good so I

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.039 
go y'all and then you turn out good so I
think<00:07:05.259> that's<00:07:05.469> going<00:07:05.589> to<00:07:05.649> be<00:07:05.769> it<00:07:05.860> for<00:07:05.889> this<00:07:06.099> one

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:07.049 
think that's going to be it for this one

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:11.339 
think that's going to be it for this one
what<00:07:08.049> time<00:07:08.259> the<00:07:08.709> outside<00:07:09.159> heat<00:07:09.429> exchange<00:07:10.349> took

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
what time the outside heat exchange took

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:12.389 
what time the outside heat exchange took
us<00:07:11.439> a<00:07:11.529> couple<00:07:11.559> of<00:07:11.829> days<00:07:11.949> to<00:07:12.069> put<00:07:12.219> it<00:07:12.279> together

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:12.399 
us a couple of days to put it together

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.979 
us a couple of days to put it together
with<00:07:12.729> what<00:07:12.849> we<00:07:12.939> had<00:07:13.119> how<00:07:13.449> long<00:07:13.689> we<00:07:13.809> probably

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:13.989 
with what we had how long we probably

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:16.850 
with what we had how long we probably
ain't<00:07:14.139> got<00:07:14.349> what<00:07:14.729> sixty<00:07:15.729> or<00:07:15.789> seventy<00:07:15.939> dollars

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
ain't got what sixty or seventy dollars

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.199 
ain't got what sixty or seventy dollars
whatever<00:07:17.860> barrel<00:07:18.159> maybe<00:07:18.399> you<00:07:18.819> wrapped<00:07:19.059> up

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:19.209 
whatever barrel maybe you wrapped up

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:22.649 
whatever barrel maybe you wrapped up
into<00:07:19.389> this<00:07:19.569> thing<00:07:19.809> and<00:07:21.269> that's<00:07:22.269> about<00:07:22.360> all<00:07:22.479> we

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659 
into this thing and that's about all we

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:23.939 
into this thing and that's about all we
got<00:07:22.809> wrapped<00:07:22.989> up<00:07:23.079> into<00:07:23.319> it<00:07:23.529> so<00:07:23.649> it's<00:07:23.799> going<00:07:23.889> to

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949 
got wrapped up into it so it's going to

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.229 
got wrapped up into it so it's going to
hopefully<00:07:24.099> provide<00:07:24.489> heat<00:07:24.669> we<00:07:24.819> got<00:07:24.969> plenty<00:07:25.179> of

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:25.239 
hopefully provide heat we got plenty of

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:26.999 
hopefully provide heat we got plenty of
wood<00:07:25.389> that<00:07:25.449> we<00:07:25.599> can<00:07:25.749> burn<00:07:25.899> and<00:07:26.169> I<00:07:26.529> will<00:07:26.709> see<00:07:26.860> how

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.009 
wood that we can burn and I will see how

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.229 
wood that we can burn and I will see how
much<00:07:27.069> it<00:07:27.309> saves<00:07:27.489> over<00:07:27.639> the<00:07:27.729> winter<00:07:27.879> time<00:07:28.029> and

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:28.239 
much it saves over the winter time and

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.419 
much it saves over the winter time and
it's<00:07:29.110> not<00:07:29.259> a<00:07:29.289> permanent<00:07:29.559> structure<00:07:29.979> so<00:07:30.219> come

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:30.429 
it's not a permanent structure so come

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:31.799 
it's not a permanent structure so come
to<00:07:30.579> springtime<00:07:30.939> we<00:07:31.149> can<00:07:31.269> take<00:07:31.419> all<00:07:31.539> the<00:07:31.659> bricks

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:31.809 
to springtime we can take all the bricks

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:33.359 
to springtime we can take all the bricks
away<00:07:32.049> stack<00:07:32.409> them<00:07:32.559> up<00:07:32.649> and<00:07:32.889> then<00:07:33.039> slide<00:07:33.339> it

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:33.369 
away stack them up and then slide it
