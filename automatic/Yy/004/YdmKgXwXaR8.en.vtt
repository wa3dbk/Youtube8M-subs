you want to bring up on your end like

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.789 
you want to bring up on your end like
the<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.190> jump<00:02:31.459> kick<00:02:32.110> when<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.230> sprinting

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.699 
striking button and there's a junkie
that<00:02:38.000> comes<00:02:38.209> out<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:39.049> little<00:02:39.560> bit

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
that comes out it's a little bit

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.220 
that comes out it's a little bit
problematic<00:02:40.130> for<00:02:40.880> us<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:41.299> visually<00:02:41.900> we

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
problematic for us just visually we

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.930 
problematic for us just visually we
weren't<00:02:42.530> quite<00:02:42.860> happy<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.730> but<00:02:43.760> we

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
weren't quite happy with it but we

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.180 
weren't quite happy with it but we
couldn't<00:02:44.269> quite<00:02:44.480> articulate<00:02:45.019> what<00:02:45.470> was<00:02:45.860> wrong

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
couldn't quite articulate what was wrong

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.070 
couldn't quite articulate what was wrong
with<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.970> can<00:02:47.180> see<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.630> slow<00:02:47.780> mo

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
with it so you can see it in slow mo

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.190 
with it so you can see it in slow mo
okay<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.950> brothers<00:02:49.810> good<00:02:50.810> con<00:02:50.989> seen

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
okay I see the brothers good con seen

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.830 
okay I see the brothers good con seen
yes<00:02:51.380> yes

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
yes yes

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.460 
yes yes
so<00:02:53.500> at<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.800> point<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.280> know<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:55.180> we<00:02:55.599> broke<00:02:55.930> we

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
so at that point you know we we broke we

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.680 
so at that point you know we we broke we
broke<00:02:56.739> into<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.129> mechanics<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.910> what<00:02:58.480> was

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
broke into the mechanics of what was

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.020 
broke into the mechanics of what was
wrong<00:02:58.959> with<00:02:59.319> that<00:02:59.470> move<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.040> how<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.519> wasn't

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
wrong with that move and how it wasn't

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.780 
wrong with that move and how it wasn't
looking<00:03:01.330> correct<00:03:01.720> doesn't<00:03:02.410> feel<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.790> you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
looking correct doesn't feel like you

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.790 
looking correct doesn't feel like you

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
bit different and will be even closer to

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.910 
bit different and will be even closer to
having<00:03:40.090> truly<00:03:40.629> authentic<00:03:40.930> fighting

the<00:03:48.099> flying<00:03:48.400> punch<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:49.360> one<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.870> my<00:03:49.989> favorite

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
the flying punch it's one of my favorite

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.350 
the flying punch it's one of my favorite
move<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.129> fighting<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:51.879> have<00:03:52.000> no<00:03:52.150> new
