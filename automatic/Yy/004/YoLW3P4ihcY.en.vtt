00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
 but if the symmetry back for something 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.640
 good to see in this relationship 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.250
 and there is chito flowers is injured 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 with the ball pulls the little one out 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.700
 man 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.700
 and now he throws it and pulled back world 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.400
 flowers had been hurt in the action 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.180
 previous because it was to collide I know 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.050
 savings 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.989
 also the person 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.870
 no no I do not discuss the ingenuity of flowers 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.140
 ecological I do not argue its good 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.059
 Will 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.140
 madina faiffer if I fall a little 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.360
 because I think if you fan faster 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 but for my taste there is right 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110
 had very little 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.710
 for my taste well a soccer code 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.890
 but it will be and could not be remedied 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:13.869
 because if Vallejo allowed himself to make a goal 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.869
 I think so 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.070
 because you are a recontra 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.830
 my life weakens 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.850
 you are a new market 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.850
 a mother 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 so 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.990
 it exists for all 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.120
 I definitely do not know where you claim 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.310
 fair play where there is no more good there is 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.960
 teach him what his players should 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.190
 teach the little one so that it has 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.340
 selected because it has been selected 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.630
 that the strip was that simple to the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.970
 football and always football is not or 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.760
 we can not invent things now nothing 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.100
 more a play as always but nothing 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.770
 plus the ball 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.770
 I wanted to find to play or not 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.840
 to determine the match by a 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:46.360
 detail the silly truth for us is 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.520
 that mistake of ours is obviously a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.890
 play where there is no Pauline and you have to 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.450
 go outside before he took the opportunity to declare 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.620
 that fair play is a lie in the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.570
 football does not have to exist the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.680
 repetitive and the power to stop the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.270
 match when a player is 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.320
 seriously injured then my team to 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.610
 from now on he will not respect the fair 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.860
 play so you know all the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.240
 players but other teams simply 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.500
 that you do not have because we do not 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.090
 we were the ball outside and not the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.800
 have when when better they fall 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.110
 because we are not going to stop the 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.480
 party because we had been talking 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.100
 with the boys and today he left 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.100
 felipe and we will not use it 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.650
 good
