00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
grammar is cool I guess I then tried to

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.759 
grammar is cool I guess I then tried to
shut<00:03:17.549> off<00:03:17.670> my<00:03:17.909> ps3<00:03:18.239> but<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.079> was<00:03:19.200> burned<00:03:19.500> onto

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
the screen then I stepped onto my

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.410 
the screen then I stepped onto my
controller<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.680> assume<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.519> breaks<00:03:23.819> because<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
controller I assume it breaks because it

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.089 
controller I assume it breaks because it
doesn't<00:03:24.750> seem<00:03:25.230> like<00:03:25.439> it<00:03:25.590> could<00:03:25.709> support<00:03:25.950> your

who would disagree with me I think that

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.379 
who would disagree with me I think that
stories<00:04:01.919> at<00:04:02.190> least<00:04:02.220> good<00:04:02.519> ones<00:04:02.729> need<00:04:03.060> some

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
stories at least good ones need some

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.449 
stories at least good ones need some
sort<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:03.690> comprehensive<00:04:04.109> plot<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.129> you<00:04:05.340> know

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
sort of comprehensive plot and you know

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.280 
sort of comprehensive plot and you know
a<00:04:05.669> series<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.150> events<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.659> actually<00:04:06.900> makes

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
a series of events that actually makes

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.729 
a series of events that actually makes
sense<00:04:08.299> yeah<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.629> also<00:04:10.049> needs<00:04:10.349> some<00:04:10.500> sort<00:04:10.650> of

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
sense yeah it also needs some sort of

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.080 
sense yeah it also needs some sort of
plausibility<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.519> my<00:04:11.639> opinion<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.060> mean

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
plausibility in my opinion I mean

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.259 
plausibility in my opinion I mean

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
the world in real life is plausible

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.210

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
finding a hacked ps3 game disc is

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.999 
finding a hacked ps3 game disc is
infinitely<00:04:20.849> less<00:04:21.090> likely<00:04:21.539> to<00:04:21.690> happen

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
infinitely less likely to happen

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:23.779 
infinitely less likely to happen
considering<00:04:23.009> all<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.220> work<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.370> has<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.699> be

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
considering all the work that has to be

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.810 
considering all the work that has to be
