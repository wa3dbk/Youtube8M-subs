hi<00:00:10.530> there<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.160> video<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.820> want<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> look<00:00:12.240> at

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
hi there in this video I want to look at

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.020 
hi there in this video I want to look at
the<00:00:12.420> usage<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.900> vocoder<00:00:13.670> because<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.940> a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the usage of a vocoder because it's a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.849 
the usage of a vocoder because it's a
great<00:00:15.299> way<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.690> make<00:00:15.929> tracks<00:00:16.170> interact<00:00:16.619> in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
great way to make tracks interact in

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.609 
great way to make tracks interact in
this<00:00:17.580> example<00:00:18.000> I'll<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.480> using<00:00:18.630> my<00:00:19.020> voice<00:00:19.320> as

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
this example I'll be using my voice as

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.890 
this example I'll be using my voice as
kind<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.039> complex<00:00:20.580> filter<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.210> writing<00:00:21.810> my

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
kind of a complex filter and writing my

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.380 
kind of a complex filter and writing my
big<00:00:22.140> orchestral<00:00:22.619> pad<00:00:22.890> sound<00:00:23.310> through<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.029> to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
big orchestral pad sound through it to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.120 
big orchestral pad sound through it to
create<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.720> kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.050> chordal<00:00:25.590> strange

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
create this kind of chordal strange

device<00:00:31.019> looks<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.590> multiband<00:00:32.099> dynamics<00:00:32.160> was

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
device looks like multiband dynamics was

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.069 
device looks like multiband dynamics was
but<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.270> were<00:00:33.329> able<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> look<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.870> last

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
but we were able to look at that last

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
but we were able to look at that last
week<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.800> let's<00:00:34.920> check<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.250> vocoder<00:00:35.700> this

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
week so let's check out vocoder this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
week so let's check out vocoder this
week<00:00:36.530> before<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.620> even<00:00:37.710> get<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> plug-in

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
week before we even get to the plug-in

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
week before we even get to the plug-in
though<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> find<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> most

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
though what I find to be the most

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.930 
though what I find to be the most
important<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:40.980> when<00:00:41.190> dealing<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
important thing when dealing with with a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360 
important thing when dealing with with a
vocoder<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> process<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.129> voice

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
vocoder is how you process the voice

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.119 
vocoder is how you process the voice
before<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.180> gets<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> vocoder<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.170> vocoder

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
before it gets to the vocoder a vocoder

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.670 
before it gets to the vocoder a vocoder
is<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> bank<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.210> highly<00:00:48.809> resonant<00:00:49.230> bandpass

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
is a bank of highly resonant bandpass

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.160 
is a bank of highly resonant bandpass
filters<00:00:50.129> maybe<00:00:50.579> 20<00:00:51.000> different<00:00:51.030> filters<00:00:51.600> each

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
filters maybe 20 different filters each

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.470 
filters maybe 20 different filters each
of<00:00:52.350> these<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.590> resonant<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> put<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
of these are resonant and if you put a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
of these are resonant and if you put a
very<00:00:55.110> dynamic<00:00:55.289> signal<00:00:56.070> through<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> like

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
very dynamic signal through it like

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.990 
very dynamic signal through it like
spoken<00:00:57.210> word<00:00:57.590> that's<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.770> compressed<00:00:59.160> it'll

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
spoken word that's not compressed it'll

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.729 
spoken word that's not compressed it'll
tend<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.480> some<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> those<00:01:01.020> filters<00:01:01.500> go

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tend to make some of those filters go

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.060 
tend to make some of those filters go
nuts

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
nuts

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
nuts
they'll<00:01:02.370> distort<00:01:03.149> null<00:01:03.390> ring<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.320> don't

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
they'll distort null ring and you don't

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
they'll distort null ring and you don't
get<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> really<00:01:04.890> good<00:01:05.010> character<00:01:05.400> from<00:01:05.729> them

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
get a really good character from them

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
get a really good character from them
from<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> vocoder<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> heavily

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
from the vocoder so if you heavily

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
from the vocoder so if you heavily
compress<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> vocal<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.810> has<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> much

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
compress the vocal first it has a much

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
compress the vocal first it has a much
better<00:01:10.380> chance<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.890> working<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
better chance of working with the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330 
better chance of working with the
vocoder<00:01:11.970> later<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.530> did<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
vocoder later so I did that with the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
vocoder later so I did that with the
multiband<00:01:14.820> dynamics<00:01:14.909> plug-in<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> let's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
multiband dynamics plug-in and let's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
multiband dynamics plug-in and let's
look<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> settings<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.670> using<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:18.119> in

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
look at the settings I'm using I'm in

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
look at the settings I'm using I'm in
heavy<00:01:19.500> compression<00:01:20.159> mode<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:21.030> I've<00:01:21.240> chosen

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
heavy compression mode right I've chosen

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560 
heavy compression mode right I've chosen
a<00:01:21.750> threshold<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.500> around<00:01:23.119> negative<00:01:24.119> 40

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
a threshold of around negative 40

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
a threshold of around negative 40
decibels<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> low<00:01:25.830> threshold<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
decibels it's a low threshold for a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060 
decibels it's a low threshold for a
compressor<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.500> drag<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:28.920> down

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
compressor and then you drag up and down

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.620 
compressor and then you drag up and down
here<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> set<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.610> compression<00:01:30.180> amount<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
here to set your compression amount and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.890 
here to set your compression amount and
it's<00:01:31.140> set<00:01:31.350> quite<00:01:31.650> heavy<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.600> quiet

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
it's set quite heavy the but the quiet

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
it's set quite heavy the but the quiet
band<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> set<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> gating<00:01:35.070> mode<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.759> rid

so<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.260> see<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:59.010> being<00:01:59.250> compressed

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
so we see that it's being compressed

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.700 
so we see that it's being compressed
quite<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> bit<00:02:00.510> in<00:02:00.690> fact<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.230> and<00:02:01.590> the

flattened out the dynamics on my voice
it<00:02:11.220> sounds<00:02:11.550> kind<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.940> funny<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.720> small<00:02:13.200> by

it sounds kind of funny and small by

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.500 
it sounds kind of funny and small by
itself<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.550> into<00:02:14.760> vocoder<00:02:15.210> it

will<00:02:15.690> work<00:02:15.840> well<00:02:16.610> now<00:02:17.610> when<00:02:17.790> working<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.180> the

will work well now when working with the
Bo<00:02:18.420> coder<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.900> find<00:02:19.320> it's<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.770> useful<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.370> be

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
Bo coder I find it's really useful to be

Bo coder I find it's really useful to be

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
able to blend in some of the dry but

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.220 
able to blend in some of the dry but
also<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.610> able<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.910> process<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.690> dry<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.170> a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
also be able to process the dry in a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.860 
also be able to process the dry in a
different<00:02:25.530> way<00:02:25.650> than<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.550> vocoder<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.750> be

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
different way than the vocoder to be

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.050 
different way than the vocoder to be

able to do that in live we need to

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.210 
able to do that in live we need to
create<00:02:30.300> an<00:02:30.570> effect<00:02:30.990> rack<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.770> get<00:02:31.920> kind<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
create an effect rack and we get kind of

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.400 
create an effect rack and we get kind of
parallel<00:02:32.670> chains<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.540> allow<00:02:33.750> me<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.990> process

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
parallel chains that allow me to process

than the VOC oded signal I do that by

I'll<00:02:48.780> just<00:02:49.050> name<00:02:49.200> vocoder<00:02:50.360> in<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:52.140> example<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
I'll just name vocoder in this example I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.990 
I'll just name vocoder in this example I
want<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.010> get<00:02:53.130> like<00:02:53.280> more<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.550> an<00:02:53.640> aggressive

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
want to get like more of an aggressive

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.870 
want to get like more of an aggressive
sound<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.080> go<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.470> vocoder<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.730> I'll

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
sound to go with this vocoder so I'll

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
sound to go with this vocoder so I'll
create<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.150> second<00:02:57.540> chain<00:02:57.750> that'll<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.320> my

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
create a second chain that'll have my

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.610 
create a second chain that'll have my
voice<00:02:58.770> but<00:02:59.130> distorted<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.989> do<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.230> I'll<00:03:01.470> just

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
voice but distorted to do that I'll just

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.710 
voice but distorted to do that I'll just
right-click<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.340> create<00:03:02.700> chain<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.420> I'll

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
right-click and create chain and I'll

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.770 
right-click and create chain and I'll
rename<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.260> distort<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.600> that's<00:03:06.600> where<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
rename this distort and that's where I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.330 
rename this distort and that's where I
would<00:03:06.840> put<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.680> distortion<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:11.040> vocoder

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
would put the distortion and the vocoder

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.009 
would put the distortion and the vocoder
chain<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:14.310> default<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> carrier

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
chain the default is to have the carrier

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.770 
chain the default is to have the carrier
set<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> noise<00:03:16.860> now<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.790> carrier<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.540> the

set to noise now the carrier is the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.900 
set to noise now the carrier is the
sound<00:03:19.170> that's<00:03:19.290> running<00:03:19.530> through<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.489> filters

sound that's running through the filters
in<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.360> case<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.780> Kerr<00:03:22.019> will<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.290> my<00:03:22.410> pad

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
in this case the Kerr will be my pad

instance<00:03:44.930> for<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.380> routing<00:03:46.709> point<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.220> think

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
instance for a routing point I think

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.610 
instance for a routing point I think
post-effects<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.450> good<00:03:48.720> setting<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.470> that

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
post-effects is a good setting so that

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.680 
post-effects is a good setting so that
way<00:03:49.769> even<00:03:49.980> though<00:03:50.130> my<00:03:50.310> pad<00:03:50.610> track<00:03:51.090> has<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.450> very

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
way even though my pad track has a very

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.420 
way even though my pad track has a very
low<00:03:51.840> volume<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.410> also<00:03:52.709> get<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:52.980> good<00:03:53.160> signal

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
low volume I also get a good signal

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.530 
low volume I also get a good signal
going<00:03:53.549> into<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> vocoder<00:03:55.970> now<00:03:56.970> I'd<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.420> to

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
going into the vocoder now I'd like to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.759 
going into the vocoder now I'd like to
move<00:03:57.630> over<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.049> one<00:03:58.200> I've<00:03:58.320> already<00:03:58.560> built

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
move over to the one I've already built

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.070 
move over to the one I've already built
so<00:03:59.730> we<00:03:59.850> can<00:04:00.000> see<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.390> kind<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.630> settings<00:04:00.959> I've

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
so we can see that kind of settings I've

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.470 
so we can see that kind of settings I've
been<00:04:01.200> using<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:04.549> let's<00:04:05.549> hear<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:06.359> the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
been using and let's hear just the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:18.000 
been using and let's hear just the
vocoder<00:04:06.840> chain

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.960 

so<00:04:19.010> we<00:04:19.100> can<00:04:19.250> hear<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.489> sounds<00:04:19.760> kind<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:19.910> like

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
so we can hear it sounds kind of like

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.759 
so we can hear it sounds kind of like
that<00:04:20.150> pad<00:04:20.359> sound<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:21.019> running<00:04:21.530> kind<00:04:21.650> of

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
that pad sound is running kind of

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.560 
that pad sound is running kind of
through<00:04:22.070> my<00:04:22.190> voice<00:04:22.430> or<00:04:22.730> through<00:04:22.850> my<00:04:22.940> mouth<00:04:23.180> to

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
through my voice or through my mouth to

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.550 
through my voice or through my mouth to
get<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.810> became<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.170> kind<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.350> vocal

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
get it became the kind of vocal

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.470 
get it became the kind of vocal
character<00:04:25.130> now<00:04:25.670> it's<00:04:25.820> kind<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.060> hard<00:04:26.120> to

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
character now it's kind of hard to

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.570 
character now it's kind of hard to
understand<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.020> words<00:04:27.260> with<00:04:28.100> this<00:04:28.250> setting

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
understand the words with this setting

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.650 
understand the words with this setting
and<00:04:28.670> that's<00:04:28.730> often<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.120> case<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.510> vote

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
and that's often the case of the vote

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.840 
and that's often the case of the vote
coders<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.080> find<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.410> big<00:04:30.560> challenge<00:04:30.920> is<00:04:31.310> kind<00:04:31.730> of

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
coders I find a big challenge is kind of

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.280 
coders I find a big challenge is kind of
getting<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.120> balance<00:04:32.570> between<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:33.050> Sunday

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
getting that balance between it's Sunday

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.990 
getting that balance between it's Sunday
night<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.560> robotic<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.220> actually<00:04:34.760> being

night and robotic and actually being

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.720 
night and robotic and actually being
able<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.210> understand<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.780> words<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.730> approach

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
able to understand the words I approach

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.610 
able to understand the words I approach
it<00:04:37.760> by<00:04:38.240> creating<00:04:38.570> a<00:04:38.630> second<00:04:39.020> chain<00:04:39.320> and

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
it by creating a second chain and

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.680 
it by creating a second chain and
putting<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.220> high-pass<00:04:40.850> filter<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.420> a

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
putting a high-pass filter and a

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.680 
putting a high-pass filter and a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
distortion on it if I blend this in you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.670 
distortion on it if I blend this in you
will<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:44.990> able<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.169> understand<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.590> words

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
will be able to understand the words

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:55.210 
will be able to understand the words
much<00:04:45.950> better<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:50.960> can<00:04:51.140> turn<00:04:51.440> this<00:04:51.530> up<00:04:54.220> and

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
much better and I can turn this up and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.920 
much better and I can turn this up and
get<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.580> balance<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.060> like<00:04:56.270> between<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.810> two

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
get a balance I like between the two

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.690 
get a balance I like between the two
signals<00:04:57.169> I<00:04:57.530> like<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.919> keep<00:04:58.040> this<00:04:58.160> fairly<00:04:58.520> low

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
signals I like to keep this fairly low

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.970 
signals I like to keep this fairly low
if<00:04:59.630> you're<00:04:59.810> not<00:05:00.020> using<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.440> second<00:05:00.800> chain

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
if you're not using a second chain

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
if you're not using a second chain
that's<00:05:01.520> fine

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
that's fine

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.970 
that's fine
you'll<00:05:02.419> have<00:05:02.570> to<00:05:02.690> use<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.810> unvoiced<00:05:03.380> section

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
you'll have to use the unvoiced section

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.040 
you'll have to use the unvoiced section
to<00:05:04.280> let<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.490> s<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:05.030> F<00:05:05.120> silence<00:05:05.570> come<00:05:05.750> through

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
to let the s and F silence come through

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.020 
to let the s and F silence come through
and<00:05:06.290> then<00:05:06.710> maybe<00:05:06.919> lower<00:05:07.190> dry/wet<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.760> little

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
and then maybe lower dry/wet a little

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.640 
and then maybe lower dry/wet a little
bit<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.570> get<00:05:08.690> little<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.020> drug<00:05:09.290> to<00:05:09.470> let<00:05:09.620> a

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
bit to get little that drug to let a

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.110 
bit to get little that drug to let a
little<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.040> dry<00:05:10.280> through<00:05:10.580> which<00:05:10.940> will<00:05:11.030> help

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
little to dry through which will help

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.990 
little to dry through which will help
understand<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.660> words<00:05:11.870> but<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.380> like<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:13.340> two

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
understand the words but I like the two

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.230 
understand the words but I like the two
chains<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.479> distorting<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.380> second<00:05:15.680> one

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
chains and distorting the second one

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.670 
chains and distorting the second one
some<00:05:17.240> settings<00:05:17.540> in<00:05:17.660> vocoder<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.530> you'll

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
some settings in vocoder that you'll

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.190 
some settings in vocoder that you'll
want<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.950> use<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:20.030> mange<00:05:20.300> three<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.140> think

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
want to use the mange three that I think

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.510 
want to use the mange three that I think
are<00:05:21.470> really<00:05:21.590> useful<00:05:21.830> are<00:05:22.160> going<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.430> be

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
are really useful are going to be

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.659 
are really useful are going to be

release attack inform it attack and
release<00:05:25.790> act<00:05:26.240> very<00:05:26.750> much<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:27.169> way<00:05:27.290> that<00:05:27.320> they

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
release act very much the way that they

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.860 
release act very much the way that they
do<00:05:27.590> in<00:05:27.890> a<00:05:28.160> compressor<00:05:28.700> and<00:05:28.850> they<00:05:29.300> control<00:05:29.660> how

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
do in a compressor and they control how

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.440 
do in a compressor and they control how

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
filters go if I increase release we get

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.260 
filters go if I increase release we get
kind<00:05:35.900> of<00:05:35.990> an<00:05:36.169> ethyl<00:05:36.890> reverb<00:05:37.520> sound<00:05:37.880> on<00:05:38.120> the

kind of an ethyl reverb sound on the

kind of an ethyl reverb sound on the
entire<00:05:38.510> thing<00:05:38.540> let's<00:05:39.020> hear<00:05:39.169> that<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:44.660> we<00:05:44.750> hear

as<00:06:04.580> low<00:06:04.760> as<00:06:04.910> possible<00:06:05.419> but<00:06:05.810> avoiding

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
as low as possible but avoiding

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.719 
as low as possible but avoiding
distortion<00:06:06.680> similar<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.400> what<00:06:07.490> we<00:06:07.580> do<00:06:07.700> with

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
distortion similar to what we do with

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.420 
distortion similar to what we do with
with<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.300> compressor<00:06:08.750> attack<00:06:08.990> and<00:06:09.140> release

with the compressor attack and release
formant<00:06:10.430> moves<00:06:11.060> those<00:06:11.390> filters<00:06:11.720> around<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.290> bit

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
formant moves those filters around a bit

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.830 
formant moves those filters around a bit
so<00:06:12.950> you<00:06:12.979> can<00:06:13.070> kind<00:06:13.250> of<00:06:13.490> make<00:06:13.669> a<00:06:13.700> man<00:06:14.330> sound<00:06:14.690> more
