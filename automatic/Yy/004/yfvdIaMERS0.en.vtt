00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
oh wow I really don't like it as much as

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.820 
oh wow I really don't like it as much as
I<00:03:37.990> thought<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.150> time<00:03:40.210> I<00:03:40.510> really<00:03:40.830> waited

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
I thought but this time I really waited

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.940 
I thought but this time I really waited
enough<00:03:42.520> time<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.750> washed<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.350> seven<00:03:44.770> times

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
enough time and I washed it seven times

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.680 
enough time and I washed it seven times
I've<00:03:45.220> washed<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.670> probably<00:03:46.090> six<00:03:46.360> times

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
I've washed it probably six times

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.370 
I've washed it probably six times
already<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.830> has<00:03:48.070> not<00:03:48.310> shed<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.850> me

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
already and it has not shed on me

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.080 
already and it has not shed on me
normally<00:03:50.380> when<00:03:50.620> i<00:03:50.650> started<00:03:51.160> i<00:03:51.370> noticed<00:03:51.970> that

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
normally when i started i noticed that

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.360 
normally when i started i noticed that
shedding<00:03:52.690> starts<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.530> happen<00:03:53.680> probably<00:03:54.100> about

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
shedding starts to happen probably about

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.030 
shedding starts to happen probably about
the<00:03:54.550> third<00:03:54.820> or<00:03:55.120> fourth<00:03:55.690> wash<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:56.770> i<00:03:56.800> guess

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
the third or fourth wash and so i guess

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.410 
the third or fourth wash and so i guess
that<00:03:57.190> I've<00:03:57.280> washed<00:03:57.490> this<00:03:57.700> probably<00:03:58.120> about<00:03:58.360> a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
that I've washed this probably about a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.530 
that I've washed this probably about a
good<00:03:58.660> six<00:03:58.900> times<00:03:59.230> now<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.860> it<00:04:00.790> hasn't<00:04:01.150> shed

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
good six times now and it hasn't shed

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.530 
good six times now and it hasn't shed
and<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.800> that's<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.190> plus<00:04:03.400> for<00:04:03.850> me<00:04:03.910> because<00:04:04.420> I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and so that's a plus for me because I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.510 
and so that's a plus for me because I
got<00:04:04.690> said<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.410> foundation<00:04:05.590> brush<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.340> was

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
got said the foundation brush that I was

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.030 
got said the foundation brush that I was
using<00:04:06.730> before<00:04:07.000> hand<00:04:07.510> was<00:04:08.230> shedding<00:04:08.590> like

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
using before hand was shedding like

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040 
using before hand was shedding like
crazy<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:09.880> did<00:04:10.150> not<00:04:10.330> like<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.570> it<00:04:10.960> was

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
crazy and I did not like that it was

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.050 
crazy and I did not like that it was
always<00:04:11.320> fun<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.710> me<00:04:11.980> having<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.280> pick<00:04:12.580> those

always fun to me having to pick those

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.990 
always fun to me having to pick those
