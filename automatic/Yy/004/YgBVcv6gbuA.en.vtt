00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 yes so that's not a lot we now 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.790
 want to analyze here is the top game 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.990
 to have to play on Monday 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.389
 but picked out the game on 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.980
 on monday even live on TV 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.340
 as shown st Paul to be cologne 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 Pauli in the lower middle field Cologne 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.650
 midfield and marco is the whole and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.220
 on the current failures 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.220
 I think 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:39.520
 st pauli falls what is big or ball 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.790
 and that adheres because both still 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.829
 in borders at kornfeld klopp none 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.730
 so far 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.040
 otherwise cologne stop in the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.510
 upward trend 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:57.010
 or the rising form curve in 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.620
 Opposite to Cologne the city nonsense too 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.690
 pauli the students actually 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.330
 more in the square and then almost 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.479
 always good games to watch but that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.979
 last game of kölner too hard too 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.470
 as a fan, that's why 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.380
 I believe the last few of those 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.759
 have also gone out of a tie or 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.509
 it can be won off I know it 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:29.979
 just not for goods each 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:36.360
 21 but I mean the last game of 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:40.530
 saint paul ii in cologne in hamburg would be 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.420
 been hard-fought 00 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.829
 the play in rhine energy 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.829
 stadium bank insane 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.759
 I mean that you can still reason else 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.009
 great I say guess due 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:08.290
 from the weather and so is also a hard 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:11.019
 be recordable place and only needs times 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:19.030
 look what that really brings on 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:20.920
 I do not have to go I did not have to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.390
 bus or fold will hurt but me 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.620
 I know exactly who they are now 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.019
 also the contract with bay man 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.709
 extended that was also times at Cologne 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.120
 at that time from the youth of dortmund after 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.989
 england changed to liverpool 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.069
 actually a pretty interesting one 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.790
 playmaker what that concerns and 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:52.500
 promising talent even if he 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 already 320 24 but otherwise 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.269
 pauli he's on the road with his players 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.230
 as well as the check of the dortmund 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.489
 is borrowed 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.170
 I believe what goals are both 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.459
 Striker so both cologne and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.349
 relatively equivalent where I believe 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.349
 that Cologne has scored a few more goals 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.520
 All in all , I'm just doing functions 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.710
 play out and that may be 1 1 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:35.470
 maybe even two suits will end 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:45.460
 I think now ends now the game of chance 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:47.640
 punished that was just a 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.640
 tidbit 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.400
 think it was not exactly as the 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.150
 play what I had for me 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.580
 kölner 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.760
 is not to look relatively bad 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.070
 A lot has happened now has 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.890
 cologne yes almost for the opportunities and 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.680
 So climbed brought since I my 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.330
 in terms of advancement fight these are 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.410
 for me three teams again 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.640
 play along and that stays outside of 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.340
 The first two are actually so good 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.160
 as by Brunswick is for me 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.720
 already written down and gets harder 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.840
 I think second place so fast 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.540
 I do not want to lose anymore either 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.580
 that the train has departed 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:41.400
 That's not how it is 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:44.120
 weak on the way and therefore how 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.220
 said we are more likely to go from 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.620
 undecided and possibly with 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.620
 easy trend to win cologne
