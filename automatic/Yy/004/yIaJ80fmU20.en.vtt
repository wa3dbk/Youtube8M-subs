00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
when I say cup I'm just adding a ladle

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.800 
when I say cup I'm just adding a ladle
full<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.569> bra<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.969> how<00:01:42.179> quickly

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
full of bra and you can see how quickly

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.949 
full of bra and you can see how quickly
the<00:01:43.740> gravy<00:01:44.249> will<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.389> how

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959
