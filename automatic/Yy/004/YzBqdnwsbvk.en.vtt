8 you can go up to 32 I believe through
customization<00:03:48.970> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910

you<00:03:57.140> can<00:03:57.260> install<00:03:57.530> games<00:03:57.890> on<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.550> it's<00:03:58.790> not

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
you can install games on that it's not

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.130 
you can install games on that it's not
just<00:03:59.210> enough<00:03:59.420> for<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.660> operating<00:04:00.050> system

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
just enough for the operating system

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.170 
just enough for the operating system
it's<00:04:00.710> also<00:04:00.860> got<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.070> one<00:04:01.250> terabyte<00:04:01.460> hard<00:04:01.850> drive

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
it's also got a one terabyte hard drive

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.700 
it's also got a one terabyte hard drive
that's<00:04:02.420> sort<00:04:02.600> of<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.780> combo<00:04:03.170> on<00:04:03.350> there<00:04:03.560> which

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
that's sort of the combo on there which

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.030 
that's sort of the combo on there which
is<00:04:03.740> a<00:04:03.830> really<00:04:03.920> nice<00:04:04.250> touch<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:06.230> display<00:04:06.710> as

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
is a really nice touch the display as

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.730 
is a really nice touch the display as
mentioned<00:04:07.460> before<00:04:07.550> full<00:04:08.330> 1080p<00:04:08.720> display<00:04:09.380> it's

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
mentioned before full 1080p display it's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.530 
mentioned before full 1080p display it's
also<00:04:09.920> I'd<00:04:10.430> say<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.790> weakest<00:04:11.120> point<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.480> the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
also I'd say the weakest point of the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.320 
also I'd say the weakest point of the
hardware<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.760> horizontal<00:04:13.760> viewing<00:04:14.030> angles

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
hardware the horizontal viewing angles

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.970 
hardware the horizontal viewing angles
are<00:04:14.360> actually<00:04:14.660> pretty<00:04:14.930> good<00:04:15.170> on<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.710> display

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
are actually pretty good on this display

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.979 
are actually pretty good on this display
but<00:04:16.610> I<00:04:16.670> find<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.209> vertical<00:04:17.480> up-and-down

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
but I find that the vertical up-and-down

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.430 
but I find that the vertical up-and-down
is<00:04:18.830> not<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.400> great<00:04:19.640> it's<00:04:20.450> a<00:04:20.540> good<00:04:20.750> non<00:04:21.019> glossy

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
is not that great it's a good non glossy

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.190 
is not that great it's a good non glossy
display<00:04:21.560> though<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:22.760> say<00:04:23.510> for<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.870> size<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.110> the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
display though I say for the size of the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.780 
display though I say for the size of the
bezel<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.530> probably<00:04:24.830> could<00:04:25.010> have<00:04:25.070> gone<00:04:25.190> 1920

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
bezel that probably could have gone 1920

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.260 
bezel that probably could have gone 1920
by<00:04:25.910> 1200<00:04:26.210> that's<00:04:27.140> my<00:04:27.290> preference<00:04:27.830> but<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.910> lot

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
by 1200 that's my preference but a lot

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.010 
by 1200 that's my preference but a lot
of<00:04:29.360> people<00:04:29.600> play<00:04:29.810> on<00:04:30.080> 1080<00:04:30.890> displays<00:04:31.640> so<00:04:32.060> it's

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
of people play on 1080 displays so it's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.960 
of people play on 1080 displays so it's
not<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.200> bad<00:04:33.440> display<00:04:34.220> but<00:04:34.400> I'd<00:04:34.490> say<00:04:34.640> it<00:04:34.730> is<00:04:34.820> the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
not a bad display but I'd say it is the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.730 
not a bad display but I'd say it is the
weakest<00:04:35.270> part<00:04:35.420> of<00:04:35.450> all<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.690> hardware<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.260> the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
weakest part of all the hardware on the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.990 
weakest part of all the hardware on the
software<00:04:37.070> side<00:04:37.190> it's<00:04:37.580> actually<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.850> really

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
software side it's actually a really

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.720 
software side it's actually a really
good<00:04:38.270> story<00:04:38.570> with<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:38.870> PC<00:04:39.290> one<00:04:40.100> thing<00:04:40.280> that

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
good story with this PC one thing that

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.250 
good story with this PC one thing that

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.360 
will change and you know the lighting
display<00:05:14.090> will<00:05:14.270> change<00:05:14.470> based<00:05:15.470> on<00:05:15.650> what<00:05:15.980> game

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
display will change based on what game

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.190 
display will change based on what game
you<00:05:16.580> open<00:05:16.910> or<00:05:17.060> what<00:05:17.210> program<00:05:17.570> you<00:05:17.720> open<00:05:18.050> you

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
you open or what program you open you

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.450 
you open or what program you open you
can<00:05:18.350> have<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:18.770> double<00:05:19.130> click<00:05:19.280> on<00:05:19.310> an

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
can have it so you double click on an

icon to open up a specific game and the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.620 
icon to open up a specific game and the
whole<00:05:22.010> PC<00:05:22.370> will<00:05:22.610> change<00:05:23.300> into<00:05:23.510> that

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
whole PC will change into that

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.630 
whole PC will change into that
particular<00:05:24.470> mode<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:25.010> that's<00:05:25.100> kind<00:05:25.340> of<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.460> neat

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
it I think it works with the design it's

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.020 
it I think it works with the design it's
really<00:06:44.800> good<00:06:44.920> at<00:06:45.040> what<00:06:45.160> it<00:06:45.190> does<00:06:45.280> the<00:06:45.730> harbor
