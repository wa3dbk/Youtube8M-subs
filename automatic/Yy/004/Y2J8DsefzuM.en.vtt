 in any case it really interesting 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.780
 there you can see it up info 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.980
 extermination title up I'm going to do that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.540
 in a hurry to show you a little 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.310
 how does it happen to you put 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.630

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.430
 small dots so the activity area 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.930
 we're going to put it here to you 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.670
 little spawn dots so here up the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.990
 living room camera so here I do a little 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.920
 everything and anything pump hurry 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.750
 shows you a little bit about how it feels 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.210
 that's the radius of the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.220
 limit of play outside in my opinion you 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.450
 can not access the dish there you 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.590
 put the little bridges exponent I 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.790
 believe that these frames of 8b is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.040
 four decades if you are only yes 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.150
 player called back to 4 in the team a 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.500
 Then we will put the team 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.750
 justice '' hop there four little dots 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.250
 spawn here then here you can you 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.630
 have fun doing this bridge arts of 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.610
 sets to pistols I had some 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.900
 little guns here then have you 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.190
 can put small vehicles of which 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.930
 seem are going to take him to the roof of 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.040
 the team stowers it does not really serve to 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.850
 something from me vehicles but 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.490
 it can make little traps 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.690
 explosive device there barriers to 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.890
 you can even put pedestrians 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.660
 atmosphere and traffic 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.310
 so that in my opinion had called for 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.810
 pnj who wander pedestrians times pnj 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.910
 who walks on the roof it can be 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.379

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.149
