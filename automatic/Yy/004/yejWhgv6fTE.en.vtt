00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.509

 all good second split game and 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.810
 we already saw that the premiere was very 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.660
 well but they would be able to continue the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.129
 streak right away we see it in the phase of 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.320
 tics and we kept the usual in 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.269
 transfers stinging the tremendous 3 of 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.489
 leader as we clearly like to follow 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.559
 also web did not exist with which one of 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.500
 his best characters without a doubt 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.300
 jacques the copenhagen team in word 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.030
 they also looked for surprise with the pick of 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.379
 Karim also liked the clip of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.120
 calista at the hands of frizz 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.640
 but good let's go with the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.199
 compositions we go with them starting 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.180
 for our giants because he was going to 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.309
 distribute lighthouse ties through the top link with 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.470
 charles frederick that would go with beat for 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.960
 the jungle of money this time would play its 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.880
 very good jari and in the voice line adriÃ  

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.250
 I would distribute bast with serious and finally 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.320
 as I do not riddle with three a composition 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.210
 with very good initiation with the charles 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.130
 of I will make the death sentences of three 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.259
 and even the last beat and the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.730
 composition of the Copenhagen wolves 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.290
 it would be the next me 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.080
 so that I would try to face 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.270
 webber live with dar in the double air box 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.210
 that he was going to gallop into the jungle with 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.520
 the cadiz on whether he wanted chera freeze 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.550
 we were surprised everyone catching the dc 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.130
 newest calista and brawn the one chosen by 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.720
 a leader for his bearing speak something that 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.980
 we were very surprised everyone was the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.840
 double is maite in the team 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.030
 copenhagen wolves and is that brawn decided 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.740
 play with the crush something that I eat 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.420
 we will see the line quite difficult 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.369
 our guys 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.680
 despite this the game started well 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.450
 for our team minute 4 and it arrived 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.610
 the first start or double by part 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.040
 of frederic that would end in a flash 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.659
 by yaks and nothing later 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.149
 cucumber would take this to 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.729
 get the first blood lane voice 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.890
 I was suffering enough limestone tube 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.759
 brawn was very solid and they dominated without 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.860
 problems 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.410
 so the reinforcements arrived with a 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.989
 tele by de waverly although the thing is not 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.030
 it ends very well so it saves for a little bit 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.989
 Finish in triple to finally call 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.989
 it ended up falling in 3 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.530
 later pinedo and frederic put the 2 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.720
 to 1 on the score hunting the sweetheart 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.879
 meanwhile of the population and continued with 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.530
 reader problems I was about 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.250
 of dying again even though it finally 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.250
 saves by the hair 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.049
 another Angangueo has arrived to the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.629
 top and john buck who did not tell him his 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.640
 mother or that back from the tower almost 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.010
 He has Freddy ahead 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.870
 at the same time that copenhagen world is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.120
 it made the first dragon and it stayed that way 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.680
 within the game in this move of 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.040
 Flat flame by both top 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.959
 leiner and first kill for jacques and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.120
 now please pay close attention because a 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.720
 superhero came to the crack super 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.720
 Fred of life 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.380
 after this player we did not 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.930
 we will never see it 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.360
 chayanne rotaria david name and adri se 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.670
 he would take his first agile and the team 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.170
 the first turret of the line were still 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.030
 pressing and they also took the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.090
 second tower is the advantage began to 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.890
 be very considerable all this advantage 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.320
 was used to take over the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.660
 second dragon of the game and put the 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.220
 equality in this aspect while yayas 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.260
 dealt with in a coordinated way and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.060
 perfect to the table in berlin tank 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.190
 endorse all possible damage by making 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.760
 perfect bait 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.980
 and as a prize they would win 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.960
 of 10 that have already continue to squeeze 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.690
 up to take brawn limestone and the 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.460
 Tier 2 turret of top approaches 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.770
 giants was making his third dragon 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.690
 wolf operator initiated a male of a 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.060
 way a little hasty but good and 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.520
 he threw himself with everything and made another game 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.890
 getting a triple kill with this 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.900
 performance of waverly giant neutralized 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.580
 the advantage I had gotten 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.530
 combining the wall with the biggest and 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.970
 encarrilaba to heading towards 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.160
 victory but one was missing one last 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.930
 push to translate this advantage into 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.940
 victory so you can see how 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.950
 finally they were made with the first male 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.900
 major of the game and in case this was not 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.600
 enough the tops are getting 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.880
 what would be his fourth dragon donkey 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.980
 with all this now if our giants 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.360
 he did not doubt it for a second and they destroyed 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.510
 what they caught ahead to finish 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.680
 the game and marmoset to carve second 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.840
 match and second victory in the ls no 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.910
 could start better recapitulating a 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.400
 little from the beginning we saw how the 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.410
 Indian voice ians began suffering in 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.520
 part thanks to that amazing smile 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.900
 that presented us 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.669
 to this advantage he talks about 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.410
 would translate into the first dragon of the 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.509
 departure for copenhagen world without 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.610
 however the opposite happened in the 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.460
 double start wherli with the help of your 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.500
 money they made him the possible 10 anal but 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.300
 little by little the ones that were happening towards 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.650
 the side of our guys and the team 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.659
 it was becoming an authentic 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.210
 steamroller machine if we add to this 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.879
 the fourth dragon group over snacks 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.190
 york giants had everything necessary to 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.020
 launch and end the game like that 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.699
 little more on our part then 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.690
 we wait as always in the next 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.690
 goodbye video
