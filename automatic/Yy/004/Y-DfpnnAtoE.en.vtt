done<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> good<00:01:48.210> job<00:01:48.270> paving<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.899> way<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
done a good job paving the way in the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
done a good job paving the way in the
run<00:01:49.439> game<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.860> far<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.130> davis<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.670> wilds<00:01:50.939> are

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
run game so far and davis and wilds are

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.350 
run game so far and davis and wilds are
out<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> good<00:01:51.869> start<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.350> season<00:01:53.360> UCF

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
out to a good start to this season UCF

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
out to a good start to this season UCF
is<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.899> undersized<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.920> some<00:01:56.490> big

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
is not undersized they have some big

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.980 
is not undersized they have some big
guys<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:57.149> front<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.540> d

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
guys up front on d

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.600 
guys up front on d
but<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.110> think<00:01:59.410> Davis<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.920> wilds<00:02:00.220> can't<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:00.580> a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
but I think Davis and wilds can't have a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.490 
but I think Davis and wilds can't have a
good<00:02:00.790> game<00:02:00.970> Penn<00:02:01.630> State<00:02:01.900> had<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.110> pretty<00:02:02.320> good

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
good game Penn State had a pretty good

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.930 
good game Penn State had a pretty good
game<00:02:02.680> running<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.130> ball<00:02:03.280> particularly<00:02:03.700> in

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
game running the ball particularly in

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.160 
game running the ball particularly in
the<00:02:04.000> second<00:02:04.360> half<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.840> think<00:02:04.900> that's

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the second half and I think that's

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.300 
the second half and I think that's
something<00:02:05.350> South<00:02:05.680> Carolina<00:02:06.010> can<00:02:06.130> take

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
something South Carolina can take

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.219 
something South Carolina can take
advantage<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.910> Connor<00:02:07.540> Shaw<00:02:07.780> will<00:02:07.840> be<00:02:07.990> key<00:02:08.200> in

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
advantage of Connor Shaw will be key in

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.139 
advantage of Connor Shaw will be key in
the<00:02:08.410> game<00:02:08.560> too<00:02:08.800> he'll<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.460> counted<00:02:09.790> on<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.910> run

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
the game too he'll be counted on to run

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.330 
the game too he'll be counted on to run
the<00:02:10.270> ball<00:02:10.420> some<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.930> zone<00:02:11.110> read<00:02:11.380> take<00:02:12.160> off

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
the ball some in the zone read take off

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.160 
the ball some in the zone read take off
when<00:02:12.580> things<00:02:12.790> aren't<00:02:13.030> there<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.480> deliver<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
when things aren't there and deliver the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.840 
when things aren't there and deliver the
ball<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.590> get<00:02:14.770> did<00:02:15.070> against<00:02:15.310> Vanderbilt

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
ball like you get did against Vanderbilt

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.000 
ball like you get did against Vanderbilt
if<00:02:16.420> those<00:02:16.600> three<00:02:17.110> guys<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.560> think<00:02:17.740> can<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
if those three guys I think can have a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.710 
if those three guys I think can have a
good<00:02:18.190> game<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.460> South<00:02:19.030> Carolina<00:02:19.150> plays<00:02:19.510> well

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
good game and South Carolina plays well

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.760 
good game and South Carolina plays well
up<00:02:19.840> front<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.110> think<00:02:20.290> they<00:02:20.380> can<00:02:20.530> score<00:02:20.740> some

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
up front I think they can score some

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.350 
up front I think they can score some
points<00:02:21.100> yeah<00:02:21.460> i<00:02:21.490> know<00:02:21.610> i'll<00:02:21.820> definitely<00:02:22.330> be

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
points yeah i know i'll definitely be

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.390 
points yeah i know i'll definitely be
looking<00:02:22.510> at<00:02:23.050> Brandon<00:02:23.290> wilds<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:23.890> Mike<00:02:24.100> Davis

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
looking at Brandon wilds and Mike Davis

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.730 
looking at Brandon wilds and Mike Davis
and<00:02:24.730> as<00:02:24.820> well<00:02:25.060> Connor<00:02:25.450> Shaw<00:02:25.810> who<00:02:26.110> historically

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
and as well Connor Shaw who historically

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.460 
and as well Connor Shaw who historically
doesn't<00:02:27.460> play<00:02:27.670> very<00:02:28.000> well<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.660> road<00:02:28.840> do

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
doesn't play very well on the road do

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.230 
doesn't play very well on the road do
you<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.860> we<00:02:30.010> could<00:02:30.160> see<00:02:30.370> Dylan<00:02:30.700> Thompson<00:02:30.970> I

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
you think we could see Dylan Thompson I

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.120 
you think we could see Dylan Thompson I
asked<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:31.870> before<00:02:32.020> Georgia<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:32.980> had<00:02:33.100> a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
asked you this before Georgia we had a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.890 
asked you this before Georgia we had a
little<00:02:33.340> discussion<00:02:33.550> about<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.090> what<00:02:34.780> do<00:02:34.840> you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
little discussion about it what do you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.780 
little discussion about it what do you
think<00:02:34.990> quarterback<00:02:35.709> wise<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.280> think<00:02:36.459> Shaw

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
think quarterback wise do you think Shaw

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.760 
think quarterback wise do you think Shaw
will<00:02:36.970> play<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.300> entire<00:02:37.540> game<00:02:37.600> it's<00:02:38.530> possible

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
will play the entire game it's possible

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.160 
will play the entire game it's possible
but<00:02:39.130> Steve<00:02:39.459> Spurrier<00:02:39.820> has<00:02:40.030> once<00:02:40.450> again<00:02:40.600> as<00:02:41.050> he

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
but Steve Spurrier has once again as he

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.540 
but Steve Spurrier has once again as he
probably<00:02:41.350> will<00:02:41.590> every<00:02:41.890> week<00:02:42.070> he's<00:02:42.280> left<00:02:42.490> the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
probably will every week he's left the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.010 
probably will every week he's left the
door<00:02:42.730> open<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:43.060> Dylan<00:02:43.390> Thompson<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.840> play

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
door open for Dylan Thompson to play

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.070 
door open for Dylan Thompson to play
it's<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:44.950> really<00:02:45.130> an<00:02:45.310> issue<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.209> know<00:02:46.240> him

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
it's not really an issue of you know him

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.050 
it's not really an issue of you know him
playing<00:02:47.350> better<00:02:47.620> than<00:02:47.709> Shaw<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.340> vice<00:02:48.760> versa

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
playing better than Shaw or vice versa

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.540 
playing better than Shaw or vice versa
it's<00:02:49.300> just<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:50.380> Spurrier<00:02:50.740> feels<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.250> Dylan

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
it's just that Spurrier feels that Dylan

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.670 
it's just that Spurrier feels that Dylan
Thompson<00:02:51.730> sort<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.240> deserves<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.690> play<00:02:52.810> they

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
Thompson sort of deserves to play they

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.770 
Thompson sort of deserves to play they
like<00:02:53.860> what<00:02:54.010> he<00:02:54.100> brings<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.490> table<00:02:54.750> he's<00:02:55.750> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
like what he brings to the table he's a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.270 
like what he brings to the table he's a
different<00:02:56.200> type<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.410> quarterback<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.160> maybe

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
different type of quarterback and maybe

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.340 
different type of quarterback and maybe
in<00:02:57.430> certain<00:02:57.580> situations<00:02:58.050> they'll<00:02:59.050> get<00:02:59.170> to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
in certain situations they'll get to

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.900 
in certain situations they'll get to
Dylan<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.740> this<00:02:59.890> game<00:03:00.100> depending<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.790> how

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
Dylan in this game depending on how

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.720 
Dylan in this game depending on how
things<00:03:01.150> go<00:03:01.390> now<00:03:02.080> moving<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.739> defense<00:03:03.400> which

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
things go now moving on to defense which

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.509 
things go now moving on to defense which
has<00:03:03.760> been<00:03:04.180> an<00:03:04.570> interesting<00:03:05.100> side<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.340> ball

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
has been an interesting side of the ball

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.430 
has been an interesting side of the ball
for<00:03:06.760> South<00:03:06.940> Carolina<00:03:07.390> lately<00:03:07.780> what<00:03:08.140> are<00:03:08.260> some

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
for South Carolina lately what are some

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.110 
for South Carolina lately what are some
key<00:03:08.620> players<00:03:08.800> on<00:03:09.100> defense<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.760> need<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.030> have

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
key players on defense that need to have

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.270 
key players on defense that need to have
a<00:03:10.209> standout<00:03:10.540> game<00:03:10.780> for<00:03:11.380> both<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.860> Gamecocks

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
a standout game for both the Gamecocks

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.150 
a standout game for both the Gamecocks
and<00:03:12.550> UCF<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.510> think<00:03:14.230> defensively<00:03:14.590> for<00:03:14.950> South

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
and UCF I think defensively for South

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.740 
and UCF I think defensively for South
Carolina<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:16.060> know<00:03:16.150> you've<00:03:16.269> got<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.420> look<00:03:16.600> at

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
Carolina you know you've got a look at

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
secondary they haven't tackled all that

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.400 
secondary they haven't tackled all that
well<00:03:19.150> they've<00:03:19.360> had<00:03:19.510> some<00:03:19.660> breakdowns<00:03:19.900> here

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.630 
well they've had some breakdowns here
and<00:03:20.500> there<00:03:20.590> particularly<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> georgia

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
and there particularly in the georgia

and there particularly in the georgia
game<00:03:22.170> UCF's<00:03:23.170> quarterback<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.769> very<00:03:23.980> good

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
game UCF's quarterback is very good

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.560 
game UCF's quarterback is very good
Blake<00:03:24.670> bortles<00:03:24.850> he's<00:03:25.209> one<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.540> most

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
Blake bortles he's one of the most

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.150 
Blake bortles he's one of the most
efficient<00:03:26.140> quarterbacks<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.709> country<00:03:26.799> so

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
efficient quarterbacks in the country so

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.009 
efficient quarterbacks in the country so
far<00:03:27.519> through<00:03:27.790> three<00:03:28.000> games<00:03:28.150> they<00:03:28.780> have<00:03:28.870> not

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
far through three games they have not

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.410 
far through three games they have not
played<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.350> best<00:03:29.500> competition<00:03:30.150> Penn<00:03:31.150> State

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
played the best competition Penn State

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.030 
played the best competition Penn State
was<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.720> best<00:03:31.930> defense<00:03:32.290> they<00:03:32.470> face<00:03:32.739> South

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
was the best defense they face South

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.259 
was the best defense they face South
Carolina's<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.640> think<00:03:33.820> will<00:03:33.940> be<00:03:34.060> better

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
Carolina's I think will be better

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.670 
Carolina's I think will be better
although<00:03:34.780> they<00:03:34.930> do<00:03:34.989> have<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.290> benefit<00:03:35.650> of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
although they do have the benefit of

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.250 
although they do have the benefit of
playing<00:03:35.980> at<00:03:36.130> home<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> good

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
playing at home but that is it is a good

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.199 
playing at home but that is it is a good
group<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.799> think<00:03:39.489> South<00:03:39.670> Carolina's<00:03:40.030> going<00:03:40.150> to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
group I think South Carolina's going to

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.970 
group I think South Carolina's going to
have<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.360> play<00:03:40.510> well<00:03:40.660> up<00:03:40.900> front<00:03:41.140> but<00:03:41.380> i'm

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
have to play well up front but i'm

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.680 
have to play well up front but i'm
looking<00:03:42.130> at<00:03:42.340> Bryson<00:03:42.700> Williams<00:03:43.030> South

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
looking at Bryson Williams South

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.180 
looking at Bryson Williams South
Carolina's<00:03:44.049> free<00:03:44.230> safety<00:03:44.650> he<00:03:44.830> needs<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.100> have

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
Carolina's free safety he needs to have

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.800 
Carolina's free safety he needs to have
a<00:03:45.220> big<00:03:45.459> game<00:03:45.670> coming<00:03:45.700> up<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.269> run<00:03:46.420> support

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
a big game coming up and run support

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.630 
a big game coming up and run support
trying<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.830> make<00:03:47.980> some<00:03:48.220> big<00:03:48.370> plays<00:03:48.610> in

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
trying to make some big plays in

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.520 
trying to make some big plays in

well stopping the run and

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.959 
well stopping the run and
and<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:02.040> know<00:04:02.129> helping<00:04:02.400> out<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.640> passing

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
game as well now you mentioned that this

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.550 
game as well now you mentioned that this
was<00:04:05.159> a<00:04:05.189> big<00:04:05.549> game<00:04:05.819> at<00:04:06.120> home<00:04:06.420> for<00:04:06.719> UCF<00:04:07.230> there<00:04:07.500> are

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
was a big game at home for UCF there are

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.410 
was a big game at home for UCF there are
only<00:04:07.620> one<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.159> twenty<00:04:08.430> four<00:04:08.640> all-time<00:04:08.819> against

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
only one in twenty four all-time against

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.020 
only one in twenty four all-time against
ranked<00:04:09.659> opponents<00:04:09.719> this<00:04:10.680> game<00:04:10.980> sold<00:04:11.400> out<00:04:11.730> how

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
ranked opponents this game sold out how

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.509 
ranked opponents this game sold out how
much<00:04:12.239> how<00:04:13.049> much<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.409> an<00:04:13.799> effect<00:04:14.219> do<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.430> think

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
much how much of an effect do you think

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.479 
much how much of an effect do you think
the<00:04:15.299> crowd<00:04:15.659> could<00:04:16.079> have<00:04:16.350> on<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:17.009> Gamecock

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the crowd could have on this Gamecock

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.599 
the crowd could have on this Gamecock
team<00:04:17.729> yeah<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.509> think<00:04:18.750> particularly<00:04:19.289> if<00:04:19.560> UCF<00:04:20.459> is

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
team yeah I think particularly if UCF is

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.249 
team yeah I think particularly if UCF is
able<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.940> get<00:04:21.090> up<00:04:21.209> early<00:04:21.539> make<00:04:21.720> some<00:04:21.900> big<00:04:22.019> plays

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
able to get up early make some big plays

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.230 
able to get up early make some big plays
early<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.800> game<00:04:22.949> it<00:04:23.160> could<00:04:23.310> be<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.520> scenario

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
early in the game it could be a scenario

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.659 
early in the game it could be a scenario
where<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.539> becomes<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.870> little<00:04:24.900> more<00:04:25.139> difficult

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
where it becomes a little more difficult

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.860 
where it becomes a little more difficult
you<00:04:26.669> know<00:04:26.789> one<00:04:26.940> thing<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.180> keep<00:04:27.330> in<00:04:27.479> mind<00:04:27.539> is

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
you know one thing to keep in mind is

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.020 
you know one thing to keep in mind is
that<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.470> isn't<00:04:28.889> Sanford<00:04:29.250> Stadium<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.940> know

going<00:04:42.389> to<00:04:42.479> be<00:04:42.599> I<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.110> pretty<00:04:43.289> good<00:04:43.470> crowd

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
going to be I think a pretty good crowd

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.580 
going to be I think a pretty good crowd
a<00:04:43.710> pretty<00:04:44.009> good<00:04:44.190> environment<00:04:44.960> with<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.139> noon

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
a pretty good environment with the noon

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.830 
a pretty good environment with the noon
kickoff<00:04:47.030> so<00:04:48.030> it's<00:04:48.210> something<00:04:48.539> that<00:04:48.660> South

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
kickoff so it's something that South

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.330 
kickoff so it's something that South
Carolina<00:04:49.199> I<00:04:49.289> think<00:04:49.530> they<00:04:49.710> need<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:49.919> jump<00:04:50.220> out

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
Carolina I think they need to jump out

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.370 
Carolina I think they need to jump out
early<00:04:50.789> and<00:04:50.970> try<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.539> take<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.900> crowd<00:04:52.110> out<00:04:52.139> of

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
early and try to take the crowd out of

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.310 
early and try to take the crowd out of
it<00:04:52.620> as<00:04:52.740> much<00:04:52.860> as<00:04:52.919> possible<00:04:53.160> all<00:04:53.729> right<00:04:54.000> now

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
it as much as possible all right now

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.900 
it as much as possible all right now
wrapping<00:04:55.320> this<00:04:55.500> up<00:04:55.710> give<00:04:56.280> me<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.520> score

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
wrapping this up give me a score

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.969 
wrapping this up give me a score
prediction<00:04:57.479> for<00:04:57.930> this<00:04:58.139> Saturday<00:04:58.680> South

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
prediction for this Saturday South

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.969 
prediction for this Saturday South
Carolina<00:04:59.460> UCF<00:05:00.000> I'm<00:05:00.330> gonna<00:05:00.509> go<00:05:00.660> 3423<00:05:01.590> South

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
Carolina UCF I'm gonna go 3423 South

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.610 
Carolina UCF I'm gonna go 3423 South
Carolina<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:03.030> think<00:05:03.360> UCF<00:05:03.840> can<00:05:04.080> move<00:05:04.289> the<00:05:04.440> ball<00:05:04.590> I

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
Carolina I think UCF can move the ball I

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.740 
Carolina I think UCF can move the ball I
think<00:05:04.740> they<00:05:04.979> can<00:05:05.010> score<00:05:05.310> some<00:05:05.370> points<00:05:05.729> on<00:05:06.300> the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
think they can score some points on the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.089 
think they can score some points on the
flip<00:05:06.930> side<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.169> think<00:05:07.260> South<00:05:07.590> Carolina<00:05:07.919> can

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
flip side I think South Carolina can

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.279 
flip side I think South Carolina can
score<00:05:08.310> some<00:05:08.340> points<00:05:08.639> as<00:05:08.909> well<00:05:09.110> against<00:05:10.110> that

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
score some points as well against that

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.080 
score some points as well against that
UCF<00:05:10.710> defense<00:05:11.159> I<00:05:11.400> think<00:05:11.639> they<00:05:11.729> have<00:05:11.760> some

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
UCF defense I think they have some

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.310 
UCF defense I think they have some
vulnerabilities<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.780> they<00:05:13.020> can<00:05:13.169> take

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
vulnerabilities that they can take

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.379 
vulnerabilities that they can take
advantage<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.729> think<00:05:14.760> it's<00:05:15.060> going<00:05:15.300> to

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
advantage of and I think it's going to

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.240 
advantage of and I think it's going to
be<00:05:15.510> a<00:05:15.539> close<00:05:15.810> game<00:05:15.840> when<00:05:16.800> all<00:05:16.889> is<00:05:17.010> said<00:05:17.220> and

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
be a close game when all is said and

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.010 
be a close game when all is said and
done<00:05:17.400> but<00:05:17.699> South<00:05:17.940> Carolina<00:05:18.300> pulls<00:05:18.479> away<00:05:18.630> what

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
done but South Carolina pulls away what

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.649 
done but South Carolina pulls away what
about<00:05:19.199> you<00:05:19.320> I'm<00:05:19.620> gonna<00:05:19.800> go<00:05:19.979> with<00:05:20.419> 27-17<00:05:21.419> you

about you I'm gonna go with 27-17 you
pretty<00:05:21.900> much<00:05:21.960> said<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.500> I<00:05:22.530> think<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.979> will<00:05:23.220> be<00:05:23.430> a

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
pretty much said it I think it will be a

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.040 
pretty much said it I think it will be a
close<00:05:23.760> game<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:24.240> fact<00:05:24.449> that<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:24.659> Gamecocks

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
close game the fact that the Gamecocks

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.870 
close game the fact that the Gamecocks
are<00:05:25.229> traveling<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.740> Orlando<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.550> they're

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
are traveling to Orlando and they're

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.180 
are traveling to Orlando and they're
facing<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.389> UCF<00:05:27.840> team<00:05:28.080> who<00:05:28.590> really<00:05:28.889> doesn't

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
facing a UCF team who really doesn't

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.520 
facing a UCF team who really doesn't
need<00:05:29.490> any<00:05:29.820> reason<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.750> get<00:05:30.930> pumped<00:05:31.289> up<00:05:31.380> for

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
need any reason to get pumped up for

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
this game other than the fact that they
