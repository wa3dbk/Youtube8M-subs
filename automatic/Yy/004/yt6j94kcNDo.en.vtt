00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
of putting on a Oland steering damper on

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.600 
of putting on a Oland steering damper on
a<00:00:08.970> 2006<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> zx-10r<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.769> guess<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.250> will

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
a 2006 the zx-10r I guess I will

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.560 
a 2006 the zx-10r I guess I will
and<00:00:12.740> here<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.799> go<00:00:14.070> well<00:00:14.219> basically<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.969> have

and here we go well basically you have
your<00:00:15.750> two<00:00:15.870> bolts<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> go<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:16.560> tank<00:00:17.180> give

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
your two bolts to go to your tank give

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.640 
your two bolts to go to your tank give
your<00:00:18.330> old<00:00:18.449> engineering<00:00:18.930> damper<00:00:19.230> there<00:00:19.410> how

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
your old engineering damper there how

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.230 
your old engineering damper there how
that's<00:00:19.830> lined<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.460> haven't<00:00:20.699> bolted<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> down

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
that's lined up I haven't bolted it down

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.349 
that's lined up I haven't bolted it down
yet<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.830> then<00:00:23.010> we're<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:24.199> there<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
you have to drop you gotta take these

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.830 
you have to drop you gotta take these
two<00:00:33.719> screws<00:00:34.050> down<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.890> drop<00:00:35.130> this

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
two screws down here and drop this

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.010 
two screws down here and drop this
there's<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.930> screw<00:00:37.290> behind<00:00:38.239> your<00:00:39.239> brake

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
there's a screw behind your brake

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.280 
there's a screw behind your brake
reservoir<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.040> loosened<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
reservoir that has to be loosened and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.040 
reservoir that has to be loosened and
then<00:00:43.700> what<00:00:44.700> you'll<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.930> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
then what you'll do then just see this

bracket right here on the end of the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.220 
bracket right here on the end of the
steering<00:00:49.890> damper<00:00:50.160> die<00:00:50.399> bracket<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.230> we'll

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
steering damper die bracket then we'll

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
steering damper die bracket then we'll
mount<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> phone<00:00:53.489> agate<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
mount up you got the phone agate with a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
mount up you got the phone agate with a
little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.350> there's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.440> hole<00:00:55.680> under<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
little bit there's a hole under the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.349 
little bit there's a hole under the
triple<00:00:56.850> triple<00:00:57.690> tree<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.789> this<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:00.300> you

drop when you drop drop it down there
this<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:04.680> fit<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.100> exactly<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.659> between<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this will fit on exactly in between the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
this will fit on exactly in between the
bracket<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> triple<00:01:11.520> tree<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:13.320> piece

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
bracket the triple tree and this piece

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280 
bracket the triple tree and this piece
will<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.130> fit<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:15.390> three<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.049> fit

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
nobody seemed to have any answers so I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
nobody seemed to have any answers so I
figured<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.540> it's
