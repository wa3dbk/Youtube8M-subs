00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
him if they knew how to swim and they

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.840 
him if they knew how to swim and they
all<00:02:03.229> shook<00:02:03.890> their<00:02:04.040> head<00:02:04.190> know<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.580> they<00:02:04.670> did

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
all shook their head know that they did

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.550

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
not know how to swim so I didn't want

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.139 
not know how to swim so I didn't want
them<00:02:06.799> jumping<00:02:07.280> off<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> hole<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.940> boat

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
and trying to get to our boat it was

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.640 
and trying to get to our boat it was
better<00:02:10.369> for<00:02:10.610> us<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:11.090> send<00:02:11.780> someone<00:02:12.020> over<00:02:12.170> to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
better for us to send someone over to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.470 
better for us to send someone over to
recover<00:02:13.459> him<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.760> situation<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.420> that

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
recover him in a situation like that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.240 
recover him in a situation like that
there's<00:02:20.870> not<00:02:20.989> much<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.709> for<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.040> boat

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
there's not much we can do for the boat

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
there's not much we can do for the boat
so<00:02:22.670> our<00:02:22.850> our<00:02:23.060> main<00:02:23.239> thing<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:24.140> got<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.380> save

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
pull him on board by himself so I had to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.900 
pull him on board by himself so I had to
leave<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> wheel<00:02:29.950> assist<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.220> pulling<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
along the side of the boat went a series

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.920 
along the side of the boat went a series
of<00:02:36.470> ways<00:02:36.819> we<00:02:37.819> had<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.030> quite<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> few<00:02:38.600> wave

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
