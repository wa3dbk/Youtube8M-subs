00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.680 
edge female so you know which paint meg
I<00:02:24.340> think<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.849> say<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.569> see

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
I think you can say that so you can see

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.509 
I think you can say that so you can see
the<00:02:31.810> difference<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:33.010> think<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.310> peach

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
the difference and I think the peach

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.020 
the difference and I think the peach
actually<00:02:33.910> gives<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.180> nice<00:02:35.610> skin<00:02:36.610> effect<00:02:36.849> once

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
actually gives a nice skin effect once

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.520 
actually gives a nice skin effect once
