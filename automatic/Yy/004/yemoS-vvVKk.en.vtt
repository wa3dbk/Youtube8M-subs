this pretty soon once they see it on
youtube<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:05.390> I'll<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.840> something<00:01:07.290> at

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
youtube and I'll think of something at

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.580 
youtube and I'll think of something at
the<00:01:07.470> end<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> video<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.290> i'm

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the end of the video but right now i'm

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.350 
the end of the video but right now i'm
showing<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> how<00:01:11.400> long<00:01:11.670> does<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.030> glitch

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
showing you how long does it glitch

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
showing you how long does it glitch
works<00:01:12.740> it's<00:01:13.740> pretty<00:01:14.040> much<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> barrier<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
works it's pretty much a barrier and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.380 
works it's pretty much a barrier and
then<00:01:15.920> since<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.100> friends<00:01:17.670> sitting<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
then since my friends sitting on this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.230 
then since my friends sitting on this
barrier<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.409> guess<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> zombies<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.580> nowhere

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
barrier I guess the zombies have nowhere

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.039 
barrier I guess the zombies have nowhere
else<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.780> under<00:01:22.320> him<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:24.049> they're

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
else to go but under him and they're

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.060 
else to go but under him and they're
pretty<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.470> followed<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.829> waiting<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
pretty much followed up and waiting to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.730 
pretty much followed up and waiting to
die<00:01:30.229> now<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:32.369> best<00:01:32.610> way<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.329> best<00:01:33.780> guns<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
die now the best way the best guns to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.749 
die now the best way the best guns to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.620 

now<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:40.770> see<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.250> they're<00:02:41.880> not<00:02:42.090> actually

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
now you see that they're not actually

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.750 
now you see that they're not actually
going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.650> kill<00:02:43.860> me<00:02:44.040> they're<00:02:44.250> actually<00:02:44.610> going

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
going to kill me they're actually going

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
going to kill me they're actually going
under<00:02:45.150> me<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:46.430> guess<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.640> AI<00:02:47.850> for<00:02:48.660> zombies

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
under me I guess the AI for zombies

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.699 
under me I guess the AI for zombies
early<00:02:49.740> bad<00:02:49.950> because<00:02:50.540> when<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.900> zombie<00:02:52.350> spawn

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
early bad because when the zombie spawn

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.930 
early bad because when the zombie spawn
on<00:02:54.350> they<00:02:55.350> they<00:02:55.800> know<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.640> this

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
on they they know that I'm on this

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.640 
on they they know that I'm on this
glitch<00:02:57.300> for<00:02:57.690> some<00:02:57.870> reason<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.350> they<00:02:58.470> could

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
glitch for some reason and they could

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.100 
glitch for some reason and they could
kill<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.130> but<00:02:59.490> not<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.850> zombies<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:03.360> yeah

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
kill me but not the zombies and yeah

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.920 
kill me but not the zombies and yeah
this<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:04.470> basically<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.430> best<00:03:05.610> way<00:03:05.820> to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
this is basically it the best way to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.610 
this is basically it the best way to
kill<00:03:06.930> them<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:08.630> area<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.900> usually

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
kill them on this area is usually

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.940 
kill them on this area is usually
throwing<00:03:11.100> grenades<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.390> don't<00:03:12.660> throw

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
throwing grenades but you don't throw

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.620 
throwing grenades but you don't throw
like<00:03:13.950> two<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.310> them<00:03:14.640> at<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> time<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.390> throw

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
