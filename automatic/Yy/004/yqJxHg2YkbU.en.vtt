away from it Ben Youngs pass it to me
for<00:00:41.040> some<00:00:41.100> reason<00:00:41.160> I'll<00:00:41.820> try<00:00:41.940> things<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
for some reason I'll try things going to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
for some reason I'll try things going to
put<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.510> across<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.559> no<00:00:43.680> pass<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.070> me<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
put it across me but no pass it to me so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
put it across me but no pass it to me so
and<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.670> deals<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.469> tip<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.770> someone

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and that deals just tip it on to someone

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
and that deals just tip it on to someone
who<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.160> run<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.300> turnover<00:00:48.719> ball

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
who can run I think with turnover ball

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.650 
who can run I think with turnover ball

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a short little ball and the gaps matter

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.240 
a short little ball and the gaps matter
for<00:01:15.750> me<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.259> know<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.830> quite<00:01:17.040> simple

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
for me and you know it's quite simple

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
for me and you know it's quite simple
actually<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:17.970> running<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.869> dr.<00:01:19.080> Bordeaux

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
actually was running I'm dr. Bordeaux

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.370 
actually was running I'm dr. Bordeaux
essential<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.909> give<00:01:21.060> solid<00:01:21.420> set<00:01:21.630> piece<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
essential to give solid set piece that a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830 
essential to give solid set piece that a
strong<00:01:22.650> platform<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.159> play<00:01:23.310> off<00:01:23.570> yeah<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
strong platform to play off yeah and I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
strong platform to play off yeah and I
think<00:01:25.049> that's<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> try<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.790> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
think that's one thing to try and do is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
think that's one thing to try and do is
serve<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> decent<00:01:28.200> set<00:01:28.320> piece<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> ball<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
serve a decent set piece get the ball to

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
serve a decent set piece get the ball to
8<00:01:29.369> feet<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.540> some

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
8 feet and then if you can get some

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.350 
8 feet and then if you can get some
fundamental<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> scrum<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.240> can

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
fundamental in the scrum or so you can

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
fundamental in the scrum or so you can
take<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.290> allowed<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> night<00:01:34.740> 89

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
take that but you allowed the night 89

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.710 
take that but you allowed the night 89
to<00:01:35.460> play<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> ball<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> them<00:01:36.390> really

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to play the ball is up to them really

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
to play the ball is up to them really
we're<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.229> doing<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> job<00:01:37.560> bend<00:01:37.890> over<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
we're just doing a job bend over and
