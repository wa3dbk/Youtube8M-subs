00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.130 
each but each Bank has its all seen
selected<00:03:10.760> there<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.629> I'm<00:03:11.750> just<00:03:11.840> gonna<00:03:11.930> play

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
selected there so I'm just gonna play

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.449 
selected there so I'm just gonna play
these<00:03:12.290> two<00:03:12.470> back<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.829> back<00:03:12.859> to<00:03:13.129> let<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.340> know

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
these two back to back to let you know

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:32.759 
these two back to back to let you know
so<00:03:14.329> kind<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.870> looks<00:03:14.989> like

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.349 

so<00:03:33.769> they<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.099> so<00:03:34.340> that's<00:03:34.519> basically<00:03:34.999> how<00:03:35.269> you

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
so they go so that's basically how you

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.729 
so they go so that's basically how you
know<00:03:35.719> track<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.109> out<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.319> even<00:03:36.560> shown<00:03:36.709> you

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
know track it out and I even shown you

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.229 
know track it out and I even shown you
you'll<00:03:37.010> see<00:03:37.159> in<00:03:37.249> st.<00:03:37.489> Joe's<00:03:37.670> video<00:03:37.939> you<00:03:38.030> can

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
you'll see in st. Joe's video you can

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.780 
you'll see in st. Joe's video you can
also<00:03:38.469> you<00:03:39.469> know<00:03:39.560> go<00:03:39.739> pattern<00:03:40.189> double<00:03:40.670> the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
also you know go pattern double the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.129 
also you know go pattern double the
length<00:03:40.939> or<00:03:41.209> just<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.569> know<00:03:41.599> do<00:03:41.840> what<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.019> got

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
length or just you know do what you got

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.229 
length or just you know do what you got
to<00:03:42.230> do<00:03:42.349> to<00:03:42.379> make<00:03:42.829> your<00:03:42.980> patterns<00:03:43.400> or<00:03:44.060> make<00:03:44.209> a

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
to do to make your patterns or make a

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.119 
to do to make your patterns or make a
scene<00:03:44.510> sorry<00:03:44.780> longer<00:03:45.200> or<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.859> course<00:03:46.040> you

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
scene sorry longer or of course you

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.520 
scene sorry longer or of course you
could<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:46.430> double<00:03:46.670> number<00:03:47.150> them<00:03:47.359> which<00:03:47.989> just

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
could just double number them which just

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.929 
could just double number them which just
give<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.739> more<00:03:48.920> scenes<00:03:49.280> but<00:03:49.549> it's<00:03:49.849> completely

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
give you more scenes but it's completely

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.550 
give you more scenes but it's completely
up<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.359> you<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:51.079> got<00:03:51.230> lost<00:03:51.409> a<00:03:51.530> little

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
to be laid out so let's leave it as it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.529 
to be laid out so let's leave it as it
is<00:04:24.919> what<00:04:25.610> I'm<00:04:25.669> going<00:04:25.789> to<00:04:25.820> do<00:04:25.970> just<00:04:26.000> because<00:04:26.419> I

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
is what I'm going to do just because I

wanted to play a few more times so I'll

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.240 
wanted to play a few more times so I'll
take<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:29.020> double<00:04:30.020> this<00:04:30.169> here<00:04:30.650> here<00:04:30.919> here

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
take this double this here here here

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.640 
take this double this here here here
here<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:32.240> you're<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.080> same<00:04:33.289> thing<00:04:33.500> with

here here so I got basically you know
these<00:04:38.120> two<00:04:38.360> loop<00:04:38.599> same<00:04:39.470> thing<00:04:39.740> goes<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:40.310> bars

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
these two loop same thing goes to bars

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.790 
these two loop same thing goes to bars
two<00:04:40.699> bars<00:04:40.820> two<00:04:41.090> bars<00:04:41.240> but<00:04:41.960> also<00:04:42.139> do<00:04:42.440> now<00:04:42.590> just

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
two bars two bars but also do now just

for the heck of it let's go into the
last<00:04:44.599> one<00:04:44.840> on<00:04:44.930> each<00:04:45.080> one<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:46.370> switch<00:04:46.580> up<00:04:46.610> the

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
last one on each one to switch up the

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.820 
last one on each one to switch up the
drums<00:04:47.120> hey<00:04:47.389> back<00:04:47.720> off<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:48.050> my<00:04:48.110> drums<00:04:48.409> sitting

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
drums hey back off to my drums sitting

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.279 
drums hey back off to my drums sitting
pattern<00:04:49.159> to<00:04:49.599> barely<00:04:50.599> anything<00:04:50.780> different

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
pattern to barely anything different

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.170 
pattern to barely anything different
just<00:04:51.320> one<00:04:51.590> less<00:04:51.800> snaring<00:04:52.159> them<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.759> now<00:04:52.880> I

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
just one less snaring them so now I

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:40.040 
just one less snaring them so now I
don't<00:04:53.539> play<00:04:53.810> everything<00:04:54.669> select<00:04:55.669> like<00:04:55.880> that

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.840
