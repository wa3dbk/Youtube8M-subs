waffling let's open it up and see what

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:15.250 
waffling let's open it up and see what
see<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.180> like

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260

bright<00:02:19.019> orange<00:02:19.200> box<00:02:19.590> reminds<00:02:20.459> me<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> Lumia

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
bright orange box reminds me of a Lumia

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.750 
bright orange box reminds me of a Lumia
phone<00:02:23.599> here<00:02:27.019> all<00:02:28.019> right<00:02:28.200> here<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:28.800> go<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.550> we

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
phone here all right here we go so we

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.949 
phone here all right here we go so we
have<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:31.069> manual<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.569> tells<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
have a manual and it's tells you to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.199 
have a manual and it's tells you to
download<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.440> app<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.130> there's<00:02:35.730> an<00:02:35.819> app<00:02:35.970> that

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
download the app so there's an app that

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.970 
download the app so there's an app that
comes<00:02:36.360> with<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:37.010> which<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.160> assumes<00:02:38.489> for

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
comes with this which I assumes for

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.589 
comes with this which I assumes for
configuring<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.090> testing<00:02:42.450> all<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
configuring it and testing all the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.449 
configuring it and testing all the
buttons<00:02:42.870> make<00:02:43.049> sure<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.290> works<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.400> that's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
buttons make sure that works so that's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.920 
buttons make sure that works so that's
just<00:02:44.670> telling<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.090> now<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.329> got<00:02:45.420> some<00:02:45.569> basic

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
just telling you now it's got some basic

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.690 
just telling you now it's got some basic
instructions<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.829> about<00:02:46.980> how<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> use<00:02:47.310> it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
instructions I think about how to use it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.930 
instructions I think about how to use it
so<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.420> got<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.079> bit<00:02:49.319> we<00:02:50.099> have<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> charging<00:02:50.640> cable

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
so I got a bit we have a charging cable

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.729 
so I got a bit we have a charging cable
now<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.390> does<00:02:51.569> cover<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.079> control<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.650> does

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
now this does cover this control it does

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.530 
now this does cover this control it does
have<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> built<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.370> battery<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.209> set

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
have a built in battery in it the set

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.270 
have a built in battery in it the set
aside<00:02:55.970> 680<00:02:56.970> milliamps<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.160> don't

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
aside 680 milliamps and so you don't

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.229 
aside 680 milliamps and so you don't
have<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.430> worry<00:02:59.579> about<00:02:59.730> batteries<00:03:00.120> or

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
have to worry about batteries or

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.490 
have to worry about batteries or
anything<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.780> that's<00:03:01.019> pretty<00:03:01.200> good

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
anything like that so that's pretty good

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.460 
anything like that so that's pretty good
she<00:03:02.400> comes<00:03:02.610> with<00:03:02.700> charging<00:03:03.120> cable<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.900> then

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
she comes with charging cable and then

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.539 
she comes with charging cable and then
underneath<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:07.370> hmm

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
underneath here we have this hmm

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.009 
underneath here we have this hmm
it's<00:03:08.760> thinner<00:03:09.060> than<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.420> thought<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.780> would<00:03:09.870> be

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
it's thinner than I thought it would be

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.059 
it's thinner than I thought it would be
actually<00:03:11.630> hmm<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.690> bit<00:03:12.900> lighter<00:03:13.139> okay<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:13.889> let's

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
actually hmm a bit lighter okay so let's

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.470 
actually hmm a bit lighter okay so let's
just<00:03:14.130> take<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.489> look<00:03:14.730> let's<00:03:14.910> put<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.389> one

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
just take a look let's put this to one

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:25.340 
just take a look let's put this to one
side<00:03:19.730> okay<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.389> here<00:03:21.780> we<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:24.350> first

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
side okay so here we go first

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.140 
side okay so here we go first
impressions<00:03:25.920> actually<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:26.609> really<00:03:26.940> light

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
impressions actually it's really light

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.319 
impressions actually it's really light
now<00:03:27.420> unlike<00:03:27.980> I've<00:03:28.980> got<00:03:29.160> an<00:03:29.220> Xbox<00:03:29.430> 3<00:03:29.880> consists

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
now unlike I've got an Xbox 3 consists

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.930 
now unlike I've got an Xbox 3 consists
360<00:03:31.170> controller<00:03:31.560> here<00:03:31.859> is<00:03:32.130> noticeably

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
360 controller here is noticeably

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.250 
360 controller here is noticeably
lighter<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:35.269> even<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.420> take<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.870> batteries

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
lighter and even if I take the batteries

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.509 
lighter and even if I take the batteries
out<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:40.440> more<00:03:40.680> or<00:03:40.769> less<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:41.069> same<00:03:41.280> so

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
out it's more or less the same so

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.940 
out it's more or less the same so
actually<00:03:41.880> by<00:03:42.000> not<00:03:42.180> having<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:43.650> having<00:03:43.859> to

actually by not having not having to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.979 
actually by not having not having to
stick<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.370> double-a<00:03:44.850> batteries<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.329> need<00:03:45.450> does

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
stick to double-a batteries I need does

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.270 
stick to double-a batteries I need does
make<00:03:46.230> quite<00:03:46.500> different<00:03:46.859> actually<00:03:46.980> that's

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
make quite different actually that's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.020 
make quite different actually that's
really<00:03:47.430> impressive

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
really impressive

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.670 
really impressive
size-wise<00:03:51.200> it's<00:03:52.200> really<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.410> little<00:03:52.560> bit

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
size-wise it's really a little bit

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.670 
size-wise it's really a little bit
bigger<00:03:52.950> than<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.220> 360<00:03:53.940> but<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.209> definitely

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
bigger than the 360 but it's definitely

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.530 
bigger than the 360 but it's definitely
it's<00:03:55.680> definitely<00:03:55.709> thinner<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.269> that's<00:03:57.389> pretty

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
it's definitely thinner so that's pretty

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.539 
it's definitely thinner so that's pretty
impressive<00:03:57.840> actually<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.500> put<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.739> on<00:03:58.889> site<00:03:59.150> so

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
the widest tell if I never seen by man

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.820 
the widest tell if I never seen by man
for<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:00.240> lots<00:05:00.389> of<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:01.020> that's<00:05:01.410> really<00:05:01.470> cool

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
for it lots of it so that's really cool

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.159 
for it lots of it so that's really cool
and<00:05:02.669> actually<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.120> feels<00:05:03.389> really<00:05:03.630> sturdy<00:05:03.930> it

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
and actually this feels really sturdy it

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.490 
and actually this feels really sturdy it
sort<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.380> clicks<00:05:05.270> into<00:05:06.270> place<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.110> suppose

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
sort of clicks into place so I suppose

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.550 
sort of clicks into place so I suppose
if<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:07.770> were<00:05:08.630> you<00:05:09.630> know<00:05:09.780> if<00:05:09.840> you're<00:05:09.990> playing<00:05:10.350> a

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
game you're lying down

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.790 
game you're lying down
you<00:05:12.150> wouldn't<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:13.020> frame<00:05:13.290> wouldn't<00:05:13.590> collapse

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
you wouldn't the frame wouldn't collapse

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.860 
you wouldn't the frame wouldn't collapse
on<00:05:14.070> your<00:05:14.190> fingers<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:15.240> it's<00:05:15.389> a<00:05:15.450> bit<00:05:15.600> stiff

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
on your fingers and it's a bit stiff

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.370 
on your fingers and it's a bit stiff
that's<00:05:16.440> okay<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:18.780> doesn't<00:05:18.930> feel<00:05:19.139> like<00:05:19.200> your

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
that's okay it doesn't feel like your

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.290 
that's okay it doesn't feel like your
phone's<00:05:19.620> gonna<00:05:19.740> go<00:05:19.950> anywhere<00:05:20.250> that's<00:05:20.400> that's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
phone's gonna go anywhere that's that's

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.909 
phone's gonna go anywhere that's that's
great<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:21.900> if<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.080> was<00:05:22.200> to<00:05:22.229> just<00:05:22.470> tilt<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:24.710> say<00:05:25.710> if

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
great so if I was to just tilt it say if

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.680 
great so if I was to just tilt it say if
you<00:05:26.280> were<00:05:26.340> lying<00:05:26.580> down<00:05:26.760> flat<00:05:27.060> I<00:05:27.090> suppose<00:05:27.390> it

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
you were lying down flat I suppose it

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.540 
you were lying down flat I suppose it
would<00:05:27.810> be<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.930> bit<00:05:28.080> risky<00:05:28.260> but<00:05:28.680> yeah<00:05:29.370> that's

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
would be a bit risky but yeah that's

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.890 
would be a bit risky but yeah that's
that<00:05:29.789> seems<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.300> hold<00:05:30.479> it<00:05:30.570> pretty<00:05:30.690> well

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900

quite<00:06:10.889> like<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.160> d-pad<00:06:11.550> on<00:06:11.580> this<00:06:11.850> actually<00:06:12.650> it

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
quite like the d-pad on this actually it

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.350 
quite like the d-pad on this actually it
was<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:13.889> bit<00:06:14.070> better<00:06:14.250> than<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.550> Xbox<00:06:14.940> one<00:06:15.150> I

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
was a bit better than the Xbox one I

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.730 
was a bit better than the Xbox one I
think<00:06:15.419> that's<00:06:16.289> pretty<00:06:16.470> good

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740
