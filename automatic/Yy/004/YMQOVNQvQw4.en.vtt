00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.529
 There, I think that one of the characters 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.660
 more dear to me who had a 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.040
 great participation in my life gamer 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.019
 not only mine but I'm sure that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.769
 many of you are fans of this guy 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.690
 Cool 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.670
 the problem is that for many years quest 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 has had its crises of identity and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.109
 your new games are getting more and more 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 distant players but for this I 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 Tell you what kindergarten to have had a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.680
 rebound in 2010 and that in the same year 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.410
 will also launch a new crash racing foda 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.239
 is it really true in 2010 could 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.559
 have had a new game that would be of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.719
 fact made by the one who made games like 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 jec x so much but he own clash of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.300
 the radical titans were thinking 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.190
 radical the pun ok box of her act 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 wanted to do a series crash reboot and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 making all the characters and creating 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.149
 a new story then the project is born 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.860
 crash bandicoot 2010 that did not take long 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.879
 very few have already begun to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.100
 to leak on the net 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.109
 the story revolves around the cortex that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 would try to kidnap friends from day care 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.030
 with the help of diego taiyou the dingoo 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.890
 as I call myself king of my life 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.510
 after shooting friends from day care 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.280
 all over the map with a kind of 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.750
 machine that shoots the tennis ball 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.880
 hero would have to start his adventure 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 to save all his companions and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.479
 kidnapped comrades is where we will 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.150
 I've seen this the day care franchise 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.909
 so with this work had sex radical 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.920
 crash design would change a lot 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.080
 which was taken from the goofball guy that you 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.060
 day for a more serious and I 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.070
 I particularly did not like the idea. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.520
 because mongo's face is part of the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.950
 crash pulled the table right here 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.630
 was excellent now other images 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.689
 They showed that you was really Rebu 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.090
 serious where copper and orcs appeared that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.880
 would obviously be enemies and those who 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.060
 Are you seeing now I think it would 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.470
 some crash transformations by turning 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.079
 a bat a halter and if in the middle sees 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.329
 seriously no idea what the fuck 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.700
 the game would be divided into six worlds that 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.280
 would change between beach desert marsh 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 mountain volcano and future some images 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.090
 television showed that the phases would have 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.160
 futuristic machines which is not so 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.690
 weird 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.480
 and why this style had already appeared 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.130
 in crash bandicoot 3 or day care ipad 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.900
 call it any way you want 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.000
 known characters are not 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.760
 mentioned in the project with coconut 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.400
 popular and the rest of the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.410
 the stages with mounts probably 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.480
 would be out of the game what would be a 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.830
 a fucking shot in the foot because the people are 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.140
 that the binges 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.360
 after a few years to be more precise 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.310
 in 2012 the project of the game received its 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.520
 true name being officially 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.020
 titled the clash legend yes take the 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.910
 banks of the name creche landro according to 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.680
 with my dictionary means day care 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.430
 landed would be released for playstation 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.560
 3 xbox 360 the whole yen of s 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.050
 and no game place left for the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.780
 table consoles only an addendum to 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.630
 nintendo ds that I found with the pardon of 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.180
 word a cube demo began with the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.800
 menu shortly afterwards and direct to 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.930
 the gameplay is always tightening option 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.760
 none the game was still half-lives and 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.560
 the enemies appeared out of nowhere but 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.970
 to accept because it was a demo now 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.680
 that you can not accept the way you 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.990
 Express was walking by the hand of God. 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 every time after the game has been 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.760
 canceled this subject on the internet this 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.560
 year another video of another game of 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.470
 daycare center that was being 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.320
 by the radical to try to give a boom 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.900
 Chinese is considered to be weird not bush 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.630
 in that redoute the sheet and would be called 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.700
 newcrest racing originality is 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.489
 Rolling loose on the radical in the wonderful 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.190
 and that obviously would be a new game of 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.930
 crash race to be honest I did not 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.940
 I thought it was really bad, I got enough. 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.130
 excited to play the game by pulling 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.840
 that design talk of the characters of 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.820
 as if I was even happy because this 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.459
 video appeared the popular then 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.870
 probably would be in the crash land 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.450
 even if it has not been mentioned 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.489
 of game design the game would have new 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.430
 characters including a shark that 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.800
 would have a beautiful shaq goal fucking fuck 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.200
 the game would have a 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.110
 garage for you to make your kart 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.570
 way you want to change tires with 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.669
 even special of your car when 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.739
 is running, such as this one 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.390
 of the popular he makes a snowball 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.669
 runners would also have a 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.500
 primary type when my car is 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.280
 near your 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.280
 I could do this 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.300
 the video we already know has only one clue 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.790
 four characters who are diego nursery 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.920
 jerk and skip but obviously they would have 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.520
 much more in the final version of 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.520
 game 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.070
 unfortunately it has also been canceled already 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.070
 that the reboot of the series would not launch more 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.610
 and to finish currently day care 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.230
 belongs to activision but to praise the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.420
 rumors that the franchise would be 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.350
 coming back to anori dog or your 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.150

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.070
 showed the plate with the crash on top 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.040
 and then an original symbol of the 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.230

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.020
 Indeed ect video or start removing
