00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
polyethylene membrane down see how that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:39.260 
polyethylene membrane down see how that
fits<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.440> we're<00:02:31.440> good<00:02:38.120> looks<00:02:39.120> like

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
fits of that and we're good looks like

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.540 
fits of that and we're good looks like
you've<00:02:39.420> switched<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.050> smaller<00:02:40.380> trial<00:02:40.740> yep

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
you've switched to a smaller trial yep

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.410 
you've switched to a smaller trial yep
we<00:02:41.790> switch<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.270> 18<00:02:42.690> inch<00:02:43.190> trowel<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.610> we

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
we switch to a 18 inch trowel and we

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.120 
we switch to a 18 inch trowel and we
don't<00:02:45.630> need<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> lot<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.170> thin-set<00:02:46.440> underneath

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
don't need a lot of thin-set underneath

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.840 
don't need a lot of thin-set underneath
the<00:02:47.280> membrane<00:02:49.100> now<00:02:50.100> we're<00:02:50.310> gonna<00:02:50.430> set<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
the membrane now we're gonna set the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.160 
the membrane now we're gonna set the
drain<00:02:52.370> push<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.520> down<00:02:53.730> till<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:54.660> losses
