00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
don't last as long they tend to come off

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.730

more<00:01:37.290> easily

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.730 

and<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.869> I'm<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.200> use<00:01:44.320> some<00:01:44.350> top<00:01:44.710> coat

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.980 
and here I'm going to use some top coat
but<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.399> can<00:01:45.549> also<00:01:45.729> use<00:01:45.939> artificial<00:01:46.630> nail

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
but you can also use artificial nail

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.340 
but you can also use artificial nail
glue<00:01:47.290> which<00:01:47.770> would<00:01:47.979> last<00:01:48.159> longer<00:01:49.080> then<00:01:50.080> I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
glue which would last longer then I

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.289 
glue which would last longer then I
grabbed<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.040> jewel<00:01:51.280> with<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.640> pair<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.000> pliers

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
grabbed the jewel with a pair of pliers

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.100 
grabbed the jewel with a pair of pliers
and<00:01:52.899> apply<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.070> nail<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:55.600> I'm<00:01:55.930> going

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
and apply it on the nail now I'm going

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.960 
and apply it on the nail now I'm going
to<00:01:56.200> apply<00:01:56.350> some<00:01:56.649> top<00:01:56.890> coats<00:01:57.189> all<00:01:57.399> around<00:01:57.850> the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
to apply some top coats all around the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.450 
to apply some top coats all around the
Jew<00:01:58.149> but<00:01:58.450> not<00:01:58.750> on<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.799> top<00:02:00.009> coat<00:02:00.220> will

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
Jew but not on it the top coat will

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.800 
Jew but not on it the top coat will
basically<00:02:00.850> make<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.299> hold<00:02:01.539> better<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.479> that's

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
basically make it hold better so that's

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.289
