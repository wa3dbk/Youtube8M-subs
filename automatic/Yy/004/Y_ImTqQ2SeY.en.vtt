00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.940
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 Today I would like to teach you how to add 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.470
 things sportcar mode in terrarium speech 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.789
 will not go about ordinary terraria which 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.220
 used on computer 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.640
 a terraria which is used at the feast 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.369
 android and ios systems 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 So in order to add to the root 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.580
 things 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.949
 your mobile tyrael we need 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.059
 the device itself also we need 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.540
 a little time 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.329
 the program itself terraria does not have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.760
 full values or 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.340
 demo and we also need hands 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.340
 or jailbreak perhaps we will start 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.390
 spool you program which 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.579
 called game killer 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.790
 this is on android on ios this program 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.260
 called game player 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.030
 This program is an analogue of artmani on 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.520
 computer 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.640
 very useful thing for the Russian version 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.780
 so called broke to games 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.659
 further open and other player on 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.790
 root user requests like this 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.340
 we have the interface of the program further 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.710
 open the very terrarium here but 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.880
 terraria to add sports car things 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.400
 regime we need to replace or 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.910
 take a few things and 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.340
 example use potion treatment put 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.990
 its on the first line 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.140
 further in the killer circle and in the search bar 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.540
 we carry the item on a bottle of potion 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.850
 treatment which puts 50 units 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.450
 health do 28 click search 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 choose the phonetic it took us almost 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.830
 180 thousand values ​​already quite a lot 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.640
 she is such a bed for this we take another 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.920
 the subject of the example we will take a tree it and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.879
 children further again activate the course against 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.780
 9 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:20.159
 you see we have a large radiation staff 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.640
 so you don't need to look again from 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.319
 arranging for this we take a cobblestone it 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.420
 these three 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.420
 put it in place of the tree open ken 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.250
 killer station dad 3 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.430
 click search as you see we have found 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.180
 5 values ​​are now the most important thing we need 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.569
 change it first community limits what 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.099
 we will change for this open the browser 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.370
 for example, take this site where we 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:55.680
 everything is written let's go for example 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:01.170
 take the wings of the demon for the sake of 492 you 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:05.819
 see here they are for this again for prank 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:11.280
 terrarium choose the first value 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:14.970
 choose a table we will have 1 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.160
 and here we prescribe 1 492 is if you 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.910
 want to add hell labor push 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.690
 ready and by analogy with the following 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.230
 values 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.650
 each time to rise two polyps 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.520
 paragraph 3 and so on we also prescribe 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.520
 492 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.920
 look will 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.160
 492 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.060
 at 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:02.150
 make two points 4 of crime in 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.880
 last point you see he straightened 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.950
 very 409 fate 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:14.920
 recommend you differ from 05 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:17.769
 these are already put in ready okay how are you 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.150
 see we came to take the land for 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.010
 in order to use this this 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.750
 not enough will still be put 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:30.240
 Stone of this exit from the game we close 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.240
 him as follows go in again and 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.669
 now try to apply our add 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.639
 them in the field of improvements you see when 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.210
 set leaving leaving them 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:54.389
 performance as you can see 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.389
 or everything should work until the version 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.540
 also you can add any items 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.020
 until I mean any bonus 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.270
 weapons holy armor 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.900
 various boers that help fast 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.510
 for a year and so on I think in this 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.620
