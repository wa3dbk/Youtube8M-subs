00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.530 
zeolite now you look at what a zeolite
is<00:02:56.270> it's<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.690> micro<00:02:57.080> porous<00:02:57.970> alumina<00:02:58.970> silicon

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
is it's a micro porous alumina silicon

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.430 
is it's a micro porous alumina silicon
mineral<00:03:00.080> used<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.830> as<00:03:01.130> an<00:03:01.250> absorbent<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:03.260> it's

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
mineral used it as an absorbent so it's

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.050 
mineral used it as an absorbent so it's
kind<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.740> you've<00:03:03.950> ever<00:03:04.010> seen<00:03:04.340> Primos<00:03:04.820> has<00:03:05.030> a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
kind of you've ever seen Primos has a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.330 
kind of you've ever seen Primos has a
spray<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.959> has<00:03:06.260> silver<00:03:06.770> in<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.100> it's

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
spray that has silver in it and it's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.260 
spray that has silver in it and it's
based<00:03:07.910> off<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.530> principle<00:03:12.760> now<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.820> fleece

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
based off that principle now the fleece

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.560 
based off that principle now the fleece
in<00:03:14.510> here<00:03:14.810> for<00:03:15.290> warmth<00:03:15.770> it's<00:03:15.950> 355<00:03:16.940> grains<00:03:17.360> of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
in here for warmth it's 355 grains of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.560 
in here for warmth it's 355 grains of
fleece<00:03:17.900> or<00:03:18.800> excuse<00:03:19.190> me<00:03:19.220> crams<00:03:19.730> not<00:03:20.060> grains<00:03:20.360> I'm

fleece or excuse me crams not grains I'm

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.870 
fleece or excuse me crams not grains I'm
gonna<00:03:20.720> read<00:03:20.870> too<00:03:20.959> much<00:03:21.080> bullet<00:03:21.410> stuff<00:03:21.880> 355

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
gonna read too much bullet stuff 355

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.800 
gonna read too much bullet stuff 355
grams<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.780> fleece<00:03:24.110> which<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.570> you<00:03:26.570> know<00:03:26.630> like

grams of fleece which is a you know like
I<00:03:26.900> said<00:03:26.959> it's<00:03:27.470> gonna<00:03:27.590> be<00:03:28.310> really<00:03:28.489> warm<00:03:28.930> during

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
I said it's gonna be really warm during

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.920 
I said it's gonna be really warm during
the<00:03:30.200> rut<00:03:30.470> which<00:03:30.800> up<00:03:31.100> here<00:03:31.600> generally<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.750> ruts

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
the rut which up here generally the ruts

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.340 
the rut which up here generally the ruts
gonna<00:03:33.140> be<00:03:33.820> early<00:03:34.820> November<00:03:35.360> kind<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.959> round<00:03:36.170> in

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
gonna be early November kind of round in

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.830 
gonna be early November kind of round in
there<00:03:36.560> plus<00:03:37.459> or<00:03:37.670> minus<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.090> week<00:03:38.239> depending<00:03:38.420> on

there plus or minus a week depending on

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.870 
there plus or minus a week depending on
cold<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:42.170> it's<00:03:42.530> perfect<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.580> it's

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
cold so it's perfect for that and it's

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.420 
cold so it's perfect for that and it's
not<00:03:44.150> it's<00:03:44.870> it's<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.230> compressed<00:03:45.709> fleece<00:03:46.070> it's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
not it's it's a compressed fleece it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.820 
not it's it's a compressed fleece it's
not<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:47.239> light<00:03:47.450> airy<00:03:47.780> fleece<00:03:48.140> that<00:03:48.350> wind<00:03:48.620> goes

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
not the light airy fleece that wind goes

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.130 
not the light airy fleece that wind goes
through<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.610> compressed<00:03:50.300> police<00:03:50.600> so

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
through this is the compressed police so

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.110 
through this is the compressed police so
you<00:03:51.350> know<00:03:51.530> it's<00:03:51.680> good<00:03:51.860> for<00:03:51.890> for<00:03:52.610> wind<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:52.970> all

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
you know it's good for for wind and all

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.670 
you know it's good for for wind and all
that<00:03:53.150> stuff<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.940> has<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.120> moisture<00:03:56.680> transport

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
that stuff it has a moisture transport

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.620 
that stuff it has a moisture transport
system<00:03:58.040> which<00:03:58.070> wicks<00:03:58.519> sweat<00:03:58.640> away<00:03:59.180> from<00:03:59.330> the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
system which wicks sweat away from the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.289 
system which wicks sweat away from the
body<00:03:59.870> that's<00:04:00.590> extremely<00:04:01.280> important<00:04:02.030> up<00:04:02.120> here

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
body that's extremely important up here

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.150 
body that's extremely important up here
in<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.450> cold<00:04:02.690> weather<00:04:02.930> when<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.590> walk<00:04:03.830> out<00:04:04.040> to

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
in the cold weather when you walk out to

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.340 
in the cold weather when you walk out to
your<00:04:04.250> stand<00:04:04.580> you're<00:04:04.820> gonna<00:04:04.970> sweat<00:04:05.390> even<00:04:06.080> if

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
your stand you're gonna sweat even if

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.320 
your stand you're gonna sweat even if
you<00:04:06.950> know<00:04:07.070> most<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.580> time<00:04:07.730> I'll<00:04:07.940> leave<00:04:08.120> my

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
you know most of the time I'll leave my

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.229 
you know most of the time I'll leave my
stuff<00:04:08.600> unzipped<00:04:09.320> as<00:04:09.500> much<00:04:09.830> as<00:04:10.010> possible<00:04:10.250> but

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
stuff unzipped as much as possible but

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.030 
stuff unzipped as much as possible but
it<00:04:11.480> you're<00:04:11.750> still<00:04:12.080> gonna<00:04:12.260> sweat<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> little<00:04:12.890> bit

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
it you're still gonna sweat a little bit

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.430 
it you're still gonna sweat a little bit
so<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.239> is<00:04:14.330> going<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.510> keep<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.840> sweat<00:04:15.260> away

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
so this is going to keep that sweat away

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.050 
so this is going to keep that sweat away
from<00:04:15.830> your<00:04:15.980> body<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:21.769> sleeve<00:04:22.310> construction

from your body the sleeve construction

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.510 
from your body the sleeve construction
is<00:04:23.240> designed<00:04:23.780> for<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.110> full<00:04:24.919> range<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.310> motion

is designed for a full range of motion

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.420 
is designed for a full range of motion
with<00:04:25.910> no<00:04:26.510> chapping<00:04:27.080> now<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.770> full<00:04:28.070> range<00:04:28.250> of

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.950 
with no chapping now the full range of
motion<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.910> very<00:04:28.970> important<00:04:29.690> when<00:04:29.840> you're

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
motion is very important when you're

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.870 
motion is very important when you're
doing<00:04:30.260> things<00:04:30.500> like<00:04:30.640> especially<00:04:31.640> if<00:04:31.729> you<00:04:31.789> have
