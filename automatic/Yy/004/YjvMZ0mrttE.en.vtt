boys which means that now we can get

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
boys which means that now we can get
very<00:01:21.180> tanky<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.320> no<00:01:22.439> limit<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.799> that

very tanky and there's no limit on that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.590 
very tanky and there's no limit on that
we<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.640> many<00:01:23.850> times<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.299> feel

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
we can use this as many times as we feel

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
we can use this as many times as we feel
like<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.110> only<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.710> crit<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.280> stop<00:01:26.549> us<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
like it and only a crit can stop us and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
like it and only a crit can stop us and
may<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.270> toxic<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.869> stuff<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
may be toxic and stuff like that

may be toxic and stuff like that
so<00:01:29.009> today<00:01:29.159> behind<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.579> set<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.299> want

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
so today behind the set is that we want

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to get it stanky as possible make it to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.130 
to get it stanky as possible make it to
where<00:01:32.670> our<00:01:32.790> opponent<00:01:33.090> can't<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.450> damage<00:01:33.960> us

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
where our opponent can't out damage us

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
where our opponent can't out damage us
to<00:01:34.290> where<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> takes<00:01:35.189> two<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:35.490> three

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to where you know it takes two or three

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
to where you know it takes two or three
hits<00:01:35.939> even<00:01:36.299> knock<00:01:36.420> us<00:01:36.540> down<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.840> half<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.229> we

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
hits even knock us down to half so we

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.929 
hits even knock us down to half so we
have<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.530> worry<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.860> ruse<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> that's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
have to worry about a ruse and that's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
have to worry about a ruse and that's
very<00:01:39.240> possible<00:01:39.509> especially<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.799> how<00:01:40.979> tank

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
very possible especially with how tank

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
very possible especially with how tank
it<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.700> remember<00:01:42.030> 70<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.420> hit<00:01:42.570> points<00:01:42.869> 102<00:01:43.500> on

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
it is remember 70 on hit points 102 on

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
it is remember 70 on hit points 102 on
defenses<00:01:44.130> usually<00:01:44.490> use<00:01:44.640> defend<00:01:45.030> order<00:01:45.270> twice

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
defenses usually use defend order twice

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.010 
defenses usually use defend order twice
that<00:01:46.020> means<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.350> 344<00:01:47.100> hit<00:01:47.220> points<00:01:47.549> almost

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
that means we have 344 hit points almost

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.160 
that means we have 344 hit points almost
600<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.259> defense<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:51.170> 560

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
600 on that defense and then like 560

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
600 on that defense and then like 560
ish<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.740> special<00:01:53.220> defense<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
ish on the special defense so I like the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.359 
ish on the special defense so I like the
idea<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.720> calm<00:01:54.930> nature<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.470> 200<00:01:56.070> defense

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
idea of a calm nature with 200 defense

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
idea of a calm nature with 200 defense
investment<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.270> reason<00:01:57.509> why<00:01:57.600> 200<00:01:57.990> defense

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
investment the reason why 200 defense

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.959 
investment the reason why 200 defense
investment<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> calm<00:01:58.979> nature<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.700> just

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
investment with a calm nature it's just

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
investment with a calm nature it's just
going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.240> fairly<00:02:00.450> easy<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
going to be fairly easy to do and it's

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889 
going to be fairly easy to do and it's
also<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.460> us<00:02:02.640> pretty<00:02:03.450> good<00:02:03.570> all

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
also going to make us pretty good all

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.969 
also going to make us pretty good all
around<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> we're<00:02:04.439> gonna<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> good

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
around that we're gonna have a good

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.679 
around that we're gonna have a good
amount<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.280> bulk<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.149> those<00:02:06.270> physical

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
amount of bulk for those physical

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.630 
amount of bulk for those physical
attacks<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> nice<00:02:07.950> backing<00:02:08.459> for

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
attacks then we have a nice backing for

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
attacks then we have a nice backing for
a<00:02:08.700> special<00:02:09.060> offense<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.170> like

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
a special offense or you can just like

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.650 
a special offense or you can just like
make<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.860> easy<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.160> yourself

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
make it really easy on yourself

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.020 
make it really easy on yourself
-<00:02:11.990> TV<00:02:12.230> -<00:02:12.260> now<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.130> really<00:02:13.340> lose<00:02:13.460> too<00:02:13.670> much<00:02:13.790> but

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
- TV - now can really lose too much but

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.340 
- TV - now can really lose too much but
you<00:02:14.090> are<00:02:14.270> going<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.750> be<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.870> little<00:02:15.200> more

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
you are going to be a little more

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.570 
you are going to be a little more
successful<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:15.980> special<00:02:16.310> defense

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
successful on the special defense

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.550 
successful on the special defense
standpoint<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.240> when<00:02:17.630> boosting<00:02:18.110> those

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
standpoint and when boosting those

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.930 
standpoint and when boosting those
points<00:02:18.890> are<00:02:19.010> being<00:02:19.100> lost<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.760> know<00:02:19.880> if

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
points are being lost that you know if

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.820 
points are being lost that you know if
we<00:02:20.030> had<00:02:20.150> 15<00:02:20.840> more<00:02:21.050> points<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.500> special

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
we had 15 more points and special

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.200 
we had 15 more points and special
offense<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.280> know<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.460> used<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.790> fend<00:02:23.000> order

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
offense you know you used to fend order

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.910 
offense you know you used to fend order
twice<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.960> means<00:02:24.050> we're<00:02:24.260> losing<00:02:24.560> out<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.710> a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
twice that means we're losing out on a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.530 
twice that means we're losing out on a
lot<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:25.130> points<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.610> long<00:02:25.790> run<00:02:26.060> but

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
lot of points in the long run but

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.420 
lot of points in the long run but
overall<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:27.200> personal<00:02:27.680> preference<00:02:28.100> on<00:02:28.190> if

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
overall it's personal preference on if

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.740 
overall it's personal preference on if
you<00:02:28.490> won't<00:02:28.670> be<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> physical<00:02:29.150> tank<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.450> mixed

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
you won't be a physical tank a mixed

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.810 
you won't be a physical tank a mixed
tank<00:02:29.930> or<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> special<00:02:30.620> tank<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.040> now<00:02:31.490> let's<00:02:31.670> get

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
tank or a special tank and now let's get

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.640 
tank or a special tank and now let's get
into<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> rest<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.360> strategy<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.020> my<00:02:33.170> idea

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
into the rest of strategy so my idea

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.860 
into the rest of strategy so my idea
toxic<00:02:34.280> infestation<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.690> use

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
toxic infestation that you use

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.960 
toxic infestation that you use
infestation<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:36.860> threw<00:02:37.070> out<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.340> toxic<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
infestation you threw out the toxic and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.640 
infestation you threw out the toxic and
then<00:02:38.060> they<00:02:38.210> die<00:02:38.510> because<00:02:38.810> they're<00:02:39.440> going<00:02:39.590> to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
then they die because they're going to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.770 
then they die because they're going to
be<00:02:39.710> taking<00:02:39.980> infestation<00:02:40.700> damage<00:02:41.000> increasing

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
be taking infestation damage increasing

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.570 
be taking infestation damage increasing
toxic<00:02:42.140> damage<00:02:42.440> they<00:02:42.650> can't<00:02:42.920> switch<00:02:43.160> out<00:02:43.370> and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
toxic damage they can't switch out and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.670 
toxic damage they can't switch out and
then<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.240> just<00:02:44.360> roost<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:44.930> them<00:02:45.110> for<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
then you can just roost all them for the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.530 
then you can just roost all them for the
win<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.670> idea<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:46.880> citrus<00:02:47.240> barrier

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
win I like the idea of citrus barrier

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.330 
win I like the idea of citrus barrier
that<00:02:47.660> way<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.870> know<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.140> defend<00:02:48.500> order<00:02:48.800> you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that way you know you defend order you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.250 
that way you know you defend order you
defend<00:02:49.670> order<00:02:49.940> citrus<00:02:50.270> very<00:02:50.450> procs<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.960> roost

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
defend order citrus very procs you roost

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.990 
defend order citrus very procs you roost
defend<00:02:51.680> order<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.160> then<00:02:52.550> you're<00:02:52.700> ready<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.910> go

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
defend order and then you're ready to go

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.610 
defend order and then you're ready to go
and<00:02:53.240> then<00:02:53.570> you're<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.930> be<00:02:53.990> super<00:02:54.290> tanky

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
and then you're going to be super tanky

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.130 
and then you're going to be super tanky
I'm<00:02:54.800> also<00:02:55.400> with<00:02:55.850> using<00:02:56.240> defend<00:02:56.510> order<00:02:56.780> it's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
I'm also with using defend order it's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.450 
I'm also with using defend order it's
going<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.380> make<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.740> where<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:57.920> can<00:02:58.160> endure

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
going to make it to where you can endure

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.430 
going to make it to where you can endure
those<00:02:58.580> super<00:02:58.910> effective<00:02:59.270> hits<00:02:59.480> to<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> degree

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
those super effective hits to a degree

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.860 
those super effective hits to a degree
so<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.160> play<00:03:01.550> around<00:03:01.640> those<00:03:01.910> except<00:03:02.600> if<00:03:02.750> you're

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
so I play around those except if you're

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.090 
so I play around those except if you're
dealing<00:03:03.170> with<00:03:03.200> like<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.410> rock<00:03:03.620> type<00:03:03.830> attack

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
dealing with like a rock type attack

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.580 
dealing with like a rock type attack
rock<00:03:04.670> type<00:03:04.910> is<00:03:05.090> going<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.390> be<00:03:05.480> very<00:03:05.990> brutal<00:03:06.290> -

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
rock type is going to be very brutal -

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.080 
rock type is going to be very brutal -
so<00:03:06.890> we<00:03:07.010> are<00:03:07.130> gonna<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.460> to<00:03:07.580> pay<00:03:07.700> attention<00:03:07.790> to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
so we are gonna have to pay attention to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.240 
so we are gonna have to pay attention to
that<00:03:08.240> you<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.780> also<00:03:08.930> change<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.770> up<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.070> bit

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
that you can also change this up a bit

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.100 
that you can also change this up a bit
and<00:03:10.400> go<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.610> bit<00:03:10.880> more<00:03:10.910> offensive<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.900> while

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
and go a bit more offensive that while

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.500 
and go a bit more offensive that while

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
eventually become very rewarding so I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.100 
eventually become very rewarding so I
was<00:03:28.610> thinking<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.910> want<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.270> go<00:03:29.360> with<00:03:29.630> pretty

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
was thinking you want to go with pretty

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.230 
was thinking you want to go with pretty
much<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.650> same<00:03:30.860> setup<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.430> except<00:03:32.030> instead

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
much the same setup here except instead

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.880 
much the same setup here except instead
of<00:03:32.360> calm<00:03:32.600> nature<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.080> change<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:33.440> too<00:03:33.530> careful

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
of calm nature you change it too careful

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.410 
of calm nature you change it too careful
that<00:03:34.040> way<00:03:34.130> you're<00:03:34.280> not<00:03:34.310> lowering<00:03:34.970> your<00:03:35.150> attack

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
that way you're not lowering your attack

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.480 
that way you're not lowering your attack
and<00:03:35.720> then<00:03:36.020> after<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.350> couple<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:37.100> home<00:03:37.250> Falls

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490

and then after a couple of home Falls
we're<00:03:38.000> going<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.390> be<00:03:38.510> tanky<00:03:39.080> we're<00:03:39.350> going<00:03:39.470> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.800 
order and then we slab roost why not
heal<00:03:43.130> order<00:03:43.459> well<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.180> thing<00:03:44.360> about<00:03:44.390> heal

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
heal order well the thing about heal

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.750 
heal order well the thing about heal
order<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.830> you<00:03:45.980> know<00:03:46.100> heals<00:03:46.400> using<00:03:46.700> by

order is that you know heals using by

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.479 
order is that you know heals using by
50%<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.540> then<00:03:47.780> roost<00:03:48.200> killjoys<00:03:48.739> about<00:03:48.980> 50%

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
50% and then roost killjoys about 50%

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.360 
50% and then roost killjoys about 50%
but<00:03:49.940> it<00:03:50.090> removes<00:03:50.630> your<00:03:51.050> flying<00:03:51.350> typing<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.310> if

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
but it removes your flying typing so if

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.000 
but it removes your flying typing so if
by<00:03:52.670> some<00:03:52.730> miracle<00:03:53.450> you're<00:03:54.290> faster<00:03:54.709> than<00:03:54.739> your

by some miracle you're faster than your
opponent<00:03:55.430> like<00:03:55.580> this<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:56.060> why<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.239> don't<00:03:56.570> really

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
feel that roost is too much better but I

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.790 
feel that roost is too much better but I
mean<00:03:59.330> there's<00:03:59.510> those<00:03:59.870> weird<00:04:00.110> off<00:04:00.260> chances<00:04:00.709> you

attack order and dusting bond the idea

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.550 
attack order and dusting bond the idea
behind<00:04:29.250> this<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:29.790> if<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.120> need<00:04:30.780> tailwind

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
behind this is that if you need tailwind

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.800 
behind this is that if you need tailwind
if<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.950> need<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.160> singles<00:04:32.700> tailwind<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.660> is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
if you need a singles tailwind this is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.330 
if you need a singles tailwind this is
probably<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.140> best<00:04:34.260> way<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.500> doing<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.920> first

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
probably the best way of doing it first

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.430 
probably the best way of doing it first
turn<00:04:35.550> use<00:04:35.820> tailwind<00:04:36.300> focus<00:04:36.630> ash<00:04:36.750> procs<00:04:37.050> after

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
turn use tailwind focus ash procs after

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.350 
turn use tailwind focus ash procs after
that<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.680> have<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.830> loft<00:04:38.010> speed<00:04:38.310> used<00:04:38.820> estaban

that you have a loft speed used estaban
your<00:04:39.570> opponent<00:04:39.810> attacks<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.530> both<00:04:40.920> go

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
your opponent attacks you you both go

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.260 
your opponent attacks you you both go
down<00:04:41.280> but<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:41.640> left<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.910> tail<00:04:42.090> weight

down but you left the tail weight

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.760 
down but you left the tail weight
advantage<00:04:42.600> for<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.810> couple<00:04:43.020> more<00:04:43.170> turns<00:04:43.350> you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
advantage for a couple more turns you

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.620 
advantage for a couple more turns you
bring<00:04:43.980> in<00:04:44.100> a<00:04:44.160> slow<00:04:44.340> pokemon<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:45.000> needs<00:04:45.360> that

tailwind<00:04:46.050> boost<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.680> goes<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.040> blows<00:04:47.250> up

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
tailwind boost that goes and blows up

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.240 
tailwind boost that goes and blows up
everything<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.300> then<00:04:49.200> you<00:04:49.380> can<00:04:49.590> use<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:49.920> for

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
everything and then you can use that for

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.980 
everything and then you can use that for
a<00:04:50.310> huge<00:04:50.610> advantage<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.120> if<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.600> tail<00:04:51.810> when

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
a huge advantage that if that tail when

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.600 
a huge advantage that if that tail when
gives<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.800> KO<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:53.310> wouldn't<00:04:53.550> have

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
gives you that KO that you wouldn't have

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.130 
gives you that KO that you wouldn't have
had<00:04:53.760> you're<00:04:54.180> starting<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.510> snowball<00:04:54.840> off<00:04:55.020> of
