made no sense with what i guess said now
we<00:01:22.200> gotta<00:01:22.470> landscapes<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:24.350> rectangles

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
we gotta landscapes are rectangles

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.670 
we gotta landscapes are rectangles
coming<00:01:25.799> off<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.299> makes<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.450> even<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
coming off it makes that even I kind of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.550 
coming off it makes that even I kind of
messed<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.310> further<00:01:29.670> left<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.290> then

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
messed up there further left and then

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160 
messed up there further left and then
you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.829> draw<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.570> lines<00:01:33.570> coming<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you can draw two lines coming on the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.240 
you can draw two lines coming on the
back<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.900> that<00:01:36.900> adds

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
back of it and that adds

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.360 
back of it and that adds
now<00:01:39.790> we<00:01:40.000> can<00:01:40.150> draw<00:01:40.210> spikes<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.140> I'd<00:01:42.010> not

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
now we can draw spikes and I'd not

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.160 
now we can draw spikes and I'd not
unlike<00:01:42.760> this<00:01:42.970> Fitness<00:01:43.420> little<00:01:43.690> triangles

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
unlike this Fitness little triangles

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.340 
unlike this Fitness little triangles
coming<00:01:44.590> off<00:01:44.710> any<00:01:45.010> part<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.400> want<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.750> on<00:01:50.020> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
coming off any part you want but on the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.740 
coming off any part you want but on the
pictures<00:01:50.770> they<00:01:51.460> got<00:01:51.670> like<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.450> they're

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
pictures they got like that and they're

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.800 
pictures they got like that and they're
more<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.770> depth<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:55.180> I'm<00:01:55.300> not<00:01:55.450> look<00:01:55.660> at<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
more in depth but I'm not look at so

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.970 
more in depth but I'm not look at so
eyes<00:01:58.810> wise<00:01:59.590> yeah<00:02:00.400> I<00:02:00.790> think<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.330> rhymes<00:02:01.980> they

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
eyes wise yeah I think that rhymes they

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.450 
eyes wise yeah I think that rhymes they
can<00:02:03.130> just<00:02:03.310> be<00:02:03.490> dots<00:02:04.060> like<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:05.310> order<00:02:06.310> can<00:02:06.430> be

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
can just be dots like that order can be

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.050 
can just be dots like that order can be
bats<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:07.120> this<00:02:07.330> with<00:02:07.600> her<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.280> shovel<00:02:09.759> I

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.790 
just made those senses now but you know
like<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:50.140> chocolate<00:02:50.380> sauce<00:02:50.769> I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
like that and this chocolate sauce I

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.949 
like that and this chocolate sauce I
thought<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.790> just<00:02:51.910> messed<00:02:52.360> up<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.660> my<00:02:52.750> words

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
thought I just messed up on my words

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.550 
thought I just messed up on my words
this<00:02:53.800> cactus<00:02:54.070> dog<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.780> green<00:02:55.989> one<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:56.380> she

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
this cactus dog is the green one so she

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.120 
this cactus dog is the green one so she
has<00:02:57.100> what<00:02:57.790> I'm<00:02:57.910> drawing<00:02:58.120> here<00:02:58.890> he<00:02:59.890> has<00:03:00.100> a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
has what I'm drawing here he has a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.290 
has what I'm drawing here he has a
little<00:03:00.430> kind<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.850> her<00:03:01.780> template<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.590> his<00:03:02.800> face

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
little kind of her template on his face

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.630 
little kind of her template on his face
theory<00:03:04.300> here<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.590> would<00:03:05.860> color<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.340> area

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
theory here so you would color that area

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.520 
theory here so you would color that area
and<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:07.060> much<00:03:07.269> lighter<00:03:07.510> than<00:03:07.840> what<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.019> just<00:03:08.110> did

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
and a much lighter than what I just did

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.680 
and a much lighter than what I just did
but<00:03:08.590> I'm<00:03:09.250> doing<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.060> by<00:03:10.209> looking<00:03:10.360> through

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
but I'm doing this by looking through

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.110 
but I'm doing this by looking through
