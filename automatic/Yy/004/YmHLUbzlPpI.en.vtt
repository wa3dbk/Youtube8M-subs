00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:11.591
 Hello everyone, welcome to watch the IT people 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.940
 Today I will test the three sports camera with you again. 

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:18.195
 Look at the place that will be in this place this time. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.320
 In the morning, I will take everyone into the theme park to see the daytime shooting situation. 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.360
 The first piece is taken with GoPro 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 This time I used 720p, 60 seconds per second. 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.000
 Seeing that even if the picture was changed from the last tested 4K to 720p 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.960
 The picture quality is still good. 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.260
 Very clear 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.720
 In slow playback, you see the fine bits for the water droplets. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.780
 With the water surface, background, leaves, etc. 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.735
 Very clear 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.680
 I believe this is also expected 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.900
 Because GoPro was also doing well in the dark environment last time. 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.880
 What about the mountain dog that did not perform well in the dark environment last time? 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.560
 The picture color seems a bit reddish 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.500
 Color is still heavy 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.060
 But seeing it even now in slow motion 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.640
 Seeing every picture is also clear, such as leaves, water droplets 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.180
 Are very clear 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.980
 When taking a photo at night before washing 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.480
 More vague, a lot of "ghost" hurricanes 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.420
 On Sony, I saw the picture crisp and crisp. 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.860
 No some afterimage 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.840
 The shock absorption is also quite successful, and the picture on the ship is quite stable. 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.460
 Sony and GoPro support ultra-high speed shooting 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.640
 The current picture is taken by GoPro with 1 second and 240 frames. 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.780
 In slow motion, the picture still keeps the picture smooth 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020
 Won't "one grid" 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.240
 This mountain dog is not super high speed shooting 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.740
 The mountain dog only provides a maximum of 60 seconds in 1 second. 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.700
 Sony and GoPro are up to 240 seconds in 1 second. 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.240
 Look at other pictures, each moving camera screen orientation 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.160
 The mountain dog is bright but dark 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.940
 Sony is soft and bright 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.700
 GoPro is sharp 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.820
 In summary, in the case of the day 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.000
 The effect of the tested motion camera is relatively close 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.580
 No late deviations are so big 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.740
 The time of this episode is coming again, see you next time.
