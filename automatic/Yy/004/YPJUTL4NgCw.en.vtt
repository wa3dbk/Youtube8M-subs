00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.260 
okay this is part three of my solar hot
water<00:00:10.930> coil<00:00:11.560> and<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:15.400> I've<00:00:15.550> done<00:00:15.730> here<00:00:16.000> is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
water coil and what I've done here is

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.670 
water coil and what I've done here is
I've<00:00:16.630> got<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:17.640> I've<00:00:18.640> got<00:00:18.910> all<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.390> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I've got the I've got all the the

I've got the I've got all the the
fittings<00:00:20.680> so<00:00:22.110> braze<00:00:23.110> together<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:24.960> when<00:00:25.960> you

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
fittings so braze together and when you

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.130 
fittings so braze together and when you
do<00:00:26.260> this<00:00:26.619> you<00:00:27.430> don't<00:00:27.609> want<00:00:28.090> to<00:00:28.420> fill<00:00:28.869> it<00:00:29.020> with

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
put a a pressure test on here and I

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:00.119 
put a a pressure test on here and I
filled<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.519> with<00:00:54.549> air<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:57.959> I<00:00:58.959> had<00:00:59.619> a<00:00:59.649> couple<00:00:59.949> of

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
filled it with air and I had a couple of

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.920 
filled it with air and I had a couple of
leaks<00:01:00.399> I<00:01:02.280> there's<00:01:03.280> actually<00:01:04.030> sixty-four

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
leaks I there's actually sixty-four

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.140 
leaks I there's actually sixty-four
joints<00:01:05.650> -<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:07.540> for<00:01:07.810> each<00:01:08.160> so<00:01:09.160> I<00:01:09.490> had<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.730> couple

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
joints - two for each so I had a couple

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:19.400 
joints - two for each so I had a couple
leaks<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.330> just<00:01:16.540> take<00:01:16.750> some

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.870 

soapy<00:01:20.410> water<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.960> find<00:01:22.960> them<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.880> sometimes

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
soapy water and find them and sometimes

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.810 
soapy water and find them and sometimes
if<00:01:25.390> it's<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.690> good-sized<00:01:26.170> leak<00:01:26.620> it'll<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:27.550> won't

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
if it's a good-sized leak it'll it won't

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.380 
if it's a good-sized leak it'll it won't
even<00:01:28.030> blow<00:01:28.270> bubbles<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.140> little<00:01:29.380> actually

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.460 

you<00:01:34.390> know<00:01:34.480> you<00:01:34.690> just<00:01:34.870> need<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.230> use<00:01:35.440> your

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
you know you just need to use your

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.050 
you know you just need to use your
finger<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.250> find<00:01:36.670> it

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
finger to find it

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.210 
finger to find it
so<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.560> just<00:01:38.800> put<00:01:39.730> a<00:01:39.760> hose<00:01:40.660> on<00:01:41.020> here<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.740> fill

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
so you just put a hose on here and fill

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.460 
so you just put a hose on here and fill
it<00:01:42.340> up<00:01:42.430> with<00:01:42.640> air<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:43.409> find<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.560> leak<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it up with air and find the leak and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.760 
it up with air and find the leak and
then<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.810> way<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.080> don't<00:01:50.350> have<00:01:50.620> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
then then that way you don't have the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.090 
then then that way you don't have the
thing<00:01:51.010> full<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.430> water<00:01:51.700> where<00:01:52.120> you<00:01:52.150> can't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.940 

where<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:58.060> know<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:59.470> don't<00:01:59.620> have<00:01:59.770> to

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
where you can you know you don't have to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.149 
where you can you know you don't have to
drain<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.640> everything<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.690> get<00:02:02.010> to<00:02:03.010> get

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
drain it and everything to get to get

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.090 
drain it and everything to get to get
the<00:02:03.310> leak<00:02:03.520> repaired<00:02:04.020> but

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
the leak repaired but

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.050 
the leak repaired but
anyway<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.480> got<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.170> coil<00:02:08.410> together<00:02:08.920> now<00:02:09.220> it's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
anyway I got the coil together now it's

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.840 
anyway I got the coil together now it's
uh<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.970> good<00:02:13.150> 10<00:02:13.510> feet<00:02:13.780> long<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:15.550> not

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
uh it's a good 10 feet long and it's not

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.280 
uh it's a good 10 feet long and it's not
quite<00:02:16.270> 3<00:02:16.660> feet<00:02:16.900> high<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.600> anyway<00:02:22.020> we're<00:02:23.020> ready

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
quite 3 feet high so anyway we're ready

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.330 
quite 3 feet high so anyway we're ready
to<00:02:24.090> mount<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.390> thing<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.940> we'll<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.090> back
