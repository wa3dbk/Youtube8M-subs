area that's now known as Pennsylvania he

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.190 
area that's now known as Pennsylvania he
imagined<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> was<00:02:12.450> possible<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.990> develop

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

an entirely new city here in North

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.330 
an entirely new city here in North
America<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:17.070> he<00:02:17.790> created<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.300> charter<00:02:18.720> that
