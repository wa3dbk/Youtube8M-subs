00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.710
 I notice this game maybe this time 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.140
 not suitable for all people 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.149
 so video may not be too 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 especially for the most 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.950
 then my stomach is weak 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.050
 I'll let you see what it's all about 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.690
 this aberration of nature that is in the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.789
 our front here now I will press x 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 to start is a flash game 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.320
 I'm going to put five kings because I do not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.140
 I want to play an entire tournament then 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.270
 people click here and we will choose 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.399
 the track where we play 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.440
 I hope I can remember everyone. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.809
 the commands here is as follows the first 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.510
 lane presentation of her i will translate 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.600
 for you a very crazy guy tremendous 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.159
 tremendous 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.119
 then the woman asks why you do not 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 was wearing no clothes is the guy 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.920
 still not saying anything 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.290
 you can hear did not say anything 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.930
 also 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.470
 I said 'why are not you wearing 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.470
 no clothes 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.070
 There the guy answers cars do not wear 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:43.040
 clothes cars cars do not talk in cars 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.320
 they run 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.000
 He leaves it's a race, I'll explain. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.729
 that this is what you're running with a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.740
 bunch of guy without clothes 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.070
 There you have these power ups that you 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.180
 Catch me, I'm not flying to them. 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.250
 making noise 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.750
 you have I want to get a power is to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.009
 show you what it's all about 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.290
 that you still have no idea of 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.060
 bizarre thing that until you see 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.649
 the power both in operation 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.080
 let me see if I can get some and 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.560
 I'm obviously terrible at this game and I'm going 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.250
 arrive at last all but i have 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.010
 patience 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.050
 with me when you can run from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.390
 Suddenly he grabs the site picked up a 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.920
 Power up this power is exactly what 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.060
 Are you thinking he is if you? 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 x tighten this program plays the coconut 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.970
 others saying so directly 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.080
 now I got two power after 1 and a16 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.840
 play 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.880
 I'm doing everything wrong so I 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.950
 I'm useful now I've come by the way 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.770
 Wrong wonder 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.190
 oh right now i have three power aps 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.140
 no I play when others in 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.790
 hence I play a can with something 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.430
 that I do not want to be me not that I do not 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.800
 I want it to be a liquid without something 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.959
 I do not want to know what 's yellow then 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.910
 We already understand what it can be to me. 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.220
 I'm late because I was wrong at that time. 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.020
 on the track and this game here I'm not 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.660
 actually playing to try to be good I 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.520
 I just want to show you how far you can go until 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.700
 where the human imagination goes with the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.130
 her most obscure places 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.630
 There I was going to have one more but one more 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.170
 run I took another power up from 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.230
 It's a yellow thing here and now I'm going to 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.180
 last turn I got the plague trick 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.610
 dammit and playing with one playing with 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.410
 camera keyboards is a marvel of 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.000
 control I'll put the control 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.610
 No, I will not need to try to play 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.120
 again put the control once 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.860
 and beauty face I'll let another 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.590
 and know what it's all about. 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.790
 business here I speed up and we arrive 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.100
 at the end of the game that's what you saw 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.950
 I want to see if I can get more power up. 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.290
 one more turn, man, I'm going to cut 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.030
 the next map now let's go guys 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.510
 according to the map I'm going to play with 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.989
 you this here is the bizarre or tse is the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.360
 bizarre killing think better production 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:09.450
 He asks who's there I'm going to take 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.110
 my browns out front and show me one 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.110
 claimed 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.739
 please do not eat me for an cars not 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.980
 they taste really good and do not have any 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.980
 nutritive value goal 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.690
 I 'm warning you, cars can be 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.690
 very dangerous 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.350
 You do not know how many people die in 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:45.130
 accidents in traffic every year is traffic 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.150
 in the glory of having brought in created 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.150
 right region 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.950
 This is the last chance I'm a band. 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.910
 black in kung fu cafu car that you 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.810
 called 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:02.800
 Come on, man, this way. 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.960
 This goes from here to where the head of the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.490
 human being understood this one here a test 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.030
 This is a monster coming after me. 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.100
 and damn stampede will bum 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.020
 though 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.910
 I show coming up behind Argentina by 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.919
 but this time I'm not in the last 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.050
 which is already a breakthrough but I will miss the 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.310
 turn ball back and 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.770
 see that this route is more difficult if 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.720
 The first one I showed is easier. 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.280
 but anyway I'm walking here now I 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.810
 I have two power ups and there's a new one there. 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.150
 You need to see what it's all about. 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.430
 I got stuck I'm already at 27 still 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.050
 has no name is the following text power 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.490
 Why throw things ahead? 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.440
 You already saw there, I have to play the 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.500
 things behind now this father is 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.850
 exactly what they are getting expensive 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.860
 for this game 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.660
 when I was doing I was 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.340
 doing research for the videos of this 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.430
 series there was this thing that I said 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:56.190
 I can not believe someone pollutes the head. 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.150
 someone conceived this expensive game 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.130
 I got that power for everybody. 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.860
 know the business is there you 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:07.030
 throws things there is already wrong and the 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.690
 I drug this drug in here, that 's good, man. 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.910
 What's up? 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.419
 get out of the front show I got power-up 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.400
 I was on my feet, this is Pedro's again. 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.040
 Then the guy behind me was able to accelerate. 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.630
 are a business to keep accelerating almost 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.450
 impossible 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.580
 everybody passed by on the side 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.560
 at least one last one which is a 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.190
 Good advantage and I caught three palm trees 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.230
 now it has 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.640
 the knives game that will not stop me 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.080
 a lot that now when 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.510
 I'll be able to get close to the guy's in 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.150
 my front but I'll show 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.560
 any way he does it there's that 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.960
 what's up 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.970
 I came in eighth is not the last 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.560
 understood then the globe has a globe there 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.600
 Anyone here has a zygo animation of 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:56.620
 end but I'm afraid to show the 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:59.890
 What the fuck! Let it go! 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.270
 so is this guys is I will not show 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.580
 but this game if you want to play this 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.810
 freak of nature that thing I do not know 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.810
 inexplicable conceived by the imagination 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.360
 the link is in the description I do not 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.260

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.100
 the intellect itself
