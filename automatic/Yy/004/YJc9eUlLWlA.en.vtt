00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
moment there that that was a couple you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
moment there that that was a couple you
know<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.070> true<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.520> jumped<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.880> mind<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
know the true that jumped to mind is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.220 
know the true that jumped to mind is
probably<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.110> SEC<00:02:13.560> Championship<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:16.050> won

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
probably the SEC Championship we won

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.920 
probably the SEC Championship we won
that<00:02:16.440> freshman<00:02:16.740> year<00:02:17.100> my<00:02:17.310> freshman<00:02:17.550> year<00:02:17.970> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that freshman year my freshman year that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.510 
that freshman year my freshman year that
that<00:02:19.170> was<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.560> exciting<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.160> then<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
that was really exciting and then the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.750 
that was really exciting and then the
other<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:20.940> probably<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.990> touchdown

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
other one is probably the touchdown

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.090 
other one is probably the touchdown
I<00:02:24.020> get<00:02:25.020> well<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> guess<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.800> really<00:02:25.860> a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
I get well I guess it's not really a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.210 
I get well I guess it's not really a
touchdown<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.550> got<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> cold<00:02:27.480> back<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.800> ran<00:02:29.190> a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
touchdown I got a cold back but we ran a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.690 
touchdown I got a cold back but we ran a
fake<00:02:29.490> punt<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:31.130> got<00:02:32.130> into<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> end<00:02:32.580> zone

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
fake punt and I got into the end zone

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.760 
fake punt and I got into the end zone
but<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> flag<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.170> play<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
but there was a flag on the play and it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.890 
but there was a flag on the play and it
got<00:02:34.890> cold<00:02:35.130> back<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.670> early<00:02:36.060> celebration<00:02:36.810> or

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
got cold back for early celebration or

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.880 
got cold back for early celebration or
something<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.410> was<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> first

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
something like that was like the first

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.260 
something like that was like the first
time<00:02:38.130> they'd<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> cold<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.000> college

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
time they'd have a cold it in college

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.690 
time they'd have a cold it in college
football<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.440> crazy<00:02:40.770> people<00:02:41.220> still<00:02:41.459> talk

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
football so it's crazy people still talk

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.729 
football so it's crazy people still talk
about<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.209> think<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.690> four<00:02:43.590> or

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
about that I think it was like four or

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.510 
about that I think it was like four or
five<00:02:43.800> years<00:02:44.250> ago<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
five years ago so it's it it it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.360 
five years ago so it's it it it
definitely<00:02:47.910> changed<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.510> lot<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:50.130> know<00:02:50.250> I've

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
definitely changed a lot you know I've

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.340 
definitely changed a lot you know I've
never<00:02:50.550> had<00:02:50.760> anybody<00:02:51.030> recognized<00:02:51.690> my<00:02:51.870> face<00:02:51.900> or

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
never had anybody recognized my face or

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.350 
never had anybody recognized my face or
anything<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:53.040> when<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.940> happened

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
anything and then when that happened

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.610 
anything and then when that happened
that<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.660> changed<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> little<00:02:55.200> bit<00:02:55.380> around

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that that changed a little bit around

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.979 
that that changed a little bit around
school<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.370> was<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.910> funny<00:02:57.780> but

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
school so that was that was funny but

school so that was that was funny but
it's<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.320> think<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:58.950> crazy<00:02:59.070> people

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
it's I think it's it's crazy people

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.130 
it's I think it's it's crazy people
still<00:02:59.730> talk<00:02:59.940> about<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.390> five<00:03:00.720> years<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.080> don't

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
still talk about it five years I don't

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.800 
still talk about it five years I don't
know<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.130> part<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.610> coming<00:03:03.360> out<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.510> LSU

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
know it's a part of it coming out of LSU

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
know it's a part of it coming out of LSU
things<00:03:04.440> didn't<00:03:04.799> really<00:03:04.980> happen<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.730> would

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
things didn't really happen is you would

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.610 
things didn't really happen is you would
envision<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.540> got<00:03:06.690> signed<00:03:06.989> by<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> Eagles

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
envision if you got signed by the Eagles

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.410 
envision if you got signed by the Eagles
and<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:07.980> didn't<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.549> cut<00:03:08.700> what<00:03:09.330> did

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and then didn't make the cut what did

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.170 
and then didn't make the cut what did
you<00:03:09.540> learn<00:03:09.660> from<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.959> experience<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:12.060> was

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
you learn from this experience it was

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.000 
you learn from this experience it was
just<00:03:12.420> really<00:03:12.630> humbling<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.320> know<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> didn't

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
just really humbling you know I didn't

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.830 
just really humbling you know I didn't
think<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.459> when<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.330> was<00:03:15.450> coming<00:03:15.690> out<00:03:15.750> of

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
think that when I was coming out of

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.539 
think that when I was coming out of
school<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.440> didn't<00:03:16.799> think<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.220> wouldn't<00:03:17.430> be

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
school I didn't think that I wouldn't be

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.830 
school I didn't think that I wouldn't be
playing<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> next<00:03:18.090> year<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.480> know<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.630> thought

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
playing the next year you know I thought

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.300 
playing the next year you know I thought
I'd<00:03:18.989> have<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> team<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.560> thought<00:03:19.709> I'd<00:03:19.860> be<00:03:20.010> playing

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
I'd have a team I thought I'd be playing

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.060 
I'd have a team I thought I'd be playing
on<00:03:20.549> Sundays<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.360> then<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.530> wasn't<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.890> case
