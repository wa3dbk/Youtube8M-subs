hey<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.810> it's<00:00:01.079> Beefaroni<00:00:02.570> wanted<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.840> show

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hey guys it's Beefaroni wanted to show

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.430 
hey guys it's Beefaroni wanted to show
off<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:05.069> new<00:00:05.190> piece<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.000> software<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.990> was

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
off a new piece of software that was

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.910 
off a new piece of software that was
recommended<00:00:07.950> by<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.519> co-worker

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
recommended by a co-worker

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:18.590 
recommended by a co-worker
it's<00:00:10.920> called<00:00:11.160> FeO<00:00:11.519> gen<00:00:13.670> it<00:00:14.960> bakes<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.470> AO<00:00:17.600> to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it's called FeO gen it bakes the AO to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.970 
it's called FeO gen it bakes the AO to
either<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.439> high<00:00:19.619> poly<00:00:19.920> vertex<00:00:20.430> colors<00:00:21.170> or<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
either the high poly vertex colors or it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.439 
either the high poly vertex colors or it
can<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.160> bake<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.699> right<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> low<00:00:24.240> poly

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
can just bake it right to the low poly

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.620 
can just bake it right to the low poly
texture<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.260> think<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.220> real<00:00:26.640> strength<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
texture I think the real strength of the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.460 
texture I think the real strength of the
mod<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.289> real<00:00:28.439> strength<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> program<00:00:29.279> is

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
mod the real strength of the program is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.139 
mod the real strength of the program is
baking<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> high<00:00:32.070> poly<00:00:32.309> vertex<00:00:32.759> colors

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
baking to the high poly vertex colors

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.240 
baking to the high poly vertex colors
and<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.719> does<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.110> through<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> GPU<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and it does it all through the GPU so

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.380 
and it does it all through the GPU so
it's<00:00:35.460> super<00:00:36.420> super<00:00:36.899> quick

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
it's super super quick

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.530 
it's super super quick
it's<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:40.219> $35<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.579> during<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it's about $35 right now during the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.940 
it's about $35 right now during the
development<00:00:43.200> process<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.640> at<00:00:45.590> $35<00:00:46.590> it's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
development process I think at $35 it's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.080 
development process I think at $35 it's
a<00:00:47.280> no-brainer<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.270> buy<00:00:48.649> at<00:00:49.649> 70<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a no-brainer to buy at 70 when it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.869 
a no-brainer to buy at 70 when it
releases<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.899> still<00:00:52.110> buy<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.920> 35<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
releases I would still buy it but 35 it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
releases I would still buy it but 35 it
was<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.410> just<00:00:55.410> had<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
was just just had to have it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.180 
was just just had to have it
you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.320> download<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> without

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you can if you just download it without

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
you can if you just download it without
buying<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.789> you're<00:00:59.969> able<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.300> test<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
buying it you're able to test out the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.939 
buying it you're able to test out the
software<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> can't<00:01:02.070> export<00:01:02.370> any<00:01:02.640> map<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
software but you can't export any map so

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.760 
software but you can't export any map so
after<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.100> video<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.729> any<00:01:06.770> second

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
after this video if you have any second

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
after this video if you have any second
thoughts<00:01:07.799> about<00:01:08.299> if<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.840> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
thoughts about if it's good just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.100 
thoughts about if it's good just
download<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.010> test<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.880> think<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.810> think

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
download it test it out I think I think

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.490 
download it test it out I think I think
I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.740> everyone<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.450> enjoy<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.960> let<00:01:16.380> me

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
I think everyone will enjoy it so let me

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.810 
I think everyone will enjoy it so let me
open<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.220> real<00:01:17.430> quick<00:01:18.830> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.220> load<00:01:20.580> in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
open it up real quick going to load in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.800 
open it up real quick going to load in
my<00:01:21.290> high<00:01:22.290> poly<00:01:22.590> model<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:26.810> this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
my high poly model this is about this

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.880 
my high poly model this is about this
model<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> about<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:30.110> little<00:01:31.110> over<00:01:31.350> two<00:01:31.680> million

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
model is about a little over two million

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.550 
model is about a little over two million
Poly's<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.810> when<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> load<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.259> its<00:01:34.439> gonna

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Poly's and when I load it in its gonna

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
Poly's and when I load it in its gonna
take<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.490> under<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> minute<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.509> process

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
take a little under a minute to process

00:01:37.200 --> 00:02:00.270 
take a little under a minute to process
everything<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.990> hopefully<00:01:39.990> nothing<00:01:40.170> freezes

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.070 

so<00:02:01.000> what<00:02:01.120> it's<00:02:01.270> doing<00:02:01.480> right<00:02:01.570> now<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.900> just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
so what it's doing right now is just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.360 
so what it's doing right now is just
yeah<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:02.350> generating<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.920> AO<00:02:03.070> on

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
yeah it's generating the AO on

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.610 
yeah it's generating the AO on
everything<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.030> it's<00:02:04.540> doing<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.080> incredibly

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
everything and it's doing it incredibly

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.270 
everything and it's doing it incredibly
quick<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.130> these<00:02:06.340> these<00:02:06.850> are<00:02:07.000> some<00:02:07.390> pretty

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
quick and these these are some pretty

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.640 
quick and these these are some pretty
some<00:02:09.280> really<00:02:09.550> nice<00:02:09.729> results<00:02:10.200> from<00:02:11.200> something

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
some really nice results from something

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.650 
some really nice results from something
that<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.830> don't<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.220> set<00:02:12.460> up<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.850> cage

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that you don't have to set up a cage

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
that you don't have to set up a cage
distance<00:02:14.290> or<00:02:14.440> set<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.860> high<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.190> low<00:02:15.430> poly

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
distance or set up a high to a low poly

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.860 
distance or set up a high to a low poly
just<00:02:16.060> bake<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.860> completely<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> GPU<00:02:18.870> super

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
just bake it completely on the GPU super

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.740 
just bake it completely on the GPU super
quickly<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:21.700> able<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.060> see<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.510> real

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
quickly and be able to see it in real

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.090 
quickly and be able to see it in real
time<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> model<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:25.620> here's<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.740> result

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
time on the model so here's the result

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.290 
time on the model so here's the result
of<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.370> AO<00:02:32.190> there's<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.250> few<00:02:33.520> parts<00:02:33.820> here<00:02:34.120> where

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
of the AO there's a few parts here where

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.920 
of the AO there's a few parts here where
the<00:02:34.650> model<00:02:35.650> dot<00:02:36.220> isn't<00:02:36.610> high<00:02:37.030> enough<00:02:37.060> res<00:02:37.570> I'll

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
the model dot isn't high enough res I'll

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.630 
the model dot isn't high enough res I'll
probably<00:02:38.170> blur<00:02:38.470> these<00:02:38.740> out<00:02:38.950> or<00:02:38.980> edit<00:02:39.370> them<00:02:39.490> in

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
probably blur these out or edit them in

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.430 
probably blur these out or edit them in
Photoshop<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.510> other<00:02:40.630> alternative<00:02:41.290> would<00:02:41.380> be

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
Photoshop the other alternative would be

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.280 
Photoshop the other alternative would be
to<00:02:41.680> smooth<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.130> mesh<00:02:42.340> again<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:43.140> thought<00:02:44.140> would

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
to smooth the mesh again I thought would

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.140 
to smooth the mesh again I thought would
just<00:02:44.440> be<00:02:44.560> creating<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.070> huge<00:02:45.280> file<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.730> my<00:02:45.880> case

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
just be creating a huge file in my case

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.920 
just be creating a huge file in my case
and<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.780> areas<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.290> don't<00:02:47.800> look<00:02:47.980> good<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.430> so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and the areas that don't look good or so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.300 
and the areas that don't look good or so
small<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.080> comparison<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.770> everything<00:02:51.130> that

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
small in comparison to everything that

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.690 
small in comparison to everything that
does<00:02:51.700> look<00:02:52.240> that<00:02:52.600> looks<00:02:53.020> great<00:02:53.700> here's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
does look that looks great here's

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.240 
does look that looks great here's
another<00:02:54.880> area<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:56.110> here's<00:02:56.560> another<00:02:56.680> area<00:02:57.220> and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
another area and here's another area and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.070 
another area and here's another area and
once<00:02:57.490> again<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.060> could<00:02:58.120> insert<00:02:58.750> more<00:02:58.900> edge

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
once again so I could insert more edge

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.140 
once again so I could insert more edge
loops<00:02:59.380> there's<00:02:59.800> a<00:03:00.070> bunch<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.640> things<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.940> could

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
loops there's a bunch of things I could

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.750 
loops there's a bunch of things I could
do<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.990> get<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:02.530> super<00:03:02.860> super<00:03:03.430> smooth

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
do to get this like super super smooth

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.449 
do to get this like super super smooth
but<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.060> really<00:03:04.300> not<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.450> big<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.110> deal

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
but it's really not that big of a deal

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.770 
but it's really not that big of a deal
in<00:03:06.510> addition<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.959> doing<00:03:08.640> AO<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.300> also<00:03:10.450> do<00:03:10.750> a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
in addition to doing AO it can also do a

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:25.890 
in addition to doing AO it can also do a
gradient<00:03:11.080> map<00:03:11.350> which<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.130> will<00:03:12.400> show<00:03:12.640> right<00:03:12.880> now

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.589 

so<00:03:26.530> there's<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.890> gradient<00:03:27.280> map<00:03:27.430> once<00:03:28.269> again

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
so there's the gradient map once again

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.619 
so there's the gradient map once again
it<00:03:28.840> looks<00:03:29.440> really<00:03:29.890> nice<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.370> was<00:03:30.819> calculated

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
it looks really nice and was calculated

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.350 
it looks really nice and was calculated
and<00:03:31.900> maybe<00:03:32.590> about<00:03:32.890> 10<00:03:33.220> seconds<00:03:33.670> I'm<00:03:33.819> not<00:03:34.180> sure

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
and maybe about 10 seconds I'm not sure

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.399 
and maybe about 10 seconds I'm not sure
how<00:03:34.450> long<00:03:34.629> that<00:03:34.690> was<00:03:34.989> but<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.560> was<00:03:35.980> pretty

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
how long that was but it was pretty

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:53.020 
how long that was but it was pretty
wasn't<00:03:38.409> long<00:03:38.680> at<00:03:38.830> all

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.970 

so<00:03:54.030> here's<00:03:54.390> just<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.810> Oh<00:03:54.900> again<00:03:55.349> on<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
so here's just the a Oh again on the

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.160 
so here's just the a Oh again on the
model<00:03:58.609> once<00:03:59.609> again<00:03:59.879> looks<00:04:00.120> good<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.750> I'm<00:04:01.019> gonna

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
model once again looks good so I'm gonna

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.250 
model once again looks good so I'm gonna
right<00:04:01.709> click<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:02.159> mesh<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:03.060> then<00:04:03.870> save<00:04:04.230> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
right click this mesh and then save the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.119 
right click this mesh and then save the
vertex<00:04:04.829> AO<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:06.170> then<00:04:07.170> I'm<00:04:07.920> gonna

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
vertex AO on it and then I'm gonna

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.140 
vertex AO on it and then I'm gonna
export<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.939> to<00:04:09.000> an<00:04:09.420> FBX<00:04:10.519> so<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.939> main

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
export that to an FBX so just the main

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.279 
export that to an FBX so just the main
high<00:04:12.329> poly<00:04:12.629> AO<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:14.420> then<00:04:15.420> an<00:04:15.599> X<00:04:15.810> normal<00:04:16.259> I<00:04:16.590> can

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
high poly AO and then an X normal I can

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:27.969 
high poly AO and then an X normal I can
load<00:04:19.289> up<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.799> FBX<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.820> was<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:21.090> exported

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.749 

so<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.039> have<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> main<00:04:29.520> AO<00:04:31.160> turn<00:04:32.160> off<00:04:32.340> ignore

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
so I have the main AO turn off ignore

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:39.529 
so I have the main AO turn off ignore
for<00:04:33.060> its<00:04:33.330> vertex<00:04:33.900> color<00:04:37.699> import<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.910> low<00:04:39.240> poly

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
for its vertex color import the low poly

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:55.480 
for its vertex color import the low poly
mesh<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.710> cage

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.279 

all<00:04:56.000> right<00:04:56.150> so<00:04:56.300> have<00:04:56.419> those<00:04:56.599> both<00:04:56.810> loaded<00:04:57.169> in

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
all right so have those both loaded in

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.339 
all right so have those both loaded in
and<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.860> baking<00:04:58.220> options<00:04:58.669> have<00:04:59.569> the<00:04:59.780> main<00:04:59.990> set

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
and the baking options have the main set

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.010 
and the baking options have the main set
to<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.680> map<00:05:00.919> and<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:02.180> I'm<00:05:02.300> gonna<00:05:02.449> go<00:05:02.630> down<00:05:02.810> to

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
to the map and then I'm gonna go down to

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.090 
to the map and then I'm gonna go down to
bake<00:05:03.199> high<00:05:03.410> poly<00:05:03.680> vertex<00:05:04.160> color

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.100 

and<00:05:12.090> so<00:05:12.360> there<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.250> high<00:05:14.250> Polly's<00:05:15.110> Bao

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
and so there it is the high Polly's Bao

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.110 
and so there it is the high Polly's Bao
was<00:05:16.440> baked<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.890> high<00:05:17.010> poly<00:05:17.280> vertex<00:05:17.730> colors

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
was baked to the high poly vertex colors

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.460 
was baked to the high poly vertex colors
that<00:05:18.930> was<00:05:19.110> baked<00:05:19.350> into<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.680> low<00:05:19.950> poly<00:05:20.250> and

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
that was baked into the low poly and

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.710 
that was baked into the low poly and
here<00:05:22.470> we<00:05:22.560> have<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.740> map<00:05:23.040> since<00:05:23.700> some<00:05:24.330> parts<00:05:24.600> of

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
here we have a map since some parts of

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.430 
here we have a map since some parts of
the<00:05:24.810> model<00:05:25.170> were<00:05:25.320> generated<00:05:26.040> with<00:05:26.400> an<00:05:26.670> N<00:05:27.240> do<00:05:27.450> by

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
the model were generated with an N do by

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.940 
the model were generated with an N do by
quick<00:05:28.740> cyl<00:05:29.420> those<00:05:30.420> won't<00:05:30.840> be<00:05:31.050> baked<00:05:31.500> into<00:05:31.740> this

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
quick cyl those won't be baked into this

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.670 
quick cyl those won't be baked into this
AO<00:05:32.160> map<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:32.820> what<00:05:33.480> I'm<00:05:33.600> gonna<00:05:33.750> end<00:05:34.020> up<00:05:34.140> doing<00:05:34.320> is

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
AO map so what I'm gonna end up doing is

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.820 
AO map so what I'm gonna end up doing is
combining<00:05:34.950> this<00:05:35.490> AO<00:05:35.700> map<00:05:36.060> with<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.290> AO<00:05:37.440> map

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
combining this AO map with the AO map

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.920 
combining this AO map with the AO map
generated<00:05:38.430> from<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.730> normals<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.390> I<00:05:39.630> think

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
generated from the normals and I think

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.530 
generated from the normals and I think
that'll<00:05:40.350> just<00:05:40.380> end<00:05:40.920> with<00:05:41.760> very<00:05:42.150> little<00:05:42.330> effort

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
that'll just end with very little effort

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.750 
that'll just end with very little effort
and<00:05:42.960> very<00:05:43.140> little<00:05:43.350> time<00:05:43.620> it'll<00:05:44.040> end<00:05:44.310> up<00:05:44.490> being

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
and very little time it'll end up being

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.020 
and very little time it'll end up being
a<00:05:45.090> great<00:05:45.480> AO<00:05:45.780> map<00:05:46.170> and<00:05:46.880> yeah<00:05:47.880> I'm<00:05:47.970> really

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
a great AO map and yeah I'm really

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.130 
a great AO map and yeah I'm really
looking<00:05:48.450> forward<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.750> seeing<00:05:48.900> where<00:05:49.020> the

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
looking forward to seeing where the

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.260
