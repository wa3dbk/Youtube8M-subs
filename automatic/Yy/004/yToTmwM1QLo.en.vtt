where you play the path okay you can
start<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.270> think<00:02:07.510> about<00:02:07.630> playing<00:02:08.259> racket

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
start to think about playing racket

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.260 
start to think about playing racket
games<00:02:10.290> only<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.650> situation<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.850> now<00:02:13.060> is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
games only in that situation and now is

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.480 
games only in that situation and now is
where<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.600> second<00:02:13.930> point<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.410> coming<00:02:14.710> in<00:02:14.830> all

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
where the second point is coming in all

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.030 
where the second point is coming in all
the<00:02:15.730> stuff<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.060> said<00:02:16.390> before<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:17.320> very

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the stuff I said before is very

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.640 
the stuff I said before is very
important<00:02:18.610> because<00:02:19.240> if<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.780> start<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.320> play

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
important because if you start to play

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.670
