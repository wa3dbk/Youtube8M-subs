most threatening now then I think this

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.510 
most threatening now then I think this
could<00:05:57.660> be<00:05:57.690> a<00:05:57.750> penalty<00:05:58.200> there<00:05:59.160> was<00:05:59.280> a<00:05:59.310> little

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
could be a penalty there was a little

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.760 
could be a penalty there was a little

bit of a shirt full off the ball as to

play built up down the left and that has

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.410 
play built up down the left and that has
been<00:06:04.860> enough<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.310> persuade<00:06:05.670> this<00:06:05.850> referee<00:06:06.270> to
