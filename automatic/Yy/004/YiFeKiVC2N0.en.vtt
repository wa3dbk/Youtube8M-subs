00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.959
 hello dear gamers glasses and cordial 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.869
 Welcome to our test video too 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.580
 definitely for you by tomb raider ago 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.400
 Nearly a year ago, the newest appeared 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.780
 adventures of lara croft already for pc 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.320
 xbox 360 and ps3 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.120
 now it stands for xbox one and the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.890
 Playstation 4 in the trade 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.510
 since we were in our then test and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 testvideo already extensively on the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.360
 strengthen and weaken content 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 we want to get in 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 this test video especially with the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.470
 to deal with technical aspects 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.250
 and the xbox version with the pc-version 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.250
 to compare 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.399
 cusack 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.789
 and we just start with the xbox 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.469
 one to the default a bit 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.359
 darker than it comes in the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.280
 Playstation 4 version is the case 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.019
 therefore also fall ever after 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.549
 not so much the problems on the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.619
 Developer apparently with the hair 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.789
 had this essential now 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.530
 more detailed than that in the 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.039
 original version of the case 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.590
 is 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.630
 However, the lighting works through 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.840
 sometimes these grayish shimmer 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.000
 a little unnatural the most important 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
 but is at ambient six tours at 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.420
 effects and also lighting 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.229
 the game overall clearly 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.030
 gained at a glance 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.459
 presents the xbox train version 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.409
 the pc-version equal if you 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.420
 however, it looks closer 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.459
 you already that the pc version still 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.229
 the higher detail sharpness has and also 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.970
 on topics like edge smoothing one 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.970
 shows a slightly better figure 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.350
 also see in this direct comparison 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.750
 Here you can see quite well that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.030
 no detail in the textures 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.850
 too much difference 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.820
 Even the fire throws the teacher's torch 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.260
 does not have on any of the two platforms 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.420
 serious benefits and that's true too 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.080
 for the still ugly one 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.200
 water the psp version still has it 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.310
 natively in 1080p should run and with 60 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
 frames per second 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.989
 not too big advantages over 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.150
 the xbox bonn version with exception 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.600
 maybe from the slightly higher 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.600
 definition 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.550
 and here we show you one more 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.750
 Another scene from Lena's new adventure 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.060
 on the xbox man 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.100
 we have these objects here 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.760
 ignite and transport her here 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.870
 down to jump on the gate and that 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.030
 same again on pc and there you can 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.520
 quite clearly see that despite 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.960
 maximum graphics settings here no 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.910
 decisive advantage for the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.640
 recognizing pc version is actually 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.680
 there are even individual textures in 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.840
 the xbox version a bit sharper 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.540
 act as in the pc version apparently 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.540
 you have a few post-processed there 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.300
 the content of the xbox version is indeed 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.060
 identical but still offers a few 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.190
 new functions among others you can 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.690
 with the gesture control from kinect in 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.310
 certain sections like this one 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.990
 Example when climbing yours 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.490
 personal views like that 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.580
 Developers determine the name 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.300
 So that's just an alternative 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.940
 take a perspective 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.550
 and there are also kinect voice commands 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.290
 at least in the fight as extreme 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.090
 can be helpful if you have to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.460
 example simply by voice command 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.950
 fast from normal to fire 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.570
 changes the only special feature of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.700
 Playstation 4 version in this regard 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.760
 is the use of the speaker in the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.510
 gamepads photo about some 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.850
 ambient sounds are reproduced 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.480
 what kind of atmosphere 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.480
 should increase 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.940
 We would like to emphasize that the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.500
 version for xbox lane and ps4 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.870
 appear multilingual 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.060
 because at least the 360 ​​version was 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.100
 yes do not play in English 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.480
 Thankfully, he also regulates that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.130
 not about the language settings of the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.070
 console but may directly in the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.990
 Main menu speech output and subtitles 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.990
 choose language and that separately 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.230
 in that tomb raider is a really good one 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:17.539
 action adventure is changing with you 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.759
 Of course, xbox one and ps4 are nothing 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.570
 that means you should still play this 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.580
 do not own 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.410
 then nothing speaks against it 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.639
 the game is for one of the two 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.830
 platforms 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.770
 who the game for xbox 360 or ps3 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.199
 already he can think about whether he 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.240
 for a clearly much better 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.110
 graphic once again the wallet 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.639
 wants to pull 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.500
 but who the pc version and 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.060
 reasonably current has the hardware 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.460
 needs a purchase of xbox 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.740
 certainly or not 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.080
 make thoughts because he already owns 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.169
 one of the three best versions of the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.169
 , game
