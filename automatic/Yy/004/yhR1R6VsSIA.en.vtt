00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 for Manuel and Carlos Silva the name of 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.180
 the nightmare that your rope carries 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.849
 Gallística is your best strategy for 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 instill fear to colleagues of their trade 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.389
 but really what it is about is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.849
 to distinguish the company from roosters more 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.190
 famous in the Savanna region and that gave 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 origin to the gallera san josé one of the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.900
 most recognized scenarios throughout 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 country the father josé asunción silva was 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 a person recognized nationally 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.900
 and international and for their passion of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.020
 rooster made this this monument that at 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.149
 I present to you that one of the best 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.340
 streets that are here in Colombia from 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 very young child I felt the passion because 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.590
 the truth is very much the largest of the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.440
 three brothers and with him 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.710
 I identified and I was always next 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.489
 of the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:56.060
 and I include that sport that the truth 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.070
 I'm very passionate and I like it a lot 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.450
 them more than to the line of this animal 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.790
 they have dedicated themselves to their breeding 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.530
 the fine roosters are your passion and business 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.110
 to which they consecrate intense days 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.030
 paying attention to these specimens is that the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.659
 rooster breeding is a complex affair that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.999
 it requires time and money 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.450
 that there is an animal an athlete is a 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:18.340
 athlete and it's very delicate and we feel for 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.219
 that all drugs all medicines 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.250
 everything has to be preventive in the 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.959
 bird because buds and times are presented 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.939
 of the year that present many outbreaks of 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:31.020
 diseases at least smallpox 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.740
 avian is something that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.530
 produces great economic damage there is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.969
 loss economic loss with loss 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 of a bird of a chicken of several chickens 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.469
 that loses the amount of money the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.960
 Gallero must seek attention 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.759
 personalized to each specimen they 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.969
 they have to act as nurses 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.969
 nutritionists assistant coaches and 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.259
 it is best to put all his vocation to him 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.270
 rose from the roosters takes 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.340
 approximately one year since the period 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.229
 of incubation until the moment the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.399
 animal has reached maturity and can 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.590
 have their first fight 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.079
 there is an intensive form and another form 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.959
 extensive the extensive form is that a 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.730
 breeder takes his 10-15 chickens to a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.680
 patio with a rooster 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.010
 what advantages does that have the advantages that 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.739
 the medina 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.019
 it gets faster it goes faster but 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.049
 the great disadvantage is the creator does not know 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.950
 in case it is something extraordinary 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.110
 he does not know what a mother efe 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.360
 the great disadvantages that it has is that 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.950
 ras shaped and otherwise redo 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.620
 the intensive form you have to have 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.560
 an infrastructure where every hen 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.330
 has its warehouse 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.800
 or lest you bring him a cock that is 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.620
 that you take the hen so that the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.330
 cock serve her 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.640
 this is the intensive form this is the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.819
 organized old way that one leads 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.299
 to be able to know 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.780
 the animals you take what is the father which 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.780
 It is the mother 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.610
 it's a very good way to take it 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.920
 breeding of animals genetics is something 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.300
 quite delicate there must be a lot 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.300
 chemistry between the hen 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.890
 so that animals of 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.500
 excellent quality here these guacalito 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.310
 that I have I especially are brought 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.050
 the chicks that are born these 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.050
 as they have 5 days old 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.580
 to all 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.640
 I want the mother during during the 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.160
 day and it 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.640
 so that they eat better here, these 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.510
 nannies 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.040
 15 days thereafter until 2 months 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.040
 two and a half months that I took them to 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.200
 field where I have the most these are the 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.930
 who are in care and these are 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.250
 roosters that some are fighting others 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.830
 they are preparing 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.409
 here delay depends on the animal 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.180
 45 or 60 days in care this trades more 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.819
 of love for fighting animals that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.189
 of economic gains then in a fight 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.180
 they can lose an entire heritage 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:05.239
 represented in the schools of a 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.400
 rooster range from 300 500 roosters 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.870
 million of 5 million 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.180
 what is mattering now of 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.519
 Dominican Republic of Puerto Rico are 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.889
 roosters that come very expensive to 5,000 to 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.269
 10,000 dollars although maintain a 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.759
 rope requires a millionaire investment 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.259
 for the creators the most important thing is 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.050
 the emotions that these poultry 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:27.060
 can offer you in each square when 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.820
 peron rooster mine and win I get excited 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.789
 a lot because I see them from 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.190
 chick I picked them up the removed the 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:40.550
 Eggs included I see them is an emotion 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:45.190
 I do not tell you is indescribable no no 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.190
 you can not a very big emotion
