00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.190
 they are all boys and welcome back up 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.370
 this little corner dedicated to games 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.470
 of julia today we face a game that is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.570
 the first free game that yesterday 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.699
 associate professor is one of the games 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.910
 that I played was the game that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.580
 played for longer now now dear 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.040
 no friends but missing the word for a moment 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.800
 because my distinguished colleague is that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 you will understand that because he is sick there is a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 problem this guy suffering from the da 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.070
 what is the disease of trash 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.190
 yellow he likes shit sails among the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.809
 shitty games is true that before 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.030
 talk about this game 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.840
 we talk about this poor poor man or that a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.390
 this disease or boys to him 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.149
 defines shit rightly because mine 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.969
 a taste for charity a game that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.670
 ancient we are talking dm easing frog 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.900
 which I think boasts of a character from 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.590
 unbeatable charisma we are talking about 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.780
 of a frog was not a hand from the charisma 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.850
 unbeatable that was not pretty 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.590
 facial expressions and whose unique one 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.140
 purpose throughout the game will be of 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.150
 die in ragdoll style not two 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 practically blow this to a 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.290
 certain point it dies because you leave one 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.140
 rosy and stupid moves when 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.000
 arrives land because it may seem to 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.860
 earth there is friction stops 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.340
 no that slips and you can 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.170
 I can command a toy car 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.240
 get into this then guys 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.190
 the purpose of the game is the purpose of the game 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.540
 to be able to make the highest jump is 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.820
 managed to do in a game that works 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.740
 score as a pinball no no there is a 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.030
 where to win you have to do the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.220
 high score then also one 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.750
 challenge yourself against the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.119
 adversities of the world enclosed below 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.040
 form of challenges this is so appreciated 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.700
 the problem seems to be a serious matter 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.440
 main that it is not 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.379
 this game knows nothing about money 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.660
 series starting from gravity in the 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.180
 gravity that is not earthly is not is not 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.530
 lunar is not a big one but casey 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.180
 no one told us that the game is 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.480
 set on earth on earth you can 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.099
 see the frogs walking then maybe 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.130
 I doubt to see gods 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.989
 giant ventilations and barrels 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.000
 explosives because attention then 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.890
 practically as you see from the images 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.769
 you can take these these 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.450
 fans to be thrown far for 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.510
 do this which he calls a score 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.170
 high it really is not high because 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.120
 6,000 was not done once I did 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.069
 six thousand and among other things there are also 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.900
 of the small of the small surprises in 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.940
 this game sometimes the frog when you 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.760
 get up from the ground you have to use the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.069
 key a to raise the groundstead a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.549
 sometimes fart may seem like a thing 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.049
 trash is actually a metaphor 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.030
 on the unpredictability of life, that is 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.160
 boys and especially when you 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.170
 finally conquer frog after you have 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.819
 walked you have speed and jump 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.380
 press the hobo now now I see 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.510
 because it is difficult to work with a 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.970
 subject so no because he succeeds in 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.459
 turning trash into something serious 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.370
 but then guys I know a lot of you 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.980
 does not bore people just leaving you 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.019
 please as soon as it comes out uia I recommend you 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.180
 try this one of yes yes no no not it 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.519
 you have to because you don't have to feed the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.240
 hopes of these poor developers 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.910
 that they probably don't have a roof 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.090
 I don't know what they have that bad illness 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.340
 9 developers didn't feed theirs 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.950
 hopes for the work a thing one thing 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.370
 negative of the game I have to say so too 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.080
 ok it's free and instead i would have liked 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.700
 give money to people like that 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.830
 brave and so philosophical 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.470
 in equipping a game as amazing 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.460
 frog or videos from the game in months 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.940
 of the year 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.080
 removed take explosives 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.090
 usually one says I take one 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.550
 explosion I fly from Pisa the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.110
 flight is not clear but there you take 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.090
 the explosive may be that one 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.820
 explosive don't let you get there from 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.360
 no part depends on the way 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.790
 where you land on this explosive 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.220
 turns off a very realistic because if 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.640
 one falls on a grenade published by 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.410
 head goes farther than yes no in 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.170
 reality actually imaging frog 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.420
 this physics that the physics of energy 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.280
 added no that is if I read about physics 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.440
 energy sum fair without the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.940
 all add up this is not a guy 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.560
 of what works normally I would say 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.380
 giulia this review the review 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.360
 best months from lease fraud 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.410
 frog so give it a try I'll know what to say 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.740
 how much emotion it succeeds in arousing 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.740
 thrown in the toilet
