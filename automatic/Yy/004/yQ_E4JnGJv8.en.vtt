 Here is the story in one minute on the minute you need 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:15.540
 I opened the rice bowl to eat rice in the morning.

 Oh, but I like to buy a sandwich because I'm so sweet 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.089
 The woman is trying to get the amount. 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:42.040
 Because dinner is always late. I never eat when I go to work. 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:46.629
 I do not get dressed in the morning. I can not play my wife . 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.239
 I will come up in the morning because of the risk the same place would shake

 When her husband saw that the face value of the chickens in the morning Folks with King expressions

 I've eaten it well . Give me a word or give me a very nice day. 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.740
 This is the last reaction my husband can do. 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.810
 He's a little harder here. 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.869

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.190

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.040
 I am happy to welcome my husband coming home from work. 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.480
 It's possible 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.440
 I can not do things when I'm working, sometimes I'm late, sometimes I'm late 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.680
