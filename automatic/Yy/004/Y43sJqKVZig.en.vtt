that<00:01:54.190> category<00:01:55.740> where<00:01:56.740> we<00:01:56.920> go<00:01:57.130> people<00:01:57.670> for

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910

this<00:01:58.120> fitted<00:01:58.620> what<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.830> heck<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.190> odd

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.960 

so<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.220> these<00:02:05.370> are<00:02:05.580> cool<00:02:05.760> because

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
so we think these are cool because

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.359 
so we think these are cool because
they're<00:02:06.150> powered<00:02:06.360> by<00:02:06.570> BMW<00:02:07.260> motors<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:08.190> you'll

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
they're powered by BMW motors so you'll

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.460 
they're powered by BMW motors so you'll
notice<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.820> have<00:02:08.850> four<00:02:09.180> wheels<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:10.320> a<00:02:10.380> little
