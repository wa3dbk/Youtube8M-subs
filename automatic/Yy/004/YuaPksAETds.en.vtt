00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.280
 he in Chaco has been your career 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.720
 I started in Biguá all the lower ones in 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.550
 biguá 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.950
 after being a year when in 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.500
 first I went to the USA 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.680
 I was six years old when I made the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.390
 initial and university career 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.510
 I returned to Biguá, I stayed four seasons 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.820
 in biguá and there I started to play 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.770
 cool giambi and dance when finished 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.410
 championship was going to play the caribbean 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.330
 venezuela puerto rico and after there 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.700
 I went to Mexico I was in Mexico when 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.700
 two seasons later I signed on 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.430
 argentina I played in sanitary works three 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 seasons and now the last season 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.140
 I went to play in Brazil at UNICEF 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.580
 a match that we find with water 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.120
 in the end 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.270
 now a lot of this career that you've 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.380
 found with you suddenly did the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.280
 sent a little with him with leandro 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.010
 garcíamorales if we start from 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.700
 guys in the same after in the USA he was 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.410
 a little bit that facilitated the arrival and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 and we played a year together because we did not go back 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.050
 to play again until up to biguá and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.890
 about the end of my stay in biguá and 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.420
 after simply friendship I no no no 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 we played together again in no team 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.890
 We were in Xalapa for a while but very 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.000
 short 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.520
 so good more than anything a relationship 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.770
 friendship off the pitch Game 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.300
 most of the time like it's 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.430
 our partner because we play in the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.980
 I picked a lot of time together but 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.410
 fort more than anything in the beginning and more 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.270
 it's that biguá run that we have the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.020
 championships attacks so the people 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.000
 I remember it in water is a team that 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.330
 that bet strong in recent years 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.220
 logically with leandro the arrival is 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.200
 good and what flavio has done between 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.270
 club 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.670
 has generated a lot of things lots of 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.680
 expectations and last year that 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.959
 they had fantastic point of view I think 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.300
 that has motivated me to come and has kept quiet 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.000
 the bet a team that has great 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.580
 aspirations have logically been given 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.790
 many changes of javier in the body 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.130
 technical Americans still do not know 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.200
 you know there are many new ones that are going to come 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.900
 same my arrival so it's going to be a 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.459
 time a season that is going to have 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.860
 a lot of transition but we want it to be 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.989
 successful hours but the older tab has 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.299
 played in almost all nothing with rodrigo 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.069
 with pablo with good with marcelino 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.840
 now incorporates with leandro also yes 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.690
 yes with everyone with everyone I think that Rodrigo 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.240
 I with the only one who has not played with the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.760
 others I have a relationship of many years 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.500
 logically start in a new century 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.660
 they are different and it's there in our 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.630
 our career obviously Pablo in another 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.730
 function now they are already 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.200
 used to being here that I am the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.600
 that I come to settle here in this 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.700
 situation the good thing from starting to 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.140
 work and dealing with men pointed and 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.960
 a day to be the best way 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.600
 possible for the team as the year said 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.010
 passed in the final we played against you 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.440
 We lost it in the Peñarol Palace 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.830
 stadium full what impression did you take 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.830
 that day 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.360
 and a club was betting on big 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.890
 things I think things were made 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.690
 well and so much in the line of his American 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.090
 as in the league of the americas in 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.489
 As for the organization, the team had 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.100
 an identity last year I did not know what 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.310
 that he played against a season of the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.250
 almost unbeatable truth winning the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.920
 classics with good runs and playing with 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.300
 a lot of diversity and good showing a 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.020
 barbarian character I think that 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.789
 it showed that Uruguay is capable 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.020
 to to keep this kind of 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.729
 competition and hopefully it can be repeated 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.409
 this year 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.020
 the bloated last years dismissed them 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.340
 with with applause that more people in 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.360
 that water boat 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.730
 and logically play with so many people 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.160
 and for us who were on the other 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.229
 side in a high school was a big challenge 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.080
 of all the equipment that comes here is 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.500
 they realize that they generate what they generate 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.510
 things 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.810
 and for a team that is well armed 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.640
 I think it's an important weapon for us 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.690
 Now I'm personally trying to 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.010
 connect with the team part to 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.710
 try to get into what is what is going 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.330
 to look for this year and personally 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.610
 put me to good that is the only thing that I 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.580
 I can control then the other 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.099
 and generates water outside is a matter of water 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.629
 and I understand enjoyment people are not what 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.879
 mine get inside the court and try 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.650
 to solve problems in by 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.620
 last with what expectations itself has 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.000
 a way this for two years that is 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.530
 what you hope to get these two years in 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.670
 water good sports results but 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.750
 have a 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.330
 a good personal development 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.980
 grow with helping the team able 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.550
 one step more than what the 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.550
 last year 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.229
 and good and have a good time to try 

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:01.240
 to provide what I can give to 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.039
 this height of my career and the people 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.929
 know what something that I come up what is my 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.240
 function then expect to be able 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:08.889
 develop the best possible good for 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.689
 thank you very much from now we wish you 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.550
 the best of luck going alone the 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:14.349
 everyone's luck and it's worth the fans and 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.449
 I wanted to welcome that we say 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.129
 I also knew that they knew a 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.629
 little more than at least your words 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.550
 the first ones and as we said that we are going to 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.679
 be bothering the rest of the year good 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.499
 thank you very much for the welcome and 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:28.990
 I hope you have a good year to 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:32.219
 that is fine and that the team can 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.219
 develop best
