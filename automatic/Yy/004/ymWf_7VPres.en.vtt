princess of power cartoon the other
thing<00:01:48.009> that's<00:01:48.160> great<00:01:48.399> about<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:48.970> version<00:01:49.240> is

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
thing that's great about this version is

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.810 
thing that's great about this version is
he<00:01:49.899> includes<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.350> flight<00:01:50.649> stand<00:01:51.009> something

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
that the yellow version was sorely

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.249 
that the yellow version was sorely
lacking<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:55.060> stand<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.450> very<00:01:55.750> similar<00:01:56.080> to

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
lacking the stand is very similar to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.840 
lacking the stand is very similar to
what<00:01:56.380> we've<00:01:56.500> seen<00:01:56.740> with<00:01:56.890> figures<00:01:57.190> like<00:01:57.399> Orko

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
what we've seen with figures like Orko

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.180 
what we've seen with figures like Orko
but<00:01:58.090> this<00:01:58.330> time<00:01:58.600> just<00:01:58.780> has<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.200> small<00:01:59.619> foot<00:01:59.950> peg

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
but this time just has a small foot peg

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.160 
but this time just has a small foot peg
that<00:02:00.610> snugly<00:02:01.179> fits<00:02:01.390> onto<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.720> bottom<00:02:02.050> of

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
that snugly fits onto the bottom of

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.980 
that snugly fits onto the bottom of
either<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.740> cows<00:02:02.950> feet<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:04.450> nice<00:02:04.720> because

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
either of cows feet it's nice because

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.570 
either of cows feet it's nice because
that<00:02:05.350> means<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.679> can<00:02:05.830> also<00:02:05.950> use<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.520> for

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
that means you can also use this for

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.020 
that means you can also use this for
your<00:02:06.970> other<00:02:07.240> kal<00:02:07.569> figure<00:02:07.960> if<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.229> want<00:02:09.030> my

your other kal figure if you want my

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.720 
your other kal figure if you want my
only<00:02:10.660> gripe<00:02:11.049> is<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.799> wish<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.280> stand<00:02:12.549> were

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
only gripe is that I wish the stand were

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.759 
only gripe is that I wish the stand were
a<00:02:12.760> bit<00:02:13.090> taller<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.989> cow<00:02:14.170> was<00:02:14.200> actually
