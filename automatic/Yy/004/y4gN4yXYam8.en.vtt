a<00:01:36.450> week<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> change<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
a week so then I change to that and I

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.069 
a week so then I change to that and I
basically<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.970> stuck<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.299> all<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> basics

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
basically just stuck with all the basics

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
basically just stuck with all the basics
you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.770> bench<00:01:41.310> presses<00:01:41.790> barbell<00:01:42.240> row

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you know bench presses barbell row

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
you know bench presses barbell row
squats<00:01:42.899> deadlifts<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:44.310> tried<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.850> as

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
squats deadlifts and just tried to do as

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.940 
squats deadlifts and just tried to do as
heavyweight<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.689> possible

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
heavyweight as possible

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
heavyweight as possible
I<00:01:46.979> tried<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> train<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.270> six<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.750> eight

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I tried to train for like six to eight

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.080 
I tried to train for like six to eight
reps<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.040> could<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.310> nine<00:01:50.520> reps<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
reps so if I could get nine reps then I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.399 
reps so if I could get nine reps then I
would<00:01:51.210> increase<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> weight<00:01:51.780> next<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
would increase the weight next time I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
would increase the weight next time I
was<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.890> pushing<00:01:53.159> myself<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:53.850> hard<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
was really pushing myself really hard to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
was really pushing myself really hard to
keep<00:01:54.840> getting<00:01:55.020> stronger<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.710> stronger<00:01:55.950> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
keep getting stronger and stronger on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.219 
keep getting stronger and stronger on
the<00:01:56.850> basic<00:01:57.210> movements<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.869> six<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the basic movements for that six to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
the basic movements for that six to
eight<00:01:58.320> rep<00:01:58.560> range<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.219> along<00:01:59.850> with<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
eight rep range and along with that I

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.330 
eight rep range and along with that I
was<00:02:00.390> eating<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.780> lot<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> food<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.680> tremendous

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
was eating a lot of food a tremendous

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.670 
was eating a lot of food a tremendous
amount

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
amount

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.500 
amount
what<00:02:02.800> I<00:02:02.860> was<00:02:02.950> eating<00:02:03.370> not<00:02:03.640> only<00:02:03.790> protein<00:02:04.270> but

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
what I was eating not only protein but

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.090 
what I was eating not only protein but
an<00:02:04.990> unbelievable<00:02:05.170> amount<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.770> complex

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
an unbelievable amount of complex

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.890 
an unbelievable amount of complex
carbohydrates<00:02:06.420> probably<00:02:07.420> twice<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:07.750> many

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
carbohydrates probably twice as many

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
complex carbs as protein and my calories

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.530 
complex carbs as protein and my calories
are<00:02:10.869> probably<00:02:11.110> 4,500<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.100> 5,000<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.760> day<00:02:12.940> when<00:02:13.510> I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.040 
are probably 4,500 to 5,000 a day when I
was<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.010> 22<00:02:15.010> 21<00:02:15.610> year<00:02:15.970> range<00:02:16.420> when<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> was

I thought I would be ready so I started

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.210 
I thought I would be ready so I started
the<00:02:53.050> diet<00:02:53.230> basically<00:02:53.709> right<00:02:53.890> after<00:02:54.130> the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
the diet basically right after the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.130 
the diet basically right after the
holidays<00:02:54.580> right<00:02:55.030> after<00:02:55.239> January<00:02:55.600> first<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.550> I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
holidays right after January first and I

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.360 
holidays right after January first and I
just<00:02:59.140> followed<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.560> diet<00:02:59.770> that<00:03:00.010> was<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.190> little

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
just followed a diet that was a little

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.430 
just followed a diet that was a little
bit<00:03:00.459> different<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:00.880> time<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.450> was<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.720> little

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
bit different this time it was a little

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.740 
bit different this time it was a little
bit<00:03:02.590> higher<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:02.920> carbohydrates<00:03:03.750> complex

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
bit higher in carbohydrates complex

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.810 
bit higher in carbohydrates complex
carbohydrates<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.620> then<00:03:05.830> more<00:03:06.250> moderate<00:03:06.700> and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
carbohydrates and then more moderate and

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.630 
carbohydrates and then more moderate and
protein<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.390> low<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:07.870> fat<00:03:08.019> or<00:03:08.890> before<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.430> was

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
protein and low in fat or before I was

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.270 
protein and low in fat or before I was
the<00:03:10.120> last<00:03:10.330> six<00:03:10.780> years<00:03:10.840> or<00:03:11.080> so<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.620> was<00:03:11.950> following

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
the last six years or so I was following

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.940 
the last six years or so I was following
a<00:03:12.370> diet<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.760> was<00:03:12.850> very<00:03:13.150> high<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.420> protein

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
a diet that was very high in protein

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.770 
a diet that was very high in protein
pretty<00:03:14.950> high<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.280> fat<00:03:15.549> about<00:03:15.910> 7080<00:03:16.390> grams<00:03:16.630> a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
pretty high in fat about 7080 grams a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.720 
pretty high in fat about 7080 grams a

day from flaxseed oil and salmon and

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.400 
day from flaxseed oil and salmon and
whole<00:03:19.239> eggs<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.750> things<00:03:19.810> like<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.019> good

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
whole eggs and things like that good

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.620 
whole eggs and things like that good
fits<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.010> then<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.820> had<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.090> moderate<00:03:22.510> my

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
fits and then I had to moderate my

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.090 
fits and then I had to moderate my
carbohydrates<00:03:22.930> which<00:03:23.440> means<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.739> had<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.890> bring

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
carbohydrates which means I had to bring

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.759 
carbohydrates which means I had to bring
them<00:03:24.280> down<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.720> seems<00:03:25.959> like<00:03:26.110> every<00:03:26.410> year<00:03:26.620> as

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
them down so it seems like every year as

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.009 
them down so it seems like every year as
I've<00:03:26.890> gotten<00:03:27.190> older<00:03:27.459> I'm<00:03:27.580> 48<00:03:27.910> now<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.420> every

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
I've gotten older I'm 48 now and every

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.710 
I've gotten older I'm 48 now and every
year<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.680> my<00:03:29.860> 40s<00:03:30.280> as<00:03:30.549> I've<00:03:30.670> gotten<00:03:30.850> older<00:03:31.239> I've

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
year in my 40s as I've gotten older I've

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.060 
year in my 40s as I've gotten older I've
had<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.959> keep<00:03:32.110> burying<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.530> carbohydrates

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
had to keep burying the carbohydrates

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.009 
had to keep burying the carbohydrates
down<00:03:33.340> more<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.850> more<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.120> more<00:03:34.299> but<00:03:34.930> every

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
down more and more and more but every

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.570 
down more and more and more but every
time<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.260> tried<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.560> diet<00:03:35.920> for<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> photo<00:03:36.489> shoot

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
time I tried to diet for a photo shoot

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.660 
time I tried to diet for a photo shoot
the<00:03:37.060> gains<00:03:37.299> were<00:03:37.570> very<00:03:38.470> very<00:03:38.739> slow<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.430> if<00:03:39.519> I

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
the gains were very very slow and if I

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.280 
the gains were very very slow and if I
went<00:03:39.880> off<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.090> diet<00:03:40.269> even<00:03:40.420> one<00:03:40.720> day<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.049> was

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
went off the diet even one day it was

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.009 
went off the diet even one day it was
like<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.620> went<00:03:42.100> way<00:03:42.250> back<00:03:42.489> up<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.480> changed

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
like I went way back up so I changed

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.420 
like I went way back up so I changed
things<00:03:44.140> around<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.590> sort<00:03:44.799> of<00:03:44.890> follow<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.220> diet

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
things around I sort of follow the diet

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.310 
things around I sort of follow the diet
this<00:03:45.610> time<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.000> was<00:03:46.150> almost<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.110> diet

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
this time that was almost like the diet

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.470 
this time that was almost like the diet
we<00:03:47.470> did<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.769> 80s<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.549> know<00:03:48.670> where<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.390> was

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
we did in the 80s you know where it was

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.140 
we did in the 80s you know where it was
more<00:03:49.720> carbs<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.440> less<00:03:50.610> protein<00:03:51.610> not<00:03:51.910> low

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
more carbs and less protein not low

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.240 
more carbs and less protein not low
protein<00:03:52.390> but<00:03:52.720> less<00:03:52.959> protein<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.590> lower<00:03:53.860> fat

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
protein but less protein and lower fat

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.250 
protein but less protein and lower fat
and<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.060> really<00:03:55.329> worked<00:03:55.540> great<00:03:55.750> not<00:03:55.959> only<00:03:55.989> was

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
and it really worked great not only was

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.110 
and it really worked great not only was
just<00:03:56.410> because<00:03:56.650> my<00:03:56.799> body<00:03:56.829> needed<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.459> change<00:03:57.760> or

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
just because my body needed a change or

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.690 
just because my body needed a change or
what<00:03:58.630> but<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.170> worked<00:03:59.410> fantastic<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.549> mean

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
what but it worked fantastic and I mean

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.460 
what but it worked fantastic and I mean
I<00:04:00.760> was<00:04:00.850> making<00:04:01.150> significant<00:04:01.750> gains<00:04:01.959> each<00:04:02.170> week

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
I was making significant gains each week

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.310 
I was making significant gains each week
and<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:03.700> think<00:04:04.120> I'm<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.329> leanest<00:04:04.690> today<00:04:05.079> that

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
and I think I'm the leanest today that

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.000 
and I think I'm the leanest today that
I've<00:04:05.440> been

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
I've been

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.699 
I've been
and<00:04:06.340> maybe<00:04:07.150> 15<00:04:07.540> 20<00:04:07.840> years<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.290> know<00:04:08.409> I<00:04:08.650> know

and maybe 15 20 years you know I know

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.960 
and maybe 15 20 years you know I know
I'm<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:08.920> lightest<00:04:09.370> I've<00:04:09.489> done<00:04:09.640> in<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.819> long

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
I'm the lightest I've done in a long

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.190 
I'm the lightest I've done in a long
time<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:12.209> tell<00:04:13.209> me<00:04:13.360> about<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.659> decision
