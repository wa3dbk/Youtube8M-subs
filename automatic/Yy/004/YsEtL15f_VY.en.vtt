but<00:01:24.850> i<00:01:24.909> think<00:01:25.090> i<00:01:25.150> was<00:01:25.270> from<00:01:25.390> cedar<00:01:25.600> that's<00:01:25.869> why

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
but i think i was from cedar that's why

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.020 
but i think i was from cedar that's why
i<00:01:25.990> didn't<00:01:26.170> show<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.380> actual<00:01:26.470> bullet<00:01:26.920> but<00:01:27.130> that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
i didn't show the actual bullet but that

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.020 
i didn't show the actual bullet but that
makes<00:01:28.180> sense<00:01:28.390> now<00:01:28.509> look<00:01:29.229> at<00:01:29.320> this<00:01:29.759> who<00:01:30.759> was<00:01:30.909> the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
makes sense now look at this who was the
