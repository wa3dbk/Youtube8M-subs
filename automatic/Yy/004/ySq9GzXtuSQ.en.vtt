00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
glass finding does it it actually come

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.139 
glass finding does it it actually come
it<00:01:55.079> actually<00:01:55.229> attaches<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> lens<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it actually attaches the lens to the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.349 
it actually attaches the lens to the
display<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.710> uses<00:01:59.009> an<00:01:59.130> optically<00:01:59.609> clear<00:01:59.789> gel

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
display and uses an optically clear gel

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.120 
display and uses an optically clear gel
in<00:02:00.569> between<00:02:00.959> those<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.709> does<00:02:01.889> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
in between those and so what it does is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.260 
in between those and so what it does is
accomplished<00:02:02.490> two<00:02:02.789> or<00:02:02.909> three<00:02:03.090> different

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
accomplished two or three different

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
accomplished two or three different
things<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.530> prevents<00:02:04.920> any

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
things one is it prevents any

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.340 
things one is it prevents any
possibility<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> fogging<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.659> that's<00:02:07.109> one<00:02:07.319> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
possibility of fogging and that's one of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
possibility of fogging and that's one of
the<00:02:07.439> reasons<00:02:07.770> why<00:02:07.950> color<00:02:08.310> units<00:02:08.789> are<00:02:08.970> more

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the reasons why color units are more

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.359 
the reasons why color units are more
expensive<00:02:09.450> than<00:02:09.840> Monica

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
expensive than Monica

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.100 
expensive than Monica
unit<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:11.060> because<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.510> edition<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.049> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
unit is because this edition of the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.690 
unit is because this edition of the
glass<00:02:12.319> funding<00:02:12.769> technology<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.400> prevent

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
glass funding technology to prevent

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.149 
glass funding technology to prevent
fogging<00:02:14.030> also<00:02:14.900> you'll<00:02:15.170> notice<00:02:15.349> if<00:02:15.769> you<00:02:15.980> look

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
fogging also you'll notice if you look

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.039 
fogging also you'll notice if you look
at<00:02:16.280> various<00:02:16.730> angles<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.420> display<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:18.019> the

so<00:02:25.489> beautiful<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.299> more<00:02:26.480> Sun<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.870> put<00:02:27.079> on<00:02:27.230> a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
so beautiful the more Sun you put on a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.350 
so beautiful the more Sun you put on a
display<00:02:27.590> still<00:02:28.129> looks<00:02:28.430> very<00:02:28.730> beautiful<00:02:28.970> out

display still looks very beautiful out
of<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.569> sunlight<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.579> essence

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
of the sunlight so this is the essence

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.880 
of the sunlight so this is the essence
so<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.239> main<00:02:32.450> components<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.620> typical

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
so the main components of a typical

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.530 
so the main components of a typical
