00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.970
 Dez measures the Gero 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.970
 Grafe com acts 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.969
 Welcome to Vienna has died in the meeting point Heiner Geißler 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.909
 today it's about the distillery Johler 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.499
 It is located on the island of the same name 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.499
 between the Scottish mainland and the island 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.060
 she is relatively difficult to reach the ferries are flying a fly 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.489
 very rarely they are also very small 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.489
 And so the island of July sleeps the sleep of the just 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 a great paradise for hikers 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.090
 but the distillery 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.660
 is not really known anymore 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.210
 that changed a few years ago as the owners of the distillery 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
 changed and now there are a lot of interesting bottlings on the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.540
 Market also 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.910
 Jula bites tables percent 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.830
 he is one she wants Moritz the one mixtures 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.420
 from a distillery for which she still wanted to call 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.490
 from smoky and non-smoking 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.170
 that something special because normally they offer you 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.240
 and either for the first time 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.090
 to burn or take non-smoking malt 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.590
 and if you also take it for the first time then you can check the height of the smoke content 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.590
 the whiskey 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.290
 determine the malting 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 here went next and said it was very strong for the first time 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.020
 un-mandate not smoky Mals 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.990
 and you do not have these two processes 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.530
 Bags why 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 that comes out of the smoke guard that one imagines 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.090
 only with the problems 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.550
 to do that 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.770
 had a bit more volume percent with 43 volumes 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.189
 as the normal German or 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.270
 because 40 percent is bottled 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 that shows already the Mini a stronger something rolls 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.980
 the connoisseur satisfactory 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.110
 That's allowed to smoke this smoke 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.190
 very interesting 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.670
 it did not exist that way either 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.880
 imagine a strong figure as in the Gulf of Aden Ali 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.120
 this also loved Zarti above all else 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.779
 and bring the whiskey 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.779
 more interesting aromatic note 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.729
 who exactly takes care inaccurate 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.209
 the bottle looks does not understand age it does not matter 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.810
 that the smoky Mold Burgio he is not that old before Brandl man 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.479
 always only 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:29.069
 with UNEP baptized so the minutes do not smoke times until one then before 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.199
 few years 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.710
 Dougan also uses malt production line and now you mix 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.089
 the younger ones breathe vessels with something older 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.559
 Tie up no-smoking 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.159
 and there is this Siemens had interplay 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.239
 between 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.239
 have been different flavors 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.819
 Mueller was told a very interesting one 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.779
 you lie 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.760
 Marzipan notes after the crane line 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.779
 Now confirm with the marzipan 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.779
 the earth for me but not 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.769
 I feel my sweetness 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.769
 but the smoke from the smoke can already be covered 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.449
 to try that again » 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.169
 that has left 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.440
 to kick the force 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.179
 separate the volume 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:41.309
 Deißler 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.329
 Grow on Keitel 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.249
 slightly mitigated 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.439
 very weak sweet 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 more pronounced too 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.279
 automatically 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.099
 amazingly less smoke in the flavor than now in the taste 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.329
 so in taste 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.489
 is that even more constructive 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.559
 in the aroma 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.559
 not really 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.379
 and the finish pleasant 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.499
 comparatively sweet 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.640
 the tongue just barely hangs over it 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.779
 not hit cheerful 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.779
 which will feel cold which pulls back to make 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.210
 and then there is something like that 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.210
 here confess a bit 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.199
 "In any case, this will be Keith persist much longer 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.159
 than now 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.520
 which also above 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.920
 they will disappear soon afterwards 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.110
 because it is not so much it is a mix between Straubing and also 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.249
 Interesting 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.280
 and the reality and he actually in Jewel's character 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.389
 this strong starts this 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.370
 very intense mold 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.449
 he remains 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.020
 very interesting 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.259
 to that between belongs also to the cheap ones several times and because he 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.300
 no age bears 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.659
 nevertheless I believe that here 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.349
 with the non-smokers Moritz 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.349
 easily 10 and 12 year old Moers are there 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.839
 that shows already the sooner and it 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.979
 the pleasant Weichert on the one hand 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.490
 the fresh also in the captivating this tingling and this force 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.080
 that's probably three years old 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.479
 stick with smoky place 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.710
 a great murder 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.879
 it's worth it 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.879
 Access to us in the shop so far usually always available 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.409
 I am happy if you look over it
