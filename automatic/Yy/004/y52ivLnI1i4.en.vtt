00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hi everyone, today I wanted to make 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.139
 a tutorial using the naked palette 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.599
 among which I have recently received 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.969
 I had recently offered it as a prize 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.190
 a giveaway just on the day of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 Christmas Eve and in so many ho 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.970
 read that in the giveaway also under the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.320
 instagram photos you asked me to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.210
 make tutorials for you 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.670
 then I wanted to start by making one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.490
 and and this is what I have in this 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.340
 moment a very very simple tutorial 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.440
 reality because they are all news and colors 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 I wanted to stay on my usual kind of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.629
 makeup then the elegant one but 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.520
 however of effect but never too intense 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.540
 too bright because it's not in mine 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 tastes 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 at least sometimes yes but in general 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.660
 I prefer and prefer this 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.489
 kind of much more elegant tricks but 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.590
 simple also to achieve so that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.930
 you can do every morning so 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 now I leave you to the tutorial of this 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.410
 trick is then finished the tutorial I tell you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.870
 a little what my first are 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.580
 impressions on the naked and if there you are 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.409
 advice if I do not recommend it in short 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.689
 answers a bit to the main questions 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.299
 that you made me under the video is 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.010
 also on instagram 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.990
 I have already made the base of the face 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.820
 so I'm going to use the driver on 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 eyes I use this sample that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.890
 there was together with the palette and it is the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.590
 primer eden from the naked train from 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.930
 take loughner which is an antique pink 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.520
 very dark matt and I'm going to use it 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.409
 to intensify the crease of the eye 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.509
 blending it very well 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.369
 I like the effect of this color 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.280
 very much indeed it is the color I have 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.229
 used more so far I go to get 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.659
 this color has a shimmer pink 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.549
 very bright and I'm going to spread it up 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.259
 all the mobile eyelid in the part 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 where I hadn't written the previous one 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.240
 color is this here illuminates so much 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.000
 a pen brush I'm going to get 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.070
 this dark brown than a dark side e 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.049
 I'm just going to intensify the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.390
 eye crease also fading well 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.320
 treat with color in order to render more 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.270
 deep and more homogeneous and everything 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.670
 then I go to get the first color is 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.250
 this matt white and I'm going to roll it out 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 in the arch, then I look for it 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.090
 to illuminate the eye by extending it 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.209
 also at the beginning here near the duct 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.209
 lachrymal 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.150
 then I resume the antique pink loughner 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.829
 matt we also used above 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.590
 and I go to outline the lower rhyme 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.569
 external 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.819
 then I use this urban pencil 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.800
 decay which is the demolition is a purple 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.900
 brownish and I like very much combined with 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.450
 these colors and the stand as usual 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.280
 in the lower and inner lower rhyme 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.319
 in the upper rhythm but remaining 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.180
 so much towards the end of the eye then 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.690
 when to simply step up 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.820
 the corner 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.460
 I don't bend my eyelashes because that's it already 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.650
 incurvante mascara and I'm going to use it 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.290
 and spread it in abundant passes on 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.269
 all the eyelashes 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.609
 as a final touch I use this 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.310
 blaschke imac which has an antique rose 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.079
 very nice and a cold pink and spread it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.920
 with my husband realtek brush 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.530
 Knicks 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.480
 and to complete the whole Czech this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.660
 state of urban decay that I bought from 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.130
 little and has a very particular rose 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.060
 on the lips and very creamy e 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.060
 comfortable 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.200
 and this is the final result of mine 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.710
 first attempt of tutorials with her 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.090
 that three but others will follow as 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.180
 you have seen from the tutorial 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.190
 the colors are very very simple they are 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.440
 particularly writers as always 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.170
 like those of urban decay the quality is 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.050
 excellent some are dusty the only one 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.440
 what is that they are very very similar between 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.840
 in my opinion they are colors not so 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.480
 details in the sense the naked 1 and the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.670
 naked two had me more excited 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.400
 probably this trick as well 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.660
 all the colors of this palette 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.070
 a person could be better with 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.470
 light eyes then blue or green 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.480
 in fact I wanted to wear lenses 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.130
 to make you see the difference but then 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.770
 avoided because I know that many do not like it 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.330
 to see myself with lenses also in reality 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.310
 at least sometimes it is not a thing 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.740
 sorry to put on colored lenses 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.300
 change a little though in any case I have 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.970
 preferred to do so to let you see it 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.860
 on my eyes that I am not doing 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.350
 tending slightly much 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.420
 fancifully, however, it is said to be green 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.820
 August one of very similar colors between 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.920
 they are news tones but not like this 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.690
 details like first impressions 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.610
 in short, it does not give us so much 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.090
 I reserve the right to try it again to make you 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.670
 other make-up, however, for now I do n't have 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.830
 made how good a view they are 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.120
 very happy you preferred that 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.400
 they fit more like before 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.380
 since in the others they will be put 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.930
 a few few even in this have 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.940
 kept the same line and is a one 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.340
 what I'm sorry about then are those 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.870
 super super glittered I saw that 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.310
 only those in the other palettes 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.620
 which I use less because I found 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.900
 Christian too dusty both here and 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.630
 so we say my first 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.850
 short impression in few days 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.670
 times of use is not not the best 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.950
 if you were to recommend it sincerely 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.060
 I would not recommend buying this 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.370
 that is if you have no naked and you have 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.830
 light eyes you like news on 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.930
 shades of pink then yes for the rest of 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.580
 cases is a palette that I do not 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.710
 I would recommend to buy 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.050
 I much prefer the 2 though 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.200
 even there are fewer matt colors ie 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.800
 however, a black who can help you 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.020
 do 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.810
 luca intensify the fold and is a black 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.659
 mat that is the places that has a matt color 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.970
 which is great for doing both tricks 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.220
 in short, very simple enlightening feuds 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.590
 I always prefer the naked 2 anyway 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.840
 or possibly the one I will recommend 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.610
 life and that I and I will buy life compared to 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.190
 these among those who do not believe I would buy them 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.919
 never sincerely is the naked berdych 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.080
 because it's the usual naked I do 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.860
 see endless times in endless videos 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.590
 some favorites 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.440
 this one is really dug in everyone here 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.479
 the colors practically because at all 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.509
 colors but all colors on brown 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.460
 news and they are all very portable for 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:11.389
 make the intense clothes that make up together 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:14.240
 very light every day 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.550
 so this this one always has 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.190
 won again the others won 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.889
 however, this is why we say that not 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.150
 I was very satisfied with this 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.250
 naked claire 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.199
 I know that many of you already have it 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.669
 proven you received it for Christmas 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.430
 so I'd like to know in the comments 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.710
 below what colors you use 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.380
 mainly that tricks made 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.270
 so maybe I try to reproduce them too and 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.069
 I can fall in love a little more than 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.039
 this little stick that for now does not have me 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:44.930
 sincerely interned particularly 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.789
 among other things also in the video you saw 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.460
 used the samples they gave 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.529
 from between his show or just awkward 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.419
 facts so I do n't know if you agree with 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:55.009
 me but practically does a lot of 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:57.319
 product that you don't need 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.180
 there is a lot of product people 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.740
 could notice some mini fights a bit 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.960
 different because I found myself in 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.509
 the lipstick I wear is very bad 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.090
 it is a wonderful example of urban decay and it is 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.009
 of the new revolution collection 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.259
 I think they are called lippi vabbè 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.090
 I put the names back and I found it 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:16.370
 wonderful is very comfortable on 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.289
 I'm struggling for a few days now 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.210
 and I must say that I like it so much 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.069
 so this is my first tutorial e 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.500
 my first impressions when the naked 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:26.420
 obviously other tutorials will follow 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.460
 and other videos probably the 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.890
 in some favorite videos because it 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.350
 I will definitely use so much 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.540
 to try it as usual do me 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.460
 know everything in the comments below not 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.920
 forget to please 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.990
 video and not even subscribe to the channel 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.010
 I send you a big step and we do 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.700
 let's see to the next 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.700
 Hello
