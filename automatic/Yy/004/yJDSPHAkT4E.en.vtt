00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.970
 acute painful for many sellers like 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.539

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.489

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.640
 Different sellers, I constantly too

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.480
 causes let's say shaking hands 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.860
 March 03 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.030

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.190
 I will try to tell you the techniques understood 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 which all the time we developed 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.040
 baltic components 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.640
 having mastered this technique and applying in work with 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 potential customers you can 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.320
 and here those cold calls are perfect 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.140
 new customers 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.920
 speak boldly of eight 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.640
 lose nine meetings 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.870

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.070
 products we loved it and 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.700
 Komsomol girl likes the technique itself 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.470
 I think that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.880
 any seller deal phone calls not 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 should 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.810
 making it fun is interesting 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.200
 and then there will never be any routine 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.390
 won't be exactly fear of fear circus tent 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.320
 actions 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.479

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.810
 talking to you join 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200
 let's bring say the heads 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.280
 what already have cold tones 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 cold call our understanding is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.850
 the bell 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.640
 potential customer 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.110
 so only on the unfamiliar 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 potential customer 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.140
 who so far does not know anything about your 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.130
 product 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 proon and your company knows nothing about you 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.460
 the purpose of this call is always 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.490
 to sell them a certain product or 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.010
 sell them an appointment when 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.060
 by means of its charm the banner 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.319
 product skills 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.709
 good presentation you can influence 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.759
 decision making 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.819
 so cold call so 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.809
 he always why not called cold 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.809
 auto so the call is not prepared for customers 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.949
 without prior agreement when 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.739
 we aim to show products and faces 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.779
 says kitsch 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.849
 In general, we must say that before 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.019
 how to pick up the phone 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.219
 we would be fine 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.429
 answer a series of questions 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.259
 so dear listeners i suggest 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.179
 you formulate them for yourself and find the answer 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.989
 if you clearly know the answer to these questions 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.569
 you can safely 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.959
 elephant raise hand to call the most 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:47.820

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.629

 who do I want to call 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.729
 the other day there is no secret that 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.229
 sellers call very often 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.349

 companies are very fun and taken away 

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:28.900
 situation when 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.320
 but the fashion photographer doesn't call and people with 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.569

 sentences and never get to me 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.319
 new strategy sorry to take 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.460
 such decisions 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.410
 basically as you understand in all 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.050
 large structures there all would be business 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.449
 structure decision is made by man 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.430

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.240
 very important do not go anywhere on it 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.349
 this is the first when the country of this issue 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.969
 second side 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.680
 refers to the issue of visualization 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.370
 there is such an interesting first when we for 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.380
 obtaining the desired results of life 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.010
 should 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.979
 represent 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.469
 or them 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.659
 let's say so 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:14.519
 visually
