00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 the model is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.670
 each with a representative that the two are full and so lived against themselves 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.670
 because it is openly accepted if you think so 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.679
 The investors just want to go far 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.679
 but with the single and therefore the old price 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 so costs twice 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.119
 pm I think that the required number of providers for me then 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.119
 one is the system 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.650
 something together 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.650
 and further developed history 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.920
 RÃ¼themann 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.930
 why percent the duo also with one 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.970
 But also not 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.970
 somehow in Tampa 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.300
 in the quests was played through 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.660
 in a hotel in Berlin wanted outdated tasks 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.940
 let's wait, we were also agreed 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.410
 Sebald will make another four kids as well 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.410
 you really do not care how Renault Twingo off 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.700
 In the beginning, adobe products always thought the rest was given to Berlin 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.240
 that's a high one 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.180
 when displayed as well 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.119
 the euro will only be one possible explanation both 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.990
 including one after nine years 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.290
 for the year by maybe another cantons in October 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.420
 had been taken for a long time is still under investigation 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120
 so much to hear 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.940
 these lists are here 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.940
 Uhlig percent euros received 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 use 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.740
 we have 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.330
 to protest 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 VAT 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.090
 I have not decided yet 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 therefore may be 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.149
