00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 do you still remember the time in 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.740
 the one for a good smartphone deep in 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 had to grab the bag and if you can 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.620
 but then bought a cheaper 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.929
 then this had neither a front camera 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.030
 still a hd display and that rather 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.860
 even more luxury problems that the whole 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.900
 smartphone just has stuttered was a me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 much more conspicuous and annoying with that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.390
 nexus 4g high end to 300 euro and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.130
 lemon 50 euro a nexus 5 299 euro 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.519
 were for that, reading from and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.910
 then there was the still this module for 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.099
 169 euros 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.990
 this jihad motto now after one year 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 get a bigger brother if that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.290
 also the stuff to the bestseller has 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.290
 I want to clarify that in this review 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.950
 the design of the motogp is typical 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.900
 Motorola and you have it already 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.060
 times motors or ii also seen her 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.910
 also videos on a channel finds the 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.900
 biggest difference are the front 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.150
 stereo speakers around the same time 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.650
 rather to clarify horny they can 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.390
 not of one's performance 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.580
 htc vonn but are on everyone 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.190
 case better than the galaxy s 5 or 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.320
 lg 3 also because of your position 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.970
 straight in landscape sound the real 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.890
 neat and as soon as you get in from 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.690
 Motorola preset equalizer 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.270
 deactivated they sound even more 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.310
 better from inform aspects in general 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.440
 tell me the motogp second generation 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.810
 more to it than the predecessor because it 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.500
 less clunky and acts too 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.479
 processing technology no air for 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.220
 criticism makes the buttons are not 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.110
 as easy to push as motor but 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.090
 better than the motogp and in general 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.190
 spoken this phone is not cheap 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.270
 yet it looks like it's removed 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.860
 you can also this year the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.869
 back and there is also a lot 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.610
 other colorful colors around his cellphone too 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.900
 immunize that is not the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.460
 only reason why the back 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.710
 Can remove behind the cover 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.400
 hide among other things a micro 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 sd card slot and yes 22 micro sim 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.300
 cards slots who his mobile business 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.400
 and privately uses or any amount 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.050
 groupies will appreciate that 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 on the software side, the whole thing is whole 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.140
 nice solved you can choose over 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 which card you want to call 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.490
 or which just in mobile network 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.050
 Priority has stupidly missing lte 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.030
 this person gets me personally as 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.690
 Owner of an lt contract disturbs that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.370
 a little bit 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.350
 But I think most people will 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.300
 no problem the same applies to the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.580
 edges around the display i found them okay 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.989
 even though I would have preferred thinner ones 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.640
 but how to compete in that way 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.350
 This price range then looks up 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.300
 One finds that it is motogp comparatively 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.340
 very thin and despite the front 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.300
 speakers the entire front will be though 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.700
 actually something different 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.489
 dominates and that's the 5 inch tall 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.930
 27 p display the second lower ppr 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.450
 but the predecessor still has 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.950
 sufficiently sharp dissolves and only a little 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.660
 There is room for criticism 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.430
 Brightness is class the colors too 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.350
 only the black value and the viewing angle 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.330
 Next are the yellow ones from the egg 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.890
 nevertheless absolutely justifiable the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.450
 Performance is definitely not the thing 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.549
 best but surprisingly good 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.610
 Rogers rarely appear and 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.380
 The loading times are too 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.600
 new ticks longer than more expensive 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.580
 the whole thing keeps itself from speed 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.290
 a bit under the nexus 4 on 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.700
 to offer a small comparative value 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.950
 we owe it a great deal 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.410
 natural android 4.4 point 4 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.090
 which I liked very much on 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.010
 that's not the way it is 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.810
 because here you have no problems with 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.740
 minigames or something bigger 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.960
 videos 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.520
 especially because we have five inches here and 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.920
 it even has front speakers 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.050
 pretty cool on the motogp from 2014 too 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.870
 play secret tip for passionate 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.310
 Mobile gambler with a small purse as 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.020
 struck me is something that I 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.120
 not noticed and here at 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.040
 I'm talking about the heat development this 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.140
 really not worth talking and stuff like that 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.940
 I know after the lg 3 which partially 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.160
 has really appreciated 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.260
 the positive impression so far has set 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.670
 even with the battery life before with a 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.860
 Charge you can get four to five 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.780
 hours screen at time so roughly over 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.250
 the thumb targeted one to three days 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.870
 this is likely with android l 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.000
 even better, I was to be 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.280
 Overall, only a few enthusiastic 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.140
 words to the camera the cia from 5 to 8 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.180
 megapixel has been expanded and shoots 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.950
 quite passable pictures here is the lg 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.900
 Care of this phone sometimes positive 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.700
 though to get away though around worlds 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.950
 better but that does not mean that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.989
 motogp bad is the camera interface 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.549
 is very fast and supports 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.769
 he had been there on the other side 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.390
 only 27 preview which is a pity 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.920
 but whoever videos only on the phone 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.320
 Looks will not notice because you 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.299
 yes synonymous 9 720 p display has the pictures 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.250
 are ok for whatsapp and snapshot 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.170
 I would hang out on the wall to print 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.060
 but definitely not in spite of one 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.320
 true color reproduction 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.239
 unfortunately they are too easy for that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.220
 noisy and detail going on I guess 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.720
 unspectacular is the right word 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.550
 before I finish the video but now 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.510
 I want you still with my driving style 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.490
 to text 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.919
 the model is great it throws the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.140
 ask if you really 700 euros for 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.790
 must spend a cell phone or whether you 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.190
 do not complain just as well with this one 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.770
 The price is 199 euros 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.360
 definitely justified often comes 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.030
 it seems as if that part was far 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.860
 more 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.300
 clearly the grown size can for 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.770
 small hands be a disadvantage 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.200
 but I see it as a whole 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.840
 Successful upgrade to predecessor more 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.820
 2013 motor did not have to 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.350
 the second generation change it is 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.330
 because you really want this bigger one 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.530
 display and the front speakers i 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.540
 but would be much more on the third 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.700
 If I am a motor of the generation 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.080
 luckily, first generation has 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.760
 an update will be released soon 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.410
 android l and i also think the updates 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.480
 in the future are still very likely 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.920
 that there is an extra plus point and 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.870
 a luxury of not even flagship 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.040
 Cell phones are always granted so that was it 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.210
 from my review i hope it has you 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.680
 fallen and helped 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.910
 if it was so it was a like 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.140
 online commentary there and see you 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.260
 then next time it will do again 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.260
 Well
