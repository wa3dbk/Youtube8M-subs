dissolve<00:01:10.409> B<00:01:10.590> potion<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.100> analyzed<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:12.030> all

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
dissolve B potion is analyzed they all

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.929 
dissolve B potion is analyzed they all
contained<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.840> tetrodotoxin<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
contained two tetrodotoxin now this is a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
contained two tetrodotoxin now this is a
crazy<00:01:15.240> toxin<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.930> comes<00:01:16.080> from<00:01:16.200> pufferfish

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
crazy toxin that comes from pufferfish

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.399 
crazy toxin that comes from pufferfish
made<00:01:17.040> famous<00:01:17.340> by<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> Japanese<00:01:18.210> cuisine<00:01:18.600> fugu

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
made famous by the Japanese cuisine fugu

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.770 
made famous by the Japanese cuisine fugu
but<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.009> tetrodotoxin<00:01:20.549> does<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
but what tetrodotoxin does is that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
but what tetrodotoxin does is that
lowers<00:01:22.259> your<00:01:22.409> vital<00:01:22.830> functions<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> such<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
lowers your vital functions to such a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.130 
lowers your vital functions to such a
point<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.479> people<00:01:24.630> might<00:01:24.990> actually

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
point that people might actually

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.520 
point that people might actually
proclaim<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.890> dead<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> bury<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.869> right

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
proclaim you dead and bury you all right

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.200 
proclaim you dead and bury you all right
so<00:01:28.650> here's<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> theory<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:29.520> doctors<00:01:29.970> take

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
so here's the theory which doctors take

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
so here's the theory which doctors take
this<00:01:30.360> potion<00:01:30.600> they<00:01:30.900> blow<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.320> somebody<00:01:31.740> at

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
this potion they blow it on somebody at

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.920 
this potion they blow it on somebody at
the<00:01:31.920> contains<00:01:32.250> tetrodotoxin<00:01:32.729> people<00:01:33.720> think

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the contains tetrodotoxin people think

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
the contains tetrodotoxin people think
they're<00:01:34.110> dead<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.530> bury<00:01:34.799> him<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.280> dig

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
they're dead they bury him then they dig

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.010 
they're dead they bury him then they dig
them<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.729> again<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> turn<00:01:36.329> them<00:01:36.450> into<00:01:36.509> zombies

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
them up again and turn them into zombies

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
them up again and turn them into zombies
to<00:01:37.439> try<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> talk<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.130> those<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> trick

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
to try to talk some those just the trick

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.700 
to try to talk some those just the trick
to<00:01:39.360> make<00:01:39.479> people<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:39.930> you're<00:01:40.049> dead<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.560> they

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
to make people think you're dead so they

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
to make people think you're dead so they
write<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.100> off<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.400> bury<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.570> there's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
write you off and bury you but there's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
write you off and bury you but there's
another<00:01:43.259> drug<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.070> actually<00:01:44.369> turns<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
another drug that actually turns you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
into a zombie fight station that drug

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.609 
into a zombie fight station that drug
comes<00:01:49.829> from<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> plant<00:01:50.549> known<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.659> dr.<00:01:52.409> ax

and changing the amount of toxin even by
a<00:02:23.880> small<00:02:24.270> amount<00:02:24.420> would<00:02:24.959> kill<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:25.950> that's

a small amount would kill you and that's

one of the main critiques that Wade

one of the main critiques that Wade
Davis<00:02:27.330> got<00:02:27.690> because<00:02:28.170> witch<00:02:28.320> doctors<00:02:28.740> would

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
have to get the exact dosage right and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.930 
have to get the exact dosage right and
all<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.740> potions<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.340> had<00:02:32.459> analyzed

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
all the potions that he had analyzed

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.050 
all the potions that he had analyzed
didn't<00:02:33.570> really<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.200> exact<00:02:34.680> amount<00:02:35.060> but

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
didn't really have the exact amount but

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.550 
didn't really have the exact amount but
in<00:02:36.150> some<00:02:36.390> ways<00:02:36.570> it's<00:02:36.989> maybe<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:37.410> all<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
in some ways it's maybe not all that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.350 
in some ways it's maybe not all that
important<00:02:38.100> whether<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.459> potions<00:02:38.850> work<00:02:39.030> every

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
important whether the potions work every

important whether the potions work every
single<00:02:39.540> time<00:02:39.750> were<00:02:40.170> pretty<00:02:40.709> much<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.280> at<00:02:41.459> all

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
single time were pretty much not at all

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.940 
single time were pretty much not at all
because<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.390> Haiti<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.959> people<00:02:43.440> believe<00:02:43.739> that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
because in Haiti the people believe that

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.830 
because in Haiti the people believe that
the<00:02:44.100> zombies<00:02:44.489> are<00:02:44.610> very<00:02:44.910> real<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.600> there<00:02:45.720> you

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the zombies are very real so there you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.420 
the zombies are very real so there you
have<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.020> that's<00:02:46.500> where<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> modern<00:02:47.070> idea<00:02:47.370> of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
have it that's where a modern idea of

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.820 
have it that's where a modern idea of
zombies<00:02:47.880> actually<00:02:48.360> comes<00:02:48.600> from<00:02:48.690> unraveled<00:02:49.680> in

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
zombies actually comes from unraveled in

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
biological basis to it pretty cool huh

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.710 
biological basis to it pretty cool huh
do<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.550> what<00:02:59.730> we're<00:02:59.880> doing<00:02:59.910> watch<00:03:00.420> more
