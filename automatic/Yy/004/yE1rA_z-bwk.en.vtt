00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.000
 antioxidants you hear the word 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.269
 all the time but you may not know 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.250
 really what they are today I will explain 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.860
 what antioxidants are and how 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.620
 can benefit what 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.080
 the word is very much mentioned 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.300
 antioxidant but if I ask 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.210
 what is an antioxidant or what is it for? 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.920
 is likely to be thoughtful 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.380
 apart from saying that they are good for 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.120
 you so let me explain 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.110
 in simple terms what are the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.300
 antioxidants and how they work 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.640
 if I take an apple and leave it on the air 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.700
 free in a few minutes it will change to color 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.100
 coffee 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.370
 that's because when the shell protects 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.190
 the apple the food inside is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.470
 protected from oxygen in the air but 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.600
 when the fruit leaves the natural oxygen 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.540
 in the air it reacts with sugars 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 natural fruit a reaction 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.860
 called oxidation and you can see the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.350
 discoloration 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.120
 in simple terms the same process 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.790
 It also happens inside your body 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.950
 we are organisms that breathe oxygen 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.710
 and ellen spinning oxygen is part 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.870
 regular metabolism daily so 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.090
 that oxidation takes place within 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.460
 the traces of his body 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.500
 this is a natural process what happens 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.060
 when you breathe when you exercise 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.280
 when you eat food and others like that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.950
 as long as your body is surrounded 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.590
 of enough antioxidants the process 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.750
 it will keep well many of the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.549
 antioxidants that we consume live in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.320
 form of pigments offered by 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.720
 fruits and vegetables with their colors 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.700
 bright what is one of the reasons 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 for which I encourage the consumption of a large 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.770
 variety of colorful fruits and vegetables 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.810
 there are antioxidants in the shell of the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.240
 apple that protect the inside no 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.549
 change coffee and once you eat the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.530
 colorful peel those antioxidants 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.299
 they can work in the same way 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.299
 also protect your body 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.630
 Vitamin C is an antioxidant for 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.090
 that the apple does not change coffee if the bathroom 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.849
 the lemon juice 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.769
 the antioxidant of vitamins is protected 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.190
 the sugars in the apple against the 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.190
 oxidation 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.440
 this is another example the lycopene is a 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.620
 antioxidant pigment that gives color 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.989
 red to tomatoes and helps protect the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.330
 tomato from the heat of the sun what can 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.909
 cause antioxidant stress in the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.370
 plant when it consumes tomatoes on 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.040
 lycopene that protected the tomato acts 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.790
 as an antioxidant in your body helping 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.129
 to protect your cells 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.140
 you can not completely stop the 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.060
 oxidation in your body but you can 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.040
 accumulate the defense system of 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.800
 antioxidants in your body with 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.960
 enough plant foods 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.510
 when you fill your plate with a variety 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.150
 of fruits and vegetables do not receive only 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.160
 minerals and fiber vitamins but also 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.000
 receives a healthy dose of 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 antioxidants
