00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
think the competition within the squad

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.790 
think the competition within the squad
is<00:00:47.129> good<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.899> valuable<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.530> each

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
squad that we have I think this

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.810

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
it's really cool there was an awesome

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
it's really cool there was an awesome
atmosphere<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.570> Germany<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.259> hoping<00:01:40.799> it's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
atmosphere in Germany and hoping it's

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.789 
atmosphere in Germany and hoping it's
going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> similar<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.930> personally

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
going to be similar here I personally

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.319 
going to be similar here I personally
have<00:01:43.890> never<00:01:44.009> played<00:01:44.399> against<00:01:44.759> holland<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.299> i

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
have never played against holland so i

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.700 
have never played against holland so i
think<00:01:45.420> it'll<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.689> an<00:01:45.840> exciting<00:01:46.079> game<00:01:46.229> kind<00:01:46.649> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
think it'll be an exciting game kind of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.310 
think it'll be an exciting game kind of
a<00:01:46.799> team<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.509> team<00:01:48.659> hasn't<00:01:48.869> faced<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
a team that this team hasn't faced in a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
a team that this team hasn't faced in a
while<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.740> it'll<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.399> from<00:01:50.670> holland<00:01:51.149> i

know a couple the girls they play in
Sweden<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> they're<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
Sweden I think that they're going to be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080 
Sweden I think that they're going to be
a<00:01:54.630> quality<00:01:55.229> team<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:56.880> sure

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
a quality team and you know I'm sure

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.850 
a quality team and you know I'm sure
they're<00:01:57.270> excited<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> play<00:01:58.200> us<00:01:58.380> before

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
they're excited to get to play us before

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
they're excited to get to play us before
their<00:01:59.430> euro<00:01:59.759> tournament<00:02:00.329> they're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
their euro tournament they're going to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020 
their euro tournament they're going to
come<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:00.990> hard<00:02:01.680> they<00:02:02.130> always<00:02:02.280> everyone<00:02:02.850> does

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
when they're playing us and I think

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.380 
when they're playing us and I think
they're<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> quality<00:02:05.640> side<00:02:05.880> we

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
they're going to be a quality side we

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.419 
they're going to be a quality side we
expect<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> good<00:02:06.840> game<00:02:07.049> against<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.500> their

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
expect a good game against on their

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.749 
expect a good game against on their
quality<00:02:08.879> opponent<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
quality opponent and

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.119 
quality opponent and
I know<00:02:09.939> that<00:02:10.230> they're<00:02:11.230> going<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.379> have<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.860> good

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
I know that they're going to have a good

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.920 
I know that they're going to have a good
team<00:02:12.310> because<00:02:12.730> they're<00:02:13.000> preparing<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:13.510> euros

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
team because they're preparing for euros

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.490 
team because they're preparing for euros
and<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:15.909> it's<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.079> be<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> tough

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
and so I think it's going to be a tough

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.059 
and so I think it's going to be a tough
game<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.040> also<00:02:18.519> being<00:02:18.909> in<00:02:19.030> haunt<00:02:19.239> two

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.309 
game and also being in haunt two

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
different atmosphere but we're obviously

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.440
