00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.689
 hello how about that Ã¡lex in minecraft 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.810
 version 1.4 point 5 with a new review 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.840
 of the mod that is called as lights that we 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.899
 will allow to camouflage lights as well 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.899
 say it as you see I have here a group of 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.079
 blocks alright I'll do make it 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.399
 at night so you can see what happens and is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.890
 that produce light yes sir this way we 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.050
 will allow crafter these blocks that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.399
 they produce light each and to decorate van 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.100
 to go great for example we have this 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.809
 here the cool glowing good on white 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.150
 that at the moment only works with the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.700
 wood of this color for kraft e ar lo 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.190
 we need the wooden boards of this 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.229
 color and close tone so simple and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.320
 as you see when we put the block 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.799
 directly the area is not illuminated as 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.619
 if it were a torch 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.750
 the truth is that it is to decorate is 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.570
 one last this mod and brings several 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.050
 blocks and the one I like the most is the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 crystal 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.180
 It's like normal glass but as if 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.050
 we had a torch next to it is a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.060
 pass 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.730
 well let's see each one of these 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.790
 blocks are crafter with the block by 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:47.159
 example in the cob the are from kraft with 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.079
 copper stones and powder good close ton 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.079
 We have here the bricks brick 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.230
 Well with a block of bricks and close 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.440
 ton and all exactly the same we have 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.730
 all the colors of the wool plus these 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.820
 four blocks from here 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.300
 covers ton wooden boards brics and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.920
 crystal this moment only has this the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.480
 mod 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.390
 I suppose the mother will be working 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.180
 to add more blocks especially the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.000
 tables because I was a little disappointed that 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.270
 only work with this color but in 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.330
 end if you want to decorate your house 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.250
 with this you can do it and nothing else 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.800
