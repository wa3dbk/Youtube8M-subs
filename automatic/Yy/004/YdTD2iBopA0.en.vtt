00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.739
 Aizu Hey feel 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:17.210
 Because I say what kind of key I support to study in ぇ 

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:21.979
 Yeah I Did can know Do I think I a 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.639
 The last time I pulled it a little late, but I was using it as much as possible 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.870
 What 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.870
 Because I tried to play as much as possible similar phrases and phrases that did in earlier house 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:51.430
 Boo Boo ja code in the same way 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:55.120
 koa is going to work, I think it would be nice if you could change it a little 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:58.629
 This was the scale of the key change or rather it a pentatonic 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.379
 Remember me such going to remember firmly the position of the root in 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:07.509
 I will think whether it was found that the Tteyuu it is important that Tteyuu you check 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:07.910
 All or Toka such a thing is there is any sound in the periphery by pulling in the same shape I wish I was a its 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:11.990
 Together 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.770
 It is that even if I remember phrase Nee also play in other key from 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.040
 a 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:19.450
 Of this area 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.350
 I think that if you understand the bones or the reasoning, you will probably not feel much 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:26.460
 I more and more 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:26.460
 I think if you can enjoy pulling it, then I was able to meet you here today
