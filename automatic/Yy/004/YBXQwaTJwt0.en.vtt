videos that I had I kind of showed you

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.640 
videos that I had I kind of showed you
the<00:00:16.859> containers<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.550> had<00:00:17.869> well<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.260> finally

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the containers that I had well I finally

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.179 
the containers that I had well I finally
got<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.100> cocoa<00:00:21.000> pod<00:00:21.240> culture<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.930> today<00:00:22.350> so

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
got the cocoa pod culture in today so

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830 
got the cocoa pod culture in today so
I'm<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.820> walk<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.150> through<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.539> a

I'm just going to walk you through on a
quick<00:00:25.170> brief<00:00:25.529> little<00:00:26.420> startup<00:00:27.650> as<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.769> can

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
quick brief little startup as you can

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.659 
quick brief little startup as you can
see<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.369> went<00:00:29.699> ahead<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.179> used<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:31.460> little<00:00:32.460> less

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
see I went ahead and used a little less

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.510 
see I went ahead and used a little less
than<00:00:32.850> half<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.739> one<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> my<00:00:34.890> containers<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
than half of one of my containers of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.290 
than half of one of my containers of
phytoplankton<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.540> ready<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:38.210> put<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
phytoplankton that was ready and put it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.110 
phytoplankton that was ready and put it
into<00:00:39.690> my<00:00:40.410> containers<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.579> can

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
into my containers that I got you can

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840 
into my containers that I got you can
really<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:42.920> whatever<00:00:43.920> containers<00:00:44.579> are

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
really use whatever containers are

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.680 
really use whatever containers are
available<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.879> would<00:00:47.879> say<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> cheaper

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
available to you I would say the cheaper

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.660 
available to you I would say the cheaper
the<00:00:48.840> better<00:00:49.219> because<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.309> always<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the better because you always want to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
the better because you always want to
keep<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.270> cost<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.530> stuff

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
keep your cost down on all this stuff

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.209 
keep your cost down on all this stuff
but<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:54.239> only<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:55.170> were<00:00:55.469> they

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
but these only I think these were they

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.860 
but these only I think these were they
worked<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:58.010> 995<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> piece<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.730> Walmart<00:01:00.210> so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
worked like 995 a piece at Walmart so

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.630 
worked like 995 a piece at Walmart so
that's<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.739> me<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.010> alright

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that's to me that's alright

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
that's to me that's alright
and<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.719> filled<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:05.000> with<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.950> almost<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and I filled it up with the almost a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.480 
and I filled it up with the almost a
half<00:01:08.540> of<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.720> gallon<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.260> phytoplankton<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
half of a gallon of phytoplankton and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
half of a gallon of phytoplankton and
what<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> did<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> also<00:01:12.780> mixed<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.380> some

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
what I did was I also mixed up some

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.390 
what I did was I also mixed up some
fresh<00:01:14.369> saltwater<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:17.070> my<00:01:17.159> specific

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
fresh saltwater and put my specific

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.580 
fresh saltwater and put my specific
gravity<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.380> one<00:01:19.380> point<00:01:19.619> zero<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.189> three<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.590> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
gravity at one point zero to three and I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.429 
gravity at one point zero to three and I
know<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.880> lower<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.990> I've

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
know you can go lower you know I've

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
know you can go lower you know I've
heard<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:26.040> different<00:01:26.430> types<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.759> ranges<00:01:27.180> but

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
heard all different types of ranges but

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.749 
heard all different types of ranges but
my<00:01:28.439> tank<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:30.320> run<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.799> point<00:01:31.979> o2<00:01:32.159> five<00:01:32.549> is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
my tank is run at one point o2 five is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.990 
my tank is run at one point o2 five is
the<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> full<00:01:33.689> reef<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> would<00:01:35.759> say<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the it's a full reef so I would say I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.330 
the it's a full reef so I would say I
want<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.299> keep<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.619> close<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
want to keep it you know as close to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
want to keep it you know as close to
what<00:01:38.579> my<00:01:38.700> actual<00:01:39.119> tank<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.780> possible<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
what my actual tank is as possible to

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.280 
what my actual tank is as possible to
not<00:01:40.560> shock<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> put<00:01:42.540> them<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:45.290> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
not shock them when I put them in and I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.810 
not shock them when I put them in and I
also<00:01:46.560> only<00:01:47.369> fill<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> container<00:01:48.560> halfway

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
also only fill up the container halfway

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.289 
also only fill up the container halfway
so<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.740> cup<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.340> culture<00:01:53.700> grows<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
so that as a cup as the culture grows I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.649 
so that as a cup as the culture grows I
can<00:01:54.509> add<00:01:55.490> more<00:01:56.490> phytoplankton<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
can add more phytoplankton to that and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
can add more phytoplankton to that and
give<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.680> culture<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.250> room<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.490> grow

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
give the the culture more room to grow

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.200 
give the the culture more room to grow
now<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> culture<00:02:01.229> grows<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.549> couple<00:02:03.030> pods

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
now as the culture grows the couple pods

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.730 
now as the culture grows the couple pods
are<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> eating<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
are going to be eating up that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.210 
are going to be eating up that
phytoplankton<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.670> thus<00:02:06.479> creating<00:02:07.140> waste<00:02:07.860> in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
phytoplankton and thus creating waste in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.880 
phytoplankton and thus creating waste in
that<00:02:08.520> can

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
that can

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.220 
that can
which<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.550> gonna<00:02:10.270> build<00:02:10.509> up<00:02:10.630> your<00:02:10.780> ammonia's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
which is gonna build up your ammonia's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.380 
which is gonna build up your ammonia's
and<00:02:11.470> your<00:02:11.620> all<00:02:12.010> your<00:02:12.220> bad<00:02:12.700> things<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.300> you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
and your all your bad things that you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.960 
and your all your bad things that you
don't<00:02:13.630> want<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:13.930> your<00:02:13.959> water<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.850> why

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
don't want in your water so this is why

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.610 
don't want in your water so this is why
I<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.360> got<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> containers<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.440> this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
I have I got the containers with this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I have I got the containers with this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
valve so that I can put my sieves to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.840 
valve so that I can put my sieves to
strain<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.569> copepods<00:02:23.050> out<00:02:23.319> down<00:02:23.950> below<00:02:24.190> here

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850

you get it you know use your judgment on

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.710 
you get it you know use your judgment on
how<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.750> culture<00:02:47.260> looks<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:49.360> is<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
how the the culture looks this is the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.090 
how the the culture looks this is the
culture<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.350> copepods<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.820> get<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.470> don't

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
culture of copepods that I get you don't

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.229 
culture of copepods that I get you don't
you<00:02:54.280> probably<00:02:54.580> won't<00:02:54.700> be<00:02:54.820> able<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.030> see

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
you probably won't be able to see

anything in this video but there's quite
a<00:03:00.459> few<00:03:00.550> in<00:03:00.820> there<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.150> culture<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.510> pretty

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
a few in there that culture is pretty

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.949 
a few in there that culture is pretty
lively<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:03.100> I'm<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:03.970> wait<00:03:04.150> I'm<00:03:04.780> going<00:03:04.870> to

put that container in did this here and

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.570 
put that container in did this here and
let<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.350> copepods<00:03:09.600> acclimate<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
let the copepods acclimate to the to the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.850 
let the copepods acclimate to the to the
temperature<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.209> water<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:14.530> will<00:03:14.590> be

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
temperature of that water and I will be

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.350 
temperature of that water and I will be
picking<00:03:15.160> up<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.340> light<00:03:15.519> later<00:03:15.760> I'll<00:03:16.090> finish

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
picking up a light later I'll finish

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.210 
picking up a light later I'll finish
this<00:03:16.600> video<00:03:16.780> off<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.380> show<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.590> I'm<00:03:18.040> just

this video off and show you I'm just
going<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.430> do<00:03:18.549> some<00:03:18.730> indirect<00:03:19.150> lighting<00:03:19.390> but

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
going to do some indirect lighting but

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.789 
going to do some indirect lighting but
you<00:03:20.470> do<00:03:20.680> need<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:22.329> an<00:03:22.480> airstone<00:03:23.019> in<00:03:23.260> these

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
you do need to have an airstone in these

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.039 
you do need to have an airstone in these
in<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.610> phytoplankton<00:03:24.880> culture<00:03:25.570> now<00:03:25.840> what<00:03:26.019> I

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
in a phytoplankton culture now what I

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.100 
in a phytoplankton culture now what I
did<00:03:26.350> was<00:03:26.700> as<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.820> can<00:03:27.970> see<00:03:28.120> these<00:03:28.239> two<00:03:28.450> holes<00:03:28.720> I

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
did was as you can see these two holes I

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.770 
did was as you can see these two holes I
drilled<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.739> quarter<00:03:30.070> inch<00:03:30.220> hole<00:03:30.480> for<00:03:31.480> my<00:03:31.570> air

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
drilled a quarter inch hole for my air

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.500 
drilled a quarter inch hole for my air
line<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.190> breather<00:03:33.489> hole<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:34.269> have

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
line and then a breather hole you have

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.880 
line and then a breather hole you have
to<00:03:34.690> have<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> breather<00:03:35.200> all<00:03:35.410> otherwise<00:03:35.709> you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
to have a breather all otherwise you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.949 
to have a breather all otherwise you
could<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.040> some<00:03:36.459> problems<00:03:36.489> with<00:03:37.150> these

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
could have some problems with these

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.750 
could have some problems with these
containers<00:03:39.360> no<00:03:40.360> you'll<00:03:40.959> it'll<00:03:41.590> fill<00:03:42.489> up<00:03:42.519> with

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
containers no you'll it'll fill up with

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.039 
containers no you'll it'll fill up with
the<00:03:42.850> air<00:03:43.000> because<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.480> air<00:03:43.540> won't<00:03:43.690> have<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> way

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
the air because the air won't have a way

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.479 
the air because the air won't have a way
to<00:03:44.110> escape<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:44.950> always<00:03:45.130> want<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.459> a

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
to escape so you always want to have a

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.479 
to escape so you always want to have a
breather<00:03:45.820> just<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.180> relieve<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.480> pressure

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
breather just to relieve that pressure

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:55.610 
breather just to relieve that pressure
what<00:03:48.489> I'm<00:03:48.579> going<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.790> use<00:03:52.530> for<00:03:53.530> my<00:03:53.860> air<00:03:54.190> line<00:03:54.220> is

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
what I'm going to use for my air line is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.009 
what I'm going to use for my air line is
identical<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:58.150> hard<00:03:58.420> piece<00:03:58.780> of

this only thing that I would watch out

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.720 
this only thing that I would watch out
for<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.020> how<00:05:12.169> much<00:05:12.350> heat<00:05:12.680> it's<00:05:13.250> going<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.550> put

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
for is how much heat it's going to put

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.820 
for is how much heat it's going to put
off<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.510> how<00:05:14.630> close<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.080> put<00:05:15.260> it<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.500> your

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
off and how close you put it to your

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.720 
off and how close you put it to your
culture<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:17.810> went<00:05:18.200> ahead<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.440> did<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.520> line

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
culture I went ahead and did the line

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.110 
culture I went ahead and did the line
like<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.300> had<00:05:20.450> talked<00:05:20.690> about<00:05:20.810> and<00:05:21.790> took<00:05:22.790> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
like I had talked about and took the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.450 
like I had talked about and took the
three<00:05:23.360> sixteenths<00:05:23.990> hard-line<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.979> slipped

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
three sixteenths hard-line and slipped

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.030 
three sixteenths hard-line and slipped
the<00:05:25.790> quarter<00:05:26.180> inch<00:05:26.360> over<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.140> so<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.740> don't<00:05:27.860> have

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
the quarter inch over it so I don't have

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.540 
the quarter inch over it so I don't have
to<00:05:28.130> worry<00:05:28.310> about<00:05:28.430> that<00:05:28.750> air<00:05:29.750> leakage<00:05:30.229> again

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
to worry about that air leakage again

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.900 
to worry about that air leakage again
and<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:32.210> went<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.600> just<00:05:33.260> routed<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.740> into<00:05:34.190> my

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
and I went and just routed it into my

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.350 
and I went and just routed it into my
gang<00:05:35.180> Bab<00:05:35.450> with<00:05:35.900> all<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.169> other<00:05:36.290> wines<00:05:36.530> and

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
gang Bab with all the other wines and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.810 
gang Bab with all the other wines and
with<00:05:38.360> a<00:05:38.390> copepod<00:05:38.750> culture<00:05:39.350> you<00:05:39.919> can<00:05:40.100> see<00:05:40.370> you

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
with a copepod culture you can see you

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.020 
with a copepod culture you can see you
really<00:05:41.000> don't<00:05:41.360> want<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:42.160> blow<00:05:43.160> them<00:05:43.430> all<00:05:43.700> over

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
really don't want to blow them all over

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.400 
really don't want to blow them all over
the<00:05:44.120> place<00:05:44.150> you<00:05:44.570> know<00:05:44.690> with<00:05:44.870> too<00:05:44.990> many<00:05:45.169> bubbles

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
the place you know with too many bubbles

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.640 
the place you know with too many bubbles
so<00:05:45.800> that's<00:05:46.640> why<00:05:46.820> I<00:05:46.850> let<00:05:47.540> you<00:05:47.810> know<00:05:48.140> turn<00:05:48.410> down

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
so that's why I let you know turn down

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.650 
so that's why I let you know turn down
the<00:05:48.830> valve<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.310> try<00:05:49.520> to<00:05:49.580> get<00:05:49.880> this<00:05:50.150> is<00:05:50.360> slow

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
the valve and try to get this is slow

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.190 
the valve and try to get this is slow
enough<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:51.290> move<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.950> water<00:05:52.160> around<00:05:52.460> and

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
enough to move the water around and

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.690 
enough to move the water around and
recycle<00:05:54.200> it<00:05:54.260> put<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.620> oxygen<00:05:55.040> back<00:05:55.220> in<00:05:55.460> but

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
recycle it put the oxygen back in but

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.820 
recycle it put the oxygen back in but
not<00:05:56.330> so<00:05:56.510> much<00:05:56.660> where<00:05:56.900> it's<00:05:57.050> really<00:05:57.530> stirring

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
not so much where it's really stirring

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.560 
not so much where it's really stirring
everything<00:05:58.340> up<00:05:58.520> so<00:05:59.120> you<00:05:59.180> don't<00:05:59.330> want<00:05:59.450> to

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
everything up so you don't want to

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.340 
everything up so you don't want to
disrupt<00:05:59.930> them<00:06:00.080> that<00:06:00.260> bad<00:06:00.790> I<00:06:01.790> know<00:06:02.720> there's<00:06:03.290> a
