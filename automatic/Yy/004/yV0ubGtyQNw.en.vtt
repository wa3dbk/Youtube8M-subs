and stamp that on to my old owl of
cardstock<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.530> stamping<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
cardstock and I'm kind of stamping that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
cardstock and I'm kind of stamping that
to<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.030> left<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.750> bit<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to the left a little bit because I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.510 
to the left a little bit because I
didn't<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.860> right<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> center

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
didn't want it to be right in the center

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.399 
didn't want it to be right in the center
and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.479> I'll<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:57.960> white<00:01:58.140> embossing

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and then I'll use some white embossing

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.440 
and then I'll use some white embossing
powder<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.979> sprinkle<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.700> over<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
powder and sprinkle that on over to the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.560 
powder and sprinkle that on over to the
sentiment<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.549> embossing<00:02:02.549> powder<00:02:02.729> sticks<00:02:03.210> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
sentiment the embossing powder sticks to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.039 
sentiment the embossing powder sticks to
the<00:02:04.549> Versamark<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:06.899> do

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the Versamark and then what you would do

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.740 
the Versamark and then what you would do
is<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.350> take<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.250> heat<00:02:08.580> tool<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.849> set<00:02:09.509> that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
is just take your heat tool and set that

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.150 
is just take your heat tool and set that
and<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.739> melt<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> embossing<00:02:11.580> powder

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and that will melt the embossing powder

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.490 
and that will melt the embossing powder
so<00:02:14.160> once<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:15.030> embossing<00:02:15.900> pot<00:02:16.080> powder

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so once I have my embossing pot powder

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.070 
so once I have my embossing pot powder
all<00:02:16.769> heated<00:02:17.459> up<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.790> melted<00:02:18.150> I'm<00:02:18.390> gonna<00:02:18.930> go

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
all heated up and melted I'm gonna go

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.220 
all heated up and melted I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.530> take<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.040> piece<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:21.200> crumb<00:02:22.200> cake

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
ahead and take that piece of crumb cake

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.259

lot of adhesive with the embossed paper

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.300 
lot of adhesive with the embossed paper
it<00:02:32.959> doesn't<00:02:33.959> hold<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.410> well<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
it doesn't hold as well so I like to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.430

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
little off on that designer series piece

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.849 
little off on that designer series piece
it's<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.120> little<00:04:18.359> bit<00:04:18.479> shorter<00:04:18.930> than<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.320> crumb

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
it's a little bit shorter than the crumb

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.460 
it's a little bit shorter than the crumb
cake<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:21.299> once<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:21.959> adhered<00:04:22.409> down

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
cake so once I have that adhered down

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.770 
cake so once I have that adhered down
I'm<00:04:23.220> going<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.669> go<00:04:23.820> ahead<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.120> take<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.330> old

and tie a bow which by the way took me

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.460
