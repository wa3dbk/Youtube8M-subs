00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.589
 welcome to the alcatel stand that 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.589
 I have gone to know his news 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 and I found the alcatel turn 2 a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.610
 device prepared for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.640
 creativity with 6 inches of screen and 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.740
 an aluminum design that is very cool 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.599
 the processor is a core act to which it 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.090
 accompany 2 gigabytes of ram 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.460
 we also have this integrated stylus 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
 directly on the bottom with the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.510
 which we can control the screen but 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.770
 I want to show you an application that 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.810
 have taught how they like it a lot 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.270
 example this from us where I can 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.820
 paint so I'm going to paint them a 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.640
 bit 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.320
 we are going to give him add page and then I go 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.120
 to do this time will be to write a 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.800
 word how it can be to play that if not 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.650
 all write in English 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.630
 play 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.810
 I recognized him he puts it in a text 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.730
 normal simple as the arial letter like 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.930
 we all know the truth that is very 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.550
 cool and sure that this I 'm going to 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.050
 teach for the great majority that you see 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.760
 my videos then it's fast more than it's like 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.990
 a calculator but much more intuitive 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.350
 then I'm going to put three plus one what 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.610
 recognizes and removes the sum that I 'm going 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.830
 to erase let's put 7 x 8 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.690
 and I also get the multiplication is 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.360
 very smart and then we will put by 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.040
 example 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.040
 the square root of 2 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.659
 and he takes it from me is he is going to do everything 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.210
 very clever this many will say i want 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.609
 one for which is not bad not 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.469
 the truth is that it's cool a lot 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.359
 I'll show you I will speak of 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.060
 camera this time because I had it 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.310
 taught and it's very cool and this is the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.530
 camera let's focus the alcatel that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.020
 As you can see it is very simple from here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.969
 we can access all modes and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.399
 we even have a QR code scanner 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.259
 something that cameras do not usually integrate 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.780
 and that we have to spend space in 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.910
 our device to include it we go 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.099
 to enter for example in a new mode 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.380
 who taught us that it is white and go 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.220
 I want that allows me is to make a 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.220
 small catch 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:26.860
 in a 40 megapixel photo 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.860
 so I'm doing the pics 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.989
 and then it's supposed that if he knew how to do it 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.540
 the person who taught me to do yes 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.420
 I knew how I do not know how to do it 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.580
 it's going to come out so I'm going to follow you 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.849
 we teach ways and for example I want that 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.849
 see the filter some filters 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.519
 like this I'm going to take a picture 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.620
 what will it look like I wrote it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.620
 it's worth looking 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.950
 even as you see I am going to teach you here 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.560
 I think that skeleton 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.689
 alcatel one touch I want to have a 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.890
 mobile as well because the drawings of the 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.230
 plastic drawings are going to be made 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.459
 much easier 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.530
 good more little things more little things than you 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.030
 I want to teach mostly a manual mode 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.950
 which is something we like a lot of 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.900
 the cameras there are many that do not 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.030
 include but in this case the boat tel 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.790
 yes so we 're going to give it to manual mode 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.100
 and what we do is that we can change 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.180
 for example the speed 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.850
 simply turning as if it were a 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.670
 reflex camera as well we can also 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.900
 spin we can control it a little myself 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.240
 I'm getting a little crazy because 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.190
 I 've never done anything like this with a 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.180
 phone so I'm becoming a 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.480
 little crazy and I do not know what I 'm 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.090
 playing but hear if you know how to do it 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.430
 well but what happens many will say this to 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.570
 I do not get into a pocket this is 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.480
 impossible for me from me a 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.640
 pocket and what we have is some 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.980
 super interesting accessories that I have 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.650
 around here for example I'm going to teach you 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.310
 this reader this is a small reader 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.650
 that apart from being able to read certain things 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.810
 that we have directly integrated as 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.000
 for example we can be reading a 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.250
 ebook allows us to receive calls 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.170
 that is, I can have the phone in the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.330
 backpack behind and this in your pocket 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.910
 here I will be able to see all the calls 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.950
 that I had on my device according to 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.480
 more simply receiving here not the 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.180
 I can answer that yes what I can 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.580
 to do is answer them directly from 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.290
 my device and take care of them and this what 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.249
 what is going to be going to be tell me how 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.619
 you see, he called me richard so 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.289
 I do not want to talk to him right now, expensive 

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:44.879
 then already if that will talk to him besides 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.279
 here we can pass photographs that 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.079
 let's have in our device 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:51.119
 directly here and of course we can 

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:53.069
 read and readers have also spoken to us 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:55.169
 that we can put a qr code for 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:58.319
 read it like for example the cards of 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.569
 boarding and they have even told us that 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.009
 It has six days of autonomy so it does not 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.049
 we have to worry about loading the 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.289
 device and in case you want 

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:09.959
 something a little more useful and that you 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.489
 allows you to answer calls this is another 

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:13.799
 the accessories that can be connected 

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:16.729
 also this what you have is a 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:19.769
 touch screen that will allow us 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.409
 enter both the phone to attend 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:23.909
 calls messages enter our 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.759
 contacts or even see the 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:29.489
 notifications a remote control for the 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.989
 music for videos and of course 

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:34.319
 for the camera we can leave the camera 

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:37.019
 on a table and hit the little button 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:39.299
 so that it is recorded good so that it records 

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:41.969
 who takes the picture and here we have in 

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:45.030
 tools as a calculator we have 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:48.090
 even a calendar a fayt option 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.950
 and device and of course a 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.440
 recorder if we want to record sound 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.810
 so what did you like the new 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.870
 alcatel device because if it has 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.520
 I really liked leaving it in the comments 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.800
 because we will try to prove it to the return 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.800
 See you at the next booth
