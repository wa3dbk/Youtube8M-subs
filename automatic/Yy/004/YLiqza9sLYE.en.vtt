grass<00:03:20.840> didn't<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.350> any<00:03:21.500> old<00:03:21.650> flavors<00:03:22.100> that

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
grass didn't have any old flavors that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.210 
grass didn't have any old flavors that
produces<00:03:23.570> all<00:03:24.230> flavors<00:03:24.620> in<00:03:24.740> your<00:03:24.860> beef<00:03:25.010> that

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
produces all flavors in your beef that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.990 
produces all flavors in your beef that
sort<00:03:25.460> of<00:03:25.550> thing<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:27.280> look<00:03:28.280> at<00:03:28.430> all<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.760> steam

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
sort of thing so look at all that steam

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.430 
sort of thing so look at all that steam
is<00:03:29.180> not<00:03:29.390> even<00:03:29.570> go<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.690> near<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.140> bottom<00:03:30.380> of

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
is not even go to near to the bottom of

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.650 
is not even go to near to the bottom of
that<00:03:30.500> pick<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:30.830> out<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:32.180> thing<00:03:32.360> gets

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
that pick it out this thing gets

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.490 
that pick it out this thing gets
straddled<00:03:33.050> hot

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
straddled hot

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.970 
straddled hot
so<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.790> Nico<00:03:38.420> he<00:03:38.720> rightly<00:03:39.200> named<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.710> quick

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
so this Nico he rightly named this quick

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.980 
so this Nico he rightly named this quick
and<00:03:40.160> big<00:03:40.340> because<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.210> is<00:03:41.360> quick<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.870> is

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
and big because it is quick and it is

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.770 
and big because it is quick and it is
big<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.890> what<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:43.550> like<00:03:43.910> about<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.510> has<00:03:44.750> a

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
big and what I like about it it has a

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.710 
big and what I like about it it has a
where<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.370> Red<00:03:46.700> River<00:03:46.850> crabgrass<00:03:47.180> has

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
where the Red River crabgrass has

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.520 
where the Red River crabgrass has
typically<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.320> crabgrass<00:03:50.530> characteristics

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
typically the crabgrass characteristics

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.440 
typically the crabgrass characteristics
of<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:51.920> crow<00:03:52.130> foot<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.610> three<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:52.970> three<00:03:53.210> seed

of a crow foot of three to three seed

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.810 
of a crow foot of three to three seed
heads<00:03:53.720> we<00:03:54.440> can<00:03:54.560> get<00:03:54.710> a<00:03:54.740> dozen<00:03:55.010> seed<00:03:55.400> heads<00:03:55.640> on

heads we can get a dozen seed heads on

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.930 
heads we can get a dozen seed heads on
these<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.360> lot<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.740> lot<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.220> energy<00:03:58.820> and

is<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:37.070> crabgrass<00:04:37.310> we've<00:04:37.940> moved<00:04:38.240> now<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.510> the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
is the crabgrass we've moved now to the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.200 
is the crabgrass we've moved now to the
second<00:04:39.200> generation<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.460> crabgrass<00:04:40.700> we've

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
second generation of crabgrass we've

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.120 
second generation of crabgrass we've
moved<00:04:41.450> from<00:04:41.540> Red<00:04:42.140> River<00:04:42.320> too<00:04:42.590> quick<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:42.919> big

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
moved from Red River too quick and big

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.790 
moved from Red River too quick and big
and<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:44.360> all<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.720> our<00:04:44.930> pastures<00:04:45.230> now<00:04:45.590> have

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
and so all of our pastures now have

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.029 
and so all of our pastures now have
those<00:04:45.950> combinations

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
those combinations

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.730 
those combinations
and<00:04:47.129> this<00:04:48.029> is<00:04:48.150> our<00:04:48.300> finishing<00:04:48.809> grasses<00:04:49.229> now<00:04:49.409> we

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
and this is our finishing grasses now we

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.079 
and this is our finishing grasses now we
make<00:04:49.949> sure<00:04:50.099> all<00:04:50.159> the<00:04:50.490> Catlett's<00:04:50.849> going<00:04:51.029> to

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:51.089 
make sure all the Catlett's going to

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:52.879 
make sure all the Catlett's going to
slaughter<00:04:51.300> end<00:04:51.839> up<00:04:52.169> on<00:04:52.319> these<00:04:52.469> on<00:04:52.740> these

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
slaughter end up on these on these

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.079 
slaughter end up on these on these
grasses<00:04:53.430> we've<00:04:54.059> got<00:04:54.240> other<00:04:54.389> other<00:04:54.749> farms<00:04:55.289> I

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:56.089 
grasses we've got other other farms I

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.480 
grasses we've got other other farms I
think<00:04:57.089> 14<00:04:57.599> other<00:04:57.779> farm<00:04:58.050> police<00:04:58.439> most<00:04:59.219> of<00:04:59.369> those

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
think 14 other farm police most of those

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.209 
think 14 other farm police most of those
are<00:04:59.699> fescue<00:05:00.360> land<00:05:00.659> we<00:05:01.409> can<00:05:01.499> grow<00:05:01.649> we<00:05:02.009> can<00:05:02.039> grow

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
are fescue land we can grow we can grow

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.619 
are fescue land we can grow we can grow
these<00:05:02.369> cattle<00:05:02.759> out<00:05:02.849> but<00:05:03.119> we're<00:05:03.240> gonna<00:05:03.419> finish

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.629 
these cattle out but we're gonna finish
them<00:05:03.809> here<00:05:04.050> on<00:05:04.319> that<00:05:04.619> and<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:07.460> it's<00:05:08.460> been<00:05:08.610> a

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639
