00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.269
 begins to fasano changed find above all what are the strengths 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.349
 and weaknesses that he has encountered several all I have seen co-directors. 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.439
 technician for toast surveyors 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.259
 eh arrived beautiful 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.220
 baffled an organization is good administration to you too 

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.649
 therefore a logic of services based on state a lot on 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.890
 openness to the territory 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.680
 and let's say that two years of leave took place synergies between institutions 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.000
 air institutions 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.860
 and in order to be able to implement hey baby, we say a formative system not 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.930
 alternative martino vaccine in the sense that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.080
 el where there is interaction between the institutions. university school centers 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.240
 of research 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.720
 so many say dd al belluzzi girls have already implemented experiences therefore 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.770
 alternation school-work sumulation company 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.920
 we are a technical site clearly harp we say entrusted pop-up 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.120
 and actions in this direction 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.170
 and this is the goal I propose to myself 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.460
 to implement this in these men are a single site site where however 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.680
 includes the technician and professional 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.860
 hell trying to activate a different system that is not the one anchored to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.800
 ordinary reaction but the interactive relationships with the territory through 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.250
 season alternation simulations 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.620
 what kind of architectural projects 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.940
 pe 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.880
 maps is not easy 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 define your own style 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.960
 and because in any case the evaluation for an evaluation is in my opinion a must 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.580
 come from the outside what the productivity and results 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.920
 then 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 I don't feel like defining myself because in any case I meet my model at 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 active dynamic model 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.810
 so oo keep learning one day they have a definite style 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.499
 therefore it is modified in relation to the times related to the situations 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:14.319
 therefore I am collaborative cooperative thesis for which I place myself beside or not a 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.780
 those who actually practice in a work group 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.310
 to learn to learn continuously 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.120
 on the other hand there are times when I have to repeat to adjust for 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.530
 let's ensure a service 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.000
 I must however enforce certain rules determined under the law 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.599
 what kind of ram 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.719
 November 4th paderborn party for faculty and family students 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:44.790
 eh hey report it's easy and the law provides for it 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:49.599
 in the under the new in the model of organizational and didactic autonomy 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.459
 it provides knit point numbers formative offer to be say 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.709
 established also in relation to a territorial development plan what 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.729
 it means 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.649
 that the teachers' family must be curious in to deep weather 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:09.079
 together decide what the roky 5 development training plan cannot 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:09.659
 to be 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.710
 a simple one is a separation of decisions 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.430
 about a certain future after one that then the talent of girls for girls 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.779
 and for which free unison students for the acts are children but in the end he 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.409
 together we must develop 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.269
 these personalities in relation to their taylor guidelines and their projects 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.189
 life 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.080
 how is the anal relationship 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.589
 tester instructions in the school is a 100 cc blog report ne 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.149
 and anyway I'm 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:44.489
 clearly the positive relationships are not 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.859
 let's say 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.590
 dictated by 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.479
 by agreement 20 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.169
 and facade 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.139
 116 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.989
 for which, however, the collaborations like there must still be among the enter 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.679
 instructions for a series of problems if you have when the prof 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:04.399
 province is with the common greenhouse 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:08.919
 those of the friendly are good and then you have to see in the programmatic and 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.199
 then the events of concreteness and if these relationships can be saved 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.849
 always for development 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.319
 of the territory 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.759
 what awaits you from the institutions 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.139
 from the institution it is a game in which one can expect 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.949
 . 1 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.090
 and I believe it cracks 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.479
 the collaborative relationships between TV talk 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.289
 it was wiki 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.289
 go accor data must be defined 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.370
 we say even territorial impact and maybe we can also finish this fact 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.150
 the stars of a social balance sheet 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.300
 so through an effective collaboration eagle through agreements 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.639
 program protocol in agreement key passes and are defined together 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.430
 we can also establish losers 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.410
 3 for example as here at the ITC there is also a tourist address and so on 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.520
 hotel and catering company we say to what it is 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.230
 professionalism also linked to our territoriality that of one 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.690
 puglia because a redang diciamo needs a development of 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.310
 coasts for example in the coastal area 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.610
 clearly through 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.620
 a synergy with the municipality in the interests we say common for all 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.749
 we can also create 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:34.959
 certain and in this it is that they bring app value certain skills and 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.959
 last professionality to the local territory
