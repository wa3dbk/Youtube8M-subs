00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.689 
was well receiving of that information
there<00:00:22.210> was<00:00:22.239> a<00:00:22.329> lot<00:00:22.599> of<00:00:22.630> good<00:00:23.159> information<00:00:24.159> that

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
example tonight we we heard that the the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.960 
example tonight we we heard that the the
subway<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.160> coming<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.760> Jane<00:02:19.940> and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
subway that is coming in to Jane and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.450 
subway that is coming in to Jane and
Finch<00:02:20.330> came<00:02:20.720> into<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.110> picture<00:02:21.320> now<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:22.250> that

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
Finch came into the picture now and that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.760 
Finch came into the picture now and that
sort<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.880> changes<00:02:23.420> things<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.990> know<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.350> if

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
sort of changes things you know and if

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920 
sort of changes things you know and if
people<00:02:25.190> knew<00:02:25.340> about<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.790> before<00:02:26.240> I'm<00:02:26.600> pretty

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
people knew about that before I'm pretty

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.290 
people knew about that before I'm pretty
sure<00:02:27.260> their<00:02:27.530> debate<00:02:27.920> might<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.400> been<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.910> lot

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
sure their debate might have been a lot

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.520 
sure their debate might have been a lot
different<00:02:31.090> my<00:02:32.090> thinking<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.290> board

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
different my thinking is that the board

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.150 
different my thinking is that the board
has<00:02:33.770> decided<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.660> go<00:02:35.660> with<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.990> status<00:02:36.440> quo<00:02:36.530> in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
has decided to go with the status quo in

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.240 
has decided to go with the status quo in
other<00:02:37.400> words<00:02:37.700> no<00:02:38.270> school<00:02:38.570> closures<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:40.070> to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
other words no school closures but to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.360 
other words no school closures but to
leave<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.610> at<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.720> sad<00:02:42.080> because<00:02:42.890> you're

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
leave it at that is sad because you're

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.410 
leave it at that is sad because you're
going<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.820> have<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.060> subway<00:02:44.650> which<00:02:45.650> means<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.730> lot

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
going to have a subway which means a lot

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020 
going to have a subway which means a lot

community<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.519> better<00:03:14.420> plan<00:03:14.750> in<00:03:15.049> my<00:03:15.260> view

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
community so a better plan in my view

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.580 
community so a better plan in my view
would<00:03:16.130> have<00:03:16.280> been<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.760> take<00:03:17.290> maybe<00:03:18.290> two

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
would have been to take maybe two

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.050 
would have been to take maybe two
schools<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.040> are<00:03:19.250> close<00:03:19.459> together<00:03:19.730> like

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
schools that are close together like

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.719 

okay<00:05:41.659> let's<00:05:41.900> hit<00:05:42.259> over<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.860> Jane<00:05:43.069> Finch<00:05:43.309> area

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
okay let's hit over the Jane Finch area

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.390 
okay let's hit over the Jane Finch area
it<00:05:44.449> seems<00:05:44.719> like<00:05:45.050> this<00:05:45.740> was<00:05:45.919> a<00:05:45.949> cathartic

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
it seems like this was a cathartic

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.309 
it seems like this was a cathartic
process<00:05:46.580> we<00:05:47.150> have<00:05:47.300> escaped<00:05:47.629> loads<00:05:47.990> in<00:05:48.199> this

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
process we have escaped loads in this

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:54.850 
process we have escaped loads in this
room<00:05:48.669> immunity<00:05:49.669> baby<00:05:51.819> in<00:05:52.819> our<00:05:53.150> opposition<00:05:53.860> for

the<00:05:54.949> communities<00:05:55.400> has<00:05:55.669> it<00:05:56.150> was<00:05:56.270> hard<00:05:56.839> for<00:05:57.020> the

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
the communities has it was hard for the

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:27.579 
the communities has it was hard for the
staff<00:05:57.349> -<00:05:58.719> it<00:05:59.719> seems<00:05:59.930> like<00:06:25.960> projecting<00:06:26.960> that

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:27.589 
staff - it seems like projecting that

that and see what kind of options were
available<00:06:44.560> options<00:06:45.560> would<00:06:45.710> be<00:06:45.770> to

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
available options would be to

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.129 
available options would be to
consolidate<00:06:46.759> and<00:06:47.629> if<00:06:47.779> there<00:06:47.960> was<00:06:48.110> a

programs so the community let's for the

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.050 
programs so the community let's for the
process<00:06:56.720> I<00:06:56.960> think<00:06:57.020> it<00:06:57.410> was<00:06:57.530> a<00:06:57.580> very<00:06:58.580> healthy

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
process I think it was a very healthy

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.290 
process I think it was a very healthy
process<00:06:59.330> mobility<00:07:00.910> information<00:07:01.910> hasn't

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
process mobility information hasn't

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.540 
process mobility information hasn't
changed<00:07:02.870> and<00:07:03.050> get<00:07:03.650> the<00:07:03.860> information<00:07:04.010> for

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
changed and get the information for

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.850 
changed and get the information for
students<00:07:05.120> in<00:07:05.240> the<00:07:05.300> future<00:07:05.530> but<00:07:06.530> it<00:07:06.710> was<00:07:06.830> a

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
students in the future but it was a

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.250 
students in the future but it was a
healthy<00:07:07.280> exercise<00:07:07.820> and<00:07:08.270> I<00:07:08.750> think<00:07:08.960> one<00:07:09.110> of<00:07:09.140> the

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
healthy exercise and I think one of the

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.830 
healthy exercise and I think one of the
key<00:07:09.470> things<00:07:09.770> that<00:07:09.980> we<00:07:10.130> want<00:07:10.430> to<00:07:10.460> reinforce<00:07:10.840> is

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
key things that we want to reinforce is

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.750 
key things that we want to reinforce is
that<00:07:12.110> there<00:07:12.350> are<00:07:12.500> those<00:07:12.740> folks<00:07:13.190> that<00:07:13.370> may

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:13.760 
that there are those folks that may

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.360 
that there are those folks that may
