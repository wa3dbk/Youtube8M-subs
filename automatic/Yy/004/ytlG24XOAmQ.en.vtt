00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.560
 they are friends here and jenny dyer 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 there is a rollback to general 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:22.580
 on bye my family bye bye with you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.140
 there were months of expensive fat board 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.570
 Well, then later the name went 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.640
 tourist 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.130
 rate the dynamics of the total maximum 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.520
 Generally whom this machine is suitable 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.070
 This machine is suitable for 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.829
 wanting 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.120
 The car was combined 2 characteristic exactly 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.810
 sportiness 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.310
 and wherein 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.910
 character sports while doing so 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.910
 clearance was 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.510
 yes as a middle ground is generally difficult 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.120
 I also find when selecting the best me 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.710
 semi important 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.780
 my previous cars what 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.970
 will have low imagine checks you catch on 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.400
 gets on your nerves 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.300
 because sure with normal cars 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.750
 power and speed 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.200
 the dynamics were good with this power 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.600
 combined with a paint 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.320
 so that he does not go into a skid in the bath 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.320
 lurched 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420
 this is often a Lexus and so 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.560
 Further 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.560
 horseradish is generally slu 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.659
 so the car is happy message soon 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.609
 felt only in the city 120 140 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.609
 while speed hatch want 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 kids dynamic advice my first 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.730
 there is no return what you can 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.680
 migration and heat glasses 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.220
 even insurance dear wear it 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.820
 due to the fact that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.960
 we take the youth we fly 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.960
 and all kind of crashes 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.689
 so car is great 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.310
 what else can you say about him 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.150
 consumption certainly weighs more drowning here 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.150
 already 38 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.330
 If the throat is moderately normal ride 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 sixteen 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.080
 as a basis 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.100
 as well as the middle I let 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.100
 22 liters 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.770
 what speed 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.330
 Dashevskaya cars of course bad roads 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.060
 insanely beautiful 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.060
 and here all 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.470
 car is fine my advice take sit 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.690
 you want your whole character 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.970
 requires drive manageability 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.100
 and beauty machines so that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.030
 clearance is normal but it is low 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.130
 normal pains are not like a sedan 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.060
 sporting so on 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.060
 car with 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.150
 all thanks you will meet
