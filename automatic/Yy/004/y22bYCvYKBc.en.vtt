00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
makes total sense for a sniper to have a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.429 
makes total sense for a sniper to have a
slingshot<00:00:23.880> anyone<00:00:24.630> who<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:25.019> knows<00:00:25.140> the

sniper will tell you he was quite a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.240 
sniper will tell you he was quite a
mischievous<00:00:27.960> young<00:00:28.410> man<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> his<00:00:28.830> youth<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
mischievous young man in his youth and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.519 
mischievous young man in his youth and
began<00:00:29.789> his<00:00:30.060> sniping<00:00:30.570> career<00:00:30.840> early<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.320> when

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
began his sniping career early on when

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
began his sniping career early on when
he<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.130> sling<00:00:32.640> shot<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> little<00:00:33.300> boy<00:00:33.450> this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
he got a sling shot as a little boy this

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
he got a sling shot as a little boy this
is<00:00:34.079> simply<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> throwback<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.190> his<00:00:35.489> golden

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
is simply a throwback to his golden

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.819 
is simply a throwback to his golden
years<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> playground<00:00:36.989> headshotting

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
years on the playground headshotting

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250 
years on the playground headshotting
bullies<00:00:38.129> from<00:00:38.280> across<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.059> field<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> just

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
bullies from across the field so it just

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.840 
bullies from across the field so it just
makes<00:00:40.500> sense<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.950> he<00:00:41.070> brings<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> back<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
makes sense that he brings it back to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.180 
makes sense that he brings it back to
the<00:00:41.940> battlefield<00:00:42.270> two<00:00:42.809> headshot<00:00:43.260> more<00:00:43.680> bad

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the battlefield two headshot more bad

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639 
the battlefield two headshot more bad
people<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.719> looks<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> brilliant

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
people I think it looks like a brilliant

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.229 
people I think it looks like a brilliant
weapon<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.579> course<00:00:47.820> only<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
weapon this is of course only a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.080 
weapon this is of course only a
prototype<00:00:49.129> hopefully<00:00:50.129> valve<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.789> soon

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
prototype hopefully valve will soon

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
prototype hopefully valve will soon
release<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> an<00:00:51.930> upcoming<00:00:52.110> patch<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.670 
release it in an upcoming patch and I
personally<00:00:53.850> feel<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.410> strike

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
personally feel like it I really strike

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.439 
personally feel like it I really strike
fear<00:00:55.949> into<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> hearts<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.760> enemies<00:00:56.789> every

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
fear into the hearts of my enemies every

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.959 
fear into the hearts of my enemies every
time<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> pull<00:00:58.050> back<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.559> string<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.730> terms

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
time I pull back the string now in terms

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.760 
time I pull back the string now in terms
of<00:01:00.120> strategy<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> found<00:01:00.960> myself<00:01:01.140> using<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of strategy I found myself using it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
of strategy I found myself using it
quite<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> huntsman<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.120> anything<00:01:03.750> I'm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
quite like the huntsman if anything I'm
kind<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.110> disappointed<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.860> weapon<00:01:05.189> didn't

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
kind of disappointed this weapon didn't

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
kind of disappointed this weapon didn't
add<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> new<00:01:05.909> mechanic<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.750> sort<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
add a new mechanic it's sort of

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.300 
add a new mechanic it's sort of
augmented<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> already<00:01:08.130> existing

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
augmented the already existing

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520 
augmented the already existing
strategies<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> sniper<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
strategies that a sniper has with the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.590 
strategies that a sniper has with the
huntsman<00:01:11.090> personally<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> found<00:01:12.360> myself

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
huntsman personally I found myself

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.330 
huntsman personally I found myself
playing<00:01:12.930> sniper<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.439> lot<00:01:13.650> more<00:01:13.920> though<00:01:14.159> because

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
playing sniper a lot more though because

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
playing sniper a lot more though because
of<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.119> much<00:01:15.360> fun<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> play<00:01:16.290> with

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
of just how much fun it is to play with

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.820 
of just how much fun it is to play with
this<00:01:16.650> weapon<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.869> quite<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> same<00:01:19.650> as

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
this weapon I it's not quite the same as

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
this weapon I it's not quite the same as
the<00:01:19.950> huntsman<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> use<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.030> feel

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the huntsman when I use it I just feel

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
the huntsman when I use it I just feel
different<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.380> sorry<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.580> some

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

different like I'm sorry like I'm some
rambunctious<00:01:24.600> lad<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.439> Bart<00:01:25.830> Simpson<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
rambunctious lad like Bart Simpson and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
rambunctious lad like Bart Simpson and
just<00:01:27.000> seems<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.390> goofy<00:01:27.810> every<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> kill

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
just seems so goofy every time I kill

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
just seems so goofy every time I kill
someone<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.610> only<00:01:29.759> imagine<00:01:29.909> what

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
someone with it I can only imagine what

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.149 
someone with it I can only imagine what
the<00:01:30.479> enemy<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.840> thinking<00:01:31.290> every<00:01:31.619> time<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> how

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the enemy is thinking every time and how

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190 
the enemy is thinking every time and how
silly<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.700> feel<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.360> having<00:01:33.600> been<00:01:33.750> bested

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
silly they feel for having been bested

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
silly they feel for having been bested
by<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.680> weapon<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.880> some<00:01:36.090> problems

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
by this weapon there are some problems

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.670 
by this weapon there are some problems
with<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.689> weapon<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> course<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.560> very

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
with this weapon of course it's very

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.260 
with this weapon of course it's very
weak<00:01:37.950> against<00:01:38.310> people<00:01:38.579> who<00:01:38.670> decide<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
weak against people who decide not to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
weak against people who decide not to
stand<00:01:39.630> still<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.079> usually<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.560> people<00:01:40.590> run

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
stand still and usually when people run

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
stand still and usually when people run
sideways<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:42.180> hard<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> hit<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
sideways it's hard to hit them like the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.600 
sideways it's hard to hit them like the
medic<00:01:43.470> who<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> couldn't<00:01:43.979> beat<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.250> several

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
medic who I couldn't beat on several

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
medic who I couldn't beat on several
occasions<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.360> pyro<00:01:45.720> who<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> decided

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
occasions and this pyro who I decided

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.080 
occasions and this pyro who I decided
was<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> prime<00:01:47.070> candidate<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.579> some<00:01:47.880> close

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
was a prime candidate for some close

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.859 
was a prime candidate for some close
quarters<00:01:48.479> combat

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
quarters combat

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
quarters combat
of<00:01:48.990> course<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.680> weapon<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> clumsy<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.700> close

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
of course this weapon is clumsy in close

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
of course this weapon is clumsy in close
proximity<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.659> decide<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.930> take<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.259> hand

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
proximity so I decide to take my hand

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560 
proximity so I decide to take my hand
out<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> pyro<00:01:53.490> being<00:01:53.850> an<00:01:54.000> avid<00:01:54.210> camper

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
out but the pyro being an avid camper

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
out but the pyro being an avid camper
knew<00:01:54.960> exactly<00:01:55.320> how<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> properly<00:01:56.100> cook<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.579> ham

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
knew exactly how to properly cook my ham

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.990 
knew exactly how to properly cook my ham
and<00:01:57.119> me<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.540> well<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.280> as<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.610> by<00:01:59.969> now

and me as well so as you can see by now

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.969 
and me as well so as you can see by now
it's<00:02:00.360> fairly<00:02:00.689> potent<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.290> functions<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it's fairly potent and functions kind of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
it's fairly potent and functions kind of
like<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> Huntsman<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:02.670> clearly<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.450> not

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
like the Huntsman but clearly it's not

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.980 
like the Huntsman but clearly it's not
the<00:02:03.869> same<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.439> obviously<00:02:05.280> better<00:02:05.780> alright

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the same and obviously better alright

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.540 
the same and obviously better alright

keen viewers of this video might be

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940 
keen viewers of this video might be
getting<00:02:08.940> suspicious<00:02:09.270> about<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.319> mean<00:02:10.739> why

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
getting suspicious about now I mean why

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
getting suspicious about now I mean why
would<00:02:11.220> valve<00:02:11.489> give<00:02:11.790> me<00:02:11.970> some<00:02:12.239> new<00:02:12.450> prototype

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
would valve give me some new prototype

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.870 
would valve give me some new prototype
weapon<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.500> don't<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> close

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
weapon I don't know it is kind of close

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.120 
weapon I don't know it is kind of close
to<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> huntsman<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.720> shoots<00:02:16.020> arrows<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.950> has

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
to a huntsman it shoots arrows it has

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.180 
to a huntsman it shoots arrows it has
the<00:02:17.280> same<00:02:17.460> kill<00:02:17.760> icon<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.680> even<00:02:19.800> tod

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the same kill icon and it can even tod

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.120 
the same kill icon and it can even tod
kill<00:02:20.490> which<00:02:20.730> I'm<00:02:20.910> about<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.330> show<00:02:21.570> right<00:02:21.870> now

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
kill which I'm about to show right now

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.380 
kill which I'm about to show right now
and<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:24.450> works<00:02:25.170> kind<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.980> exactly<00:02:26.460> like<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
and it's works kind of exactly like the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.130 
and it's works kind of exactly like the
Huntsman<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:29.130> think<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.120> about<00:02:30.420> time<00:02:30.780> to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
Huntsman and I think it is about time to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.580 
Huntsman and I think it is about time to
come<00:02:31.770> clean<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.460> unfortunately<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:34.050> not<00:02:34.260> some

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
come clean I unfortunately have not some

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.580 
come clean I unfortunately have not some
valve<00:02:34.920> tester<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> what<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.660> actually<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
valve tester and what this actually is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.030 
valve tester and what this actually is
is<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.670> Huntsman<00:02:39.420> skin<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.930> was<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> make<00:02:41.010> a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.630 
that I don't know if it improved my
accuracy<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.320> feel<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.040> actually<00:03:11.370> made<00:03:11.520> it

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
accuracy I feel like it actually made it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.090 
accuracy I feel like it actually made it
worse<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.660> had<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.080> really<00:03:13.500> good<00:03:13.620> time<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.040> I

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
worse but I had a really good time and I

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.650 
worse but I had a really good time and I
mean<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.400> not<00:03:14.550> any<00:03:14.820> different<00:03:15.360> from<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
mean it's not any different from the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.840 
mean it's not any different from the
Huntsman<00:03:16.050> but<00:03:16.080> just<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.650> skin<00:03:17.010> made<00:03:17.459> me<00:03:17.580> feel

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
Huntsman but just the skin made me feel

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.640 
Huntsman but just the skin made me feel
less<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.450> Robin<00:03:18.930> Hood<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.290> more<00:03:19.440> like<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
less like a Robin Hood and more like a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.800 
less like a Robin Hood and more like a
