collinar<00:04:37.760> I've<00:04:37.880> had<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.150> for<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.390> while<00:04:38.660> and

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
collinar I've had this for a while and

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.630 
collinar I've had this for a while and
it's<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.380> really<00:04:39.590> small<00:04:39.710> barrel<00:04:40.280> but<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.520> gives

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
it's a really small barrel but it gives

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.330 
it's a really small barrel but it gives
a<00:04:40.850> nice<00:04:41.090> little<00:04:41.540> curl<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.230> my<00:04:42.470> hair<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.920> I

a nice little curl to my hair and I

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.060 
a nice little curl to my hair and I
think<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.700> looks<00:04:43.730> perfect<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:45.500> after<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.800> my

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
think it looks perfect so after that my

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.410 
think it looks perfect so after that my
hair<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.280> all<00:04:46.490> done<00:04:46.760> i'm<00:04:46.940> just<00:04:47.060> going<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.210> brush

hair is all done i'm just going to brush

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.060 
hair is all done i'm just going to brush
it<00:04:47.480> out<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:47.990> curls<00:04:48.230> aren't<00:04:48.470> as<00:04:48.590> tight<00:04:48.890> and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
it out so the curls aren't as tight and

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.370 
it out so the curls aren't as tight and
define<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:49.820> i<00:04:49.880> kind<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.150> get<00:04:50.360> curlier<00:04:51.020> type

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
define so i kind of get curlier type

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.370 
define so i kind of get curlier type
waves<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:52.510> that's<00:04:53.510> what<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.960> finish<00:04:54.230> that
