this after the life invader mission and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
this after the life invader mission and
you'll<00:01:03.720> start<00:01:03.930> off<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.259> bad<00:01:04.619> stock<00:01:05.159> market

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you'll start off with a bad stock market

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.910 
you'll start off with a bad stock market
of<00:01:05.729> 20%<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.540> life<00:01:06.810> invader<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of 20% for life invader and that's a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
of 20% for life invader and that's a
good<00:01:08.159> time<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.670> you'll<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.570> of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
good time to do it you'll make a lot of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
good time to do it you'll make a lot of
money<00:01:09.810> faster<00:01:10.409> than<00:01:10.560> any<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> these<00:01:11.040> stocks

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
money faster than any of these stocks

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940 
money faster than any of these stocks
but<00:01:12.120> I<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:13.170> didn't<00:01:13.320> wanna<00:01:13.440> go<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.650> far<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
but I really didn't wanna go that far in

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.230 
but I really didn't wanna go that far in
the<00:01:14.010> campaign<00:01:14.159> because<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.880> already<00:01:14.970> beat<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the campaign because I already beat the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.000 
the campaign because I already beat the
campaign<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.840> comp<00:01:16.110> other<00:01:16.409> console<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
campaign on the comp other console and

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.350 
campaign on the comp other console and
it's<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.550> fun<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> all

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's really not that fun to do it all

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.110 
it's really not that fun to do it all
over<00:01:18.420> again<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.979> I've<00:01:20.520> noticed<00:01:20.760> a<00:01:20.909> little

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
over again so I've noticed a little

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.700 
over again so I've noticed a little
problem<00:01:21.420> I've<00:01:21.570> done<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.020> unicorn<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
problem I've done it with unicorn and I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
problem I've done it with unicorn and I
didn't<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.010> any<00:01:23.190> profit<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:23.970> know

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
didn't make any profit so I don't know

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.390 
didn't make any profit so I don't know
that's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> bug<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.870> glitch<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:26.070> best

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that's a bug in the glitch but my best

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.270 
that's a bug in the glitch but my best
bet<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.909> insurance<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> life<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
bet was insurance and life in there so

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.469 
bet was insurance and life in there so
it's<00:01:29.580> not<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> much<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.120> difference<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it's not that much of a difference in

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.850 
it's not that much of a difference in
percentile<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.320> doesn't<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.590> make<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
percentile so it doesn't really make a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.149 
percentile so it doesn't really make a
difference<00:01:32.479> nope<00:01:33.479> about<00:01:33.750> insurance<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
difference nope about insurance and I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
difference nope about insurance and I
buy<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.729> much<00:01:36.090> insurance<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.200> possibly

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
buy as much insurance as I can possibly

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
buy as much insurance as I can possibly
