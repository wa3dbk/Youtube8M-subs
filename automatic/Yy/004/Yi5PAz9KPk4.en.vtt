 Well let's enter the game for a moment 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.890
 Even if you bring the development version of that turn, there is only that debug command 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.890
 Because it is not fun 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.330

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.100
 After that basic 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.190
 I wonder if I'm going to be a boy as I look back a little 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.060

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.409

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.319
 But such a feeling 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:57.659
 That the kind here that time flows is normally horizontal Rutteyuu of in this world 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:59.590
 Hey Omi back Atiya that Armman Noon try 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.650

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.650
 There is a puddle in the paddy field near the frog So yes this is that 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:15.340
 You can see the optical tape properly and you can do amazing things 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.200
 I place a little there is a roof and the bottom I will wind called or not wet Nea logo 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.670

 I hope to realize such a living world as much as possible 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:30.890
 That technical member is now working hard. 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.890
 So ha ha let him be 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:40.690
 I've been able to operate now at hand, but this is true 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:46.910
 The rain stopped at 2 and after a while he said that it would go up a little more slowly 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:51.320
 It's going to happen that's a lot of things right now I'm in great speed mode yes 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.440
 Let's see the character once again, I'm sure it's sunny and the clothes aren't getting wet anymore 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.270
 Right 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:02.489
 But it might Naikamo Wakan subtly too yeah hey I hair is also ne cute Tan 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:06.270
 It is not reach too thin it also addition of character 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:13.500
 Tan has certainly statement and kidnapping 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:14.040
 The Tokyo Metropolitan Government at the same location of that gameplay that was released last year too much 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.640
 In front 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:23.220
 What the fighting was I but further than the environment at that time willing right now Masu seems princess 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.020
 It is and that Luminous 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.670
 Read I found the wind that ebony that has been used to at the time of hurry at that time Dale Fifteen 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:36.340
 And of the original environment integration 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:39.930
 Since the game is moving in the production environment, the development will greatly progress from now on 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 I think I will go ahead 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.640
 Well, I think it's actually 8 days so please take a look at everyone 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.560
 It was ui- 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.460
 so 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.780
 It looks like a little light around here 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.780
 Turn it around to see 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.930
 here 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:19.840
 As I said earlier, it was a place where I was fighting with Behemoth at the last three days 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.380
 So now I can change the time at hand, but I really know in the game 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.829
 but 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.829
 24hours 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.060
 Please write more and more 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:37.190
 It seems to be darkening naturally switched to the night as it is 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:42.889
 Thereafter also world time growing up with the morning comes continues to flow all the way 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.540
 As the day goes by, the degree goes on , so why is it that last year 3 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.620
 Excuse me 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:53.660
 According to the trailer of Bartoll I put a new, but at that time 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.940
 As I said, I could not make it by tuning for a few days or so. 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:02.560
 Is the morning sun 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:06.129
 It goes to the place where raining naturally in the world naturally . Well then a little battle 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:12.409
 You can see this and this time 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:16.910
 When viewed from above it looks like it is the second time was a little scary 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:20.400
 It's about 70 to 80 percent quality right now . 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.680
 It's time to deliver the trial version 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.680
 I see this I think is going up Quality 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.370
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.370
 So do let's go battle 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.000
 Well after all here 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.190
 If you want to fight 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.120
 It is now saying that this guy 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.120
 Hero I know yes 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.110
 Path of Uchitchai of is you, slowing Awww child 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.360
 This 5 minutes of media 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.930
 Ice art is this minister 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.009
 I laughed a hundred bucks, I guess there was no tick before 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.650
 It was there quite Terutoko entered the cave there 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.920
 I have always avoided it 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:12.960
 This is this is that Well 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:18.150
 Although this red game system description Avoid this time chocolate 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.409
 Keep pushing the button for a long time or keep avoiding it 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.009
 It is such a system 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:25.600
 It's just that the attack is pressing the attack button too 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:30.190
 I will attack myself 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:33.480
 It's an action but it's very easy 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.480
 It becomes so technique comes out 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:47.109
 Last year of e 3 This softening guess it seems there was also or was I was pro opinion have 

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:51.920
 Does not unrefined just that a little while ago it was a nice little 

00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:57.410
 At the time of Kijima, we were still developing in that other temporary environment , right? 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.310
 I'm trying to finish the game like this by raising the degree of completion once in a cut environment 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:05.810
 I decided 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:12.009
 And that is also something yet fully motion with the stage that you are migrating now to a production environment 100 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:16.420
 With the state of the pants Buber will get better 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:19.240
 Click here to do no work and has been more and more there is no better time 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.780
 Seki ran and was defeated 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.780
 There 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:30.660
 I think I've been attacking with Ignis for a while now 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:33.240
 that 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.930
 There is no need for special operations on this 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:40.200
 We can take out with friend who is near at that time 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:43.130
 Joint techniques come out automatically 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.130
 Not 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:54.150
 I think it's a bit distance, but I do n't have much time , I 'm sorry I 'm biting power 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.150
 It was defeated Ademo Wow 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.350
 I cut it again, yes 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.350
 Yes
