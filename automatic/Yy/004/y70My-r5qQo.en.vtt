00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.910
 Hi there, this is a review on the firm's jacket 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:15.770
 alpha industries jacket called 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 uh one dib so the firm itself 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.020
 the american 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.150
 things are all done accordingly in 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.630
 America firm is famous for high quality 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 the prototype for this jacket was 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 jacket of American military pilots 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.620
 actually this is actually the same 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.600
 jacket but more say that civil 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.280
 option so whether so here to the torture itself 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.280
 outside two pockets on the garden and 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.260
 sleeve pocket for resist pens 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.379
 trivia so on so on as not 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.650
 written to remove before the departure of the company 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.330
 let's say so sign 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.910
 on all kurt of this series inside here here 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.650
 compartment for pens built 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.650
 for such plastic spheres embedded 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.820
 so that if you are allowed there 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.360
 insert a pen or pencil so as not to 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.730
 to pierce 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.070
 the fabric itself so that this does not remain 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.670
 pastors and so on here is enough 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760
 thoughtfully 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.420
 so sleeves sleeves below are fixed 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.870
 elastic 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.550
 such a wide enough good gum 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.460
 between respectively also further on the chest 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.869
 company label he is always sticky 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.020
 you can connect it there and let's say 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.970
 some kind of your throne to check to the limit 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.020
 blood type who has what fantasy 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:56.530
 again from you 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.530
 so lightning 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:15.400
 forbidden inside such a dark red 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.330
 can even blige burgundy color here 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.100
 so to speak in the best American 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.750
 Tradition says that the jacket 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.569
 produced in america written where is she 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.310
 produced that this is true 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.670
 say american quality is done 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.670
 actually for the military and everything like that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.790
 the hood also has a record label company 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.960
 at all scare u by the way I will also write 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.920
 company name 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.920
 on the fittings of the locks respectively 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.480
 two inner pockets too on the cells in 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.400
 Russia this jacket is better known under 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:07.290
 the name of the pilot if unlike to 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.310
 The original version of the MI-1 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.380
 this 2 zipper is made of insulation 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.070
 the hood and the collar itself is all 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.870
 it can be unfastened too much 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:26.050
 unfasten accordingly will 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.060
 classic we are one for good reason 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.590
 the company is famous for its quality 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.590
 quality jacket really made 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.700
 All seams are perfectly smooth no 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.110
 sticking thread all very neat 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.960
 the jacket is warm enough 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.070
 demi-season something suggest as 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.730
 in the winter it will not freeze very much 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.500
 convenient for some such active and 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.570
 constant wear that is, we like 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.610
 and in the forest you can and just have a city that is 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.670
 probably all thanks for watching everyone 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.670
 until
