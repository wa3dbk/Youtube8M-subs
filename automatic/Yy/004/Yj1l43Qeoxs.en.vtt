00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
readily as they used to back in the 50s

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
readily as they used to back in the 50s
and<00:01:13.110> 60s<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:14.010> reason<00:01:14.340> being<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.760> they're

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and 60s the reason being is they're

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
and 60s the reason being is they're
immunological<00:01:15.780> meaning<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:17.159> actually<00:01:17.700> help

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
immunological meaning they actually help

why your tonsils will swell

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.430 
why your tonsils will swell
they're<00:02:14.549> swollen<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.030> far<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.540> recommend

that<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.830> eliminate<00:02:17.190> wheat<00:02:17.879> from<00:02:18.150> your

my<00:02:20.370> guess<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.640> they're<00:02:20.909> smaller<00:02:21.269> if<00:02:21.680> that's
