00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.330 

this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.079> quick<00:00:01.410> demonstration<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:02.250> a

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
this is a quick demonstration of a

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.370 
this is a quick demonstration of a
project<00:00:02.730> that<00:00:02.790> I've<00:00:02.970> been<00:00:03.090> working<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.600> it<00:00:03.840> is

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
project that I've been working on it is

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.950 
project that I've been working on it is
a<00:00:04.410> real-time<00:00:05.339> non-euclidean<00:00:06.330> ray<00:00:06.480> tracer<00:00:06.839> and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
a real-time non-euclidean ray tracer and

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.020 
a real-time non-euclidean ray tracer and
it's<00:00:07.080> all<00:00:07.200> running<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.560> GLSL<00:00:08.189> shaders<00:00:08.220> which

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
it's all running in GLSL shaders which

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.209 
it's all running in GLSL shaders which
enables<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.660> run<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.080> almost<00:00:10.559> 60<00:00:10.889> frames

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
enables it to run in almost 60 frames

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.580 
enables it to run in almost 60 frames
per<00:00:11.309> second<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> ray<00:00:12.990> tracer<00:00:13.380> so

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
per second so it is a ray tracer so

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.980 
per second so it is a ray tracer so
things<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.370> awesome<00:00:14.880> reflections<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
things like awesome reflections and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.930 
things like awesome reflections and
stuff<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.350> much<00:00:16.949> easier<00:00:17.279> than<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:17.520> would<00:00:17.730> be

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
stuff are much easier than they would be

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.840 
stuff are much easier than they would be
with<00:00:18.119> traditional<00:00:18.720> rendering<00:00:19.199> techniques

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
with traditional rendering techniques

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.519 
with traditional rendering techniques
now<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.390> capable<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:22.020> non<00:00:22.320> Euclidean

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
now it is capable of non Euclidean

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.410 
now it is capable of non Euclidean
geometry<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.460> essentially<00:00:24.240> means

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
geometry which essentially means

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.939 
geometry which essentially means
something<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.410> tunnel<00:00:25.680> for

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
something like this this tunnel for

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.310 
something like this this tunnel for
example<00:00:26.369> takes<00:00:26.910> longer<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> travel<00:00:27.779> through

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
example takes longer to travel through

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.429 
example takes longer to travel through
than<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.279> does<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.910> go<00:00:30.150> around<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.289> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
than it does to go around and this is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
than it does to go around and this is
because<00:00:31.769> space<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.460> essentially<00:00:32.969> expanded

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
because space is essentially expanded

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959 
because space is essentially expanded
the<00:00:34.290> way<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.620> effect<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.190> achieved<00:00:35.370> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the way this effect is achieved is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.940 
the way this effect is achieved is
essentially<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> Rays<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> are<00:00:37.530> being<00:00:37.649> cast

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
essentially the Rays that are being cast

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.350 
essentially the Rays that are being cast
out<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> camera<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.149> specific

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
out of the camera to look for specific

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
out of the camera to look for specific
objects<00:00:39.960> once<00:00:40.469> they<00:00:40.680> entered<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.219> region

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
objects once they entered this region

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.910 
objects once they entered this region
right<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.540> being<00:00:42.920> stretched

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
right here are actually being stretched

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.389 
right here are actually being stretched
in<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.399> direction<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:46.070> set<00:00:47.070> back<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
in this direction and then a set back to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.600 
in this direction and then a set back to
normal<00:00:47.789> normal<00:00:48.629> size<00:00:49.020> once<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.950> exit<00:00:50.160> out

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
normal normal size once they exit out

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
normal normal size once they exit out
out<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.329> region<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.350> gives<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
out of the region and this gives the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
out of the region and this gives the
appearance<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> tunnel<00:00:53.699> being<00:00:53.820> extended

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
appearance of the tunnel being extended

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
appearance of the tunnel being extended
now<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> player<00:00:55.199> movement<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:56.280> slowed

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
now the player movement is also slowed

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
now the player movement is also slowed
down<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:57.030> he's<00:00:57.180> inside<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> tunnel<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
down when he's inside the tunnel so

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.340 
down when he's inside the tunnel so
these<00:00:59.129> two<00:00:59.520> factors<00:00:59.820> combined<00:01:00.449> make<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> seem

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
these two factors combined make it seem

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.219 
these two factors combined make it seem
as<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.280> space<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.000> only<00:01:03.229> consistent

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
as if the space is not only consistent

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.920 
as if the space is not only consistent
but<00:01:04.619> also<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:06.180> being<00:01:06.420> stretched

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
but also that like it's being stretched

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.370 
but also that like it's being stretched
essentially<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> inside<00:01:09.229> now<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
essentially on the inside now this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
essentially on the inside now this
tunnel<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.830> almost<00:01:11.220> exactly<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.850> exactly

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
tunnel is that almost exactly is exactly

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
tunnel is that almost exactly is exactly
the<00:01:12.390> same<00:01:12.540> concept<00:01:13.080> except<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> tunnel

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the same concept except the tunnel

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
the same concept except the tunnel
itself<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.090> long<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.900> takes

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
itself is very very long but it takes

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.020 
itself is very very long but it takes
almost<00:01:16.259> no<00:01:16.439> time<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> travel<00:01:17.159> through<00:01:17.490> because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
almost no time to travel through because

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
almost no time to travel through because
it's<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.210> simulation<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.869> space<00:01:19.110> being

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it's a simulation of space being

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
it's a simulation of space being
compressed<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> cool<00:01:21.150> things

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
compressed now one of the cool things

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.620 
compressed now one of the cool things
that<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.540> also<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:23.360> portal<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that you can also do is a portal and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
that you can also do is a portal and
this<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.490> portals<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
this is not like portals like in the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.240 
this is not like portals like in the
game<00:01:27.090> portal<00:01:27.479> basically<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.860> spherical

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
game portal basically it's a spherical

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
game portal basically it's a spherical
it<00:01:30.000> these<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.780> actually

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it these are these are actually

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.749 
it these are these are actually
spherical<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.009> walk<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> way

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
spherical so you can walk all the way

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
spherical so you can walk all the way
around<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> look<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.229> them<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.829> were

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
around and look at them as if they were

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.130 
around and look at them as if they were
3d<00:01:35.400> 3d<00:01:35.880> objects<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.780> walk

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
3d 3d objects but you can also walk

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.330 
3d 3d objects but you can also walk
through<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:38.549> onto<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.909> other<00:01:38.939> side

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
through and go onto the other side

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.190 
through and go onto the other side
now<00:01:40.909> there<00:01:41.119> are<00:01:41.180> also<00:01:41.299> another<00:01:41.869> type<00:01:42.170> of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
now there are also another type of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.460 
now there are also another type of
portals<00:01:43.189> specifically<00:01:44.119> box<00:01:44.479> portals<00:01:45.049> which

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
portals specifically box portals which

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.170 
portals specifically box portals which
are<00:01:45.619> more<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.430> traditional<00:01:46.610> portals

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
are more like the traditional portals

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.440 
are more like the traditional portals
you<00:01:47.240> might<00:01:47.450> see<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.990> any<00:01:48.829> video<00:01:49.189> game<00:01:49.450> or

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
you might see in any video game or

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.179 
you might see in any video game or
specifically<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> video<00:01:51.350> game<00:01:51.500> portal<00:01:51.979> all

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
specifically the video game portal all

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.429 
specifically the video game portal all
these<00:01:53.149> are<00:01:53.270> more<00:01:53.420> traditional<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.049> one<00:01:54.320> of

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
these are more traditional and one of

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.630 
these are more traditional and one of
the<00:01:54.500> cool<00:01:54.649> things<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:54.890> can<00:01:54.950> actually<00:01:55.340> do<00:01:55.490> is

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
the cool things you can actually do is

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.419 
the cool things you can actually do is
have<00:01:55.880> if<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.840> have<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:56.990> hallway<00:01:57.289> two<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.280> the

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
have if you have a hallway two of the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.609 
have if you have a hallway two of the
walls<00:01:58.640> could<00:01:59.060> be<00:01:59.119> portals<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.380> right

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
walls could be portals and then right

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.410 
walls could be portals and then right
there<00:02:00.649> you've<00:02:01.009> created<00:02:01.250> an<00:02:01.520> infinite<00:02:02.030> hallway

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
there you've created an infinite hallway

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.419 
there you've created an infinite hallway
that<00:02:02.600> will<00:02:02.720> continuously<00:02:03.259> loop<00:02:03.619> forever<00:02:03.860> or

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
that will continuously loop forever or

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.359 
that will continuously loop forever or
maybe<00:02:04.640> an<00:02:04.789> infinite<00:02:05.119> staircase<00:02:05.570> now<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
maybe an infinite staircase now in the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.070 
maybe an infinite staircase now in the
middle<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.700> these<00:02:07.850> three<00:02:08.450> spheres<00:02:08.899> is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
middle of these three spheres is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.449 
middle of these three spheres is
something<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.530> cannot<00:02:09.890> be<00:02:09.950> replicated

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
something that cannot be replicated

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.280 
something that cannot be replicated
using<00:02:11.120> traditional<00:02:11.300> rendering<00:02:11.900> techniques

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
using traditional rendering techniques

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.620 
using traditional rendering techniques
but<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.130> basically<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.850> spherical

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
but it's basically a spherical

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.830 
but it's basically a spherical
aberration<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.920> once<00:02:16.370> you're<00:02:16.519> inside<00:02:16.840> space

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
aberration that once you're inside space

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.170 
aberration that once you're inside space
is<00:02:18.110> stretched<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.220> x-direction<00:02:19.640> very

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
is stretched in the x-direction very

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.210 
is stretched in the x-direction very
much<00:02:20.330> like<00:02:20.540> those<00:02:20.690> tunnels<00:02:21.110> over<00:02:21.319> there<00:02:21.500> but

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
much like those tunnels over there but

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.640 
much like those tunnels over there but
with<00:02:22.610> no<00:02:22.819> boundaries<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.630> essentially<00:02:24.530> this

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
with no boundaries and essentially this

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.770 
with no boundaries and essentially this
aberration<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.549> in<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> center<00:02:26.060> here<00:02:26.299> takes

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
aberration just in the center here takes

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.080 
aberration just in the center here takes
longer<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.349> travel<00:02:27.680> through<00:02:27.950> than<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.580> does<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
longer to travel through than it does to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.589 
longer to travel through than it does to
travel<00:02:29.510> around<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.760> simulates<00:02:32.239> space

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
travel around and this simulates space

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.870 
travel around and this simulates space
being<00:02:32.900> compressed<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.640> quick

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
being compressed so this is just a quick

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.509 
being compressed so this is just a quick
look<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.630> very<00:02:35.840> simple<00:02:36.620> scene<00:02:36.890> setup<00:02:37.340> I'm

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
look of a very simple scene setup I'm

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.089 
look of a very simple scene setup I'm
hoping<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.450> optimize<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.950> it'll

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
hoping to optimize it so that it'll

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.220 
hoping to optimize it so that it'll
actually<00:02:40.340> take<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:40.910> more<00:02:41.450> complex<00:02:41.870> scenes<00:02:42.110> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
actually take in more complex scenes and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.990 
actually take in more complex scenes and
I<00:02:42.260> want<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.590> create<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.890> simple<00:02:43.310> level<00:02:43.580> editor

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
I want to create a simple level editor

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.910 
I want to create a simple level editor
that<00:02:44.510> can<00:02:44.660> be<00:02:44.780> used<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.019> actually<00:02:45.230> build<00:02:45.680> maybe

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
that can be used to actually build maybe

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.550 
that can be used to actually build maybe
a<00:02:46.040> puzzle<00:02:46.430> game<00:02:46.609> out<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.560> hopefully

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
a puzzle game out of this and hopefully

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.289 
a puzzle game out of this and hopefully
I'll<00:02:48.829> be<00:02:48.950> able<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.160> show<00:02:49.730> something<00:02:50.120> much

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
I'll be able to show something much

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.840 
I'll be able to show something much
cooler<00:02:50.769> more<00:02:51.769> interactive<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.459> really

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
cooler more interactive and that really

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.390 
cooler more interactive and that really
shows<00:02:53.090> off<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.600> unique<00:02:53.930> abilities<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:55.220> new

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
shows off the unique abilities the new

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.770 
shows off the unique abilities the new
unique<00:02:55.819> things<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.269> can<00:02:56.390> do<00:02:56.480> with<00:02:56.600> ray

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
unique things that you can do with ray

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.360 
unique things that you can do with ray
tracing<00:02:57.079> brothers<00:02:57.739> just<00:02:57.890> using<00:02:58.220> traditional

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
tracing brothers just using traditional

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.759 
tracing brothers just using traditional
rendering<00:02:59.120> so<00:02:59.750> yeah<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.620> quick

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
rendering so yeah this is just a quick

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.040 
rendering so yeah this is just a quick
look
