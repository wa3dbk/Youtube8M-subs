00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
you're a different sound so when you

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.580 
you're a different sound so when you
pick<00:04:04.540> with<00:04:04.690> your<00:04:04.810> finger<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.230> kind<00:04:05.380> of<00:04:05.470> gives

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
pick with your finger it kind of gives

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.470 
pick with your finger it kind of gives
you<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.680> different<00:04:05.800> tone<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:07.150> mixing

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
you a different tone and so the mixing

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.300 
you a different tone and so the mixing
of<00:04:07.540> those<00:04:07.690> different<00:04:08.020> tones<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.560> think<00:04:09.130> sounds

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
of those different tones I think sounds

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.020 
of those different tones I think sounds
nice

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.890 

so<00:04:14.030> when<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.420> come<00:04:14.659> down<00:04:14.689> here

and<00:04:33.750> certainly<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.229> can<00:04:34.350> pick<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.650> just<00:04:35.220> with

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370

but<00:04:40.540> if<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:40.900> can<00:04:41.140> try<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.560> use<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.800> hybrid

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
but if you can try to use a hybrid

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.030 
but if you can try to use a hybrid
picking<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.300> get<00:04:43.420> a<00:04:43.450> different<00:04:43.840> tone<00:04:44.020> okay<00:04:44.980> so

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
picking to get a different tone okay so

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.230 
picking to get a different tone okay so
that's<00:04:45.340> it

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
that's it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.140 
that's it
I'm<00:04:46.810> out
