00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
I've done let's see this one back here

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.819 
I've done let's see this one back here
is<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.190> first<00:02:12.550> one<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:12.850> built

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
is the first one I built

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:21.670 
is the first one I built
and<00:02:15.829> so<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:18.170> path<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:19.359> also<00:02:20.359> dug<00:02:20.599> up<00:02:20.780> about<00:02:21.530> a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
and so this path I also dug up about a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.239 
and so this path I also dug up about a
foot<00:02:21.739> deep<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.810> piled<00:02:23.810> onto<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.260> bed<00:02:24.439> to

foot deep and piled onto the bed to

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.720 
foot deep and piled onto the bed to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
raise it up quite a bit and then I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.819 
raise it up quite a bit and then I
filled<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.920> path<00:02:31.219> with<00:02:31.879> woodchips<00:02:32.829> all

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829

the<00:02:34.189> way<00:02:34.250> back<00:02:34.459> up<00:02:34.639> to<00:02:34.670> its<00:02:34.939> previous<00:02:35.209> level

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the way back up to its previous level

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.849 
the way back up to its previous level
and<00:02:35.840> these<00:02:37.719> are<00:02:38.719> some<00:02:38.930> fresh<00:02:39.230> chips<00:02:39.560> when<00:02:39.829> I

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
and these are some fresh chips when I

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:46.170 
and these are some fresh chips when I
did<00:02:40.189> I<00:02:40.569> started<00:02:41.569> this<00:02:41.840> garden<00:02:42.049> last<00:02:42.439> fall<00:02:43.430> and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.240 

the<00:02:47.180> chips<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.599> I<00:02:47.810> put<00:02:48.079> down<00:02:48.109> in<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.620> bed

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
the chips that I put down in this bed

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.809 
the chips that I put down in this bed
last<00:02:49.760> fall<00:02:50.180> over<00:02:51.139> the<00:02:51.230> winnowed<00:02:51.530> winner

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819

I<00:03:14.750> had<00:03:14.930> some<00:03:15.139> crop<00:03:15.409> from<00:03:16.689> over<00:03:17.689> the<00:03:17.780> winter<00:03:18.079> I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
I had some crop from over the winter I

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.030

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
grew some turnips and beets and kale so

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.979 
grew some turnips and beets and kale so
I<00:03:25.069> chopped<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.579> all<00:03:25.729> down<00:03:25.939> what<00:03:26.629> was<00:03:26.780> left

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
I chopped that all down what was left

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.309 
I chopped that all down what was left
and<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:29.199> just<00:03:30.199> mulched<00:03:30.560> over<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.139> that's

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
and I just mulched over it and so that's

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.210 
and I just mulched over it and so that's
kind<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:34.930> been<00:03:35.930> working<00:03:36.290> pretty<00:03:36.470> nice<00:03:36.739> and

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
beds and then I just replaced the pass

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.839 
beds and then I just replaced the pass

company left

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.570 
company left
and<00:04:21.350> it's<00:04:21.650> been<00:04:21.829> sitting<00:04:22.100> around<00:04:22.130> for<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.490> while

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and it's been sitting around for a while

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.790 
and it's been sitting around for a while
so<00:04:22.639> it's<00:04:23.000> got<00:04:23.180> all<00:04:23.210> kinds<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.800> mycelium

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
so it's got all kinds of mycelium

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.340 
so it's got all kinds of mycelium
growing<00:04:25.400> on<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.630> chips<00:04:26.930> are<00:04:27.110> half

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
growing on it and the chips are half

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.650 
growing on it and the chips are half
rotted<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.120> digging<00:04:29.120> around<00:04:29.210> in<00:04:29.480> there<00:04:29.600> I

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
rotted and digging around in there I

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.150 
rotted and digging around in there I
found<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:30.230> nice<00:04:31.010> fat<00:04:32.650> California<00:04:33.650> rubber<00:04:33.950> Bella

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
found a nice fat California rubber Bella

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.440 
found a nice fat California rubber Bella
which<00:04:34.669> was<00:04:34.850> kind<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.090> cool<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:36.430> but<00:04:37.430> these<00:04:38.270> are

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
which was kind of cool and but these are

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.070 
which was kind of cool and but these are
real<00:04:38.600> course<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.200> I'm<00:04:40.130> thinking<00:04:40.639> for<00:04:40.990> for<00:04:41.990> the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
real course so I'm thinking for for the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.440 
real course so I'm thinking for for the
path<00:04:42.290> that's<00:04:42.650> just<00:04:42.860> fine<00:04:43.100> for<00:04:43.430> mulching<00:04:44.330> on

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
path that's just fine for mulching on

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.430 
path that's just fine for mulching on
the<00:04:44.570> beds<00:04:45.639> I'm<00:04:46.870> more<00:04:47.870> inclined<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.410> use

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
the beds I'm more inclined to use

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.170 
the beds I'm more inclined to use
something<00:04:48.770> finer<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.430> this<00:04:49.669> so<00:04:49.910> what<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.090> did

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
something finer like this so what I did

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.470 
something finer like this so what I did
is<00:04:50.419> I<00:04:50.450> took<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:51.050> took<00:04:51.740> these<00:04:52.100> coarse<00:04:52.460> chips<00:04:52.820> and

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
is I took I took these coarse chips and

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.450 
is I took I took these coarse chips and
I<00:04:53.600> ran<00:04:53.810> them<00:04:53.960> through<00:04:53.990> that<00:04:54.290> shredder<00:04:54.770> and

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
I ran them through that shredder and

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.140 
I ran them through that shredder and
this<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.480> what<00:04:56.630> came<00:04:56.780> out<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.850> this<00:04:58.850> looks

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
this is what came out and this looks

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.409 
this is what came out and this looks
really<00:04:59.270> nice

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
really nice

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.960 
really nice
real<00:05:02.419> fine<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.290> it's<00:05:03.440> easy<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.800> it's<00:05:04.610> easy<00:05:04.790> to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
real fine so it's easy to it's easy to

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.040 
real fine so it's easy to it's easy to
mulch<00:05:05.210> right<00:05:05.450> up<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.780> plants<00:05:06.200> and<00:05:08.020> when<00:05:09.020> I

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
mulch right up to the plants and when I

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.840 
mulch right up to the plants and when I
need<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.290> pull<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.650> back<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.010> plant<00:05:10.370> seeds

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
need to pull it back to plant seeds

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.679 
need to pull it back to plant seeds
I<00:05:10.970> could<00:05:11.120> almost

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:17.689 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.449 

I<00:05:17.749> was<00:05:18.439> thinking<00:05:18.679> I<00:05:18.769> was<00:05:18.860> gonna<00:05:18.979> say<00:05:19.249> I<00:05:19.279> could

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:19.459 
I was thinking I was gonna say I could

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:20.649 
I was thinking I was gonna say I could
almost<00:05:19.580> plant<00:05:19.909> right<00:05:20.059> in<00:05:20.179> it<00:05:20.330> but<00:05:20.449> I<00:05:20.599> don't

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
almost plant right in it but I don't

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.959 
almost plant right in it but I don't
think<00:05:20.869> that<00:05:21.049> would<00:05:21.169> be<00:05:21.289> good<00:05:21.439> idea<00:05:21.969> definitely

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
think that would be good idea definitely

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.889 
think that would be good idea definitely
want<00:05:23.149> to<00:05:23.209> scrape<00:05:23.419> it<00:05:23.479> back<00:05:23.599> some<00:05:23.959> plant<00:05:24.199> in<00:05:24.409> the
