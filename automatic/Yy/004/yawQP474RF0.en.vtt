00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
my name is Michael Brown and I teach all

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.190 
my name is Michael Brown and I teach all
things<00:00:02.760> hammer<00:00:03.000> class<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.780> this<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.110> to

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
things hammer class and this is going to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.559 
things hammer class and this is going to
be<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> raising<00:00:04.859> demo<00:00:05.130> some<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.210> students

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
be a raising demo some of the students

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.049 
be a raising demo some of the students
have<00:00:06.720> been<00:00:06.839> thinking<00:00:07.200> balls<00:00:07.799> but<00:00:08.519> raising<00:00:08.940> is

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
have been thinking balls but raising is

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.330 
have been thinking balls but raising is
a<00:00:09.090> technique<00:00:09.630> where<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.469> can<00:00:10.650> get<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:11.130> about

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a technique where you can get just about

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.190 
a technique where you can get just about
any<00:00:11.519> shape<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.030> want<00:00:12.059> first<00:00:12.840> we're<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
any shape you want first we're going to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.890 
any shape you want first we're going to
find<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> center<00:00:15.590> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.830> disk<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.750> have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
find the center of the disk so I have

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.130 
find the center of the disk so I have
four<00:00:22.230> arcs<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.500> end<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.980> square

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
four arcs and I end up with a square

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.550 
four arcs and I end up with a square
this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.099> high<00:00:29.310> school

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
this is just like in high school

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.420 
this is just like in high school
except<00:00:31.560> maybe<00:00:31.830> less<00:00:32.130> precise<00:00:34.130> now<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.280> going

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
except maybe less precise now I'm going

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.630 
except maybe less precise now I'm going
to<00:00:35.489> mark<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.940> center

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.830 

okay<00:00:39.640> now<00:00:39.790> that<00:00:39.850> mark<00:00:40.210> is<00:00:40.360> going<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.570> be<00:00:40.660> on<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
okay now that mark is going to be on the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
okay now that mark is going to be on the
bottom<00:00:41.020> of<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.440> ball<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:43.150> inner<00:00:43.360> circle<00:00:43.989> is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
bottom of the ball the inner circle is

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.250 
bottom of the ball the inner circle is
going<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.190> be<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.520> size<00:00:45.900> if<00:00:46.900> you're<00:00:47.050> going<00:00:47.170> to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
going to be the size if you're going to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.400 
going to be the size if you're going to
have<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.440> flat<00:00:47.800> bottom<00:00:48.570> it'll<00:00:49.570> be<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.900> same

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
have a flat bottom it'll be the same

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.260 
have a flat bottom it'll be the same
size<00:00:50.710> as<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.220> what<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:51.610> want<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.910> bottom<00:00:52.239> to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
size as that what you want the bottom to

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.329 
size as that what you want the bottom to
be<00:00:53.070> okay<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.430> then<00:00:55.269> we<00:00:55.420> just<00:00:55.629> need<00:00:55.930> one<00:00:56.230> or<00:00:57.129> two

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
be okay and then we just need one or two

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.070 
be okay and then we just need one or two
other<00:00:57.640> circles<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.980> a<00:01:00.670> line<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:01.600> tell<00:01:01.809> us<00:01:01.930> when

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
other circles and a line to tell us when

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.049 
other circles and a line to tell us when
we've<00:01:02.199> gone<00:01:02.379> all<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.710> way<00:01:02.739> around<00:01:03.040> now<00:01:03.309> before

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
we've gone all the way around now before

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.719 
we've gone all the way around now before
I<00:01:04.089> start<00:01:04.530> raising<00:01:05.530> I'm<00:01:06.009> just<00:01:06.220> going<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.400> sink

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
I start raising I'm just going to sink

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.219 
I start raising I'm just going to sink
it<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.940> little<00:01:07.180> bit<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:07.570> it's<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.780> same<00:01:07.990> thing

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
it a little bit so it's the same thing

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.899 
it a little bit so it's the same thing
you<00:01:08.350> did<00:01:08.500> before<00:01:08.650> except<00:01:09.220> with<00:01:09.369> just<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.670> few

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
you did before except with just a few

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.150 
you did before except with just a few
hammer<00:01:10.180> blows<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.899> I<00:01:11.470> just<00:01:11.710> want<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.920> get<00:01:12.039> it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
hammer blows and I just want to get it

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:31.889 
hammer blows and I just want to get it
started<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:29.759> okay<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:30.789> I<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.030> sunk<00:01:31.509> right<00:01:31.780> up

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
started so okay so I just sunk right up

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.109 
started so okay so I just sunk right up
to<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.050> line<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:33.310> where<00:01:33.460> we<00:01:33.580> were<00:01:33.700> thinking

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
to that line and where we were thinking

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.180 
to that line and where we were thinking
before<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.320> we<00:01:35.440> were<00:01:35.530> making<00:01:35.860> our<00:01:35.979> piece

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
before and we were making our piece

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.770 
before and we were making our piece
around<00:01:37.289> this<00:01:38.289> time<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.560> want<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:38.979> sides<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.580> be

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
around this time I want the sides to be

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.050 
around this time I want the sides to be
flat<00:01:40.780> flat<00:01:41.140> okay<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:41.979> I'm<00:01:42.220> just<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.610> just<00:01:42.640> sunk

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
flat flat okay so I'm just I just sunk

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.889 
flat flat okay so I'm just I just sunk
it<00:01:43.179> about<00:01:43.450> maybe<00:01:43.720> half<00:01:44.050> an<00:01:44.229> inch<00:01:44.700> okay<00:01:45.899> raising

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
it about maybe half an inch okay raising

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.139 
it about maybe half an inch okay raising
from<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.289> flat<00:01:47.560> sheet<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:48.099> really<00:01:48.459> difficult<00:01:48.670> so

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
from a flat sheet is really difficult so

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.380 
from a flat sheet is really difficult so
it<00:01:49.270> helps<00:01:49.569> to<00:01:49.599> just<00:01:49.750> get<00:01:50.349> it<00:01:50.470> started<00:01:51.390> elbows

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
it helps to just get it started elbows

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.870 
it helps to just get it started elbows
are<00:01:52.420> in<00:01:52.780> okay<00:01:53.739> you<00:01:54.280> want<00:01:54.489> to<00:01:54.610> get<00:01:54.729> into

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
are in okay you want to get into

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.719 
are in okay you want to get into
position<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:56.470> that<00:01:56.500> right<00:01:57.099> when<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.369> strike

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
position so that right when you strike

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.139 
position so that right when you strike
the<00:01:58.330> hammer<00:01:58.539> handle<00:01:58.959> is<00:01:59.800> parallel<00:02:00.550> with<00:02:00.819> the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
the hammer handle is parallel with the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.180 
the hammer handle is parallel with the
stake<00:02:01.959> it<00:02:02.200> doesn't<00:02:02.500> mean<00:02:02.590> it's<00:02:02.739> at<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.979> same

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
stake it doesn't mean it's at the same

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.430 
stake it doesn't mean it's at the same
level<00:02:03.550> that<00:02:03.580> would<00:02:03.819> be<00:02:03.910> like<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.270> your<00:02:05.259> hand

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
level that would be like this your hand

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.020 
level that would be like this your hand
is<00:02:05.560> up<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.770> lot<00:02:05.950> higher<00:02:06.190> than<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.550> stake<00:02:06.789> but

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
is up a lot higher than the stake but

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.809 
is up a lot higher than the stake but
this<00:02:07.239> is<00:02:07.539> parallel<00:02:07.959> with<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.520> okay<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:09.580> I

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
this is parallel with this okay so I

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.990 
this is parallel with this okay so I
want<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.569> edge<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.080> stake<00:02:12.000> right

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
want to get the edge of this stake right

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.290 
want to get the edge of this stake right
underneath<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.620> first<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.760> line<00:02:16.030> where

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
underneath that first the line where

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.390 
underneath that first the line where
that<00:02:16.330> first<00:02:16.599> circle<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.830> can't<00:02:18.130> see

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
that first circle is so I can't see

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.110 
that first circle is so I can't see
where<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.760> edge<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> stake<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.970> what

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
where the edge of the stake is so what

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.339 
where the edge of the stake is so what
I'm<00:02:22.209> going<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.420> do<00:02:22.569> is<00:02:22.720> I'm<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.020> use<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.130 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use the
top<00:02:23.590> edge<00:02:23.830> my<00:02:24.129> raising<00:02:24.700> hammer<00:02:24.940> I'll<00:02:25.900> put<00:02:26.050> it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
top edge my raising hammer I'll put it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.070 
top edge my raising hammer I'll put it
right<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.590> line<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:28.390> rock<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.870> piece

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
right on the line and I rock the piece

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.619 
right on the line and I rock the piece
back<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.620> forth<00:02:29.860> if<00:02:30.069> I'm<00:02:30.250> if<00:02:30.700> I'm<00:02:31.090> up<00:02:31.300> above

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
back and forth if I'm if I'm up above

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.839 
back and forth if I'm if I'm up above
the<00:02:31.810> edge<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.140> stake<00:02:32.489> pushes<00:02:33.489> down<00:02:33.640> like

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
the edge of the stake pushes down like

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.380 
the edge of the stake pushes down like
that<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.270> below<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.209> get

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
that if I'm below it I do this so I get

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.360 
that if I'm below it I do this so I get
it<00:02:37.510> right<00:02:37.690> on

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.430 

and<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:44.030> rocks<00:02:44.360> back<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.720> forth<00:02:44.959> really

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and it rocks back and forth really

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.059 
and it rocks back and forth really
easily<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:50.379> now<00:02:51.379> what<00:02:51.500> I'm<00:02:51.590> going<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.769> do<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:51.980> I

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
easily so now what I'm going to do is I

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.740 
easily so now what I'm going to do is I
move<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.430> hammer<00:02:52.640> up<00:02:52.910> about<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> quarter<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.690> an

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
move the hammer up about a quarter of an

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.820 
move the hammer up about a quarter of an
inch<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.849> do<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.000> really<00:02:59.380> I'm<00:03:00.380> going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.650> pass

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
inch and I do a really I'm going to pass

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.350 
inch and I do a really I'm going to pass
this<00:03:01.040> around<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.580> want<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.970> look<00:03:02.120> at<00:03:02.239> what

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
this around I want you to look at what

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.339 
this around I want you to look at what
happened<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:05.150> top<00:03:05.420> edge<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.959> hammer

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.470 

pushed<00:03:09.349> down<00:03:09.790> about<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.849> quarter<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.269> an<00:03:11.390> inch

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
pushed down about a quarter of an inch

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.710 
pushed down about a quarter of an inch
up<00:03:11.750> above<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:12.410> circle<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.360> edge<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
up above this circle and the edge of the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720 
up above this circle and the edge of the
stake<00:03:14.989> pushed<00:03:15.290> up<00:03:15.530> right<00:03:15.950> under<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.340> line

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
stake pushed up right under that line

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.880 
stake pushed up right under that line
okay<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.840> was<00:03:17.959> holding<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.440> at<00:03:18.560> about<00:03:18.680> a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
okay and I was holding it at about a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.160 
okay and I was holding it at about a
30-degree<00:03:19.400> angle<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:20.930> called

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
30-degree angle so this is called

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.870 
30-degree angle so this is called
setting<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.709> edge<00:03:21.890> okay<00:03:22.459> I'm<00:03:22.519> going<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.700> pass

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
setting the edge okay I'm going to pass

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.400 
setting the edge okay I'm going to pass
this<00:03:23.090> around<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.510> can<00:03:23.569> look<00:03:23.720> at<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.110> first

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
this around you can look at the first

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.160 
this around you can look at the first
hammer<00:03:25.400> ball<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.209> when<00:03:26.569> you're<00:03:26.720> setting<00:03:27.079> the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
hammer ball so when you're setting the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.900 
hammer ball so when you're setting the
edge<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.620> go<00:03:27.739> one<00:03:27.980> hammer<00:03:28.220> blow<00:03:28.519> at<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.700> time

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
edge you go one hammer blow at a time

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:49.059 
edge you go one hammer blow at a time
I'm<00:03:29.150> going<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.329> go<00:03:29.450> pretty<00:03:29.690> fast<00:03:47.170> there<00:03:48.170> I'll

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
I'm going to go pretty fast there I'll

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.000 
I'm going to go pretty fast there I'll
pass<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.579> around<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.410> next<00:03:51.620> time<00:03:51.859> around

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
pass that around so the next time around

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.009 
pass that around so the next time around
I<00:03:52.340> still<00:03:52.670> have<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.060> edge<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.510> dip<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.959> the

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
I still have the edge of the dip of the

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.809 
I still have the edge of the dip of the
stake<00:03:55.239> underneath<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.420> line<00:03:57.579> I'm<00:03:58.579> just

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
stake underneath that line I'm just

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:12.670 
stake underneath that line I'm just
hammering<00:03:59.180> up<00:03:59.389> a<00:03:59.540> little<00:03:59.720> further

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:25.280 

and<00:04:13.680> then<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:13.950> start<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:23.270> start<00:04:24.270> moving<00:04:24.930> back<00:04:24.960> I'm

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
and then I start I start moving back I'm

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.780 
and then I start I start moving back I'm
going<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.530> be<00:04:25.620> hammering<00:04:26.040> right<00:04:26.250> about<00:04:26.520> here

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
going to be hammering right about here

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.030 
going to be hammering right about here
from<00:04:27.000> now<00:04:27.150> on<00:04:27.350> what<00:04:28.350> I<00:04:28.380> was<00:04:28.530> setting<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.919> edge

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
from now on what I was setting the edge

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.760 
from now on what I was setting the edge
I<00:04:29.250> was<00:04:29.400> right<00:04:29.580> here<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.780> next<00:04:30.960> time<00:04:31.140> around<00:04:31.290> I

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
I was right here the next time around I

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230 
I was right here the next time around I
was<00:04:31.830> right<00:04:32.070> here<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.460> then<00:04:32.640> from<00:04:32.880> then<00:04:33.090> on

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
was right here and then from then on

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.909 
was right here and then from then on
you're<00:04:33.480> in<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.720> first<00:04:33.990> inch<00:04:34.290> of<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.650> steak

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
you're in the first inch of the steak

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.370 
you're in the first inch of the steak
and<00:04:35.130> instead<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.150> creeping<00:04:36.540> up<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.840> steak<00:04:37.110> as

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
and instead of creeping up the steak as

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.200 
and instead of creeping up the steak as
you<00:04:37.950> move<00:04:38.130> up<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.400> side<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.610> your<00:04:38.820> piece<00:04:39.000> your

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
you move up the side of your piece your

00:04:39.210 --> 00:05:01.820 
you move up the side of your piece your
piece<00:04:39.419> moves<00:04:39.720> back<00:04:59.600> okay<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.350> one

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
piece moves back okay so that is one

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.040 
piece moves back okay so that is one
course<00:05:02.669> of<00:05:02.820> raising<00:05:03.210> I've<00:05:03.330> got<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.540> little<00:05:03.870> bit

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
course of raising I've got a little bit

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:24.909 
course of raising I've got a little bit
extra<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.530> do<00:05:04.680> here<00:05:21.290> now<00:05:22.290> one<00:05:22.770> final<00:05:23.100> thing<00:05:23.550> is

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
extra to do here now one final thing is

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:35.840 
extra to do here now one final thing is
to<00:05:26.870> upset<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.020> edge<00:05:28.229> just<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.740> little<00:05:28.979> bit<00:05:34.850> you

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
to upset the edge just a little bit you

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.300 
to upset the edge just a little bit you
have<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.150> hammer<00:05:36.360> on<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.930> edge<00:05:37.110> otherwise<00:05:38.070> all

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
have to hammer on the edge otherwise all

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.070 
have to hammer on the edge otherwise all
that<00:05:38.490> stress<00:05:38.970> that<00:05:39.000> gets<00:05:39.360> put<00:05:39.570> in<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.810> metal

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
that stress that gets put in the metal

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.080 
that stress that gets put in the metal
relieves<00:05:40.380> itself<00:05:40.800> in<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.100> edge<00:05:41.280> as<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:41.880> raise

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
relieves itself in the edge as you raise
