00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.770
 With 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.080
 very beautiful 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.900
 i think important 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.020
 Assertiveness and you have the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.990
 make dog clearly what happens we must 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.790
 really does not have to lose him 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.670
 make clear announcements so that he exactly 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.020
 knows what to do now and then 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.090
 it only really drifted and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.410
 it will always have to be the same 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.300
 actually it was the order 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.250
 great but of course I believe factors 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.960
 as an audience and clear everything that 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.660
 sometimes probably complicated and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.660
 just different every day 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.650
 So extra sausage or tea sausage or 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.750
 salami actually do not matter the main thing you 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.170
 did you have something in hand and it is 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.170
 meat I like to work meat 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.600
 so focused on the right ones 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.600
 really only 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.209
 Eat food in the appropriate and there must 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.209
 you really take care a little 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.569
 you have to do the round a bit 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.000
 Get to know and see how they react 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.349
 and then pack them at the right moment 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.060
 to be able to do that for us too 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.819
 It is certain that they feel safe 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.819
 and that they stay calm
