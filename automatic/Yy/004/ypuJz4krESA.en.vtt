00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
will be done actually within the game

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.029 
will be done actually within the game
and<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.479> carrot<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> stick<00:02:07.500> again<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and that carrot on that stick again that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.070 
and that carrot on that stick again that
I<00:02:08.099> keep<00:02:08.280> bringing<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.179> will<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.690> return

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I keep bringing up it will really return

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.900 
I keep bringing up it will really return
now<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> also<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> coincide<00:02:11.879> with

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
now this is also going to coincide with

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.890 
now this is also going to coincide with
the<00:02:12.120> loot<00:02:12.330> 2.0

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
the loot 2.0

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.090 
the loot 2.0
which<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.500> don't<00:02:14.620> know<00:02:14.860> they're

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
which if you don't know they're

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.950 
which if you don't know they're
basically<00:02:15.460> changing<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.330> we're

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
basically changing it so that we're

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.780 
basically changing it so that we're
gonna<00:02:17.050> be<00:02:17.230> getting<00:02:17.319> less<00:02:17.650> loot<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.340> many<00:02:18.550> less

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
gonna be getting less loot so many less

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.130 
gonna be getting less loot so many less
drops<00:02:19.090> will<00:02:19.270> be<00:02:19.360> occurring<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.959> they're

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
drops will be occurring but they're

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.710 
drops will be occurring but they're
going<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.500> be<00:02:20.650> better<00:02:21.160> items<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.180> actually

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
going to be better items and actually

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.210 
going to be better items and actually
more<00:02:22.930> suited<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.380> your<00:02:23.650> character<00:02:24.069> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
more suited for your character so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.260 
more suited for your character so
whatever<00:02:24.459> character<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.880> happen<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.180> be

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
whatever character you happen to be

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.809 
whatever character you happen to be
playing<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.140> items<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.500> drop<00:02:26.830> will<00:02:27.220> have

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
playing on the items that drop will have

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.309 
playing on the items that drop will have
a<00:02:27.850> higher<00:02:28.180> likelihood<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.810> actually<00:02:29.050> being

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
a higher likelihood of actually being

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.980 
a higher likelihood of actually being
useful<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.670> opposed<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.540> utter

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
useful for you as opposed to just utter

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.870 
useful for you as opposed to just utter
garbage<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.650> again<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.040> would<00:02:33.190> turn<00:02:33.640> around

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
garbage that again you would turn around

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.250 
garbage that again you would turn around
and<00:02:34.090> sell<00:02:34.240> on<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.420> auction<00:02:34.450> house<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.110> get

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
and sell on the auction house to get

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260 
and sell on the auction house to get
something<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.800> actually<00:02:35.920> want<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.610> this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
something that you actually want so this

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.350 
something that you actually want so this
is<00:02:37.450> quite<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.870> big<00:02:38.290> change<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.030> again<00:02:40.030> part<00:02:40.330> of

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
is quite a big change and again part of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.520 
is quite a big change and again part of
the<00:02:40.480> reason<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.930> think<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.260> stopped

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the reason that I think I stopped

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.380 
the reason that I think I stopped
playing<00:02:41.770> diablo<00:02:42.160> 3<00:02:42.430> was<00:02:42.459> because<00:02:42.910> while<00:02:43.239> the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
playing diablo 3 was because while the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.540 
playing diablo 3 was because while the
gameplay<00:02:43.810> mechanics<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.430> know

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
gameplay mechanics and you know

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.190 
gameplay mechanics and you know
everything<00:02:45.880> about<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.180> game<00:02:46.360> was<00:02:46.510> sound<00:02:46.870> in

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
everything about the game was sound in

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.340 
everything about the game was sound in
that<00:02:47.800> portion<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.700> things<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.660> desire<00:02:50.050> to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
that portion of things the desire to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.590 
that portion of things the desire to
grind<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:50.890> lutes<00:02:51.100> just<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.940> was<00:02:52.120> killed<00:02:52.390> by

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
grind for lutes just it was killed by

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.020 
grind for lutes just it was killed by
the<00:02:52.660> auction<00:02:53.080> house<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.920> did<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.340> want<00:02:54.940> to

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
the auction house it's I did not want to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.670 
the auction house it's I did not want to
do<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.300> because<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.720> knew<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.019> wasn't<00:02:56.410> gonna<00:02:56.590> be

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
do it because I knew I wasn't gonna be

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.930 
do it because I knew I wasn't gonna be
getting<00:02:56.950> anything<00:02:57.130> good<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.640> I'd<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.910> to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
getting anything good and I'd have to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.430 
getting anything good and I'd have to
sell<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.080> try<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.260> buy

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
sell it and I have to try to buy

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.990 
sell it and I have to try to buy
something<00:02:59.769> but<00:03:00.100> what<00:03:00.190> if<00:03:00.340> prices<00:03:00.610> are<00:03:00.790> marked

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
something but what if prices are marked

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000 
something but what if prices are marked
up<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:01.450> wasn't<00:03:01.810> fun<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.140> wasn't<00:03:02.470> what<00:03:02.980> I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
up it just wasn't fun it wasn't what I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.850 
up it just wasn't fun it wasn't what I
was<00:03:03.190> looking<00:03:03.610> for<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.630> game<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.260> this

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
was looking for in that game and this

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.490 
was looking for in that game and this
change<00:03:06.220> could<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.150> what<00:03:07.390> brings<00:03:07.690> myself<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.440> I
