00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 in which such friends of youtube x friend of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.639
 bnf 98 commented another video and then they 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 I bring a tutorial on how to enter your 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.450
 secret room to your not be your house 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.859
 whatever through a portal to the entity 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.020
 this this has its disadvantages and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.270
 advantages the disadvantages since the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.010
 portal the entity is down in the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.320
 most times but with a peak it 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930
 can break these if I'm not wrong and what 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880
 propose our case now good those 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.190
 are these advantages the advantages are of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.420
 which is totally undetectable and this 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.399
 lowered is totally undetectable and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.800
 We can put anything under 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 He is good first, because it is a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 portal in normal as all as you see 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.430
 here he directs me to read with him in the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 dragon and everything but I do not want that in the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 point is that if it is a portal to the entity 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.970
 as good to say so 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.579
 this then this to enter our 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.040
 secret room is everything we need 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.320
 a pig a saddle is another of 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.810
 the disadvantages a pig a chair of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.970
 ride and water or anything else that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.340
 push an animal in my case I'll 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 to be using a good pig we're going to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.970
 put the pig the pig let's have a 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.650
 the pair of this this is the bad thing about this 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.780
 room is that it requires a lot 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.400
 effort to overtake once then 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 we open the chest oh well we take out 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 our saddle and we're going to 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.369
 put the pig once put in the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.000
 We are going to take out the pig 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.970
 we ride on it and then we're going to press 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.610
 this little button that is here 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.220
 let's ride them in the pig again and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.060
 that salt come out the pig let's leave 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.130
 to leave 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.950
 this has gone out and the water simply 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 he's going to push him little by little he's going to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.789
 want to leave and in fact you get to 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.899
 climb up here on these railings that I put 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.270
 but once it falls down as you see we are going to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.950
 be in our secret room 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.320
 this is how we cross the portal link 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.630
 without teleporting and here we can 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.740
 put what we like the win and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 be chests with our power 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.349
 get us with our materials 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.600
 valuable we can put this tools 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.760
 this as if you are food armor 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.440
 we can put what we want in fact 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.319
 it can be our house below this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.750
 but the bad thing is to have the pig then low 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.450
 control and always keep them close to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.099
 when we want to enter this system of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.420
 work and if they jump they will have 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.360
 transport so it's not very 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.940
 recommendable is jumping and good and the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.230
 only exit would be a secret door or 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.720
 something like that in my case I did 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.599
 a secret door that pressed this button 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.519
 and as you can see he managed to leave and it is a 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.700
 like a hidden door behind this one 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.650
 as a temple that was here 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.239
 this can not necessarily put a 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.069
 temple, I did it to make it look 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.739
 a little better can you put any 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.379
 thing what they please and well 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.170
 more than everything they need then a 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.480
 pig a saddle try not to 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.420
 kill the pig so they can enter 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.870
 Sometimes they want a pig a chair 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.280
 to mount this and water something that gives them 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.160
 current for example, what I did was 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.260
 that with this button is activated a 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.180
 redd mechanism are what is already going to this 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.160
 dispenser this dispenser has a 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.290
 bucket with water and if we lose the bucket with 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.209
 water will release the water as 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.069
 caraotas if we press the button goes to 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.440
 jump the water and if we return it to 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.030
 squeeze is going to grab it so it's like that 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.660
 of always gentlemen we only need one 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.280
 running a pig and what would be a 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.440
 saddle and the portal leander that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.880
 is the most valuable but good can 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.620
 do anything they can let fly 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.750
 your imagination the way you guys 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.430
 They want because I know it will cost a lot 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.950
 survival but creative everything is 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.200
 can achieve and well then there 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.819
 impress your friends you know they have 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.960
 its super secret bases without anyone 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.030
 you see them 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.130
 that was it for this video so 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.890
 good friends was not making videos 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.340
 because lately been ill is not 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.680
 Well I have not been to my house so much 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.750
 I know it's just costing me a little 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.030
 more make videos because that's why 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.340
 be sick and because I do not know just 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.280
 I do not have much time now with the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.140
 tasks that leave me and everything is so what 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.460
 I feel for that but try to do what 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.320
 more than I can so good gentlemen
