00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.169
 today I have a video that is 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.590
 very very exciting for me so 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:12.470
 next one of my favorite products 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.740
 of all time and this first 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.990
 'break' by bobby braun joke 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.230
 grand prix de bobby braun are 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.380
 basically this is dust lines 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.720
 Compact that are of various colors are 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.759
 lines of various colors and basically 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.039
 are shiny is one of the products 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:35.480
 that are a bit more expensive in fact this 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.879
 Compact costs 650 pesos and serves to 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.340
 many things and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.140
 show how it is that I use it a lot 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.329
 people do not like them because they say 'the and it's 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.699
 very shiny and blah blah being 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.210
 honest I think 90% of Latinas 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.239
 we love that shiny skin and call 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.519
 the attention that I'm going to show you but 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.769
 not only that, I started to investigate 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.710
 where in the center of Guadalajara could 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.140
 find milani products and I stumbled 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.629
 with 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.690
 this is a product of Milan and that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.850
 call climate stripes then what 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.850
 I'm going to do is I'm going to put to the test 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.680
 these two products and I will use the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.000
 half on one side of my face the other 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.300
 half in the other now my face and 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.119
 you will be the judges I will not leave you 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.460
 in the information bar the address 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.560
 Exactly where can you find the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.080
 store is first of all good the one of 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.530
 bobby braun has 10 point 3 grams and the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.680
 from Milan and it has 12.8 grams so 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.960
 we have more on this side and something very 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.390
 important is the smell I love the smell 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.680
 Bobby Braun's is like dust 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.520
 mixed with bronzer with is not is not 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.320
 an ugly chemical smell and that of Milan and the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.690
 of Milan and that itself is a huge problem 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.479
 but I fly all the products smell 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.700
 much much to talc smells a lot like talc 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.429
 too much but let's try it does not open 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.820
 one of the places where I love 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.000
 apply my always is on the cheeks to 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.970
 it fascinates me 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.620
 use it as a blush because it gives me 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.460
 that luminous finish very well I'm going to 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.460
 clean my brush 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.170
 and now the beauty is the subtlety of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.579
 color then I will take the one of milan and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.969
 that I have not tried is the first time 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.969
 I tried it 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.280
 it seems pretty 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.340
 if I do not bring suntan lotion in the bag and 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.880
 I only bring this I take the line more 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.880
 dark 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:53.659
 and he used it as my outline as color 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.659
 it's the most dark coffee 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.540
 ah 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.110
 the cheekbone what I do is that with my finger 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.090
 I take the clearest line 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.560
 I put my cheekbone and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.560
 I blurred it with my fingers 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.050
 let's do the same with the one of Milan and 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.769
 Normally it illuminated the rest of the face 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.769
 as 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.720
 but take it enlightening 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.560
 and I put it on the brow bone 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.560
 milani 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.380
 people is to take the color that goes with my 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.090
 little finger 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:09.920
 which is like this golden rose 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.920
 and I put it in my lacrimal 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 in the part of the outer corner of 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.440
 eye the golden color that is here in the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.440
 center and the color below 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.069
 and I put it on my eyelid 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.830
 I had not noticed a color difference 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.479
 until now that of bobby braun la 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.680
 mixture of these two colors remains as 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:38.720
 more golden terracotta and this one is more 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.289
 as naranjita 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.379
 and finally 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.529
 I take with my little finger the last 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.869
 color the darker one and I put it in the 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:53.469
 eye socket and the outer side I'm going to 

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:55.360
 put on some lipstick and mascara and it's 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:58.449
 direct pines let's talk about the result 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.520
 final something what I can not talk about is 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.939
 the duration because it's the first time 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.180
 I use this weather straits then I can not 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.379
 I can talk about that anyway 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.779
 some information in some video 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.180
 future and after I use this more 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.999
 but bobby braun I know it lasts all 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.699
 all day or all night are powders 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:20.619
 truly long-lasting that if 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.180
 if you go fading but already after 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:23.979
 of many hours you had to have it 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.629
 used as 10-12 hours to be 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.580
 go fading when it goes 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.979
 fading away is not fading away 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.719
 as all powders with brightness that 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.629
 the color goes but the brightness is not 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.999
 fades everything uniform you do not see powders 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.430
 or that it's something that I was afraid of because 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:42.369
 I smelled too talcum, I said there, I hope 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.159
 that does not look like the dust has not 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:47.260
 sitting on the skin unlike that 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:50.590
 powder is very very soft 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:55.420
 I really like that I can do this 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:58.450
 they know and it 's very very smooth in conclusion 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.990
 I think this is an alternative 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:06.720
 excellent excellent excellent asymmetric 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:09.270
 from bobby braun is more product yes but 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.680
 it's like hard to say by the 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.830
 price so fired but still the 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.070
 first first use especially since already 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.220
 I have used this product for many years 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.860
 preferring bobby braun sinaproc 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.870
 because I do not know, I do not know what the 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.200
 duration on the skin of the de milÃ¡n and 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.660
 I also do not know what the long duration is 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.250
 term although this was not a copy of the 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.950
 from bobby braun even if it was a 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.890
 alternative this product alone is 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.170
 very good because you are saving in the 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:47.310
 fact that you can use the same 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:51.240
 powder for eyes cheeks illuminate 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.580
 etcetera then on if the concept of 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.720
 these products is good 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.259
 tim de milan and is equally radiant but 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:05.219
 It does have bits of glitter is 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:07.740
 he got to perceive just like exactly 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:09.780
 where is the glitter in the camera 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.060
 I think you can not see but here 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.340
 live I can see through the eyes I see 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.560
 where is the glitter if there are micro 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.530
 micro particles of glitter in the of 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.569
 brawn not then those 650 pesos 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.060
 I see them reflected in this product by 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:25.349
 that bought it back and that's why 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.009
 I would buy again with my eyes closed 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:30.990
 does not cover the pores has low levels of 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:36.449
 talc and mica that that's that is 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:38.939
 always good and this and I love no 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:41.430
 this on the other hand if they have more talc 

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:43.529
 However, I do not know if I'm going to cover 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.930
 pores things of that style then 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:47.939
 When I know more I tell them very 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.270
 probably yes because he has a lot 

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:53.009
 a lot of talcum I say that's the thing 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:58.069
 we can have all this is all for me 

00:07:53.009 --> 00:08:00.539
 part happy holidays take care 

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:02.759
 be very responsible I know that right now 

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:04.620
 I'm like mom but what we love most 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:05.849
 on this vacation is to return healthy and 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.439
 saved to all the activities that 

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:11.569
 we have to do the same next 

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:11.569
 video and I send them a super kiss
