00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.530 
looks and people make it look easy and
so<00:02:24.709> what<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.100> did<00:02:25.220> first<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.030> studied<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so what I did first is I studied a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.150 
so what I did first is I studied a
number<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.959> patterns<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.650> thinking<00:02:27.980> what's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
number of patterns and thinking what's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.740 
number of patterns and thinking what's
going<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.520> most<00:02:28.550> appropriate<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.450> what<00:02:29.540> do

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
going to be most appropriate and what do

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.650 
going to be most appropriate and what do
I<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.580> drew<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.030> out<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
I like and then I drew it out and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.850 
I like and then I drew it out and
repetition<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> key<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.260> knowledge<00:02:36.410> in

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
repetition is a key to knowledge in

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.280 
repetition is a key to knowledge in
anything<00:02:37.250> learn<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> Quran<00:02:38.420> repetition<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
anything learn the Quran repetition is a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.650 
anything learn the Quran repetition is a
key<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.590> knowledge<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.580> if<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.850> if<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.330> do<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
key to knowledge so if you if you do it

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.750 
key to knowledge so if you if you do it
first<00:02:41.989> then<00:02:42.799> when<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.040> come<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.430> hear<00:02:43.610> you're

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
first then when you come to hear you're

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.460 
first then when you come to hear you're
repeating<00:02:44.390> something<00:02:44.690> you've<00:02:44.959> already<00:02:45.320> done

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
repeating something you've already done

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.320 
repeating something you've already done
so<00:02:46.070> I'm<00:02:46.160> not<00:02:46.340> having<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.760> come<00:02:46.910> here<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.239> this

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so I'm not having to come here and this

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.390 
so I'm not having to come here and this
is<00:02:47.390> all<00:02:47.660> completely<00:02:48.080> new<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.590> know<00:02:48.739> before<00:02:49.370> I

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
is all completely new so I know before I

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.539 
is all completely new so I know before I
get<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.940> my<00:02:50.120> model<00:02:50.890> how<00:02:51.890> i'm<00:02:52.100> going<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.370> divide

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
get to my model how i'm going to divide

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.430 
get to my model how i'm going to divide
the<00:02:52.910> hand<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.299> how<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.570> sections<00:02:54.140> are<00:02:54.290> going

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the hand up how the sections are going

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.140 
the hand up how the sections are going
to<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.650> divided<00:02:55.190> otherwise<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:56.000> would<00:02:56.120> just

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
to get divided otherwise it would just

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.030 
to get divided otherwise it would just
take<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.510> lot<00:02:56.750> longer<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.080> would<00:02:57.260> be<00:02:57.380> able<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.860> do

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
take a lot longer I would be able to do

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.740 
take a lot longer I would be able to do
it<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:58.850> more<00:02:59.060> likely<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.420> make<00:02:59.720> mistakes

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
it but I'm more likely to make mistakes

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.530 
it but I'm more likely to make mistakes
if<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.799> go<00:03:01.040> straight<00:03:01.340> onto<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.760> hand<00:03:01.970> and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
if I just go straight onto the hand and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.300 
if I just go straight onto the hand and
this<00:03:02.660> is<00:03:02.810> one<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.140> things<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.530> budding

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
this is one of the things that budding

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.850 
this is one of the things that budding
artists<00:03:05.030> young<00:03:05.480> artists<00:03:06.080> need<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.440> realize
