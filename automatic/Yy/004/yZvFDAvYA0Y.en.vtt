front uprights the steering knuckles

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.619 
front uprights the steering knuckles
attaching<00:00:37.380> those<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> arms<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.629> then

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
attaching those to the arms and then

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.010 
attaching those to the arms and then
doing<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.329> front<00:00:42.329> shock<00:00:42.510> tower<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
doing the front shock tower and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.959 
doing the front shock tower and
attaching<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.219> putting<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
front suspension arms on and there we go

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.410 
front suspension arms on and there we go
that's<00:00:50.640> what<00:00:50.820> we've<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.180> far<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.239> far

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that's what we've got so far this so far

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
that's what we've got so far this so far
it's<00:00:54.570> gone<00:00:55.230> fairly<00:00:55.949> well<00:00:57.109> and<00:01:00.109> there's<00:01:01.109> only

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it's gone fairly well and there's only

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
it's gone fairly well and there's only
been<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.010> couple<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.760> niggles<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
been a couple little niggles here and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.149 
been a couple little niggles here and
there<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.769> first<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.570> installing<00:01:06.570> these

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
there the first one was installing these

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.170 
there the first one was installing these
ball<00:01:08.159> ends<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.510> provided<00:01:10.850> plastic

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.480 

wrench<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.049> did<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.619> some<00:01:16.890> doubts<00:01:17.310> about

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
wrench that I did have some doubts about

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.420 
wrench that I did have some doubts about
in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> last<00:01:17.790> video<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.689> remember<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
in the last video if you remember so I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
in the last video if you remember so I
did<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.450> did<00:01:21.600> strip<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.500> did

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
did have to it did strip out and I did

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.289 
did have to it did strip out and I did
have<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> wrench<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.060> so

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
have to use a wrench to put that in so

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
have to use a wrench to put that in so
there's<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.630> scratch<00:01:25.049> marks<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
there's little scratch marks on the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.929 
there's little scratch marks on the
fiberglass<00:01:26.100> no<00:01:26.700> big<00:01:26.880> deal<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:29.159> next<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.759> was

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
fiberglass no big deal the next one was

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.819 
fiberglass no big deal the next one was
a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.329> bit<00:01:30.450> bigger<00:01:30.600> deal<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
a little bit bigger deal because the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
a little bit bigger deal because the
hinge<00:01:32.100> pin<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.150> believe<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.780> right

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
hinge pin and I believe it was the right

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.980 
hinge pin and I believe it was the right
side<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.579> very<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.420> difficult<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
side up right was very very difficult to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.490 
side up right was very very difficult to
get<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.119> there's<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.500> well

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
get in there so you see there's not well

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.730 
get in there so you see there's not well
there's<00:01:40.829> no<00:01:40.979> slop<00:01:41.630> there<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:42.869> kind

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
there's no slop there that should kind

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
there's no slop there that should kind
of<00:01:43.920> flop<00:01:44.189> around<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> modern

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
of flop around if this was a modern

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.359 
of flop around if this was a modern
buggy<00:01:45.899> definitely<00:01:46.890> there'd<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.310> more

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
buggy definitely there'd be a lot more

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580 
buggy definitely there'd be a lot more
slop<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.630> slop<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.530> know

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
slop in there not slop but you know

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.960 
slop in there not slop but you know
freedom<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.130> movement<00:01:50.780> obviously<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
freedom of movement obviously the the

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.289 
freedom of movement obviously the the
arms<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.119> heavy<00:01:54.270> enough<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:55.049> fluff<00:01:55.890> about<00:01:56.299> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
arms are heavy enough to fluff about so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.929 
arms are heavy enough to fluff about so
it's<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.600> fine<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.310> bottom<00:01:59.640> with

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it's all fine and it's the bottom with

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.130 
it's all fine and it's the bottom with
the<00:01:59.969> gold<00:02:00.600> screws<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> gold<00:02:01.530> tub<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:03.140> so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the gold screws in the gold tub and so

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.760 
the gold screws in the gold tub and so
that's<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.100> next<00:02:05.490> we'll<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.790> bags<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:07.049> sorry

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that's it next we'll have bags be sorry

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.240 
that's it next we'll have bags be sorry
