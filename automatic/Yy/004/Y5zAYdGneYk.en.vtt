00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.450
 well, liberal western civilization we 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:11.010
 then we will talk about especially but for now let's say 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.790
 the fact that according to the official data of their science for 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.279
 a hundred years the average englishman 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.199
 lost somewhere around five in a dream points 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.810
 aykyu 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.199
 IQ notorious what 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.900
 it means it answers the question 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 why did the Bologna process of the axis and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.440
 the testing system they arose because 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 that new generations were not in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.670
 able to master and study programs 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.460
 who were quite lifting for their 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.920
 grandparents 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:52.020
 while Western societies are polarized 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.340
 most are able to just press 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.350
 buttons in the computer program menu 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.870
 very limited minority in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
 able to do 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.960
 hi-tech well which is basically in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.390
 able to be controlled even a monkey 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.360
 since it all comes down to election items 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.890
 menu and then everything else is done in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.640
 automatic mode ie it is 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.159
 civilization is clearly degrading despite 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.040
 scientific and technological progress because 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.799
 it's all over 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 inevitably so that someone chose the wrong one 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.040
 item in the menu in the program was some 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.860
 glitch or there was a glitch or some genius 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.409
 created a computer virus that penetrated 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.140
 Wednesday as a result of automatics 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.259
 did not work as it should 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.259
 perspectives of this society even in 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.040
 the absence of man-made disasters described 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.890
 Stanislav holes in stellar diaries and 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.909
 he and the quiet journey in my 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.490
 from 6 and on the planet in death of which 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.010
 have given all power over themselves computer 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.060
 the car that decided to hover 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.640
 order on the planet is hampered by idiots 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.400
 therefore they are subject to complete and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.120
 unconditional destruction this is what 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.390
 principle should understand those who 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.970
 lust on the topic go west and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.540
 take place there as a full 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.540
 human
