waste to be dropped off is put through
that<00:04:48.780> grinder<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.650> comes<00:04:49.860> over<00:04:50.039> here<00:04:50.160> and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
that grinder it comes over here and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.089 
that grinder it comes over here and
explain<00:04:51.210> this<00:04:51.389> process<00:04:51.870> well<00:04:52.680> after<00:04:52.979> it's

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
explain this process well after it's

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.650 
explain this process well after it's
gone<00:04:53.130> through<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.520> grinding<00:04:54.000> process<00:04:54.150> we

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
gone through the grinding process we

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.980 
gone through the grinding process we
take<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.289> 657<00:04:56.220> East<00:04:56.460> scrapers<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.330> we<00:04:57.720> build

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
take the 657 East scrapers and we build

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.750 
take the 657 East scrapers and we build
these<00:04:58.200> wind<00:04:58.470> rows<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.950> they<00:04:59.190> range<00:04:59.520> anywhere

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
these wind rows and they range anywhere

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.940 
these wind rows and they range anywhere
from<00:05:00.030> seven<00:05:00.599> to<00:05:00.630> nine<00:05:00.750> hundred<00:05:00.960> cubic<00:05:01.650> yards

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
from seven to nine hundred cubic yards

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.550 
from seven to nine hundred cubic yards
of<00:05:02.070> piece<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.880> takes<00:05:03.090> fifteen<00:05:03.780> days<00:05:04.110> to

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
of piece and it takes fifteen days to

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.860 
of piece and it takes fifteen days to
process<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:05.250> with<00:05:05.430> our<00:05:05.580> thermophilic<00:05:06.150> cell

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
process it with our thermophilic cell

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.159 
process it with our thermophilic cell
that<00:05:07.139> we<00:05:07.229> work<00:05:07.470> with<00:05:07.760> 130<00:05:08.760> degrees<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.360> 160

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
that we work with 130 degrees to 160

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.190 
that we work with 130 degrees to 160
degrees<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:11.220> cook<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.639> mulch<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.419> that's

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
degrees to cook the mulch and that's

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.050 
degrees to cook the mulch and that's
about<00:05:13.349> how<00:05:13.500> long<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.950> takes<00:05:14.160> for<00:05:14.340> mulch<00:05:14.550> now<00:05:14.940> if

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
about how long it takes for mulch now if

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.820 
about how long it takes for mulch now if
we're<00:05:15.180> gonna<00:05:15.300> do<00:05:15.479> compost<00:05:16.080> we<00:05:16.500> add<00:05:16.650> an

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
we're gonna do compost we add an

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.339 
we're gonna do compost we add an
additional<00:05:17.310> 60<00:05:17.729> days<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.840> breaks<00:05:19.169> the

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
additional 60 days and that breaks the

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:20.810 
additional 60 days and that breaks the
process<00:05:19.770> there<00:05:19.979> so<00:05:20.099> it's<00:05:20.250> sort<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.490> like<00:05:20.580> home

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
process there so it's sort of like home

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.029 
process there so it's sort of like home
composting<00:05:21.330> but<00:05:21.690> speed<00:05:22.139> it<00:05:22.229> up<00:05:22.349> incredibly

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
composting but speed it up incredibly

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.580 
composting but speed it up incredibly
fast<00:05:23.610> because<00:05:24.090> now<00:05:24.599> you're<00:05:24.810> turning<00:05:25.260> this<00:05:25.380> how

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
fast because now you're turning this how

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.610 
fast because now you're turning this how
often<00:05:26.099> we<00:05:26.700> turn<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.090> every<00:05:27.510> three<00:05:27.780> days<00:05:27.960> we

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
often we turn it every three days we

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.500 
often we turn it every three days we
water<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.070> every<00:05:29.280> day<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.300> take

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
water it every day and we take

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.270 
water it every day and we take
temperatures<00:05:31.050> on<00:05:31.229> it<00:05:31.380> every<00:05:31.740> day<00:05:31.770> right

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
temperatures on it every day right

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.620 
temperatures on it every day right
because<00:05:32.460> temperature<00:05:32.880> is<00:05:32.910> really<00:05:33.270> important

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
because temperature is really important

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.180 
because temperature is really important
because<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:34.020> kills<00:05:34.260> off<00:05:34.440> all<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.830> bad<00:05:35.010> stuff

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
because that kills off all the bad stuff

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.580 
because that kills off all the bad stuff
that's<00:05:35.610> correct<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.180> now<00:05:36.690> Dana<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.229> mulcher

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
that's correct you now Dana the mulcher

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.689 
that's correct you now Dana the mulcher
we're<00:05:37.770> just<00:05:37.919> looking<00:05:38.220> at<00:05:38.340> that's<00:05:38.520> what

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
we're just looking at that's what

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.120 
we're just looking at that's what
landscapers<00:05:39.389> used<00:05:39.570> on<00:05:39.780> top<00:05:40.020> of<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.320> soil<00:05:40.590> but

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
landscapers used on top of the soil but

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.740 
landscapers used on top of the soil but
I've<00:05:41.250> noticed<00:05:41.430> that<00:05:41.610> this<00:05:41.789> is<00:05:42.030> compost<00:05:42.599> now

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
I've noticed that this is compost now

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.930 
I've noticed that this is compost now
how<00:05:42.900> do<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:43.110> get<00:05:43.229> from<00:05:43.260> there<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.740> here<00:05:44.070> well

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
how do you get from there to here well

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.580 
how do you get from there to here well
the<00:05:45.180> process<00:05:45.389> that<00:05:45.750> we<00:05:45.900> use<00:05:45.930> is<00:05:46.260> in<00:05:46.440> this

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
the process that we use is in this

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.440 
the process that we use is in this
trommel<00:05:47.099> screen<00:05:47.400> here<00:05:47.700> right<00:05:48.120> that's<00:05:48.300> this

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
trommel screen here right that's this

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.029 
trommel screen here right that's this
big<00:05:48.719> machine<00:05:48.870> here<00:05:49.320> this<00:05:49.500> is<00:05:49.620> a<00:05:49.710> big<00:05:49.830> green

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
big machine here this is a big green

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.219 
big machine here this is a big green
machine<00:05:50.190> here<00:05:50.700> and<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:51.240> takes<00:05:51.390> that<00:05:51.659> material

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
machine here and it takes that material

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.040 
machine here and it takes that material
that<00:05:52.380> we<00:05:52.500> usually<00:05:52.680> make

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
that we usually make

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.020 
that we usually make
that<00:05:53.199> three<00:05:53.530> to<00:05:53.650> five<00:05:53.889> inch<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:54.430> we<00:05:54.520> process

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
that three to five inch and we process

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.909 
that three to five inch and we process
it<00:05:55.180> down<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.509> a<00:05:55.539> half<00:05:55.840> inch<00:05:56.050> product<00:05:56.710> it's

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
it down to a half inch product it's

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.499 
it down to a half inch product it's
basically<00:05:57.250> just<00:05:57.340> chomps<00:05:57.970> it<00:05:58.060> down<00:05:58.210> smaller

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
basically just chomps it down smaller

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.110 
basically just chomps it down smaller
correct<00:05:59.020> and<00:05:59.620> this<00:06:00.280> is<00:06:00.490> more<00:06:00.699> of<00:06:00.789> a<00:06:00.879> soil

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
correct and this is more of a soil

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.140 
correct and this is more of a soil
amendment<00:06:01.360> not<00:06:02.110> so<00:06:02.379> much<00:06:02.590> a<00:06:02.909> this<00:06:03.909> is<00:06:04.030> the

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
amendment not so much a this is the

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.760 
amendment not so much a this is the
stuff<00:06:04.389> that<00:06:04.419> you<00:06:04.720> mix<00:06:05.080> in<00:06:05.229> with<00:06:05.319> your<00:06:05.470> so<00:06:05.620> when

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
stuff that you mix in with your so when

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.379 
stuff that you mix in with your so when
you're<00:06:05.919> planting<00:06:06.129> that's<00:06:06.490> just<00:06:06.669> gold<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.240> make

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
you're planting that's just gold to make

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:08.520 
you're planting that's just gold to make
plants<00:06:07.720> grow<00:06:07.750> correct

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
plants grow correct

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.200 
plants grow correct
right<00:06:08.680> now<00:06:09.039> I've<00:06:09.280> know<00:06:09.490> some<00:06:09.819> people<00:06:10.000> have

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
right now I've know some people have

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.960 
right now I've know some people have
concerns<00:06:10.690> over<00:06:11.050> the<00:06:12.039> the<00:06:12.340> mulch<00:06:12.550> here<00:06:12.789> at<00:06:12.879> the

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
concerns over the the mulch here at the

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.850 
concerns over the the mulch here at the
