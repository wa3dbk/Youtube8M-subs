00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.010
 hi be duke now very little is missing 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.070
 to the release of the patch and 1.4 that 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.840
 will be on the 24th probably maybe 25 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.879
 and then a pre 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 release of this patch the news not 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.509
 they are very few indeed even 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.820
 because the pre releases seemed 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.189
 primarily to test how the will be 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.269
 definitive release of peace and not for 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.919
 add new things 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.140
 but let's go and see those ones anyway 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.269
 few things that have changed has been 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 removed the maximum limit that levels 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.110
 therefore expendable for example Mr. 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.030
 I omit this sword that already has between 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.980
 high level spells with another 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
 sword with level spells 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 high first as you will remember from the videos 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.270
 on the past snapshots did not allow me 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.000
 to perform this repair because the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.000
 level was too high now only in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.200
 creative you can make anyway 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.730
 this will repair this to you 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.270
 let's say assembly and then it was 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.770
 removed only in creative the limit 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.840
 spells 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.090
 also sounds have been added to a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.720
 you have already heard it but hear it again 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.100
 better as how to this sound I have to 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.920
 first damage this wooden sword 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.680
 and then I try to fix it but I need a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.680
 some wood to fix it here 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.220
 put a sword and at the first slot the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.240
 selenium and after clicking here 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.070
 we will hear a new sound is a bit strange 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.930
 feel I'm not so metallic 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.210
 associated with the preparation of a 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.920
 wooden object but obviously not 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.780
 change cannot change only for 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.520
 every object we repair and therefore 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.650
 sound is unique whether we repair objects 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.380
 metal sek we report wooden objects 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.360
 it is not very serious, it is still good this way 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.430
 this is not the only new sound 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.780
 another dream the one attributed i 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:01.600
 bats 1 squeak is nothing 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.240
 however, it is still a pleasure that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.300
 every hollywood animal has his 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 sound also in the winter was given a 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.510
 new sound or better to say 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:18.340
 commissioner aliano scherb I was now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.330
 I create it and after that it will be regenerated 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.330
 we will hear a sound 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.980
 a sound effect of 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.010
 wings flap 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.910
 it seems to me well done, it is also a kind 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.709
 roar that is not bad maybe it could 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.970
 be stronger for services but windy 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.970
 but still they are all sound effects 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.970
 pleasant 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.750
 these to the sound of when the dragon died 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.260
 and then it wasn't there before 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.450
 also added this completes the well 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 battle even if this time too 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.740
 I wanted but what and maybe a 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.840
 a little more incisive something that 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.360
 make him happy to have 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.030
 defeated the final boss of the game 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.500
 the latest addition to this pre release 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.210
 it's about multiplayer 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 now when our screen where 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.280
 we have saved all our servers 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.800
 we find the server version written 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.120
 if this does not correspond to that 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.900
 that we have installed new singles 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.510
 player 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.000
 in this way we know if we can 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.140
 enter that server directly or if 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.470
 we have to go and change ours 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.330
 version to be able to return were 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.190
 reported bugs for this pre release 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.930
 but by doing some text I have 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.890
 the impression that it is not true that they are 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.380
 present those bugs 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.270
 let's try together the first reported was 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.190
 that now the zombies are no longer able to 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.150
 break the doors to go to attack 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.980
 the villagers 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.620
 so let's do a net test with a 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.660
 nice little town and see if the zoom succeeds 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.510
 to break the door the lines of 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.330
 fracture on the wood so it seems to me 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.110
 just that we're doing it and see 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.850
 if it succeeds in breaking it sila breaks and goes to 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.680
 attach everything to our village 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.050
 normal or like the doubt that someone 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.510
 which approved if it is forgotten 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.370
 change the difficulty because the zombies 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.230
 they break the doors only in difficulty 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.020
 difficult so maybe if someone 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.310
 had left peaceful easy had 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.770
 the impression that there was this bug 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.650
 that instead the non-existence therefore sometimes 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.330
 it also happens that fashion does not do 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.200
 a correct job and come to him 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.910
 however, bugs are attributed to another bug 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.190
 which has been reported is the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.500
 command malfunction 6 the single 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.960
 player which is a command you need 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.990
 simply to say something to me 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.060
 it seems to work but maybe it does 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.170
 others in my single world for non 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.300
 would be able to read it in this case 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.419
 a LAN test would be needed though 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.669
 however it would be a minor bug 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.470
 which however has been reported in each 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.660
 case will be corrected 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.060
 in a few days when peace will come 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.460
 peace should come out on day 24 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.419
 even if it's not exactly 100% sure 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.730
 percent 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.390
 let's say they will try to get the 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.400
 day 24 always if everything will be fine if 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.080
 there won't be too big bugs 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.930
 discovered at the last second and then 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.410
 we will have to postpone it so we hope that 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.140
 this peace 1.4 that has been over 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.940
 nicknamed british carey update 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.520
 so pretty scary update 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.100
 I can go out on the correct day for 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.720
 proge all obviously I can't find 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.090
 should give a vote to this pre 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.010
 the elise because as said it is not done 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.460
 to achieve novelty but simply 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.479
 to prepare for the arrival of peace 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.190
 ultimately 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.780
 I hope the video was interesting 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.590
 I thank you for following him 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.590
 hello to all 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.300
 the sphere 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.080
 I
