00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.520
 here behind me we sometimes have problems 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.800
 special in 1984 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.939
 come bmw with the engineering department and me 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 was allowed to develop beautiful things and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.789
 This is the first result of that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.890
 department say of bmw and 2 seater 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.009
 biggest that was the first two since 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 grilles is the 507 that puts one on them 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.250
 keep them specially designed by 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 harm lagaaij a Dutchman 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.719
 if it's good and he really has it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 something very special made of it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 cars almost entirely of plastic 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 anyway all panels say this is 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 all plastic on it had to be easy 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.940
 can be replaced whole story 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.770
 will come back later 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.510
 but of course the element of this BMW 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 z1 that everyone is always talking about 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.120
 is this what fantastic door is anyway 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.680
 great and can just drive it that way 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.900
 come we go i will tell you more about the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.140
 tell what it is that special 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.280
 sometimes at least twelve boarding roswell 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.280
 the clear things 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.150
 so smoothly supersonic 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.440
 therefore about that design immediately 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.300
 briefly some further elaboration it 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.830
 design from harm lagaaij 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.840
 that man that really does study it 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.670
 made 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.350
 the downforce is very important for that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.190
 that car would have a good road holding 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.710
 to get 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.690
 we have the way for that but also one 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.520
 plastic bottom plate to ensure it 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.160
 a very nice clean 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.500
 airflow under the car and the the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.420
 muffler of the exhausts really goes that far 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.250
 It is the muffler of the exhaust is such 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.480
 designed the air that is over there 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.310
 flows 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.870
 yet again extra language for shined is that 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.880
 that comes the beautiful way 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.430
 This car is really bizarre 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.820
 is going to get see all sorts 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.560
 and things and shapes, and slots, and in 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.480
 the bodywork that ensure the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.520
 air completely optimal 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.890
 led along that body what then again 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.540
 funny is what exactly is natural 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.890
 completely contrary to the fact that you 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.350
 things can drive with open doors 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.850
 because yes ok so already gone I would mine 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.850
 window on you can do it right 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:36.780
 nice so will the script is light pot 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.780
 article is ahoy 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.140
 truck technique the bmw z1 that shares whole 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.900
 much with the bmw e30 3 series 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.150
 not the doors that are not there but it is 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.320
 things the chassis and also for example 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.050
 the engine block 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.460
 perhaps an m20 b25 block in this car 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.130
 in the fair know then that it is about 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.790
 a block from the 325 i 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.150
 which at the time they me me as I 30 3 series on 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 the market there was a 170 hp block plane and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.750
 makes sure you feel like there 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.880
 can send to the 100 for nine seconds and 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.530
 just two thick dog 20 kilometers per 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.780
 hour 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:20.130
 yes you tend to enjoy doing that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:24.690
 to go corners and to a hefty it is 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.490
 speed to hunt but this car has 900 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.800
 driven so technically 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.040
 is in the disagreement reason with them 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.410
 car from 1989 when we delivered this one 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.910
 from the first they only see 21 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.820
 and he just did not intervene so yes me 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.500
 don't you go walk number but can 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.769
 notice everything that this car really 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.360
 intended to steer very precisely 8 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.130
 hour drive of course is the too 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.570
 nice balance for those who only need 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.989
 but to send 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.989
 when bmw she introduced this car 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.970
 yes i would say they want one 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.530
 bit hyper and so you can see well 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.489
 to, for example, the coating of the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.320
 seats 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.519
 nicely can flash print somewhat newer 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.959
 is totally hip 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.580
 cameraman my garden has this with a 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.580
 sweater that fits you exactly 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.790
 but zhao it may not be everyone 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.380
 taste it we say it is 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.550
 again the danger of this kind 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.919
 stuff 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.660
 but furthermore simon that fashionable want be 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.049
 your leg had thought it would be cool 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.880
 as owners of the bmw z1 that car 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.479
 just could buy with two 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.810
 colors 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.700
 And yes how then they are all 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.530
 plastic down the idea was that you then 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.270
 could remove those panels themselves or 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.480
 could have a paragraph done in 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.700
 about 40 minutes 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.620
 could have the other set assembled 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.510
 so for example you now this car 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.300
 carried out in how a group of men would 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.400
 you maybe a what and a red set 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.650
 Panels buy there you would 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.000
 just a football club can be 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.190
 can drive with different colors 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.950
 say look new car 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.720
 but the system thought out some BMW 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.760
 maybe it's good 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.410
 word a bit to actually german one 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.330
 little about bmw 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.880
 because it appears in practice that two 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.660
 days in man-hours costs on all panels 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.280
 to take this car off and on again 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.040
 assemble 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.480
 2 days so once much practical as 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.480
 you want to erase color 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.380
 bmw z1 that we have with us today 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.120
 who have lived with our good 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.950
 friends of noa classics 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.810
 in drachten and yes I say so about it 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.610
 cars that we borrow from her this one 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.000
 really feels like new or looks like 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.920
 new 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.410
 or has been restored to new condition 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.640
 but that is just really this way now 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.130
 out is just new 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.890
 actually so you should see it state 900 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.420
 kilometer on the counter and is completely in 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.390
 original state 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.470
 the paint is never 100% original 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.210
 do not expect more car arranged 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.820
 kilometer is also a bit logical 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.550
 of course it's just really a whole 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.500
 pretty exabyte how i green metallic 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.230
 and you like him for 57 a half thousand 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.370
 raise euros 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.560
 yes and that is of course a reasonable one 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.810
 safe investment for a car 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.180
 you will hardly be able to find this state anywhere 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:11.270
 probably find it is just 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.270
 stuff when investment is purchased and 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.600
 maybe 10,000 euros in five years 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.540
 worth more and give it a try 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.000
 with gold or with shares to achieve that 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.020
 kind of save with it your cars are not 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.640
 just fun to drive 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.960
 they are just very sensible things 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.660
 to buy so you just need a lot 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.660
 just buy do it
