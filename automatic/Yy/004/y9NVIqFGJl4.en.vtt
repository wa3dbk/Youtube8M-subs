 Oberligist game he played for those in Rostock his first Oberliga goal 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.249
 he shot against what there after seven winless games now comes out of it 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.059
 The President has to do that 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.759
 the knee support though 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.019
 I am not blue-eyed either Rostock in red regarded the patients as one 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 Handball Stüber scorer against Braunschweig pushes by Tobias Jänicke 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.750
 the 0 2 1 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.150
 after only 8 minutes Jänicke one of five players from our offspring 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.360
 came once from Neubrandenburg completely free 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.130
 Schöneck does not serve the center-back Nico Leismann in the difference 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.130
 Center could not start worse 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 for Jürgen 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.680
 every best in the first half left Siemens with Robin Hood 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.750
 but already the 28 minutes of play 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.680
 the FC Carl Zeiss last 1 to 2 in thuringia derby against Erfurt today 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.940
 not again in a house again as in love 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.900
 four minutes later out there clarified at high speed 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.110
 playful 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.090
 easily without resistance in own penalty area 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.440
 without resistance in a store 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.920
 which now divorced 2 Marcel 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.450
 played once for those only 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 his team wants 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.190
 the prepared template will show if he has a little break 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.930
 the goal line is pressed up 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.320
 Rostock with fundamentally rich self-evident Torsten Siegener 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560
 Simon thirtieth minute 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.680
 Honda and he hung too late 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.890
 and in the stands 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.890
 Discussions &amp; quot; 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.770
 second half latte eggs 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.260
 Post Carsten Nulle again in luck 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.450
 Hansa has very closed to believe that these Rostocker one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179
 complete rebuilding 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.200
 behind you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.439
 Jenas Chairman of the Supervisory Board DOSB on the far right 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.410
 a bag 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.560
 it is only possible to speculate what information from the phone she likes 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.410
 on the lawn 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 the substitutes make them 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.429
 the substitutes before 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:12.769
 Müller in the Bundesliga 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.769
 for the first FC Cologne Sebastian Hähnge finds 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.799
 new hope for the 8th 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.819
 He shot three years ago in the Bundesliga for Rostock 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:28.039
 a praise for assistant Thomas Stein who runs the game the first reflex 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.349
 This price is out of Reimann 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.349
 he has to be completely behind the line 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.139
 and we touched her with a touch of three 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:44.480
 Brilliant from stone unfortunate finished to the third goal of the season by Teese 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.479
 Bastian line 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.630
 we have with restrained joy 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.529
 luckily he has turned fought now 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:58.809
 the finishing touches for Fürth really hit the jackpot with a 4-1 victory 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:59.709
 against the IKB 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.639
 they were 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.919
 it speaks 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.129
 when we already liked a decision on the coaching question 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.579
 the crew, however, they fought 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.579
 Félix Holzner 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.259
 2 goals for Genoa 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.259
 68 seconds have been 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.079
 we are three times as high 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.990
 he can be football FC Hansa dominates this game 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.120
 and suddenly he was very close to the balance 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.969
 and boss type b 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.489
 hung tightly 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.810
 they are for themselves what does he think now 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.810
 where he does not do anything good for Jürgen Rad 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.979
 and are Hanser cell phones have chances of countering four minutes to go 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.669
 they played one over 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.649
 Substitute Bolivar stepped out of the six-goal goal this term 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.999
 earlier that knew pushes 4 missed greatest opportunities now she has 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:56.849
 a run 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.639
 and 12 myself 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.490
 such 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.200
 Goals of those loses 1 to 3 against Rostock for the eighth time no victory 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.130
 the president
