goes for the melee character and I love

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
goes for the melee character and I love
the<00:00:39.329> concept<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.110> weapons<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.800> play<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> lot

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the concept of this weapons I play a lot

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.190 
the concept of this weapons I play a lot
of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> monk<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.969> Diablo<00:00:42.300> 3<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.050> my

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
of the monk and Diablo 3 and it's my

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
of the monk and Diablo 3 and it's my
favorite<00:00:43.530> class<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> reasons<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
favorite class and one of the reasons is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.760 
favorite class and one of the reasons is
because<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> fist<00:00:45.420> weapons<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.469> maybe<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
because of the fist weapons but maybe it

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.810 
because of the fist weapons but maybe it
doesn't<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.460> much

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
doesn't get you that much

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150 
doesn't get you that much
but<00:00:48.210> anyway<00:00:48.690> yeah<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> idea<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.129> having

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
but anyway yeah the idea of not having

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.819 
but anyway yeah the idea of not having
to<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:51.030> one-handed<00:00:51.750> swords<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.350> class

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to have two one-handed swords a class

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
to have two one-handed swords a class
specific<00:00:53.489> fist<00:00:53.760> weapon<00:00:54.180> makes<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.809> lot<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
specific fist weapon makes a lot of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
specific fist weapon makes a lot of
sense<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.829> actually<00:00:55.980> curious<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.670> what's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
sense I'm actually curious to see what's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
sense I'm actually curious to see what's
I<00:00:57.600> thought<00:00:57.780> items<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.320> actually<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.770> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I thought items are actually in this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.709 
I thought items are actually in this
game<00:00:59.190> around<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.879> particular<00:01:00.180> tier<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
game around this particular tier of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
game around this particular tier of
items<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.410> will<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> affect<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> character

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
items and will it affect the character

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
items and will it affect the character
visually<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.750> those<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
visually a lot of those kind of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.990 
visually a lot of those kind of
questions<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:05.820> safe

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
questions but for now it's pretty safe

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
questions but for now it's pretty safe
to<00:01:06.060> say<00:01:06.360> we're<00:01:06.479> gonna<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.869> some<00:01:07.049> fist<00:01:07.290> weapons

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to say we're gonna see some fist weapons

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
to say we're gonna see some fist weapons
okay<00:01:08.400> next<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.060> our<00:01:09.210> ranged<00:01:09.659> class<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
okay next up is our ranged class the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
okay next up is our ranged class the
devil<00:01:10.710> hunter<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.369> what's<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.880> cool

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
devil hunter now what's really cool

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
devil hunter now what's really cool
about<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.510> gameplay<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> shows<00:01:13.530> two

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
about this gameplay is it shows two

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
about this gameplay is it shows two
different<00:01:14.340> tiers<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> items<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.869> first<00:01:16.020> year

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
different tiers of items the first year

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
different tiers of items the first year
that<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> shows<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.280> dual<00:01:17.640> wielding<00:01:18.210> pistols

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that it shows is dual wielding pistols

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
that it shows is dual wielding pistols
now<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.830> could<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.130> two<00:01:20.220> ways<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.790> could<00:01:20.970> get

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
now this could go two ways we could get

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
now this could go two ways we could get
individual<00:01:21.930> pistols<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.890> worn

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
individual pistols that can be worn

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
individual pistols that can be worn
separately<00:01:23.549> or<00:01:24.030> maybe<00:01:24.330> they<00:01:24.540> come<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.930> sets

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
separately or maybe they come in sets

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.929 
separately or maybe they come in sets
now<00:01:25.590> usually<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.369> comes<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.790> type

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
now usually when it comes to this type

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.880 
now usually when it comes to this type
of<00:01:27.000> stuff<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.420> action<00:01:27.570> RPGs<00:01:28.259> it'll<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.710> two

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of stuff in action RPGs it'll be two

rifle<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.310> look<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.670> closer

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
rifle but when we look a little closer

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200 
rifle but when we look a little closer
the<00:01:39.509> character<00:01:39.930> swaps<00:01:40.409> mid<00:01:41.070> combat<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:42.060> we

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the character swaps mid combat now we

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.310 
the character swaps mid combat now we
might<00:01:42.329> even<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.540> something<00:01:42.899> similar<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
might even have something similar to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
might even have something similar to
Diablo<00:01:43.530> 2<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> weapon<00:01:44.490> swap<00:01:44.820> where<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
Diablo 2 with a weapon swap where you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
can actually have two sets of weapons on

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
can actually have two sets of weapons on
you<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> same<00:01:48.090> time<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:48.960> think

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you here at the same time I don't think

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.510 
you here at the same time I don't think
this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.770> part<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> animation

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
this is just a part of the animation

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.609 
this is just a part of the animation
there's<00:01:51.299> clearly<00:01:51.600> two<00:01:51.930> different<00:01:51.960> weapon

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
there's clearly two different weapon

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.370 
there's clearly two different weapon
tiers<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.240> expect<00:01:54.630> double

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
tiers going on so we can expect double

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.350 
tiers going on so we can expect double
dual<00:01:55.680> wielding<00:01:56.100> pistols<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.000> also

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
dual wielding pistols and also

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.690 
dual wielding pistols and also
two-handed<00:01:58.079> rifles<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.340> we're<00:01:59.490> not

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
two-handed rifles but what we're not

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.999 
two-handed rifles but what we're not
seeing<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.329> bows<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> feel<00:02:01.799> like

seeing is bows in this so I feel like

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
seeing is bows in this so I feel like
this<00:02:02.310> might<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.520> another<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
this might be another one of the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.300 
this might be another one of the
eighteen<00:02:04.200> classes<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.219> in

no weapons whatsoever now I haven't seen
this<00:02:18.570> kind<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.810> concept<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> long<00:02:19.620> time<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
this kind of concept in a long time the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.260 
this kind of concept in a long time the
last<00:02:20.250> time<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.550> heard<00:02:20.730> about<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.030> kind<00:02:21.240> of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
last time I heard about this kind of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.030 
last time I heard about this kind of
thing<00:02:21.420> was<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.720> Boulder's<00:02:22.080> Jade<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> monk

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
thing was in Boulder's Jade on the monk

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.490 
thing was in Boulder's Jade on the monk
I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> was<00:02:23.790> where<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.690> actual<00:02:24.900> hero<00:02:25.200> had

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
I think it was where the actual hero had

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.200 
I think it was where the actual hero had
no<00:02:25.710> particular<00:02:26.070> items<00:02:26.580> correct<00:02:26.910> me<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.120> I'm

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.280 
the warlord first of all it's obvious he
has<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.670> shield<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.330> know<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.630> much<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.020> what

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
has a shield we know that much but what

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.780 
has a shield we know that much but what
we<00:02:58.380> also<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.620> here<00:02:58.770> is<00:02:59.190> what<00:02:59.400> looks<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.610> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
we also have here is what looks like to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.790 
we also have here is what looks like to
be<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.910> two-handed<00:03:00.540> weapon<00:03:00.900> that's<00:03:01.380> held<00:03:01.650> in

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
be a two-handed weapon that's held in

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.190 
be a two-handed weapon that's held in
only<00:03:02.130> one<00:03:02.430> hand<00:03:02.850> now<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.540> seems<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:03.930> two

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
only one hand now this seems to have two

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.890 
only one hand now this seems to have two
functions<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.190> blade<00:03:05.550> for<00:03:05.580> starters<00:03:06.480> but

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
functions it's a blade for starters but

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.930 
functions it's a blade for starters but
second<00:03:07.470> function<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.340> ranged<00:03:08.760> attack

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
second function is it's a ranged attack

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.030 
second function is it's a ranged attack
weapon<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:10.350> can<00:03:10.500> clearly<00:03:10.709> see<00:03:10.860> that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
weapon as well you can clearly see that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.060 
weapon as well you can clearly see that
this<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.370> also<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:12.030> rifle<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.590> kind<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.890> brings

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
this is also a rifle this kind of brings

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.949 
this is also a rifle this kind of brings
back<00:03:14.160> memories<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:15.000> Final<00:03:15.480> Fantasy<00:03:15.930> or

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
back memories of like Final Fantasy or

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.020 
back memories of like Final Fantasy or
something<00:03:16.380> along<00:03:16.590> those<00:03:16.650> lines<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.700> got<00:03:17.880> its

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
something along those lines it's got its

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.330 
something along those lines it's got its
really<00:03:18.239> own<00:03:18.390> unique<00:03:18.750> twist<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.230> think<00:03:19.500> yes<00:03:19.800> cool

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
really own unique twist I think yes cool

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.860 
really own unique twist I think yes cool
I<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:20.820> this<00:03:20.970> item<00:03:21.300> I'll<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:21.600> curious

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
I really like this item I'll be curious

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.660 
I really like this item I'll be curious
to<00:03:21.989> see<00:03:22.170> how<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.560> actually<00:03:22.800> works<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.550> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
to see how this actually works in the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
to see how this actually works in the
game<00:03:23.850> like<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.330> ranged<00:03:24.780> tank<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.709> seems

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
game like a ranged tank it just seems

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.670 
game like a ranged tank it just seems
kind<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:27.209> know<00:03:27.330> contradictory<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.170> itself

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
kind of you know contradictory to itself

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.949 
kind of you know contradictory to itself
but<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.610> does<00:03:29.790> look<00:03:30.000> like<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.300> range<00:03:30.600> is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
but it does look like the range is

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.750 
but it does look like the range is
simply<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:31.950> kind<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.280> um<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.700> know

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
simply just kind of um you know

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.600 
simply just kind of um you know
expressed<00:03:33.510> visually<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.250> ranges<00:03:35.550> are

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
expressed visually and the ranges are

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.729 
expressed visually and the ranges are
too<00:03:35.820> crazy<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.510> yeah<00:03:36.989> it'll<00:03:37.200> be<00:03:37.320> cool<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.620> see

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
too crazy so yeah it'll be cool to see

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.380 
too crazy so yeah it'll be cool to see
how<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.010> works<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.489> now<00:03:38.850> it's<00:03:39.090> time<00:03:39.360> for

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
how this works out now it's time for

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.170 
how this works out now it's time for
probably<00:03:40.350> my<00:03:40.500> favorite<00:03:41.070> class<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.670> far<00:03:41.940> while

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
probably my favorite class so far while

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.910 
probably my favorite class so far while
following<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.750> game<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.650> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
following this game and that is the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.460 
following this game and that is the
infighter<00:03:44.640> once<00:03:45.570> again<00:03:45.840> it's<00:03:46.050> very<00:03:46.140> similar

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
infighter once again it's very similar

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.009 
infighter once again it's very similar
to<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.040> first<00:03:47.250> class<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:48.000> battle<00:03:48.360> mage<00:03:48.570> it's

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
to the first class the battle mage it's

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.590 
to the first class the battle mage it's
clearly<00:03:49.410> dual<00:03:49.890> wielding<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.880> weapons<00:03:51.420> what

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
clearly dual wielding this weapons what

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.570 
clearly dual wielding this weapons what
it<00:03:51.690> looks<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.200> be<00:03:52.230> again<00:03:52.769> now<00:03:53.370> those

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
it looks like to be again now those

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.729 
it looks like to be again now those
classes<00:03:53.940> seem<00:03:54.090> very<00:03:54.450> similar<00:03:55.019> as<00:03:55.170> well<00:03:55.470> it's

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
classes seem very similar as well it's

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.620 
classes seem very similar as well it's
quite<00:03:55.950> interesting<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.519> have<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.880> know<00:03:57.000> both

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
quite interesting to have you know both

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.390 
quite interesting to have you know both
classes<00:03:58.080> quite<00:03:58.260> similar<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.920> think<00:03:59.280> they

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
classes quite similar but I think they

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.490 
classes quite similar but I think they
do<00:03:59.459> actually<00:04:00.120> play<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.450> lot<00:04:00.720> differently<00:04:01.200> based

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
do actually play a lot differently based

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.720 
do actually play a lot differently based
on<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.769> gameplay<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.130> I've<00:04:02.340> actually<00:04:02.519> seen

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
on the gameplay that I've actually seen

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.460 
on the gameplay that I've actually seen
since<00:04:03.300> we've<00:04:03.450> already<00:04:03.600> covered<00:04:04.019> two-handed

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
since we've already covered two-handed

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.870 
since we've already covered two-handed
melee<00:04:04.620> weapons<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.160> want<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.370> continue<00:04:05.580> on

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
melee weapons I want to continue on

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.610 
melee weapons I want to continue on
there<00:04:06.150> okay<00:04:06.690> guys<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.230> time<00:04:07.290> for<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
there okay guys it's time for the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.110 
there okay guys it's time for the
Berserker<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.550> have<00:04:08.670> three<00:04:08.910> favorite

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
Berserker can I have three favorite

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.820 
Berserker can I have three favorite
classes<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.870> think<00:04:09.900> I've<00:04:10.140> already<00:04:10.350> chosen<00:04:10.500> two

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
classes I think I've already chosen two

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.259 
classes I think I've already chosen two
right<00:04:11.010> now<00:04:11.040> if<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.459> could<00:04:11.519> choose<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.760> third<00:04:12.030> it

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
right now if I could choose a third it

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.400 
right now if I could choose a third it
would<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.690> Berserker

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
would be the Berserker

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.110 
would be the Berserker

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
kind of looks like just

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.340 
kind of looks like just
blade<00:04:27.979> by<00:04:28.310> itself<00:04:28.850> so<00:04:29.600> we<00:04:29.750> might<00:04:29.930> have<00:04:30.110> like

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
blade by itself so we might have like

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.050 
blade by itself so we might have like
two<00:04:30.590> different<00:04:30.800> type<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.190> tears<00:04:31.639> of

two different type of tears of
two-handed<00:04:32.960> weapons<00:04:33.410> one<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.830> them<00:04:33.979> might<00:04:34.100> be

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
two-handed weapons one of them might be

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.040 
two-handed weapons one of them might be
class<00:04:34.460> specific<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.570> other<00:04:35.720> one<00:04:35.870> might

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
class specific and the other one might

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.990 
class specific and the other one might
be<00:04:36.080> just<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.590> general<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:37.100> two-handed<00:04:37.639> weapon

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
be just in general a two-handed weapon

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.219 
be just in general a two-handed weapon
for<00:04:38.270> example<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.810> know<00:04:38.900> we've<00:04:39.050> got<00:04:39.199> a

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
for example you know we've got a

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.650 
for example you know we've got a
standard<00:04:40.010> two-handed<00:04:40.699> swords<00:04:41.060> for<00:04:41.270> every

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
standard two-handed swords for every

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.180 
standard two-handed swords for every
class<00:04:41.840> can<00:04:42.139> use<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.560> by<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.710> way<00:04:42.919> guys<00:04:43.130> I

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
class can use and by the way guys I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.219 
class can use and by the way guys I
don't<00:04:43.550> know<00:04:43.610> if<00:04:43.699> every<00:04:44.060> class<00:04:44.270> can<00:04:44.510> use<00:04:44.750> you

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
don't know if every class can use you

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.050 
don't know if every class can use you
know<00:04:45.320> every<00:04:45.590> single<00:04:45.800> weapon<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:46.699> kind<00:04:47.030> of

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
know every single weapon it's kind of

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.370 
know every single weapon it's kind of
looking<00:04:47.150> like<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.570> that's<00:04:47.780> not<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.199> case

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
looking like it's that's not the case

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.920 
looking like it's that's not the case
but<00:04:49.100> you<00:04:49.430> know<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:50.030> general<00:04:50.389> classes<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.870> a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
but you know the general classes have a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.420 
but you know the general classes have a
two-handed<00:04:51.320> weapon<00:04:51.590> they<00:04:51.680> can<00:04:51.860> use<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.280> then

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
two-handed weapon they can use and then

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.040 
two-handed weapon they can use and then
all<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.610> sudden<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.910> Berserker<00:04:53.479> he's<00:04:53.840> got

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
all the sudden the Berserker he's got

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.590 
all the sudden the Berserker he's got
this<00:04:54.169> next<00:04:54.680> TR<00:04:55.250> it's<00:04:55.400> like<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.580> class<00:04:55.850> specific

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
this next TR it's like a class specific

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.020 
this next TR it's like a class specific
weapon<00:04:57.229> just<00:04:57.800> for<00:04:58.070> him<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.639> know<00:04:58.790> this<00:04:58.880> thing

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
weapon just for him you know this thing

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.790 
weapon just for him you know this thing
he's<00:04:59.150> not<00:04:59.300> carrying<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.750> in<00:04:59.900> one<00:05:00.199> hand<00:05:00.440> either

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
he's not carrying it in one hand either

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.070 
he's not carrying it in one hand either
I<00:05:01.130> think<00:05:01.250> visually<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:02.300> is<00:05:02.479> one<00:05:02.630> of<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.810> most

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
I think visually this is one of the most

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.050 
I think visually this is one of the most
impressive<00:05:03.590> looking<00:05:04.220> things<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.729> this<00:05:04.850> game

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
impressive looking things in this game

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.000 
impressive looking things in this game
like<00:05:05.300> just<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.930> way<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.289> massive<00:05:06.770> blade

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
like just the way that the massive blade

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.340 
like just the way that the massive blade
swings<00:05:07.400> around<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:08.000> so<00:05:08.389> over<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:08.780> top<00:05:08.900> it's

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
swings around it's so over the top it's

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.189 
swings around it's so over the top it's
so<00:05:09.650> dramatic<00:05:10.090> in<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.180> good<00:05:11.419> way<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.600> know<00:05:11.900> in<00:05:12.110> a

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
so dramatic in a good way you know in a

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.600 
so dramatic in a good way you know in a
really<00:05:12.470> good<00:05:12.620> way<00:05:12.770> now<00:05:13.250> there's<00:05:13.460> one<00:05:13.580> more
