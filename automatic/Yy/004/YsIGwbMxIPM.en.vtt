brings the air in and this 45 degree

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.030 
brings the air in and this 45 degree
angle<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.490> lets<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> air<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.350> okay<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
angle that lets the air out okay so if I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.399 
angle that lets the air out okay so if I
set<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.400> cross-section<00:01:12.119> aside<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:13.320> gonna

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.110 
cleaning out the inside and as you're
cleaning<00:04:11.040> out<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> inside<00:04:11.459> you're<00:04:11.940> being

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
cleaning out the inside you're being

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.180 
cleaning out the inside you're being
careful<00:04:12.330> not<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.750> bump<00:04:12.870> your<00:04:13.049> 45-degree<00:04:13.830> angle

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
careful not to bump your 45-degree angle

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.860 
careful not to bump your 45-degree angle
right<00:04:14.340> because<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.060> want<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.570> be<00:04:15.600> nice

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
and 45 degrees

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.699 
and 45 degrees
okay<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.780> should<00:04:21.080> work<00:04:21.320> now<00:04:21.530> this

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
okay and so that should work now this

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.340 
okay and so that should work now this
hole<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.220> pretty<00:04:22.610> big<00:04:22.850> okay<00:04:23.840> I'm<00:04:24.110> not<00:04:24.290> sure

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
hole is pretty big okay I'm not sure

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.030 
hole is pretty big okay I'm not sure
it's<00:04:24.650> gonna<00:04:24.740> work<00:04:25.010> or<00:04:25.190> not<00:04:25.310> but<00:04:25.850> come<00:04:26.210> if<00:04:26.450> you

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
it's gonna work or not but come if you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.830 
it's gonna work or not but come if you
hold<00:04:28.040> your<00:04:28.490> popsicle<00:04:29.000> stick<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.360> pointy<00:04:29.690> one

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
hold your popsicle stick the pointy one

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.730 
hold your popsicle stick the pointy one
in<00:04:29.990> here<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:32.240> have<00:04:32.390> this<00:04:32.630> angle<00:04:33.080> at<00:04:33.230> a<00:04:33.290> 45

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
in here and you have this angle at a 45

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.220 
in here and you have this angle at a 45
degree<00:04:33.770> angle<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:35.240> should<00:04:35.540> work<00:04:35.720> pretty<00:04:35.990> well

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
degree angle it should work pretty well

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.380 
degree angle it should work pretty well
now<00:04:36.410> I'm<00:04:36.470> gonna<00:04:36.590> try<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:36.980> and<00:04:37.850> see<00:04:38.030> if<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:38.210> can

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
now I'm gonna try this and see if I can

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.960 
now I'm gonna try this and see if I can
hold<00:04:38.540> these<00:04:38.840> two<00:04:39.170> edges<00:04:39.740> together<00:04:40.430> I'm<00:04:40.850> just

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
hold these two edges together I'm just

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.240 
hold these two edges together I'm just
gonna<00:04:41.090> kind<00:04:41.390> of<00:04:41.480> lightly<00:04:42.100> smear<00:04:43.100> them

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
gonna kind of lightly smear them

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.280 
gonna kind of lightly smear them
together<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.730> make<00:04:43.760> sure<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.120> they<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:45.170> know

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
together to make sure that they you know

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.130 
together to make sure that they you know
don't<00:04:45.560> have<00:04:45.710> any<00:04:45.890> air<00:04:46.070> coming<00:04:46.400> out<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:47.020> see<00:04:48.020> if

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
don't have any air coming out and see if

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.840 
don't have any air coming out and see if
this<00:04:48.290> can<00:04:48.470> work<00:04:48.530> now<00:04:50.530> beautiful<00:04:51.530> okay<00:04:52.400> now

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850
