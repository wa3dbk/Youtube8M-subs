 let's examine the phone itself from the front we 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.840

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.850
 compartment for removing the cover 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 so let's consider the body right 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.479
 side of the button to turn it on 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.299

 metal back cover is very comfortable 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.070

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.350
 thin smartphone turned out 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.770
 so let us now turn it on 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.780
 We look at the display that's unlocked 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.720

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.260
 Navitel is already installed initially 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.230
 navigation costs a couple of games

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.760
 but not worth the processor with 4 core 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.910
 mediatek mt6582 and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.670
