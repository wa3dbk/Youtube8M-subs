00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 Y 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.460
 hello what's going out here we are again 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.560
 and today I bring you a trick as you can see 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.260
 I'm going to put front cover camera 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240
 person and the trick is how 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.119
 remove our first person and power 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.950
 well see in third person and while 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.020
 those that the others can not the others 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.200
 days of chance or discovering I have not 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.730
 seen by nowhere out there just alone 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.930
 I think I'm going to upload it because I do not 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.570
 I have seen us looking for us there not what 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.250
 I have seen and nothing if you like to share it 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.770
 because the video is handsome the trick 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.630
 it's fine and it's for to be able to see in 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.920
 third person is also that the 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.370
 other players are with the camera 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.219
 forced first person voucher 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.309
 you as peace is like I think you'll know 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.410
 there is an option when we give the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.350
 circle 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.870
 what has you 5 that is like for cameras 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.400
 cinematographic and nothing the only thing that 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.100
 we have to do when we are there in 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.560
 a career that with cameras first 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.350
 cover person the only thing we do is 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.240
 give circles and mysteriously we 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.950
 we move to the third person we go 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.900
 there as if we were in rope of the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.940
 motorbike the only thing that you have to be 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.770
 exporting the circle but nothing is not 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.110
 complicated that supports it if the circle 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.110
 if you can you can stop with the parking brake 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.840
 hand you can fold you can do everything 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.240
 the only thing that we cut the circle and there 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 what are we going 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 I think that nobody knows this because 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 I was there playing with a bunch of rock 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.780
 and I won the whole race for the same 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.560
 because nobody knows if I have commented 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.479
 if you know how you put the nail that will emit 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.299
 comes out of the cut 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.179
 here I am giving the beige circle and cb 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.399
 in the third person and the only thing 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.070
 we have to do it is to pilot anything 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.140
 from the other world and it's very easy because with 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.600
 the circle were reported because we did not 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.240
 complicate nothing the handling of the motorcycle neither 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.610
 nothing here that I was playing 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.000
 But first person to go 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.220
 we can go in the third person when 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 we want and as long as we want 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 and now I put it 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.090
 to see see 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.980
 and there we can go the whole race there in 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.489
 third person 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.480
 this trick I think nobody knows 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.750
 I do not see 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.409
 I was looking for there I have not seen 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.150
 tricks that relate to this nothing is 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.280
 ok this is all if you like to do 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.810

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.920
 so it does not cost anything and I'm the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.750
