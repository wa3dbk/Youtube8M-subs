eighty eighteen it is a thousand sixty

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.730 
eighty eighteen it is a thousand sixty
five<00:00:16.560> pieces<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:19.310> roughly<00:00:20.310> thirteen<00:00:21.740> inches

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
five pieces and roughly thirteen inches

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.210 
five pieces and roughly thirteen inches
tall<00:00:23.720> it<00:00:24.720> took<00:00:24.930> me<00:00:25.080> about<00:00:25.470> four<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> half

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
tall it took me about four and a half

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820 
tall it took me about four and a half
hours<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> build<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.359> decently<00:00:28.320> long

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
hours to build which is decently long

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.830 
hours to build which is decently long
for<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> thousand<00:00:29.849> pieces<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.420> reason

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
for a thousand pieces and the reason

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.889 
for a thousand pieces and the reason
being<00:00:31.399> yeah<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.030> challenging<00:00:33.450> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
being yeah it's not that challenging to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
being yeah it's not that challenging to
build<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.590> legs<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:37.129> it's<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.190> just

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
build but these legs are it's just just

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
build but these legs are it's just just
tedious<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.450> build<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.780> mean<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.680> doesn't<00:00:40.829> look

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
tedious to build I mean it doesn't look

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.600 
tedious to build I mean it doesn't look
like<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.250> many<00:00:41.489> pieces<00:00:41.899> but<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
like that many pieces but it's a lot and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.139 
like that many pieces but it's a lot and
they're<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:48.030> get

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
they're all the same and it just you get

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.170 
they're all the same and it just you get
to<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.450> four<00:00:48.660> times<00:00:48.690> obviously<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:51.059> took

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to do it four times obviously so it took

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.040 
to do it four times obviously so it took
some<00:00:51.360> time<00:00:52.699> but<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.719> my<00:00:54.840> first

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
some time but this is this was my first

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.639 
some time but this is this was my first
thousand<00:00:55.530> piece<00:00:55.710> set<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.270> really

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
thousand piece set and it's really

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.959 
thousand piece set and it's really
really<00:00:58.649> something<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.730> one

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
really something I really like this one

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.160 
really something I really like this one
over<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> new<00:01:01.170> motorized<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:03.170> obviously

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
over the new motorized one obviously

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
over the new motorized one obviously
this<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.470> can't<00:01:04.830> walk<00:01:05.010> by<00:01:05.220> itself<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
this one can't walk by itself but the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.390 
this one can't walk by itself but the
legs<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.240> fully<00:01:06.540> poseable<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.100> joint

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
legs are fully poseable you go joint

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.060 
legs are fully poseable you go joint
here<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> feet<00:01:09.890> kind<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
here here and then the feet kind of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.480 
here here and then the feet kind of
wobble<00:01:12.920> I'm<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.070> gonna<00:01:14.189> show<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
wobble I'm not gonna show you that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
wobble I'm not gonna show you that
because<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.210> hard<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.710> with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
because it's very hard to do that with

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.469 
because it's very hard to do that with
one<00:01:17.009> hand<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.750> start<00:01:19.049> off<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.680> get

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
one hand so to start off with you get

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
one hand so to start off with you get
let's<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.810> two<00:01:22.259> three<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.590> many

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
let's see one two three four many

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359 
let's see one two three four many
fingers<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:24.659> luke<00:01:24.979> hang<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.159> by<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
fingers you get luke hang it on by a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.390 
fingers you get luke hang it on by a
thread<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:30.079> Imperial

thread here and then you get a Imperial
pilot<00:01:33.680> which<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.799> kind<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.189> rare<00:01:36.770> rare<00:01:37.770> rare

is on both sides by the way but I just
kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> don't<00:02:10.560> think<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
kind of like that I don't think the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.610 
kind of like that I don't think the
motorized<00:02:11.700> thing<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.390> cool<00:02:12.599> idea

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
motorized thing it's a cool idea

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.040 
motorized thing it's a cool idea
if<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.190> want<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> get<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.790> know<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.930> not

said<00:03:19.139> this<00:03:19.290> came<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.680> 2003<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.609> five

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000

well technically six years old now so if

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.629
