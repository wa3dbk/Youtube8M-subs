00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hi folks I'm the blog's fault a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.950
 outbreak and now come to show you go 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.429
 make condensed milk without lactose in 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.429
 House 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.450
 this recipe even though it takes a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.650
 A little to get ready is well 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.050
 simple to do 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.029
 We 're going to use both ingredients. 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.000
 which is vegetable milk and demerara sugar 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.550
 In this case I am using milk in the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 industrial coconut edict 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 but it is logical that using the homemade is a thousand 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.590
 times better because you will not have a 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.600
 no preservative is harmful and throws 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 the channel already this nor how to make the milks 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.649
 vegetables and this milk 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.469
 condensate can be done before 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.890
 almond nut milk and nights 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.920
 cereal also like oat la rosa opinou 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.559
 In this case you have a little trick like this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.690
 talked takes a bit of fat and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.879
 cereals do not have this crop 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 I 'll tell you what, then I 'll tell you 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.219
 for consistency to get hot is born 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.799
 so come on then you promised milk 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.930
 lactose-free condensate to people 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.930
 You will need to cook our milk. 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.450
 vegetable with the super release for this to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 people will take both of you a little low and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.840
 fumble to acquire 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.939
 consistency that we want 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.159
 this will take about 30 40 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.259
 depends a lot on the amount of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.200
 What milk are you using then I will 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.360
 mix in here and I'll show you 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.360
 our condensed milk will cook 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.150
 Our past election was ready. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.250
 You saw that it looks very creamy, right? 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.860
 now I'm going to take that from the favela 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:56.560
 I'll put a container to take to 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:58.570
 singing in the field and consistency 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.310
 shown to see how it looks 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.150
 then vision I have here one can yes the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.590
 play party series 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.849
 after it stays in the refrigerator and stays 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.860
 more consistent and stay even more with it 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.860
 You can see it looks only 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.980
 what will you do at home then maybe 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.930
 result with the help of sugar 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.900
 I use a minimal amount to stay 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.790
 responsible, very lean and healthier 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.040
