00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
firehouse and Lakeland and we pretty

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.189 
firehouse and Lakeland and we pretty
much<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.210> almost<00:00:24.510> all<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.810> them

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

unfortunately<00:00:25.800> some<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> them<00:00:26.340> were<00:00:27.029> already

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
unfortunately some of them were already

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.029 
unfortunately some of them were already
open<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.199> could<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> color<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> their

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
open so I could see the color of their

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.730 
open so I could see the color of their
hair<00:00:29.359> but<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:31.019> still<00:00:31.080> wanted<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.619> them

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
hair but we still wanted to get them

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.290 
hair but we still wanted to get them
just<00:00:31.920> because<00:00:32.040> they're<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.700> hard<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> find<00:00:33.120> now

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
just because they're so hard to find now

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
just because they're so hard to find now
and<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.620> already<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.340> remove

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and some of these we already just remove

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.520 
and some of these we already just remove
the<00:00:35.670> plastic<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> keep<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> time<00:00:37.380> of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the plastic just to keep the time of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.459 
the plastic just to keep the time of
bomb<00:00:37.680> d<00:00:37.920> videos<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.969> i<00:00:39.329> guess<00:00:39.629> some<00:00:39.899> open<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.229 
bomb d videos so i guess some open the
first<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> saw<00:00:41.430> had<00:00:41.640> purple<00:00:41.940> hair<00:00:41.969> and
