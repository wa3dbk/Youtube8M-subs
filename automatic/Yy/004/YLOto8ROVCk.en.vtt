00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
one I have for sale this and a mole I'm

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.730 
one I have for sale this and a mole I'm
asking<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.180> fifty<00:03:51.660> thousand<00:03:52.230> for<00:03:52.380> both<00:03:52.530> of

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
asking like fifty thousand for both of

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.740 
asking like fifty thousand for both of
them<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.460> make<00:03:53.670> one<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.180> these<00:03:54.420> like

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
them and you can make one of these like

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.730 
them and you can make one of these like
the<00:03:55.650> mole<00:03:55.890> in<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.370> week<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.740> could<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.010> pretty

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
the mole in a week so it could be pretty

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.350 
the mole in a week so it could be pretty
popular<00:04:01.740> with<00:04:02.220> some<00:04:02.460> people<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.210> other

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
people they don't care about it and they

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.860 
people they don't care about it and they
don't<00:04:06.300> care<00:04:06.540> about<00:04:06.780> making<00:04:07.020> any<00:04:07.320> money<00:04:07.500> so

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.509 

that's<00:04:14.379> it<00:04:14.620> pretty<00:04:14.920> fast

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
that's it pretty fast

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.990 
that's it pretty fast
I'm<00:04:17.000> taking<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.539> easy<00:04:17.720> with<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.169> now

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.810 

it's<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.540> four-cylinder<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.530> get

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
it's a four-cylinder and I get

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.030 
it's a four-cylinder and I get
approximately<00:04:26.200> 50<00:04:27.200> miles<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.770> gallon

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
approximately 50 miles to the gallon

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:38.860 
approximately 50 miles to the gallon
with<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:30.620> does<00:04:30.800> have<00:04:31.010> reversible<00:04:31.610> cost

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.550 

and<00:04:39.350> that's<00:04:39.530> one<00:04:39.740> right<00:04:41.110> I'll<00:04:42.110> try<00:04:42.380> another

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
and that's one right I'll try another

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.220 
and that's one right I'll try another
one<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.040> have<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.340> rocket<00:04:43.699> also

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.720 

go<00:04:50.230> up

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.570 

that's<00:04:54.360> it
