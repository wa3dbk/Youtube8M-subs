you again by having this extra grill at
the<00:04:23.340> top<00:04:23.730> it<00:04:24.030> only<00:04:24.210> adds<00:04:24.450> one<00:04:24.750> gram<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the top it only adds one gram to the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.890 
the top it only adds one gram to the
weight<00:04:25.770> but<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.550> increases<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.570> vision

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
weight but it increases the vision

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.990 
weight but it increases the vision
considerably<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.830> makes<00:04:29.280> for<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> far

club version is as you would expect the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.030 
club version is as you would expect the
heaviest<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.210> all<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.480> helmets<00:05:15.660> but<00:05:16.560> let's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
heaviest of all the helmets but let's

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.220 
heaviest of all the helmets but let's
remember<00:05:17.250> these<00:05:17.670> helmets<00:05:18.240> gives<00:05:18.480> an<00:05:18.690> enormous

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
remember these helmets gives an enormous

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.260 
remember these helmets gives an enormous
amount<00:05:19.770> of<00:05:19.830> protection<00:05:19.980> especially<00:05:20.850> with<00:05:21.180> the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
amount of protection especially with the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.450 
amount of protection especially with the
halo<00:05:21.510> system<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.650> my<00:05:22.860> opinion<00:05:22.890> they're

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
halo system in my opinion they're

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.830 
halo system in my opinion they're
probably<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.820> best<00:05:24.000> helmets<00:05:24.390> available<00:05:24.780> in

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
probably the best helmets available in

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.410 
probably the best helmets available in
the<00:05:24.900> market<00:05:25.320> at<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.920> moment<00:05:26.150> so<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.240> club

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
the market at the moment so the club

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.530 
the market at the moment so the club
helmet<00:05:27.750> is<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.900> heaviest<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:29.420> lightest<00:05:30.420> of
