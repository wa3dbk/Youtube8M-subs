disappeared the bounty is still active

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.579 
disappeared the bounty is still active
okay<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.210> means<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.510> carries<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.199> even

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
okay so that means it carries on even

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.070 
okay so that means it carries on even
though<00:01:04.680> he<00:01:04.710> died<00:01:05.240> but<00:01:06.240> apparently<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.720> carries

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
though he died but apparently it carries

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
though he died but apparently it carries
on<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:07.710> guessing<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.220> take<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.430> he<00:01:08.820> gets

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
on so I'm guessing if he take it he gets

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390 
on so I'm guessing if he take it he gets
killed<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.510> another<00:01:09.840> game<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.410> I<00:01:10.979> wonder<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.280> he

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
killed in another game or I wonder if he

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.830 
killed in another game or I wonder if he
appears<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.910> another<00:01:12.300> game<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.660> he'll<00:01:12.810> be

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
appears in another game but he'll be

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.249 
appears in another game but he'll be
