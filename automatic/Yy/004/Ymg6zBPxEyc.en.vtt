 philosophical and psychological studies and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.880
 it is even said that some graduates

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.690

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.620
 philosophy of the cartoon is called 'bob

 which caught my attention and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.880
 I already bought it when I finished it 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.400
 a video about him 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.840
 the city is like bikini bottom it 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.300
 it calls like that because it's under the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.860
 bikini pain a real place of the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.710
 micronesian islands when more or less 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.750
 by 1946 several tests of 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.820
 nuclear weapons so that could be 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.500
 the reason why our friends 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.500
 bikini bottoms are alive 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.570
 squid is not a squid is an octopus 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.310
 but this has it six tentacles 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.240
 because the animators decided that this way 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.640
 it looked better 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.140
 there is a crazy theory that the truth only 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.820
 they found adverse and I doubt it's 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.470
 certain which says that Duncan wants 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.330
 when they have family because their 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.280
 wife and children to make blood 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.200
