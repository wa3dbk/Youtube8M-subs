all<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> way<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:54.960> constant<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:56.420> as<00:01:57.420> long<00:01:57.600> as

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
all the way for constant on as long as

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.850 
all the way for constant on as long as
you're<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.020> using<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.409> switch<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you're just using that switch in the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
you're just using that switch in the
back<00:01:59.039> you're<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> change

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
back you're not going to have a change

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.990 
back you're not going to have a change
modes<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.219> now<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.280> loosen<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.789> head

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
modes on you now you loosen the head

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.209 
modes on you now you loosen the head
that's<00:02:03.810> where<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.110> secondary<00:02:04.560> output<00:02:05.039> is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that's where your secondary output is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.120 
that's where your secondary output is
and<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.909> secondary<00:02:06.390> output<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.619> light<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
and a secondary output on this light is

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.980 
and a secondary output on this light is
actually<00:02:08.399> programmable<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.420> pretty<00:02:09.600> cool

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
actually programmable it's pretty cool

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.780 
actually programmable it's pretty cool
the<00:02:10.380> different<00:02:10.950> things<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.280> program<00:02:11.610> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the different things you can program it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880 
the different things you can program it
to<00:02:11.820> are<00:02:12.060> kind<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.300> ridiculous<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:13.050> don't<00:02:13.830> know

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to are kind of ridiculous I don't know

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.840 
to are kind of ridiculous I don't know
if<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.310> able<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.460> show<00:02:14.610> them<00:02:14.760> all

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
if I'm going to be able to show them all

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.830 
if I'm going to be able to show them all
to<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.180> but

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
to you but

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.990 
to you but
I'll<00:02:16.050> give<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.380> an<00:02:16.470> idea<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.640> way<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.790> get

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
I'll give you an idea so the way to get

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.390 
I'll give you an idea so the way to get
into<00:02:18.180> programming<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.220> head

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
into programming is you have that head

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.430 
into programming is you have that head
loosened<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.569> have<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> loosened<00:02:22.170> make<00:02:22.290> it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
loosened just have it loosened make it

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.370 
loosened just have it loosened make it
make<00:02:22.620> sure<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.850> max<00:02:24.060> output

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
make sure it's not and that max output

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.600 
make sure it's not and that max output
so<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:25.530> loosen<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.920> make<00:02:26.250> sure<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.459> got<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
so just loosen it make sure you got that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.610 
so just loosen it make sure you got that
secondary<00:02:27.209> output<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.810> then<00:02:28.380> you're<00:02:28.530> going

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
secondary output and then you're going

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.260 
secondary output and then you're going
to<00:02:28.680> want<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> click<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.220> three<00:02:29.430> times<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.120> what

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
to want to click it three times so what

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.850 
to want to click it three times so what
I<00:02:30.300> do<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.750> lightly<00:02:31.110> press<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.620> get<00:02:31.740> that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
I do is I lightly press it to get that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.040 
I do is I lightly press it to get that
momentary<00:02:32.400> twice<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.540> fully<00:02:33.720> click<00:02:33.959> at

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
momentary twice and then fully click at

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.130 
momentary twice and then fully click at
the<00:02:34.170> third<00:02:34.350> time<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.160> go<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.580> two<00:02:35.850> three

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the third time so you go one two three

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.750 
the third time so you go one two three
and<00:02:37.140> you'll<00:02:37.260> see<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:38.100> it'll<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.700> will

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
and you'll see what it'll do is it will

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.460 
and you'll see what it'll do is it will
start<00:02:38.850> ramping<00:02:39.180> through<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> different

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
start ramping through the different

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.620 
start ramping through the different
outputs<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:41.580> if<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> turned<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.180> off<00:02:42.270> at<00:02:42.540> any

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
outputs now if I turned it off at any

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.870 
outputs now if I turned it off at any
point<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.830> will<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:44.069> set<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.640> that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
point in this it will be set to that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.460 
point in this it will be set to that
output<00:02:45.390> all<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.050> turn<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.260> off

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
output all you have to do is turn it off

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.470 
output all you have to do is turn it off
leave<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.920> off<00:02:47.100> for<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.280> few<00:02:47.400> seconds<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.000> it's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
leave it off for a few seconds and it's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.210 
leave it off for a few seconds and it's
going<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.690> memorize<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.260> output<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.100> what

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
going to memorize that output but what

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.860 
going to memorize that output but what
I'm<00:02:50.310> gonna<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.970> turn<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.209> off<00:02:51.390> turn<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.660> back

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
I'm gonna do is turn it off turn it back

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.650 
I'm gonna do is turn it off turn it back
on<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:53.370> its<00:02:53.489> gonna<00:02:53.580> do<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.540> gonna

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
on and what its gonna do is it's gonna

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.690 
on and what its gonna do is it's gonna
start<00:02:55.050> strobe<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.130> through<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> different

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
start strobe you through the different

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.970 
start strobe you through the different
frequencies<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.900> gonna<00:02:58.019> go<00:02:58.200> from<00:02:58.380> 1<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.709> 20

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
frequencies it's gonna go from 1 to 20

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.770 
frequencies it's gonna go from 1 to 20
Hertz<00:02:59.130> again<00:02:59.880> anywhere<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.390> there<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.630> turn

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
Hertz again anywhere in there you turn

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.740 
Hertz again anywhere in there you turn
it<00:03:00.930> off<00:03:01.050> it's<00:03:01.590> gonna<00:03:01.769> memorize<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:03.390> when

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
it off it's gonna memorize that but when

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.420 
it off it's gonna memorize that but when
it's<00:03:03.900> done<00:03:04.140> when<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.620> gets<00:03:04.739> all<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.890> way<00:03:04.980> up<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
it's done when it gets all the way up to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.820 
it's done when it gets all the way up to
the<00:03:05.519> max<00:03:05.700> flashing<00:03:06.380> you'll<00:03:07.380> see<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.590> start

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
the max flashing you'll see you start

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.920 
the max flashing you'll see you start
doing<00:03:08.040> some<00:03:08.190> other<00:03:08.340> stuff<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:09.569> I'll<00:03:09.630> have<00:03:09.750> this

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
doing some other stuff so I'll have this

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.870 
doing some other stuff so I'll have this
really<00:03:10.230> low<00:03:10.410> beacon<00:03:10.890> flashing<00:03:11.340> mode<00:03:11.550> you've

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
really low beacon flashing mode you've

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.390 
really low beacon flashing mode you've
got<00:03:12.060> SOS<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.780> there<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.530> got<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.830> rapid

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
got SOS in there you got this rapid

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.550 
got SOS in there you got this rapid
double<00:03:14.730> flash<00:03:14.910> kind<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.300> thing<00:03:15.480> all<00:03:15.989> kinds<00:03:16.500> of

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
double flash kind of thing all kinds of

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.990 
double flash kind of thing all kinds of
different<00:03:16.739> options<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:17.489> kind<00:03:17.940> of

different options in here kind of

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.250 
different options in here kind of
ridiculous<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.690> amount<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.930> options<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
ridiculous the amount of options that

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.259 
ridiculous the amount of options that
you<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.709> here<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.100> just<00:03:20.880> whenever<00:03:21.000> you

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.789 
you have in here and just whenever you
see<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> one<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.840> want<00:03:22.049> all<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.500> have<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.680> do

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
see the one you want all you have to do

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.330 
see the one you want all you have to do
is<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.160> turn<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.000> off<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:24.810> set<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:24.989> that

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
is just turn it off and it's set to that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.620 
is just turn it off and it's set to that
so<00:03:26.340> leave<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.640> off<00:03:26.820> for<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:27.030> few<00:03:27.060> seconds

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
so leave it off for a few seconds

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.569 
so leave it off for a few seconds
because<00:03:28.410> if<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:28.709> turn<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:28.920> back<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.459> start

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
because if we turn it back on and start

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.580 
because if we turn it back on and start
going<00:03:29.820> through<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.030> programming<00:03:30.390> again<00:03:30.720> but

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
going through the programming again but

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.150 
going through the programming again but
so<00:03:32.190> we<00:03:32.549> got<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.959> max<00:03:33.959> output<00:03:34.230> when<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.920> head

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
so we got that max output when the head

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.670 
so we got that max output when the head
is<00:03:35.370> tightened<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.910> then<00:03:36.450> loosen<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.049> it's

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
is tightened and then loosen it and it's

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.410 
is tightened and then loosen it and it's
going<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:38.100> looks<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.000> turned<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.329> off

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
going to be looks like I turned it off

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.140 
going to be looks like I turned it off
when<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.380> SOS<00:03:40.829> was<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:42.049> so<00:03:43.049> max<00:03:43.680> output

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
when the the SOS was going so max output

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.920 
when the the SOS was going so max output
always<00:03:45.150> is<00:03:45.269> going<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> be<00:03:45.570> when<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> head

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
always is going to be when the head

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.560 
always is going to be when the head
tightened<00:03:46.320> had<00:03:46.980> loosened<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.579> going<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.390> be

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
tightened had loosened is going to be

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.420 
tightened had loosened is going to be
whatever<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.140> program<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:50.310> can

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
whatever you program it to you can

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.890 
whatever you program it to you can
change<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.820> as<00:03:51.000> many<00:03:51.209> times<00:03:51.450> as<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.720> want

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
change that as many times as you want

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.449 
change that as many times as you want
and<00:03:52.170> it's<00:03:52.380> not<00:03:52.410> going<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.739> change<00:03:52.950> until<00:03:53.280> you

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
and it's not going to change until you

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.360 
and it's not going to change until you
enter<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:53.970> programming<00:03:54.690> mode<00:03:54.840> again

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
enter that programming mode again

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.710 
enter that programming mode again
alright<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.880> operation<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.630> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
alright so that is the operation of the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.120 
alright so that is the operation of the
light<00:03:57.870> we're<00:03:58.140> gonna<00:03:58.230> go<00:03:58.470> ahead<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.739> take<00:03:58.980> this

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
light we're gonna go ahead and take this

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.160 
light we're gonna go ahead and take this
outside<00:03:59.340> we'll<00:03:59.910> take<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.209> xpg<00:04:00.660> outside<00:04:01.019> as

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
outside we'll take the xpg outside as

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.539 
outside we'll take the xpg outside as
well<00:04:01.320> just<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.070> can<00:04:02.130> see<00:04:02.280> how<00:04:02.430> they

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
well just so you can see how they

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.000 
well just so you can see how they
compare<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.880> each<00:04:03.060> other<00:04:03.739> okay<00:04:04.739> we're<00:04:04.920> out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
compare to each other okay we're out

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.699 
compare to each other okay we're out
here<00:04:05.220> with<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.430> two<00:04:05.579> jet<00:04:05.880> 3ms<00:04:06.359> at<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.200> big<00:04:07.350> 40

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
here with the two jet 3ms at the big 40

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.289 
here with the two jet 3ms at the big 40
mag<00:04:07.859> light<00:04:08.070> that<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.280> always<00:04:08.459> use<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.060> let's<00:04:09.120> try

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
mag light that I always use so let's try

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.069 
mag light that I always use so let's try
that<00:04:09.450> mag<00:04:09.570> light<00:04:09.750> out<00:04:09.900> first<00:04:10.140> see<00:04:10.620> how<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.859> does

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
that mag light out first see how it does

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.580 
that mag light out first see how it does
there<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.230> is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
there it is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.400 
there it is
a<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:13.950> Bush<00:04:14.100> 15<00:04:14.609> feet<00:04:14.880> tree<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.930> there<00:04:15.959> 100

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
a little Bush 15 feet tree out there 100

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.380 
a little Bush 15 feet tree out there 100
feet<00:04:16.590> zoom<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:19.760> alright<00:04:20.760> let's<00:04:20.940> try<00:04:21.030> out<00:04:21.239> those

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
feet zoom in alright let's try out those

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.930 
feet zoom in alright let's try out those
jet<00:04:21.660> 3ms<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.800> we're<00:04:22.890> gonna<00:04:23.039> try<00:04:23.220> out<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
jet 3ms and we're gonna try out the the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.490 
jet 3ms and we're gonna try out the the
RFI<00:04:24.240> version<00:04:24.630> first

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
RFI version first

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.770 
RFI version first
I<00:04:26.530> see<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> nice<00:04:27.640> concentrated<00:04:28.360> light<00:04:28.450> on<00:04:28.600> this

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
I see a nice concentrated light on this

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.780 
I see a nice concentrated light on this
this<00:04:29.080> one's<00:04:29.320> made<00:04:29.560> more<00:04:30.100> for<00:04:30.310> distance<00:04:30.640> kind

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
this one's made more for distance kind

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.460 
this one's made more for distance kind
of<00:04:30.910> applications<00:04:31.420> definitely<00:04:32.410> a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
of applications definitely a

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.400 
of applications definitely a
concentrated<00:04:33.070> light<00:04:33.750> spill<00:04:34.750> still<00:04:35.170> really

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
concentrated light spill still really

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.930 
concentrated light spill still really
useful<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.950> can<00:04:36.160> see<00:04:36.310> everything<00:04:36.700> even
