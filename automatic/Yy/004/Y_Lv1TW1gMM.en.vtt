00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 Design thinking is a process of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.210
 five steps discover interpret devise 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 experiment and evolve 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.400
 let's go with the first one discover this step 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 is the basis of the design process is 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 try to put yourself in the shoes of the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 person for whom you are designing and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.789
 empathize with their way of thinking and of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 feel you must immerse yourself in your mind in 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.199
 your heart to understand your 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 physical and emotional needs who 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.540
 is that it makes me like that it is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.030
 important to him because he does it from that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.969
 way we will teach you two techniques for 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.280
 discover first the method that how 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 and why it divides a blackboard in three 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 sections in the first note what is it 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.329
 what your consumer does for example 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.969
 they hit their carts and they fight 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.409
 now how they do it is casual without 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.109
 However, it generates discomfort and 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.269
 clashes and finally why 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.129
 this happens maybe because they understand that 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.070
 the space is small and the jars are not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.470
 properly rotate the other technique to 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.539
 discover is the interview just like 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.250
 when you meet your friends there is nothing 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.470
 better than a sincere conversation and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.330
 pleasant when consumer to know it 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 but first you have to prepare the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.189
 interview gathers your team and make a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 brainstorming of questions in a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.179
 blackboard write about post-its all 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.940
 the potential questions that are 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.429
 occur after they are ordered by themes 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.810
 to be able to group them in this way 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.909
 the structure of the interview 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.880
 making it more fluid friendly and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.590
 effective do not forget to also have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.209
 consider these tips for the interview 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.429
 even when you think you know the 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.009
 answers questions why maybe 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.229
 can surprise you encourages the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.049
 people to tell stories be real or 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.850
 they do not reveal something of who the account 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.340
 pay attention to gestures and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.560
 body language do not fear the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.500
 silence in these moments the person 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.280
 can reflect on what has just 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.610
 and reveal something deeper suggest us 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.320
 answers to neutral questions not 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 ask binary questions that can be 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.810
 answered with a word stimulates the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.750
 conversation to just one question at a time 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.730
 no contributions to your consumer and finally 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.709
 remember to take a recorder so that 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.870
 you can forget taking notes and 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.770
 get totally involved with people 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.410
 and their stories 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.720
 the ideal is to go in pairs so that the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.220
 second record the interview and do not forget 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.989
 It is very important to ask for the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.000
 consent of the person before 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.160
 interview her as well as prepare a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.160
 adequate space not to make the step
