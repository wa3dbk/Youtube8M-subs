you know I have sat in front of a forge
I've<00:00:38.579> brought<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:39.790> hammer<00:00:40.030> down<00:00:40.559> man<00:00:41.559> that's

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
I've brought that hammer down man that's

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.299 
I've brought that hammer down man that's
a<00:00:41.950> lot<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.219> work<00:00:42.640> yeah<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:43.809> after<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:45.190> do

a lot of work yeah and after you do
about<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:46.290> hundred<00:00:47.290> hours<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:47.620> black<00:00:47.829> sand<00:00:48.040> I

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
about a hundred hours of black sand I

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.130 
about a hundred hours of black sand I
think<00:00:48.219> it's<00:00:48.340> still<00:00:48.960> speaking<00:00:49.960> from

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
think it's still speaking from

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.979 
think it's still speaking from
experience<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.460> but<00:00:52.030> one<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.570> cool<00:00:52.750> things

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
experience so but one of the cool things

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.240 
experience so but one of the cool things
I<00:00:53.170> liked<00:00:53.350> about<00:00:53.410> it<00:00:53.559> was<00:00:53.800> building<00:00:54.070> your<00:00:54.219> own

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
I liked about it was building your own

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.190 
I liked about it was building your own
tools<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:55.390> we<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:55.600> get<00:00:55.719> into<00:00:55.840> that<00:00:55.989> kind<00:00:56.170> of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
tools and we can get into that kind of

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.600 
tools and we can get into that kind of
stuff<00:00:56.320> but<00:00:56.649> what<00:00:56.770> we're<00:00:56.860> gonna<00:00:56.980> get<00:00:57.280> in<00:00:57.399> today

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
stuff but what we're gonna get in today

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.209 
stuff but what we're gonna get in today
is<00:00:57.850> something<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.210> requires<00:00:58.480> a<00:00:58.690> lot<00:00:58.930> less

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is something that requires a lot less

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.069 
is something that requires a lot less
first<00:01:00.219> off<00:01:00.460> material<00:01:00.760> starting<00:01:01.420> costs<00:01:01.870> the

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
first off material starting costs the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.790 
first off material starting costs the
actual<00:01:02.440> metal<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.860> cheap<00:01:03.509> second<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:05.530> got<00:01:05.680> all

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
actual metal is cheap second we got all

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.170 
actual metal is cheap second we got all
this<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.190> got<00:01:06.250> all<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:06.820> stuff<00:01:06.880> at<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.119> thrift

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
this I got all this stuff at the thrift

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
this I got all this stuff at the thrift
store<00:01:07.479> including<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.830> ingot<00:01:09.280> casting<00:01:09.729> trays

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.850 

so<00:01:14.200> an<00:01:14.320> ingot<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.979> basically<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.770> section<00:01:17.770> of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
so an ingot is basically a a section of

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.670 
so an ingot is basically a a section of
metal<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.400> specifically<00:01:19.030> melt<00:01:19.680> let

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
metal that you specifically melt let

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.460 
metal that you specifically melt let
solidify<00:01:21.159> on<00:01:21.280> in<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.580> mold<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.060> set<00:01:22.360> aside<00:01:22.750> so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
solidify on in a mold and set aside so

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.200 
solidify on in a mold and set aside so
that<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.799> easily<00:01:24.280> just<00:01:24.460> say<00:01:24.640> well<00:01:24.880> I<00:01:24.909> need

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
that you can easily just say well I need

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.660 
that you can easily just say well I need
about<00:01:25.360> five<00:01:25.840> or<00:01:26.049> six<00:01:26.229> ingots<00:01:26.650> worth<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.549> you

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
about five or six ingots worth and you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.100 
about five or six ingots worth and you
kind<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:27.909> know<00:01:28.090> what<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.390> way<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.540> your<00:01:28.750> ingots

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
kind of know what the way to your ingots

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.620 
kind of know what the way to your ingots
are<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.189> say<00:01:30.939> alright<00:01:31.180> well<00:01:31.420> I'll

just got five rather than sit there and

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.300 
just got five rather than sit there and
melt<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.700> weigh<00:01:33.909> out<00:01:34.030> your<00:01:34.180> metal<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:36.220> all

these calculations you just go oh well
five<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.380> these<00:01:38.439> worked<00:01:38.710> last<00:01:38.950> time

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
five of these worked last time

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.340 
five of these worked last time
for<00:01:40.210> something<00:01:40.390> five<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:40.930> time<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.259> would

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
for something five this time you would

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.630 
for something five this time you would
said<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.650> wanted<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:41.950> start<00:01:42.189> with<00:01:42.280> pewter

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
said you wanted to start with pewter

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.380 
said you wanted to start with pewter
because<00:01:42.880> pewter<00:01:43.420> has<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:44.549> low<00:01:45.549> melting<00:01:46.000> point

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
because pewter has a low melting point

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.300 
because pewter has a low melting point
yes<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:46.689> very<00:01:47.020> low<00:01:47.229> melting<00:01:47.439> point<00:01:47.829> compared<00:01:48.189> to

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
yes a very low melting point compared to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.800 
yes a very low melting point compared to
a<00:01:48.340> lot<00:01:48.549> of<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.700> other<00:01:48.820> metals<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.360> we<00:01:49.479> used

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
a lot of the other metals that we used

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.899 
a lot of the other metals that we used
to<00:01:49.990> like<00:01:50.380> mess<00:01:50.590> around<00:01:50.680> with<00:01:50.950> like<00:01:51.220> steel<00:01:51.549> or

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
to like mess around with like steel or

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
people literally forging you know in the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.940 
people literally forging you know in the
flames<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.689> not<00:02:04.689> all<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.469> absolutely

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
flames and not all of that is absolutely

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.920 
flames and not all of that is absolutely
necessary<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:07.119> that's<00:02:07.540> one<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.719> the<00:02:07.810> things

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
necessary and that's one of the things

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.449 
necessary and that's one of the things
that<00:02:08.049> we<00:02:08.170> wanted<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.470> actually<00:02:08.679> bring<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.310> you

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
that we wanted to actually bring to you

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.509 
that we wanted to actually bring to you
guys<00:02:09.509> know<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:11.110> there<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.440> most<00:02:12.070> of<00:02:12.280> what<00:02:12.430> you

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
guys know that there is most of what you

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.900 
guys know that there is most of what you
see<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.600> pewter<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.550> actually

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
see here is is pewter this is actually

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.479 
see here is is pewter this is actually
aluminum<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.840> talk<00:02:17.050> more<00:02:17.319> about<00:02:17.489> how

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
aluminum and we can talk more about how

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.400 
aluminum and we can talk more about how
you<00:02:18.550> can<00:02:18.819> tell<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> difference<00:02:19.510> but

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
you can tell the difference but

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.600 
you can tell the difference but
a lot<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> stuff<00:02:20.860> that's<00:02:21.040> pewter<00:02:21.400> will

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
a lot of the stuff that's pewter will

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.370 
a lot of the stuff that's pewter will
actually<00:02:21.970> say<00:02:22.150> pewter<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.870> bottom<00:02:23.230> oh

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
actually say pewter on the bottom oh

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.030 
actually say pewter on the bottom oh
yeah<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:25.020> literally<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.770> scrap

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
yeah and you can literally in a scrap

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.390 
yeah and you can literally in a scrap
pan<00:02:27.310> melt<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.600> your<00:02:29.380> your<00:02:29.740> your<00:02:30.130> stovetop

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
pan melt this on your your your stovetop

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.660 
pan melt this on your your your stovetop
or<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.390> grill<00:02:31.660> yeah<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.230> you'll<00:02:33.100> just<00:02:33.370> see

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
or on a grill yeah and you'll just see

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.820 
or on a grill yeah and you'll just see
it<00:02:33.790> liquefy<00:02:34.570> right<00:02:34.930> right<00:02:35.320> before<00:02:35.650> your<00:02:35.800> eyes

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
it liquefy right right before your eyes

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.020 
it liquefy right right before your eyes
and<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.540> pour<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.350> from<00:02:38.560> your<00:02:38.920> from<00:02:39.670> your<00:02:39.700> pan

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
and you pour it from your from your pan

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.170 
and you pour it from your from your pan
into<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.960> tray<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.890> be<00:02:42.460> able<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.820> make<00:02:43.000> your

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
into the tray and be able to make your

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.510 
into the tray and be able to make your
ingots<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.840> way<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:45.130> know<00:02:45.220> when<00:02:45.400> you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
ingots that way and you know when you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.210 
ingots that way and you know when you
once<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.910> have<00:02:46.150> them<00:02:46.390> sized<00:02:46.630> properly

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
once you have them sized properly

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.770 
once you have them sized properly
they're<00:02:48.220> they're<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:48.760> much<00:02:48.880> easier<00:02:48.940> as<00:02:49.540> Nate

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
they're they're so much easier as Nate

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.650 
they're they're so much easier as Nate
says<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:50.530> grab<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.730> assortment<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
says to just grab the assortment you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.810 
says to just grab the assortment you
need<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.140> be<00:02:53.320> able<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.650> make<00:02:54.190> whatever<00:02:54.460> it<00:02:54.700> is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
need to be able to make whatever it is

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.100 
need to be able to make whatever it is
that<00:02:54.940> you're<00:02:55.060> gonna<00:02:55.150> make<00:02:55.390> yeah<00:02:55.750> we'll<00:02:55.990> do

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
that you're gonna make yeah we'll do

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.670 
that you're gonna make yeah we'll do
full<00:02:56.410> cast<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.010> gets<00:02:57.160> for<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.550> little<00:02:58.270> tiny

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
full cast and gets for this little tiny

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.220 
full cast and gets for this little tiny
yeah<00:02:59.680> single<00:03:00.040> serving<00:03:00.370> muffins<00:03:01.230> bite-sized

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
yeah single serving muffins bite-sized

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.580 
yeah single serving muffins bite-sized
muffin<00:03:02.560> tray<00:03:02.770> now<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.420> for<00:03:05.020> this<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
muffin tray now the for this that the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.560 
muffin tray now the for this that the
tray<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:06.220> aluminum<00:03:06.940> yes

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
tray is aluminum yes

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.960 
tray is aluminum yes
so<00:03:08.230> therefore<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:09.130> like<00:03:09.280> got<00:03:09.490> twice<00:03:09.760> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
so therefore it's like got twice the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.930 
so therefore it's like got twice the
melting<00:03:10.240> point<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:11.710> therefore<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.520> you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
melting point and therefore you can you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.350 
melting point and therefore you can you
can<00:03:13.210> melt<00:03:13.540> pewter<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.440> put<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.220> into<00:03:15.550> aluminum

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
can melt pewter and put it into aluminum

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.460 
can melt pewter and put it into aluminum
and<00:03:16.710> it's<00:03:17.710> not<00:03:17.980> going<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.820> stick<00:03:19.810> it's<00:03:20.200> not

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
and it's not going to stick it's not

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.940 
and it's not going to stick it's not
going<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.250> melt<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.480> aluminum<00:03:23.020> so<00:03:23.650> you're

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
going to melt the aluminum so you're

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.010 
going to melt the aluminum so you're
you're<00:03:24.340> safe<00:03:24.580> there<00:03:24.850> yeah<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.270> always<00:03:25.660> the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
you're safe there yeah you always the

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.930 
you're safe there yeah you always the
trick<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.440> with<00:03:26.740> you<00:03:27.160> know<00:03:27.220> with<00:03:27.520> metalworking

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
trick is with you know with metalworking

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.060 
trick is with you know with metalworking
especially<00:03:28.420> with<00:03:28.540> pewter<00:03:28.780> it's<00:03:29.350> easy<00:03:29.620> because

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
especially with pewter it's easy because

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.980 
especially with pewter it's easy because
everything<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.030> use<00:03:31.270> pretty<00:03:31.570> much<00:03:31.750> has<00:03:31.959> a

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
everything you use pretty much has a

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.710 
everything you use pretty much has a
higher<00:03:32.170> melting<00:03:32.380> point<00:03:32.730> then<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.420> pewter

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
higher melting point then the pewter

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.930 
higher melting point then the pewter
does<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.650> trays<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.250> use<00:03:36.430> just<00:03:36.670> for

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
does so the trays that you use just for

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.210 
does so the trays that you use just for
baking<00:03:37.300> corn<00:03:38.260> muffins<00:03:38.650> there's<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.070> higher

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
baking corn muffins there's a higher

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.070 
baking corn muffins there's a higher
melting<00:03:39.459> point<00:03:39.640> than<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.840> stovetop

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
melting point than it and the stovetop

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.590 
melting point than it and the stovetop
stuff<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.770> you<00:03:41.860> use<00:03:42.100> again<00:03:43.090> because<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
stuff that you use again because the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.210 
stuff that you use again because the
temperatures<00:03:44.020> on<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> stovetop<00:03:44.470> can<00:03:44.920> get<00:03:45.070> high

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
temperatures on a stovetop can get high

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.949 
temperatures on a stovetop can get high
enough<00:03:45.490> to<00:03:45.700> melt<00:03:45.850> pewter<00:03:46.180> now<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:46.780> gonna<00:03:46.870> be

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
enough to melt pewter now it's gonna be

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.960 
enough to melt pewter now it's gonna be
the<00:03:47.140> hottest<00:03:47.350> thing<00:03:47.709> you've<00:03:47.890> ever<00:03:48.070> cooked<00:03:48.370> on

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
the hottest thing you've ever cooked on

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.620 
the hottest thing you've ever cooked on
a<00:03:49.330> stovetop<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:51.190> spill<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.510> know

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
a stovetop and you spill it and you know

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.330 
a stovetop and you spill it and you know
it's<00:03:52.780> not<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.200> not<00:03:53.380> on<00:03:53.500> me<00:03:53.680> what<00:03:53.890> happens<00:03:54.190> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
it's not it's not on me what happens to
