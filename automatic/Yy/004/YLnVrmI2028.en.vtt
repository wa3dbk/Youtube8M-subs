00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 first fucking today I want to talk to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.529
 you about mobile video cards 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.809
 worth our laptops wanna squeeze out of them 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.460
 maximum to show you how it's done and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.790
 Plus, I want to show the program 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
 which accelerates accelerating the system 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.880
 first program we will 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 use is called am i say after 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.380
 burner 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.880
 and the second program is razer game booster 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 us using the first program we raise 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.369
 process video cleanliness and video memory 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.340
 and with the help of 2 programs we will 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 mark unnecessary processes and this should 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.590
 help us speed up the system and improve 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 performance you start perhaps with 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.780
 programs m and site of the burner 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.170
 program for overclocking video process so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.850
 as we have a video processor notebook us 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 fan speed is not available 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 which is responsible for the rotational speed 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.140
 fan and since we have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.000
 there is no separate cooling system for 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 video process Saratov us this parameter 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.270
 then the other two parameters 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.710
 bark clock &amp; memory clock is available 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.939
 there is the first is the core frequency 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.520
 and the second video memory frequency is here you 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.860
 see that I'm more or less for myself 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.350
 customized you can customize by 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.830
 differently but a little bit 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.240
 I took on 40 values ​​increased 4040 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 Now if you look it looks like this 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 something like this for 40 increase 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.840
 and then you get the value that you 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 best fit forget also about 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.450
 the temperature 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 if you look at the maximum 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.250
 shown 100 degrees but also better 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.430
 noted that 100 degrees is suitable for 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.920
 stationary video cards which have their own 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.520
 I picked up a fan for me 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.970
 temperature of 70 degrees i.e. this 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 moment 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.820
 playing may hang for lagging and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.090
 look at this moment is reset 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.969
 frequency starts all over again but now 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.210
 70 degrees but 7 chernous is for me 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.219
 the limit is that is in the set they sweated 70 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.090
 degrees are normal and here in the game already 70 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.979
 degrees will be very, very bad 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.440
 so what else did I want to tell you on 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.110
 Basically everything in this program is nothing 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.910
 there is no difficult thing for a laptop here 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.690
 as soon as two parameters are available 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.209
 settings in principle can be watered to 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.880
 select geforce graphics processor 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.510
 840 m in my case I have nothing here 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.080
 put chose nothing like put 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.670
 for yourself to check frequencies 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.550
 they help you or not go into the game 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.180
 and gradually increase and 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.820
 cleanliness 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.320
 Now on the example of the game witcher 3 I want 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.820
 show you how much I am 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.860
 raised with that way but alas it will be 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.070
 not video but just screenshots 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.140
 before and after the fact that all programs 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:01.050
 records on the laptop they devour 23 24 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.660
 frame and very bad this 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.860
 The situation is that I play at 30 for example 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.470
 writing down at 26 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.630
 I can not pass you all the possibilities 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.100
 this overclocking therefore only screenshots 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.100
 but I think that's enough 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.860
 Now let's talk about the program razer game 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.930
 booster it is needed to 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.040
 speed up system shut down unnecessary 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.200
 service processes and other 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.580
 clean ozu and even turn off and 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.100
 explorer.exe here it should you gentle and 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.630
 speed up the system 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.860
 let's go through the program and 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:18.410
 let's see what she can in the diagnosis we 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:23.120
 we can learn error reports 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.710
 debugging some gaming processes 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:33.990
 defragmenting games release was easier 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:36.960
 You can find the driver to put the frequency 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.009
 frames to be displayed here 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.830
 here 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:46.490
 buns let's see how the game 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.550
 will react to this program will accelerate 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.419
 razer game booster witch and will raise 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.419
 frame rate 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.840
 a total of one or two frames I confess 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.290
 expected a little more from this 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.290
 programs 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.060
 such small actions are needed to 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.430
 overclocking process video laptops 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.010
 praseodymium boosters i will just say briefly 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.610
 what seems to me on his forehead like he doesn't 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:34.080
 helps you can at 12 weight but it 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.300
 imperceptibly that's why use them 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.430
 use decide for yourself today 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.050
 all subscribe put like if you 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.550
 need help leave your question in 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.330
 comments or just email me 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.700
 in contact with 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.700
 and now I wish you good luck and bye
