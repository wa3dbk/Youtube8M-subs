what<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> did<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.470> make<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.770> bones<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
what I did is just to make the bones a

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.670 
what I did is just to make the bones a
little<00:00:35.250> lighter<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.850> still<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.140> bone<00:00:37.320> marrows

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680

overnight<00:00:38.280> you're<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.760> obliged<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.720> this

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
overnight you're not obliged to do this

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
overnight you're not obliged to do this
but<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.320> does<00:00:40.440> make<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.860> much<00:00:41.130> more<00:00:41.340> appealing

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but it does make it much more appealing

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700 
but it does make it much more appealing
then<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> did<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.350> clean

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
then what I did is just you you clean

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.600 
then what I did is just you you clean
the<00:00:44.070> excess<00:00:44.489> meat<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.430> just<00:00:47.430> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the excess meat that's on it just so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790 
the excess meat that's on it just so
that<00:00:47.790> you<00:00:48.720> know<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.200> smell<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.560> better

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that you know the smell will be better

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.590 
that you know the smell will be better
and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.130> it's<00:00:50.340> nice<00:00:50.580> it's<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.120> presentable

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and then it's nice it's more presentable

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.150 
and then it's nice it's more presentable
so<00:00:51.720> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.050> greet<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.830> bone<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.130> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
so you can just greet the bone like that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.000 
so you can just greet the bone like that
and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.580> meat<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.910> come<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> then

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
and then the meat will come out and then

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.230 
and then the meat will come out and then
we<00:00:56.010> shouldn't<00:00:56.220> transfer<00:00:56.610> any<00:00:56.760> everything

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
we shouldn't transfer any everything

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.920 
we shouldn't transfer any everything
into<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.540> roasting<00:00:57.990> pan<00:00:58.020> here

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
into a roasting pan here

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.810 
into a roasting pan here
and<00:00:59.220> you'll<00:01:00.220> see<00:01:00.430> that<00:01:00.460> this<00:01:00.640> is<00:01:00.700> really

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
and you'll see that this is really

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.540 
and you'll see that this is really
simple<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.510> cook<00:01:01.690> because<00:01:01.900> fat<00:01:02.560> is<00:01:02.590> all<00:01:03.040> in<00:01:03.370> the

simple to cook because fat is all in the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.490 
simple to cook because fat is all in the
bone<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:03.910> inside<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.390> meat<00:01:04.540> so<00:01:04.720> everything
