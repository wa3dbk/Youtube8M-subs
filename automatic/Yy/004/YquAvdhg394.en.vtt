00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi all friends with you marry and this 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.150
 video about extra lenses for 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.700
 mobile phone 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 this is ander five dollars buy buy 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.400
 which costs less than 5 dollars I bought 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.859
 them through ebay and paid 4 dollars 80 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.880
 cents 3 lenses each with different 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 opportunities 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.100
 lens fisheye fisheye strange name 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 does a fish see so white engle 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.960
 wide google and macro lens for shooting 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 from very close distances 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 these lenses are quite rich there are two 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 caps in order to be able to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.210
 protect the lenses from damage also 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.640
 there is a good carrying case 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 clothespin for attaching lenses to the phone to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 This clothespin lens is screwed with 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.050
 threading aid for testing these lenses 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 I used my phone lg nexus 5 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 Immediately for comparison, I filmed 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.899
 short video timelapse without 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.500
 extra lenses can appreciate 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500
 quality 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.150
 well, then I fixed the lens fisheye 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.930
 I adjusted my mouth slightly and filmed 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.240
 this movie 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.700
 capture angle of course much more but 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.740
 as you see along the edges of the video frame is very 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.870
 zamylennye further I thought that one of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 scripts used the phone and these 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.640
 additional lenses will use 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 them in the car as a DVR 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.300
 car phone holder 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.190
 I unfortunately not so I 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.440
 tested it all in the air 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.640
 here is the first video without any lenses 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.690
 sorry for the shaking image 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.940
 I just did not have enough hands and this shot 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.040
 lens white jungle angle frame 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.050
 here of course more but the image by 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.690
 the edges too zamylen and yes indeed but 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.700
 other distorted colors focusing same 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.830
 not so clear have a fisheye lens 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.360
 frame capture angle is the largest 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.580
 problems with slipping colors and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350
 focusing remain but i think 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.320
 using one of these lenses and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.450
 phone as a DVR 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.590
 maybe we will go over the photos 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.520
 do 1 photo 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.270
 immediately for comparison without a lens then swine 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.270
 write down oh 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.700
 and another one with a white eng lens 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.360
 with extra lenses again no 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.849
 clarity 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.159
 and now we go to this macro 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.019
 I liked the lens most at once 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.030
 for comparison made a photo without a lens 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.970
 to show the possibility of the phone and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.590
 then fix the macro lens and look 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.590
 and the photo came out 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.620
 plus these mini lenses they are cheap with 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.750
 they can get more interesting 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.550
 footage than with conventional camera and a smartphone 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.560
 minus is that the quality of photos and videos 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.540
 noticeably worse, but the script 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.910
 uses can be very different 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.010
 here it all depends on your imagination well 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.930
 and with you was marry put like if you 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.000
 at least like my video and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.240
 Watch my other videos all 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.240
 until 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.310
 we
