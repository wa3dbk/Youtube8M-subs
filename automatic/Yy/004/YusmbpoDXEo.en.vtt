second generation of SSDs that they've

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.550 
second generation of SSDs that they've
come<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.850> market<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:19.350> don't<00:00:19.470> really

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
come to market with and we don't really

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
come to market with and we don't really
have<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> box<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.460> unboxing<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
have a box to do an unboxing with but I

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.359 
have a box to do an unboxing with but I
am<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> take<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.320> apart<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.100> there<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
am going to take it apart so there is a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279 
am going to take it apart so there is a
closer<00:00:23.699> look<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> drive<00:00:24.570> itself<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.109> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
closer look at the drive itself this is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.500

this<00:00:53.219> SSD<00:00:53.550> real<00:00:53.850> quick<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.420> was

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this SSD real quick because I was

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
this SSD real quick because I was
curious<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.050> controller<00:00:55.500> used<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.370> we

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
curious what controller used but here we

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
curious what controller used but here we
can<00:00:56.640> actually<00:00:56.789> also<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> nand<00:00:58.020> flash

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
can actually also see the nand flash

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.189 
can actually also see the nand flash
modules<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.100> included<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.789> have<00:01:00.030> 8<00:01:00.239> 16

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
modules that are included we have 8 16

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.139

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
128 gigs 120 of that is usable and we

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.359 
128 gigs 120 of that is usable and we
could<00:01:07.110> tell<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.439> labeling<00:01:07.830> actually<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
could tell by the labeling actually that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
could tell by the labeling actually that
these<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.090> NAND<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.510> actually<00:01:09.869> manufactured

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
these this NAND is actually manufactured

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
these this NAND is actually manufactured
by<00:01:10.680> sam<00:01:11.040> discs<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.580> they're<00:01:11.729> using<00:01:11.760> their<00:01:12.030> own

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
by sam discs so they're using their own

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.920 
by sam discs so they're using their own
