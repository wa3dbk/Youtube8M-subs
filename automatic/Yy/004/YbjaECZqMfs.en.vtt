I think I just a bit don't hit points
and<00:03:20.100> performance<00:03:20.489> job<00:03:20.810> as<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.019> see<00:03:22.260> they

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
and performance job as you can see they

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
and performance job as you can see they
attack<00:03:22.739> with<00:03:22.950> three<00:03:23.190> different<00:03:23.370> kinds<00:03:23.700> they

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
attack with three different kinds they

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.090 
attack with three different kinds they
attacked<00:03:24.269> with<00:03:24.480> melee<00:03:24.840> range<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.560> magic

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
attacked with melee range and magic

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.370 
attacked with melee range and magic
magic<00:03:26.760> seems<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.060> hit<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.329> highest<00:03:27.720> if<00:03:28.200> that

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
magic seems to hit the highest if that

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.539 
magic seems to hit the highest if that
just<00:03:28.530> might<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.769> because<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> video<00:03:29.370> I'm

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549
