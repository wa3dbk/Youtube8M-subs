00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it looks really high res and shiny the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
it looks really high res and shiny the
old<00:01:06.990> textures<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.590> polygons<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.100> clearly

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
old textures and polygons are clearly

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
old textures and polygons are clearly
old<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.450> work<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:09.780> been<00:01:09.840> done<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
old and not much work has been done to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
old and not much work has been done to
them<00:01:10.320> however<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.460> doesn't<00:01:11.670> lag<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.060> all

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
them however the game doesn't lag at all

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
them however the game doesn't lag at all
and<00:01:12.479> overall<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:13.890> matches

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and overall I think it actually matches

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
and overall I think it actually matches
the<00:01:14.250> gameplay<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.390> how<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> b-movie

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the gameplay kind of like how a b-movie

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
the gameplay kind of like how a b-movie
has<00:01:16.320> cheesy<00:01:16.619> effects<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> definitely

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
has cheesy effects well it definitely

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910 
has cheesy effects well it definitely
matches<00:01:18.240> their<00:01:18.570> throws<00:01:18.780> mm<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.590> regard

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
matches their throws mm in that regard

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.859 
matches their throws mm in that regard

to press them easy enough the only

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.240

downside<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> game<00:02:07.979> has<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> very

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
downside is that the game has a very

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.490 
downside is that the game has a very
flake<00:02:08.670> physics<00:02:09.179> model<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.140> use<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
flake physics model and if I use the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.260 
flake physics model and if I use the
games<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.860> Gran<00:02:11.069> Turismo<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.879> may<00:02:12.000> find<00:02:12.180> the
