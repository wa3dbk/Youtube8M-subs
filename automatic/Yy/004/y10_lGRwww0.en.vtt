00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
on them so I open up one of them this is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
on them so I open up one of them this is
quite<00:00:49.860> light<00:00:50.780> it's<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> decent<00:00:52.379> size<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.219> let's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
quite light it's a decent size so let's

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.600 
quite light it's a decent size so let's
see<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.300> there's<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> length<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.010> open<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
see so there's the length if I open it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.189 
see so there's the length if I open it
up<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.440> that's<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> width<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.780> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
up and that's the width so it's it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.170 
up and that's the width so it's it's
good<00:01:01.440> enough<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.920> wrap<00:01:02.789> twice<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
good enough to wrap twice I think and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
good enough to wrap twice I think and
i'll<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.330> show<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.540> guys<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.260> cats<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.890> them
