you<00:00:35.790> lose<00:00:36.059> fat<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.260> problem<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:38.010> most<00:00:38.460> diets

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you lose fat the problem with most diets

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.630 
you lose fat the problem with most diets
is<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:40.500> lose<00:00:40.770> fat<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.120> also<00:00:42.420> lose<00:00:43.640> lean

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
is you lose fat but you also lose lean

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.170 
is you lose fat but you also lose lean
mass<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.450> slows<00:00:45.960> your<00:00:46.140> metabolism<00:00:46.200> down

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
mass and that slows your metabolism down

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
mass and that slows your metabolism down
so<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:49.980> eat

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
so when you go back when you then eat

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.090 
so when you go back when you then eat
what<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> were<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.989> amount<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.530> were<00:00:52.649> eating

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
what you were the amount you were eating

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.270 
what you were the amount you were eating
or<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.910> calories<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.780> meeting<00:00:55.280> after

you're<00:00:56.399> done<00:00:56.579> dieting<00:00:57.239> since<00:00:57.539> you've<00:00:57.690> slowed

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
you're done dieting since you've slowed

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.650 
you're done dieting since you've slowed
your<00:00:58.199> metabolism<00:00:58.949> down<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.760> put<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> fat<00:01:00.449> on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
your metabolism down you put the fat on

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.490 
your metabolism down you put the fat on
faster

because<00:02:08.550> you've<00:02:09.119> lost<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.840> glycogen

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
because you've lost all your glycogen

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.070 
because you've lost all your glycogen
stores<00:02:10.830> which<00:02:11.220> are<00:02:11.400> your<00:02:11.840> carbohydrate

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
stores which are your carbohydrate

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.440 
stores which are your carbohydrate
reserves<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.980> your<00:02:14.100> muscle<00:02:14.520> which<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.700> which

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
reserves in your muscle which is which

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.230 
reserves in your muscle which is which
is<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.660> very<00:02:16.340> readily<00:02:17.340> available<00:02:17.490> energy

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
is a very readily available energy

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.140 
is a very readily available energy
source<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.750> your<00:02:18.840> muscles<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.410> use<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.610> then

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
source for your muscles to use and then

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.860 
source for your muscles to use and then
your<00:02:21.360> metabolism<00:02:22.080> slows<00:02:22.410> down<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:24.210> once

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
your metabolism slows down so then once

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.690 
your metabolism slows down so then once
you<00:02:25.020> bottomed<00:02:25.470> out<00:02:25.530> your<00:02:25.770> glycogen<00:02:26.070> stores

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you bottomed out your glycogen stores

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.910 
you bottomed out your glycogen stores
and<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> pull<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.960> actually<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.650> store

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
and you pull you actually to store

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.610 
and you pull you actually to store
glycogen<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.820> body<00:02:30.000> takes<00:02:30.330> glucose<00:02:30.870> links

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
glycogen your body takes glucose links

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.470 
glycogen your body takes glucose links
the<00:02:31.740> molecules<00:02:32.250> together<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.850> water<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the molecules together with water and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.330 
the molecules together with water and
that's<00:02:34.020> why<00:02:34.230> your<00:02:34.410> muscles<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.920> nice<00:02:35.040> and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that's why your muscles are nice and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.240 
that's why your muscles are nice and
full<00:02:35.550> when<00:02:35.880> you're<00:02:36.000> properly<00:02:36.480> carved<00:02:37.350> up<00:02:37.530> so

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
full when you're properly carved up so

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.820 
full when you're properly carved up so
when<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.820> drastically<00:02:39.780> lower<00:02:40.020> your<00:02:40.230> carbs<00:02:40.680> or

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
when you drastically lower your carbs or

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.010 
when you drastically lower your carbs or
your<00:02:40.950> calories<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.970> burn<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.420> your<00:02:42.720> glycogen

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
your calories you burn up your glycogen

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.600 
your calories you burn up your glycogen
and<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.710> water<00:02:43.920> comes<00:02:44.220> out<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.460> your

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and all the water comes out of your

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.060 
and all the water comes out of your
muscle<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.620> don't<00:02:46.830> have

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
muscle with it and then you don't have

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.430 
muscle with it and then you don't have
an<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.400> readily<00:02:48.030> available<00:02:48.120> energy<00:02:48.990> source<00:02:49.290> so

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
an a readily available energy source so

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.070 
an a readily available energy source so
your<00:02:49.680> metabolism<00:02:50.370> slows<00:02:50.520> down<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.840> every

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
your metabolism slows down so for every

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.250 
your metabolism slows down so for every
then<00:02:52.260> pound<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.950> fat<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.120> burn<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.630> also<00:02:55.020> burn

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
then pound of fat you burn you also burn

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.650 
then pound of fat you burn you also burn
to<00:02:55.440> pound<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.890> muscle<00:02:56.280> off<00:02:56.430> your<00:02:57.000> body<00:02:57.240> starts

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
to pound a muscle off your body starts

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.199 
to pound a muscle off your body starts
cannibalizing<00:02:58.530> its<00:02:58.680> own<00:02:58.830> muscle<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.970> your

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
cannibalizing its own muscle so your

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.810 
cannibalizing its own muscle so your
metabolism<00:03:00.959> slows<00:03:01.140> down<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
metabolism slows down and then it's a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.510 
metabolism slows down and then it's a
lot<00:03:02.970> easier<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> gain<00:03:04.110> fat<00:03:04.530> well<00:03:05.280> we

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
lot easier for you to gain fat well we

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.980 
lot easier for you to gain fat well we
want<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.820> figure<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.120> how<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.360> do<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:06.750> we

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
want to figure out how to do this we

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.560 
want to figure out how to do this we
want<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.290> make<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.670> easier<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.730> us<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.300> burn

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
want to make it easier for us to burn

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.040 
want to make it easier for us to burn
fat<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.670> what<00:03:11.670> we<00:03:11.820> want<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.270> when<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:12.660> start

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
fat so what we want to do when we start

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.260 
fat so what we want to do when we start
our<00:03:13.290> diet<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.070> we're<00:03:14.490> talking<00:03:14.790> about<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.970> diet

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
our diet and we're talking about a diet

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.300 
our diet and we're talking about a diet
here<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.350> lose<00:03:16.650> fat

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
here to lose fat

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.540 
here to lose fat
you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.060> also<00:03:18.239> diet<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.290> gain<00:03:19.769> muscle<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
you can also diet to gain muscle and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.840 
you can also diet to gain muscle and
that's<00:03:21.150> part<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.780> equation<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.610> want

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
that's part of the equation so we want

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.990 
that's part of the equation so we want
to<00:03:24.060> at<00:03:24.360> first<00:03:24.650> step<00:03:25.650> number<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.820> our

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
to at first step number one is just our

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.290 
to at first step number one is just our
overall<00:03:27.420> calories<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.800> we<00:03:29.430> don't<00:03:29.640> drastically

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
overall calories so we don't drastically

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.120 
overall calories so we don't drastically
deplete<00:03:30.660> our<00:03:30.810> glycogen<00:03:31.080> stores<00:03:31.620> what<00:03:31.830> we<00:03:31.950> want

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
deplete our glycogen stores what we want

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.070 
deplete our glycogen stores what we want
to<00:03:32.220> do<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.610> want<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.910> lose<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> pound<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:34.050> week

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
to do is we want to lose a pound a week

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.000 
to do is we want to lose a pound a week
and<00:03:34.730> then<00:03:35.730> what<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.150> do<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:37.110> we<00:03:37.800> have<00:03:37.830> a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
and then what we do is and we have a

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.740 
and then what we do is and we have a
thing<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.430> skin<00:03:38.730> fold<00:03:39.000> caliper<00:03:39.120> z'<00:03:39.570> and

thing on skin fold caliper z' and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.960 
thing on skin fold caliper z' and
they're<00:03:39.840> how<00:03:40.019> how<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.769> do<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:41.790> how<00:03:41.910> to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
they're how how to do you know how to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.000 
they're how how to do you know how to
take<00:03:42.180> your<00:03:42.330> body<00:03:42.510> fat<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.680> put<00:03:43.920> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
take your body fat is we put the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.280 
take your body fat is we put the
calipers<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.209> or<00:03:45.420> on<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.750> person<00:03:46.140> we're

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
calipers on you or on the person we're

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.350 
calipers on you or on the person we're
working<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.459> see<00:03:47.670> how<00:03:47.940> much<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.180> that

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
working with and we see how much of that

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.320 
working with and we see how much of that
pound<00:03:48.810> they<00:03:49.050> lost<00:03:49.320> was<00:03:49.590> fat<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.100> how<00:03:50.730> much<00:03:51.000> was

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
pound they lost was fat and how much was

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.380 
pound they lost was fat and how much was
muscle<00:03:51.810> or<00:03:52.200> lean<00:03:52.380> mass<00:03:52.739> now<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.580> was<00:03:53.760> all<00:03:54.000> fat

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
muscle or lean mass now if was all fat

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.240 
muscle or lean mass now if was all fat
we<00:03:54.720> keep<00:03:54.959> doing<00:03:55.200> what<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.680> were<00:03:55.830> doing

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
we keep doing what we were doing

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.290 
we keep doing what we were doing
if<00:03:56.600> it's<00:03:57.600> if<00:03:57.959> let's<00:03:58.920> say<00:03:59.070> 1/2<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.580> pound<00:03:59.760> was<00:04:00.060> fat

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
if it's if let's say 1/2 a pound was fat

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.600 
if it's if let's say 1/2 a pound was fat
but<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.660> half<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.080> pound<00:04:01.260> was<00:04:01.530> lean<00:04:01.800> mass<00:04:02.130> and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
but a half a pound was lean mass and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.190 
but a half a pound was lean mass and
that's<00:04:03.180> actually<00:04:03.420> you're<00:04:03.720> starting<00:04:04.140> to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
that's actually you're starting to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.410 
that's actually you're starting to
deplete<00:04:04.500> your<00:04:04.620> glycogen<00:04:04.920> stores<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.880> we

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
deplete your glycogen stores and we

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.759 
deplete your glycogen stores and we
don't<00:04:06.600> want<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.170> we<00:04:07.380> want<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.620> keep

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
don't want to do that we want to keep

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.310 
don't want to do that we want to keep
the<00:04:07.890> metabolism<00:04:08.430> revved<00:04:08.820> up<00:04:09.030> what<00:04:09.750> we<00:04:09.870> do<00:04:10.049> is

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
the metabolism revved up what we do is

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.860 
the metabolism revved up what we do is
we<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.799> adjust<00:04:11.060> or<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.299> can<00:04:12.420> adjust<00:04:12.540> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
we can adjust or we can adjust the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.600 
we can adjust or we can adjust the
aerobics<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.380> can<00:04:13.530> adjust<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.920> workouts<00:04:14.370> but

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
aerobics we can adjust the workouts but

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.880 
aerobics we can adjust the workouts but
one<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.480> prime<00:04:15.750> things<00:04:16.080> we<00:04:16.229> do<00:04:16.440> with<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
one of the prime things we do with the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.909 
one of the prime things we do with the
diet<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.580> we<00:04:18.090> adjust<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.630> ratio<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.229> protein

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
diet is we adjust the ratio of protein

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.090 
diet is we adjust the ratio of protein
to<00:04:20.330> carbohydrates<00:04:21.330> in<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> diet<00:04:21.740> that<00:04:22.740> ratio

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
to carbohydrates in the diet that ratio

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.090 
to carbohydrates in the diet that ratio
denotes<00:04:23.970> how<00:04:24.090> much<00:04:24.360> glucagon<00:04:25.110> which<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:26.070> a

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
denotes how much glucagon which is a

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.900 
denotes how much glucagon which is a
hormone<00:04:26.400> made

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
hormone made

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.580 
hormone made
to<00:04:27.000> burn<00:04:27.270> fat<00:04:27.600> for<00:04:27.840> energy<00:04:27.960> your<00:04:28.410> body

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
to burn fat for energy your body

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.250 
to burn fat for energy your body
produces<00:04:28.890> an<00:04:29.540> insulin<00:04:30.540> which<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.170> hormone

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
produces an insulin which is a hormone

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.360 
produces an insulin which is a hormone
that<00:04:32.100> makes<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.150> which<00:04:33.750> is<00:04:33.950> anabolic<00:04:34.950> but<00:04:35.190> too

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
that makes you which is anabolic but too

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.880 
that makes you which is anabolic but too
much<00:04:35.550> makes<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.060> store<00:04:36.390> fat<00:04:36.420> for<00:04:36.960> energy<00:04:37.050> so

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
much makes you store fat for energy so

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.630 
much makes you store fat for energy so
if<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.250> adjust<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.790> protein<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.720> carburation

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
if we adjust that protein to carburation

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.120 
if we adjust that protein to carburation
we<00:04:41.640> can<00:04:41.910> adjust<00:04:42.600> how<00:04:43.110> much<00:04:43.170> glucagon<00:04:44.100> and

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
we can adjust how much glucagon and

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.170 
we can adjust how much glucagon and
insulin<00:04:44.730> our<00:04:45.300> body<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.870> releasing<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.910> we<00:04:47.910> can

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
insulin our body is releasing and we can

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.800 
insulin our body is releasing and we can
then<00:04:48.450> make<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:49.020> burn<00:04:49.710> more<00:04:50.010> fat<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.730> burn<00:04:51.570> more

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
then make it burn more fat and burn more

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.420 
then make it burn more fat and burn more
fat<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.410> store<00:04:52.800> less<00:04:53.130> fat<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:55.010> that's<00:04:56.010> one<00:04:56.340> of

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
fat and store less fat so that's one of

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.950 
fat and store less fat so that's one of
that's<00:04:56.640> one<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.000> first<00:04:57.240> things<00:04:57.480> we<00:04:57.630> can<00:04:57.810> do

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
that's one of the first things we can do

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.520 
that's one of the first things we can do
is<00:04:58.230> adjust<00:04:58.860> our<00:04:59.340> protein<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.090> carb<00:05:00.330> ratio<00:05:00.600> now

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
is adjust our protein to carb ratio now

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.000 
is adjust our protein to carb ratio now
you<00:05:01.590> can<00:05:01.860> look<00:05:02.040> at<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:03.320> we<00:05:04.320> look<00:05:04.710> at<00:05:04.830> this

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
you can look at this is we look at this

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.260 
you can look at this is we look at this
another<00:05:05.280> way<00:05:05.460> we<00:05:05.610> look<00:05:05.790> at<00:05:05.910> this<00:05:06.000> is<00:05:06.240> how

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
another way we look at this is how

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.660 
another way we look at this is how
insulin<00:05:07.050> reactive<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.770> are<00:05:07.950> to<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.250> carbs

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
insulin reactive you are to the carbs

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.910 
insulin reactive you are to the carbs
you<00:05:08.760> eat<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.810> person<00:05:10.320> that's<00:05:10.470> let's<00:05:10.740> say<00:05:10.830> a

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
you eat so a person that's let's say a

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.850 
you eat so a person that's let's say a
hard<00:05:11.220> gainer<00:05:11.580> he<00:05:12.570> has<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.810> hard<00:05:13.170> time<00:05:13.290> putting

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
hard gainer he has a hard time putting

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.680 
hard gainer he has a hard time putting
on<00:05:14.100> muscle<00:05:14.340> he<00:05:14.970> also<00:05:15.090> has<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.360> hard<00:05:15.630> time

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
on muscle he also has a hard time

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.080 
on muscle he also has a hard time
putting<00:05:16.110> on<00:05:16.290> fat<00:05:16.560> because<00:05:17.280> we<00:05:17.400> know<00:05:17.520> insulins

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
putting on fat because we know insulins

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.030 
putting on fat because we know insulins
anabolic<00:05:18.660> but<00:05:18.810> insulin<00:05:19.200> makes<00:05:19.380> fat<00:05:19.620> so<00:05:19.890> when

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
anabolic but insulin makes fat so when

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.920 
anabolic but insulin makes fat so when
he<00:05:20.100> eats<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.400> lot<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.580> carbs<00:05:21.060> he<00:05:21.450> doesn't<00:05:21.780> put<00:05:21.900> on

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
he eats a lot of carbs he doesn't put on

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.990 
he eats a lot of carbs he doesn't put on
much<00:05:22.230> fat<00:05:22.500> he<00:05:23.040> doesn't<00:05:23.340> put<00:05:23.460> on<00:05:23.490> much<00:05:23.730> muscle

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
much fat he doesn't put on much muscle

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.040 
much fat he doesn't put on much muscle
easy<00:05:24.330> either

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
easy either

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.130 
easy either
a<00:05:25.230> person<00:05:26.010> that's<00:05:26.160> very<00:05:26.540> insulin<00:05:27.540> reactive

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
a person that's very insulin reactive

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.870 
a person that's very insulin reactive
that<00:05:28.380> really<00:05:28.680> responds<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.340> insulin<00:05:29.700> it's

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
that really responds to insulin it's

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.820 
that really responds to insulin it's
real<00:05:30.060> easy<00:05:30.240> for<00:05:30.390> him<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.720> put<00:05:30.900> on<00:05:30.930> fat<00:05:31.260> it's

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
real easy for him to put on fat it's

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.020 
real easy for him to put on fat it's
usually<00:05:32.040> easy<00:05:32.520> for<00:05:32.790> him<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:32.970> put<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.270> muscle<00:05:33.600> so

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
usually easy for him to put on muscle so

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.240 
usually easy for him to put on muscle so
so<00:05:36.030> we<00:05:36.540> have<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.930> really<00:05:37.170> watch<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.740> amounts

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
so we have to really watch the amounts

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.820 
so we have to really watch the amounts
and<00:05:38.400> types<00:05:38.670> of<00:05:38.940> carbs<00:05:39.480> he<00:05:40.020> or<00:05:40.170> she<00:05:40.440> will<00:05:40.650> eat

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
and types of carbs he or she will eat

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.400 
and types of carbs he or she will eat
and<00:05:41.100> that's<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.820> wild<00:05:42.240> card<00:05:42.600> and<00:05:42.930> how<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.110> do

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
and that's the wild card and how you do

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.850 
and that's the wild card and how you do
this<00:05:43.620> is<00:05:43.980> getting<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:45.350> protein<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.530> carb

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
this is getting the protein the carb

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.670 
this is getting the protein the carb
ratio<00:05:47.130> just<00:05:47.880> right<00:05:48.180> for<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.570> individual<00:05:49.320> to

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
ratio just right for the individual to

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.950 
ratio just right for the individual to
denote<00:05:50.520> how<00:05:50.700> much<00:05:50.880> glucagon<00:05:51.600> and<00:05:51.630> insulin

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
denote how much glucagon and insulin

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.110 
denote how much glucagon and insulin
your<00:05:52.350> body<00:05:52.410> puts<00:05:52.919> out<00:05:53.160> so<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.970> they're

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
your body puts out so that they're

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.900 
your body puts out so that they're
burning<00:05:54.360> all<00:05:54.780> fat<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.350> not<00:05:55.710> muscle<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:56.760> that

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
burning all fat and not muscle so that

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.640 
burning all fat and not muscle so that
they<00:05:57.030> keep<00:05:57.240> their<00:05:57.419> metabolism<00:05:58.230> going<00:05:58.410> and

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
they keep their metabolism going and

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.680 
they keep their metabolism going and
they<00:05:58.710> don't<00:05:58.890> slow<00:05:59.070> their<00:05:59.340> metabolism<00:06:00.000> down<00:06:00.150> so

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
they don't slow their metabolism down so

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.390 
they don't slow their metabolism down so
as<00:06:00.870> they're<00:06:01.050> dieting<00:06:01.620> they<00:06:01.800> can<00:06:01.950> actually<00:06:02.130> get

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
as they're dieting they can actually get

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.430 
as they're dieting they can actually get
healthier<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.060> as<00:06:03.450> they<00:06:03.570> if<00:06:03.870> they<00:06:04.080> do<00:06:04.140> it

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
healthier and as they if they do it

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.350 
healthier and as they if they do it
right<00:06:04.710> they<00:06:05.250> can<00:06:05.430> actually<00:06:05.580> speed<00:06:06.150> their

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
right they can actually speed their

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.050 
right they can actually speed their
metabolism<00:06:07.140> up<00:06:07.290> as<00:06:07.470> we<00:06:07.740> as<00:06:08.250> we<00:06:08.430> continue<00:06:08.940> with

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
metabolism up as we as we continue with

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.500 
metabolism up as we as we continue with
this<00:06:09.180> process<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:10.500> they<00:06:10.830> can<00:06:11.010> actually<00:06:11.510> become

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
this process so they can actually become

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.050 
this process so they can actually become
a<00:06:12.780> lot<00:06:13.110> leaner<00:06:13.410> and<00:06:13.650> a<00:06:13.890> lot<00:06:14.070> healthier<00:06:14.370> buy<00:06:14.790> and

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
a lot leaner and a lot healthier buy and

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.850 
a lot leaner and a lot healthier buy and
eat<00:06:15.419> a<00:06:15.450> lot<00:06:15.720> more<00:06:15.900> foods<00:06:16.290> if<00:06:16.530> they<00:06:16.620> eat<00:06:16.770> the

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
eat a lot more foods if they eat the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.070 
eat a lot more foods if they eat the
right<00:06:17.040> types<00:06:17.070> of<00:06:17.460> foods<00:06:18.110> so<00:06:19.110> in<00:06:19.440> step<00:06:19.940> two

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
right types of foods so in step two

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.570 
right types of foods so in step two
we'll<00:06:22.080> go<00:06:22.200> over<00:06:22.560> some<00:06:22.800> of<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:22.950> ways<00:06:23.100> we<00:06:23.310> can<00:06:23.430> do

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
we'll go over some of the ways we can do

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.790 
we'll go over some of the ways we can do
this
