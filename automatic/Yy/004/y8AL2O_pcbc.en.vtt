00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:08.579 
think that using it for about a month is

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:11.809 
think that using it for about a month is
giving<00:06:08.939> it<00:06:09.059> a<00:06:09.209> definite<00:06:10.489> decent<00:06:11.489> amount<00:06:11.699> of

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
giving it a definite decent amount of

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.639 
giving it a definite decent amount of

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:13.649 
time to be able to test something so

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.679 
time to be able to test something so
that<00:06:13.769> I<00:06:13.799> can<00:06:14.069> review<00:06:14.219> it<00:06:14.459> and<00:06:14.579> then<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:15.479> funny

it<00:07:17.580> in<00:07:17.760> the<00:07:17.850> bin<00:07:17.880> it<00:07:18.630> may<00:07:18.810> not<00:07:18.930> work<00:07:18.990> for<00:07:19.290> me<00:07:19.350> but

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
it in the bin it may not work for me but

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.380 
it in the bin it may not work for me but
it<00:07:19.710> may<00:07:19.830> work<00:07:20.010> for<00:07:20.250> you<00:07:20.430> so<00:07:20.640> I<00:07:20.670> think<00:07:20.790> it<00:07:21.090> is<00:07:21.120> one

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390 
it may work for you so I think it is one

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.930 
it may work for you so I think it is one
of<00:07:21.420> those<00:07:21.890> it<00:07:22.890> depends<00:07:23.370> kind<00:07:23.610> of<00:07:23.730> things

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
of those it depends kind of things

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.880 
of those it depends kind of things
