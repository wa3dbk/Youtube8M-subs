00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
but I really do believe that when we

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.979 
but I really do believe that when we
perform<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.120> best<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.840> we're

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
perform the best it's because we're

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
perform the best it's because we're
having<00:00:46.230> fun<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.820> from<00:00:48.059> feeling

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
having fun so how do we get from feeling

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
having fun so how do we get from feeling
like<00:00:48.510> crap<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.440> airplanes<00:00:49.800> bouncing

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
like crap because the airplanes bouncing

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.590 
like crap because the airplanes bouncing
around<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> way<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> altitude<00:00:51.239> you're<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
around on the way to altitude you're on

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.209 
around on the way to altitude you're on
borrowed<00:00:51.840> gear<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.500> kind<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.770> dark<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
borrowed gear and it's kind of dark and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.430 
borrowed gear and it's kind of dark and
you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.730> where<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.390> these<00:00:54.750> things<00:00:55.050> adding

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you know where all these things adding

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.549 
you know where all these things adding
up<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:57.030> make<00:00:57.329> us<00:00:57.449> feel<00:00:57.570> pretty<00:00:57.840> lousy<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.350> we

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
up can make us feel pretty lousy and we

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
up can make us feel pretty lousy and we
cannot<00:00:58.920> perform<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.489> well<00:00:59.550> when<00:01:00.059> we're

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cannot perform very well when we're

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
cannot perform very well when we're
feeling<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.710> I've<00:01:01.829> been

airplane I want to perform to the best
of<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.799> ability<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.549> only<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
of my ability not only because it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.929 
of my ability not only because it
protects<00:01:39.450> me<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:39.630> danger<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.759> also

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
protects me from danger but it also

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.859 
protects me from danger but it also
always<00:01:42.270> more<00:01:42.630> fun<00:01:43.520> skill<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.700> better<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.570> every

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
always more fun skill is better on every

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.760 
always more fun skill is better on every
level<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> how<00:01:48.930> does<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> fit<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.590> your

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
better and then look for the solutions

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.380 
better and then look for the solutions
from<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.530> state<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:25.920> mind<00:02:26.070> whew<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.300> a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.490 
hard thing that's like enlightenment it
really<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:32.240> that's<00:02:33.240> why<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.350> would<00:02:34.470> be

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
really is that's why I think it would be

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.080 
really is that's why I think it would be

and it comes back again to what William
James<00:03:28.110> was<00:03:28.350> trying<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.860> teach<00:03:29.340> us<00:03:29.580> about

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
James was trying to teach us about

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.800 
James was trying to teach us about
emotion<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:32.610> we<00:03:32.820> can't<00:03:33.150> do<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.660> with

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
emotion is that we can't do it with

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.390 
emotion is that we can't do it with
thought<00:03:34.020> alone<00:03:34.200> word<00:03:34.620> because<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.070> thoughts

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
thought alone word because the thoughts

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.340 
thought alone word because the thoughts
that<00:03:35.520> we<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.820> access<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.600> at<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> time<00:03:37.080> are

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
that we have access to at the time are

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.199 
that we have access to at the time are
limited<00:03:37.800> based<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.910> how<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.120> feel<00:03:39.660> at<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.110> time

is<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.420> they<00:03:48.540> talk<00:03:48.720> about<00:03:48.750> gut<00:03:49.200> check<00:03:49.470> too<00:03:49.770> so

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
is that they talk about gut check too so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.540 
is that they talk about gut check too so
before<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:51.120> into<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.480> situation<00:03:52.550> how

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
before you get into the situation how

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.580 
before you get into the situation how
does<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.820> feel<00:03:53.970> right<00:03:54.239> here<00:03:54.450> if<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.320> doesn't

feel good there's one or two

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.479 
feel good there's one or two
possibilities<00:03:58.380> one<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.980> are<00:03:59.160> unprepared

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
possibilities one is you are unprepared

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.640 
possibilities one is you are unprepared
and<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.090> should<00:04:00.330> go<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.660> other<00:04:00.690> way<00:04:00.930> don't<00:04:01.440> do

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and you should go the other way don't do

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.949 
and you should go the other way don't do
it<00:04:01.680> I've<00:04:02.400> been<00:04:02.610> saved<00:04:02.910> by<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.239> lot<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.840> those

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
it I've been saved by a lot of those

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.380 
it I've been saved by a lot of those
decisions<00:04:04.820> antennas<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:06.060> climbed

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
decisions antennas that have climbed

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.680 
decisions antennas that have climbed
down<00:04:07.160> because<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.430> didn't<00:04:08.700> feel<00:04:08.820> right<00:04:09.060> jumping

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
down because I didn't feel right jumping

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.210 
down because I didn't feel right jumping
off<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:11.209> lots<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.360> situations<00:04:12.570> where<00:04:13.110> we've

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
off of it lots of situations where we've

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.039 
off of it lots of situations where we've
de-escalated<00:04:14.220> we've<00:04:14.700> avoided<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.360> danger<00:04:15.510> by

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
de-escalated we've avoided the danger by

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.509 
de-escalated we've avoided the danger by
going<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> other<00:04:16.500> way<00:04:16.680> because<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:17.250> simply

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
going the other way because we simply

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.729 
going the other way because we simply
were<00:04:17.790> not<00:04:17.820> ready<00:04:18.209> for<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:19.590> way<00:04:19.709> or

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
were not ready for it in one way or

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.560 
were not ready for it in one way or
another<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:20.580> other<00:04:20.730> possibility<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.480> that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
another the other possibility is that

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.400 
another the other possibility is that
it's<00:04:21.810> just<00:04:22.080> my<00:04:22.289> neurosis<00:04:22.860> again<00:04:23.840> it's<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.169> my

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
it's just my neurosis again it's just my

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.320 
it's just my neurosis again it's just my
yeah<00:04:26.010> but<00:04:26.280> what<00:04:26.610> if<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.880> goes<00:04:27.030> back

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
yeah but what if it goes back

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.779 
yeah but what if it goes back
add<00:04:27.530> because<00:04:28.530> when<00:04:28.949> you're<00:04:29.069> looking<00:04:29.370> off<00:04:29.550> of

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
add because when you're looking off of

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.490 
add because when you're looking off of
this<00:04:29.909> direction<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.599> it<00:04:30.750> off<00:04:30.960> into<00:04:31.379> the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
this direction and it off into the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.719 
this direction and it off into the
distance<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:32.069> what<00:04:32.939> if<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.240> goes<00:04:33.449> badly

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
distance of what if it goes badly

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.070 
distance of what if it goes badly
because<00:04:35.729> that's<00:04:35.969> we<00:04:36.330> need<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.599> do<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.780> right

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
because that's we need to do that right

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.649 
because that's we need to do that right

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
you have to be able to look into a

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.029 
you have to be able to look into a
situation<00:04:41.759> and<00:04:42.270> get<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.780> glimpse<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.409> what<00:04:43.919> if

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
situation and get a glimpse of what if

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.129 
situation and get a glimpse of what if
it<00:04:44.159> doesn't<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:44.490> well<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:45.419> do<00:04:45.569> have<00:04:45.599> an<00:04:45.810> answer

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
it doesn't go well you do have an answer

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.529 
it doesn't go well you do have an answer
to<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.349> if<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.949> don't<00:04:47.009> I<00:04:47.430> better<00:04:47.669> feel<00:04:48.000> worried

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
to that if I don't I better feel worried

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.020 
to that if I don't I better feel worried
in<00:04:49.199> our<00:04:49.379> worthy<00:04:49.740> should<00:04:50.129> cause<00:04:50.550> me<00:04:50.759> to<00:04:50.879> build

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
in our worthy should cause me to build

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.050 
in our worthy should cause me to build
the<00:04:51.090> other<00:04:51.240> way<00:04:51.389> don't<00:04:51.599> do<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:52.669> but<00:04:53.669> if<00:04:53.819> we

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
the other way don't do it but if we

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.999 
the other way don't do it but if we
stare<00:04:54.629> in<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.050> direction<00:04:55.409> here's<00:04:55.919> the

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
stare in that direction here's the

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.189 
stare in that direction here's the
problem<00:04:56.479> because<00:04:57.479> then<00:04:57.659> you're<00:04:57.870> telling<00:04:58.050> the

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
problem because then you're telling the

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.659 
problem because then you're telling the
story<00:04:58.560> of<00:04:58.800> what<00:04:58.979> that's<00:04:59.159> going<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.370> be<00:04:59.490> like

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
story of what that's going to be like

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.999 
story of what that's going to be like
and<00:04:59.909> you're<00:05:00.419> going<00:05:00.539> to<00:05:00.629> find<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:01.110> way<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:01.889> either

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
and you're going to find a way to either

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.309 
and you're going to find a way to either
make<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.729> happen<00:05:03.090> or<00:05:03.599> make<00:05:03.840> yourself<00:05:04.169> feel

make it happen or make yourself feel

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.459 
make it happen or make yourself feel
terrible<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.569> you're<00:05:06.569> not<00:05:06.719> in<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.960> alternate

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
terrible and you're not in the alternate

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.059 
terrible and you're not in the alternate
set<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.830> answers<00:05:08.370> which<00:05:08.969> is<00:05:09.240> okay<00:05:10.050> that's<00:05:10.650> that

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
set of answers which is okay that's that

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.629 
set of answers which is okay that's that
would<00:05:11.190> be<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.370> worst<00:05:11.460> case<00:05:11.729> scenario<00:05:12.379> deepa

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
would be the worst case scenario deepa

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.369 
would be the worst case scenario deepa
okay<00:05:14.639> where<00:05:15.389> would<00:05:15.509> be<00:05:15.629> the<00:05:15.659> best<00:05:15.750> case

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
okay where would be the best case
