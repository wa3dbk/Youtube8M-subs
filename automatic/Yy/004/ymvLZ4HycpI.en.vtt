00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
that a lot of people also can afford

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.029 
that a lot of people also can afford
this<00:00:16.440> powder<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:21.230> $34<00:00:22.230> 34

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
this powder because this is like $34 34

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.189 
this powder because this is like $34 34
something<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.449> my<00:00:24.600> personal<00:00:25.080> opinion

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
something and in my personal opinion

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.439 
something and in my personal opinion
that<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.490> pricey<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.210> powder

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that is kind of pricey for a powder

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
that is kind of pricey for a powder
especially<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> use<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.560> everyday<00:00:28.859> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
especially if you use it everyday and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.060 
especially if you use it everyday and
then<00:00:29.420> it<00:00:30.420> kind<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.470> know<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.920> run

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
then it kind of just you know you run

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.700 
then it kind of just you know you run
out<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.239> $34<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.230> don't<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.559> it's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
out of it and for $34 I don't think it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.420 
out of it and for $34 I don't think it's
that<00:00:34.770> worth<00:00:35.040> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
that worth it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.750 
that worth it

the packaging one thing I don't like
about<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.669> is<00:05:17.880> that<00:05:17.940> if<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:19.020> close<00:05:19.320> it

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
about it is that if you close it

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.800 
about it is that if you close it
properly<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:21.120> can't<00:05:21.330> believe<00:05:21.419> I<00:05:21.570> just<00:05:21.600> did

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
that because now I'm gonna have the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.940 
that because now I'm gonna have the
hardest<00:05:23.280> time<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.730> open<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:24.120> this<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:25.229> so<00:05:25.650> hard

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
hardest time to open it this is so hard

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.480 
hardest time to open it this is so hard
to<00:05:26.100> open

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
to open

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.450 
to open

can't I can't open this I'm just gonna
leave<00:05:31.229> it<00:05:31.350> closed<00:05:31.500> for<00:05:31.710> now<00:05:31.860> but<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.680> Mac<00:05:34.860> one

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
leave it closed for now but the Mac one

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.420 
leave it closed for now but the Mac one
is<00:05:35.370> just<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:35.970> much<00:05:36.090> easier<00:05:36.540> to<00:05:36.570> open<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.650> in<00:05:37.890> my

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
is just so much easier to open but in my

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.040 
is just so much easier to open but in my
opinion<00:05:38.550> who<00:05:39.030> cares<00:05:39.240> about<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.570> packaging

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
opinion who cares about the packaging

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.600 
opinion who cares about the packaging
I'm<00:05:40.260> gonna<00:05:40.500> use<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.770> products<00:05:41.160> not<00:05:41.400> the

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
I'm gonna use the products not the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.870 
I'm gonna use the products not the
packaging<00:05:42.060> so<00:05:42.720> yeah<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.950> think<00:05:44.070> it's<00:05:44.460> worth<00:05:44.550> it

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
packaging so yeah I think it's worth it

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.360 
packaging so yeah I think it's worth it
