00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:04.589
 the session if we choose today we will show a professional connected in the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.670
 and graduates in a maximum of three years is the technologist in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.499
 computer networks crc conservation was sought by people who already 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:13.719
 work in the area 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.400
 what would represent the worst among the functions of the professional is the guardian 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.779
 security of stored information 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.339
 having good functioning 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.339
 all components of computers 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 and the small circuit connectors 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.660
 for us to have a complex system of understanding but for the technician soon 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.040
 network of computers working with these present devices is part of the 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:46.809
 routine 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:47.700
 the paper 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.120
 main victim 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.930
 deploy these networks 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 these networks make these networks operational 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.220
 manage these networks to manage all of these 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.530
 equipment and in the case of consulting also it can also 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.670
 is helping it to unveil new 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 but in this area of ​​events 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.960
 fernando is 26 years old and in 2009 he graduated in computer network technology 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 in a short time the federal institute was already employed as the most 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.010
 contest that promises enough 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.450
 discovered 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.550
 to like something more that is not so important the action of the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.480
 time 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.820
 most of the information we see today is being uploaded 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.460
 by computer systems often using computer related 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.350
 so we have to support this information to make the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.760
 systems work safely this is the issue the undergraduate course of 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.640
 Computer network technology takes an average of three years 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.820
 the salary for the early career professional is on average two 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.930
 one thousand reais 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.130
 medicado that is in full expansion I'm sure that yes my area 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.090
 is already standardized and the tendency is to value itself more and more the market has 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.550
 a great lack of some professionals in this area 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:22.019
 mainly because most companies today are small companies 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.939
 medium or large 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.109
 they have to claim all the data 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.299
 in the network lose and computer technician who will specialize in 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.839
 network technology 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.839
 he works at the national telecommunications institute 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.420
 have a specialization in a graduate 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.039
 an advanced technology course 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.759
 this is my main focus also for 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.680
 yes 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.109
 in line with new technologies 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.850
 was also raised in the area 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.850
 Have you ever imagined a company without computers? 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.779
 it really would be 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:54.859
 impossible 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.169

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.379
 for the extension of business 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.499
 but so that there is no loss 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.529
 everything has to be working 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.009
 perfectly 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.299
 in the broadcasting equipment industry who is responsible for 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.780
 to leave the computer network in November 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.239
 and luiz cláudio with the consignation in enem 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.590
 all messages sent through the server now we will have in the process 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.889
 Brazilian 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.590
 and probably a revolver in the middle one year ago he takes the technology course in 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:28.199
 network 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.010
 learning is already put into practice mubarak that the system of 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:37.389
 computer can not stop another from a stopped server is a very 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.929
 large company 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.149

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.870
 risks sorry last

 According to the Ministry of Education, 23 institutions have 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.829
 authorization to offer the technology course in computer networks 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.740
