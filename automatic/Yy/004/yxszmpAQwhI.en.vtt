00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
know this is a good engine we've seen

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.480 
know this is a good engine we've seen
this<00:02:01.109> at<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.289> bunch<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.679> other<00:02:01.799> cars<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.399> them

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
this at a bunch of other cars and them

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.020 
this at a bunch of other cars and them
in<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.729> fourth<00:02:02.969> line<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:04.850> well<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> was

acceleration brakes were good on it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.820 
acceleration brakes were good on it
transmissions<00:02:12.750> fun<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.170> put<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.409> in<00:02:13.500> paddle

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
transmissions fun we put it in paddle

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.339 
transmissions fun we put it in paddle
shift<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.760> did<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.540> couple<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:16.080> great

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349

runs<00:02:16.620> with<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.370> no<00:02:17.970> very<00:02:18.360> nice

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
runs with that but no very nice

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.789 
runs with that but no very nice
engine<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.840> was<00:02:20.049> impressed<00:02:20.500> by<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
engine and and I was impressed by the

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.979 
engine and and I was impressed by the
whole<00:02:20.980> powertrain<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.299> transmission<00:02:22.870> is

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
whole powertrain the the transmission is

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.539 
whole powertrain the the transmission is
a<00:02:23.019> six-speed<00:02:23.500> Automatic<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.189> you<00:02:24.280> said<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
a six-speed Automatic like you said the

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.250 
a six-speed Automatic like you said the
paddle<00:02:24.849> shifters<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.480> sport<00:02:25.780> mode<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.170> it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
paddle shifters in a sport mode and it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.869 
paddle shifters in a sport mode and it
gives<00:02:26.439> it<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.799> doesn't<00:02:26.980> downshift<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.670> really

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
gives it it doesn't downshift it really

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.369 
gives it it doesn't downshift it really
when<00:02:28.000> he<00:02:28.030> put<00:02:28.180> his<00:02:28.209> war<00:02:28.450> mode<00:02:28.629> it<00:02:29.019> feels<00:02:29.230> like

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
when he put his war mode it feels like

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.899 
when he put his war mode it feels like
it's<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.709> tweaking<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.219> calibration<00:02:30.819> a

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
it's just tweaking the calibration a

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.610 
it's just tweaking the calibration a
little<00:02:31.239> bit<00:02:31.359> with<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.719> ECU<00:02:32.140> probably

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
little bit with the ECU probably

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.289 
little bit with the ECU probably
throttle<00:02:33.040> mapping<00:02:33.159> a<00:02:33.400> little<00:02:33.579> bit<00:02:33.700> gives<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.239> a

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
throttle mapping a little bit gives it a

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.089 
throttle mapping a little bit gives it a
little<00:02:34.480> bit<00:02:34.689> of<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.870> pep<00:02:35.079> eNOS<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:35.859> I

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
little bit of a pep eNOS to it so I

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.069 
little bit of a pep eNOS to it so I
think<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:37.150> somebody<00:02:37.720> that's<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.959> the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
think for for somebody that's in the

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.349 
think for for somebody that's in the
market<00:02:38.439> for<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.650> car<00:02:39.159> like<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.180> kind

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
market for a car like this you can kind

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.530 
market for a car like this you can kind
of<00:02:40.540> feel<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:40.959> kind<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.170> fun<00:02:41.379> but<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:43.390> it's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
of feel it it's kind of fun but but it's

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.259 
of feel it it's kind of fun but but it's
certainly<00:02:43.689> not<00:02:43.930> as<00:02:44.109> aggressive<00:02:44.439> as<00:02:45.269> something

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269

enough power and torque on a smaller

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.659 
enough power and torque on a smaller
motor<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:05.019> can<00:03:05.139> get<00:03:05.260> great<00:03:05.290> gas<00:03:05.620> mileage<00:03:06.129> in<00:03:06.310> a

motor you can get great gas mileage in a

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.190 
motor you can get great gas mileage in a
bigger<00:03:06.879> car<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.510> don't<00:03:07.599> have<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:08.169> a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
bigger car so you don't have to have a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.440 
bigger car so you don't have to have a
you<00:03:08.590> know<00:03:08.859> be<00:03:09.189> a<00:03:09.220> really<00:03:09.489> thirsty<00:03:09.760> engine<00:03:10.329> in

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
you know be a really thirsty engine in

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.899 
you know be a really thirsty engine in
one<00:03:10.629> now<00:03:11.079> one<00:03:11.439> thing<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.709> what<00:03:12.129> that<00:03:12.489> Lincoln

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
one now one thing that what that Lincoln

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.129 
one now one thing that what that Lincoln
has<00:03:13.030> been<00:03:13.209> trying<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.540> do<00:03:13.659> which<00:03:13.810> i<00:03:13.900> think<00:03:13.959> is

has been trying to do which i think is
kind<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.409> neat<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:15.010> they've<00:03:15.790> been<00:03:15.879> trying

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
kind of neat is is they've been trying

sound<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.360> power

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600

thought the turbo would really kind of

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.240 
thought the turbo would really kind of
muffle<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.410> up<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:28.790> that's<00:04:31.070> that's<00:04:32.070> pretty

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
muffle it up but that's that's pretty

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.410 
muffle it up but that's that's pretty
much<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:32.790> this<00:04:33.060> car<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:34.710> lincoln<00:04:35.010> MKZ
