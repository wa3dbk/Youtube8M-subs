00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
mention on one layer we didn't have to

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.940 
mention on one layer we didn't have to
create<00:04:30.600> 30<00:04:30.960> different<00:04:31.140> layers<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.620> get<00:04:31.830> all

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950

that's<00:04:36.570> again<00:04:37.080> part<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.650> benefits<00:04:38.610> of

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
that's again part of the benefits of

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.890 
that's again part of the benefits of
using<00:04:39.900> CMYK<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.940> color<00:04:42.180> very<00:04:42.390> comfortably

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
using CMYK you color very comfortably

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.360 
using CMYK you color very comfortably
and<00:04:42.990> not<00:04:43.289> worry<00:04:43.500> about<00:04:43.560> any<00:04:43.919> consequences<00:04:44.850> so

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
and not worry about any consequences so

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.280 
and not worry about any consequences so
there<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.210> from<00:04:47.449> here<00:04:47.690> on<00:04:47.840> out<00:04:48.050> you

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
there you have it from here on out you

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.320 
there you have it from here on out you
just<00:04:48.500> save<00:04:48.680> your<00:04:48.830> piece<00:04:49.070> if<00:04:49.910> you're<00:04:50.060> wanting

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
to submit it for the web you would just

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.140 
to submit it for the web you would just
simply<00:04:52.090> switch<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.120> mode<00:04:53.540> up<00:04:53.840> here<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:56.949> RGB

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
simply switch the mode up here to RGB

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.969 
simply switch the mode up here to RGB
and<00:04:59.150> then<00:05:00.020> you're<00:05:00.139> done<00:05:00.290> so<00:05:02.020> again<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.710> is
