00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.990 
finish this is a very simple fly to tie
it's<00:03:10.470> used<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.800> lot<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.190> San<00:03:11.459> Juan<00:03:11.700> as<00:03:11.970> a

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
it's used a lot on the San Juan as a

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.030 
it's used a lot on the San Juan as a
midge<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:14.640> can<00:03:14.790> leave<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.180> this

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
midge and you can leave it like this

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.229 
midge and you can leave it like this
fish<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:17.970> not<00:03:18.060> very

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
fish it just like so it's not very

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.940 
fish it just like so it's not very
durable<00:03:18.540> though<00:03:18.930> if<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.200> fish<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.800> like

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
durable though if you fish it just like

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.370 
durable though if you fish it just like
so<00:03:19.980> cuz<00:03:20.459> it'll<00:03:20.780> fall<00:03:21.780> apart<00:03:22.050> pretty<00:03:22.230> easily

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
so cuz it'll fall apart pretty easily

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.890 
so cuz it'll fall apart pretty easily
because<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.280> thread<00:03:23.700> body<00:03:23.940> but<00:03:24.840> I

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
because it's just a thread body but I

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.390 
because it's just a thread body but I
like<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.170> do<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.470> usually<00:03:25.590> coat<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.130> with

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
like to do is usually coat it with

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.550 
like to do is usually coat it with
