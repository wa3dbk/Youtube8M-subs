00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
garage after a while you'll end up

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.900 
garage after a while you'll end up
getting<00:03:19.560> earthworm<00:03:20.560> castings<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.400> that's

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
getting earthworm castings and that's

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.330 
getting earthworm castings and that's
when<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.390> remove<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.470> tray<00:03:23.740> here<00:03:24.160> and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
when you remove the the tray here and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.430 
when you remove the the tray here and
then<00:03:25.150> you'll<00:03:25.240> have<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.450> castings<00:03:25.900> down<00:03:26.080> here

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
then you'll have the castings down here

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.040 
then you'll have the castings down here
and<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.250> can<00:03:27.400> continue<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.850> add<00:03:28.030> four<00:03:28.480> levels

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
and you can continue to add four levels

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.640 
and you can continue to add four levels
of<00:03:29.610> trays<00:03:30.610> on<00:03:30.880> this<00:03:31.180> they'll<00:03:31.750> also<00:03:32.080> create<00:03:32.530> a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
of trays on this they'll also create a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.010 
of trays on this they'll also create a
worm<00:03:32.950> juice<00:03:33.520> it<00:03:34.150> comes<00:03:34.420> out<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.600> this<00:03:34.750> spigot

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
worm juice it comes out of this spigot

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.050 
worm juice it comes out of this spigot
down<00:03:35.290> here<00:03:35.590> you'll<00:03:35.800> open<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.250> up<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:36.670> drain<00:03:36.910> it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
down here you'll open it up and drain it

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.540 
down here you'll open it up and drain it
and<00:03:37.210> that's<00:03:37.630> just<00:03:37.990> like<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.070> compost

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
and that's just like a like a compost

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.600 
and that's just like a like a compost
tea<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:40.480> can<00:03:40.630> use<00:03:40.810> that<00:03:41.020> earthworms<00:03:41.980> juice<00:03:42.340> on

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
tea you can use that earthworms juice on

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.120 
tea you can use that earthworms juice on
any<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.150> your<00:03:43.390> vegetables<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.560> can<00:03:44.680> even<00:03:44.830> use
