designer and I'm trying to learn how to
do<00:00:08.730> photorealistic<00:00:09.660> renderings<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.610> just

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
do photorealistic renderings I just

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.440 
do photorealistic renderings I just
bought<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.849> new<00:00:11.910> package<00:00:13.969> called<00:00:14.969> Thea

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
bought this new package called Thea

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.070 
bought this new package called Thea
render<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.060> it's<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.300> beta<00:00:18.480> phase<00:00:18.600> but

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
render and it's in the beta phase but

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
render and it's in the beta phase but
it's<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.529> great<00:00:19.770> program<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
it's a really great program and one of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150 
it's a really great program and one of
the<00:00:20.880> things<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:22.289> learned<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.949> thought

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the things I just learned and I thought

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.700 
the things I just learned and I thought
I<00:00:23.220> would<00:00:23.640> make<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> video<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.680> I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
I would make a video of so that I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380 
I would make a video of so that I
remember<00:00:26.160> how<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> future<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
remember how to do it in the future is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.820 
remember how to do it in the future is
depth<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.320> field<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.029> go<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> sketchup

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
depth of field so if you go to sketchup

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.850 
depth of field so if you go to sketchup
and<00:00:32.120> let's<00:00:33.120> say<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.329> copy<00:00:33.780> sang<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.649> think

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and let's say you copy sang I think

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220 
and let's say you copy sang I think
that's<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> gentleman's<00:00:35.640> name<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that's the gentleman's name and what you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
that's the gentleman's name and what you
want<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.829> want<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.430> head

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
want to do is you want to have this head

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.670 
want to do is you want to have this head
in<00:00:38.940> focus<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> rest<00:00:39.840> blurred<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.379> just

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
in focus and the rest blurred out just

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.470 
in focus and the rest blurred out just
like<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> camera<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.579> depth<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.030> field<00:00:42.300> with

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
like a camera can do depth of field with

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
like a camera can do depth of field with
an<00:00:42.600> f-stop<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> first<00:00:44.700> thing<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.030> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
an f-stop so the first thing you have to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.770 
an f-stop so the first thing you have to
do<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.870> create<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> scene<00:00:50.180> just<00:00:51.180> call<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> seen

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
do is create a scene just call it seen

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:01.220 
do is create a scene just call it seen
one<00:00:53.870> next<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.430> theater<00:00:58.100> and<00:01:00.230> in

the theater you go to scenes and you set

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.240 
the theater you go to scenes and you set
your<00:01:05.760> f-stop<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.840> focus<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
your f-stop your focus and if you go to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
your f-stop your focus and if you go to
22<00:01:08.670> everything<00:01:08.850> will<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.330> focus<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.869> go

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
22 everything will be in focus if you go

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
22 everything will be in focus if you go
to<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.320> whatever<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.159> select<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.760> in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
going to export the model i'll just save

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.700 
going to export the model i'll just save
it<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.500> saying<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.520> i<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.470> set<00:01:34.500> so

the<00:01:35.060> theoretical<00:01:37.280> start<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.549> wireframe

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the theoretical start up in wireframe

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.590 
the theoretical start up in wireframe
mode<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.009> different

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
mode and you can see all the different

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
mode and you can see all the different
wireframe<00:01:42.600> shapes<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> sayings<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.829> i

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
wireframe shapes of the sayings that i

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.120 
wireframe shapes of the sayings that i
had<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> scene<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.170> over<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
had on the scene if you go over to the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
had on the scene if you go over to the
left<00:01:47.340> part<00:01:47.640> you'll<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> scene<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
left part you'll see the scene and the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.469 
left part you'll see the scene and the
cameras<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.280> click<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.790> scene

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
cameras so if you click on this scene

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.960 
cameras so if you click on this scene
you<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.439> come<00:01:52.740> down<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.759> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you can come down and you can see that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.999 
you can come down and you can see that
your<00:01:54.119> f<00:01:54.270> number<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.780> 1<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.770> focus

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
your f number is 1 and your focus

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.690 
your f number is 1 and your focus
distance<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.810> 3.1<00:01:57.810> meters<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> metric

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
distance is 3.1 meters this is a metric

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.420 
distance is 3.1 meters this is a metric
system<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.990> those<00:02:01.229> feet<00:02:01.890> got<00:02:02.130> converted

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
system so all those feet got converted

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
system so all those feet got converted
to<00:02:02.700> mirrors<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:04.170> i'm<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> go<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
to mirrors now i'm going to go to the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.359 
to mirrors now i'm going to go to the
dark<00:02:04.979> room<00:02:05.540> I'm<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.259> render<00:02:08.039> this

dark room I'm just going to render this
I'm<00:02:08.700> biased<00:02:09.629> without<00:02:10.229> changing<00:02:10.739> anything

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.460 

and<00:02:13.209> after<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.080> warms<00:02:14.290> up<00:02:14.590> for<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.890> few<00:02:15.190> seconds

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and after it warms up for a few seconds

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.550 
and after it warms up for a few seconds
it'll<00:02:17.470> start<00:02:17.800> rendering<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.870> sayings<00:02:20.349> that<00:02:20.410> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
it'll start rendering the sayings that I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.080 
it'll start rendering the sayings that I
put<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.280> sketchup<00:02:21.970> file<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.910> just

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
put in the sketchup file and it just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.119 
put in the sketchup file and it just
takes<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.480> few<00:02:25.510> seconds<00:02:26.110> maybe<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.800> need<00:02:26.890> some

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
takes a few seconds maybe I need some

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.520 
takes a few seconds maybe I need some
background<00:02:27.340> music<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:29.099> while<00:02:30.099> I'm<00:02:30.400> waiting

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
background music here while I'm waiting

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.840 
background music here while I'm waiting
but<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.650> ray<00:02:32.799> tracing

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:48.130 

just<00:02:39.510> wait<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.020> update<00:02:40.230> one<00:02:40.890> more<00:02:41.190> time

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.710 

and<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.890> not<00:02:50.040> too<00:02:50.190> clear<00:02:50.400> yet<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.390> it'll<00:02:51.510> get

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and it's not too clear yet but it'll get

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.750 
and it's not too clear yet but it'll get
clearer<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.110> clearer<00:02:52.320> as<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.620> render<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.070> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
clearer and clearer as I render it you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.270 
clearer and clearer as I render it you
can<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.210> first<00:02:54.450> sang<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:55.280> really

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
can see the first sang is in really

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.540 
can see the first sang is in really
great<00:02:56.490> focus<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.330> as<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.200> people<00:02:58.650> go<00:02:59.340> further

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
great focus and as the people go further

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.610 
great focus and as the people go further
back<00:02:59.820> they<00:03:00.180> blur<00:03:00.450> out<00:03:00.660> just<00:03:01.020> like<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.200> depth<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
back they blur out just like a depth of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.980 
back they blur out just like a depth of
field<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.370> camera<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.840> this

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
field of a camera so I really like this

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.630 
field of a camera so I really like this
feature<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.860> see<00:03:05.070> using<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.580> a

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
feature and I can really see using it a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.060 
feature and I can really see using it a
lot<00:03:05.670> when<00:03:06.150> i<00:03:06.210> designed<00:03:06.480> my<00:03:06.750> bridges<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.500> i

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
lot when i designed my bridges and i

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.620 
lot when i designed my bridges and i
want<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.370> highlight<00:03:08.580> something<00:03:09.120> some

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
want to highlight something some

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.530 
want to highlight something some
guardrail<00:03:10.430> some<00:03:11.430> special<00:03:11.880> detail<00:03:12.240> on<00:03:12.420> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
guardrail some special detail on the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.330 
guardrail some special detail on the
bridge<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.680> i<00:03:13.740> can<00:03:13.890> blur<00:03:14.070> out<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
bridge and then i can blur out the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.890 
bridge and then i can blur out the
background<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.270> will<00:03:15.390> really<00:03:15.570> help<00:03:15.660> to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
background and that will really help to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900 
background and that will really help to
because<00:03:16.380> when<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.740> do<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> bridge<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.760> have<00:03:17.850> a

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
because when you do a bridge you have a

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.000 
because when you do a bridge you have a
ton<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.120> landscaping<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.350> background

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
ton of landscaping and background

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.560 
ton of landscaping and background
material<00:03:20.430> be<00:03:20.550> nice<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.850> blur<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.510> you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
material be nice to blur it out so you

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.150 
material be nice to blur it out so you
can<00:03:21.720> get<00:03:21.870> away<00:03:21.960> with<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.560> cheating<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.130> little

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
can get away with the cheating a little

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.890 
can get away with the cheating a little
bit<00:03:23.370> without<00:03:23.610> putting<00:03:23.910> too<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.270> stuff<00:03:24.540> back

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
bit without putting too much stuff back

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.310 
bit without putting too much stuff back
there<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:26.010> anyways<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.520> suck<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.060> phia<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.630> this

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
there so anyways I suck at phia and this

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.450 
there so anyways I suck at phia and this
is<00:03:28.500> my<00:03:28.710> little<00:03:29.040> video<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.550> depth<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.090> field
