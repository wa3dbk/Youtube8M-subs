wood frequently the fire is going to
burn<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.290> correct<00:01:37.740> same<00:01:38.340> thing<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.610> the

burn down correct same thing with the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.690 
burn down correct same thing with the
metabolism<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.659> skip<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.170> meals<00:01:40.700> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
metabolism if you skip your meals you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.310 
metabolism if you skip your meals you
your<00:01:42.060> metabolism<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> suffer

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
your metabolism is going to suffer

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.679 
your metabolism is going to suffer
big-time<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.130> our<00:01:44.250> bodies<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.509> just

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
big-time like our bodies and just just

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.429 
big-time like our bodies and just just
notice<00:01:46.049> our<00:01:46.229> bodies<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:47.149> wired<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.570> survival

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
notice our bodies are wired for survival

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.530 
notice our bodies are wired for survival
all<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.399> than<00:01:50.520> anything<00:01:50.970> else<00:01:51.270> it's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
all right more than anything else it's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020 
all right more than anything else it's
survival<00:01:52.439> oriented<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.399> you're<00:01:53.579> starving

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
survival oriented so if you're starving

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.490 
survival oriented so if you're starving
yourself<00:01:54.360> you're<00:01:54.689> basically<00:01:55.110> telling<00:01:55.320> your

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
yourself you're basically telling your

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.499 
yourself you're basically telling your
body<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:55.950> what<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:57.030> getting<00:01:57.270> food

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
body you know what I'm not getting food

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.410 
body you know what I'm not getting food
so<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.439> better<00:01:58.950> stock<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.850> what<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so you better stock up and what is

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.200 
so you better stock up and what is
stalking<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.280> unused

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
stalking of what is you know not unused

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300 
stalking of what is you know not unused
energy<00:02:03.420> where<00:02:04.259> does<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.070> what

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
energy where does it go and that's what

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.440 
energy where does it go and that's what
our<00:02:05.369> fat<00:02:05.610> storage<00:02:06.000> is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
our fat storage is

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 
our fat storage is
basically<00:02:06.869> potential<00:02:07.380> energy<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.950> can

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
basically potential energy that we can

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.339 
basically potential energy that we can
use<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> future<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.209> again<00:02:09.509> by<00:02:10.020> skipping

of times they forget serving size equate

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.770 
of times they forget serving size equate
sat<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:23.040> serving<00:03:23.459> size<00:03:23.609> that's<00:03:23.790> 800<00:03:24.359> calories

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780

so<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.049> just<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:25.769> keep<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.190> mind<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.670> just

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
so just just just keep in mind that just

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.910 
so just just just keep in mind that just
because<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.840> seems<00:03:28.319> like<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> good<00:03:28.739> deal

because it seems like a good deal
doesn't<00:03:29.730> always<00:03:30.120> mean<00:03:30.329> it's<00:03:30.810> good<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.380> go<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
doesn't always mean it's good to go the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.729 
doesn't always mean it's good to go the
whole<00:03:32.579> package<00:03:33.120> like<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.450> bucket<00:03:34.139> of<00:03:34.230> ice<00:03:34.350> cream

we need fat car visit our main source of

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.550 
we need fat car visit our main source of
energy<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:12.150> most<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.990> majority<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.470> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
energy for most the majority of the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.380 
energy for most the majority of the
population<00:04:13.980> we<00:04:14.310> use<00:04:14.430> our<00:04:14.580> reviews<00:04:14.910> glycogen

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
population we use our reviews glycogen

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.870 
population we use our reviews glycogen
and<00:04:15.570> glucose<00:04:16.020> correct<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:17.100> lot<00:04:17.550> of<00:04:17.580> times

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
and glucose correct so a lot of times

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.360 
and glucose correct so a lot of times
when<00:04:18.150> we<00:04:18.300> are<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.810> these<00:04:19.170> fad<00:04:19.500> diets<00:04:20.040> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
when we are on these fad diets the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.490 
when we are on these fad diets the
reason<00:04:20.640> why<00:04:20.730> they<00:04:20.850> seemed<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.390> awesome<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:22.110> you

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
reason why they seemed so awesome is you

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.650 
reason why they seemed so awesome is you
know<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.650> lose<00:04:23.100> 10-15<00:04:23.820> pounds<00:04:24.270> within<00:04:24.570> a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
know you lose 10-15 pounds within a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.600 
know you lose 10-15 pounds within a
matter<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.170> couple<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.650> weeks<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.100> the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
matter of like a couple of weeks and the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.460 
matter of like a couple of weeks and the
reason<00:04:26.790> why<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.390> happens<00:04:27.870> is<00:04:27.990> because<00:04:28.110> our

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
reason why that happens is because our

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.190 
reason why that happens is because our
carbohydrates<00:04:29.250> storage<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.150> depleted<00:04:30.780> so

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
carbohydrates storage is depleted so

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.050 
carbohydrates storage is depleted so
when<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.530> happens<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.370> lose<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.730> lot<00:04:33.030> of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
when that happens you lose a lot of

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.080 
when that happens you lose a lot of
water<00:04:33.390> weight<00:04:34.050> but<00:04:34.680> only<00:04:34.920> preliminary<00:04:35.310> you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
water weight but only preliminary you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.180 
water weight but only preliminary you
see<00:04:36.270> that's<00:04:36.810> why<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.200> seems<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:37.920> it's<00:04:38.070> so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
see that's why it seems like it's so

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.640 
see that's why it seems like it's so
good<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.850> later<00:04:39.090> your<00:04:39.420> metabolism<00:04:40.260> gets<00:04:40.470> kind

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
good but later your metabolism gets kind

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.740 
good but later your metabolism gets kind
of<00:04:40.710> crappy<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.280> feel<00:04:41.520> lethargic<00:04:41.750> because

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
of crappy you feel lethargic because

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.210 
of crappy you feel lethargic because
you're<00:04:42.870> not<00:04:42.930> getting<00:04:43.170> carved<00:04:43.440> so<00:04:43.650> cars<00:04:43.920> is<00:04:44.100> not
