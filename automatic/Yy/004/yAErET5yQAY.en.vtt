00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello and welcome to buildings today 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.779
 I want you the usb outlet of 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.779
 Introduce bush jaeger 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.290
 Everyone is special 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.050
 come up with that because they have that 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.750
 power adapter the usb power adapter into the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.300
 integrated socket that is the 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.050
 socket here is in the usb socket 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 to load and behind you can see are 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.390
 the connections for the socket completely 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.679
 normal one just closes phase sooner 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.059
 dollar on and the usb power supply is yours 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.359
 So you are square so to speak 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.559
 No consultation effort at all 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.960
 Connecting socket for a 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.809
 It works pretty well here 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.659
 good as you put it around them 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.309
 is built in pretty much 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:56.549
 saves space from the deep reaches one 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.229
 flat switch cans perfectly 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.920
 in that it is flat 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.049
 switch can fit it is possible 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.090
 the socket also after that to solve the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.610
 means if I somewhere a socket 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.159
 have just installed in a book their 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.530
 switch program then i can do that 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.380
 build out foundation and use this usb 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.840
 sticks or install 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.399
 I just want you in one 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.219
 two frames show what it looks like 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.100
 if i have a double socket a usb 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:30.159
 lan outlet is a standard outlet 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.630
 and of course what it looks like when 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:39.549
 power supply compared to simple usb 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 Cable is in the socket in the corridors 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:50.700
 and Bußjäger switch program like eg 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:56.979
 bicycle courier steel solo cent alpha 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:02.009
 future linear and reflexes and of course 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.179
 in all colors the bushy has 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.569
 This can of course be of 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.569
 design 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:18.459
 at integrate and the subscription program what 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:21.430
 already in the household so if you have one 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.099
 double socket just a usb charging 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.670
 power outlet and a standard power outlet 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.280
 Here you can already see the USB socket 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.010
 is not quite as flat as a whole 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.440
 normal outlet but actually 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.019
 no further annoying is now 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.630
 Space is needed again when I am here 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.630
 reinsteckt a normal USB plug 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.750
 and a charger that is one of htc 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:06.970
 you can already see that a lot on 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:11.140
 save space and what it much more important 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.120
 is i have mine despite that 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.790
 I still have the mobile phone charging 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.709
 outlet in which case is free here 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.340
 The outlet is occupied and I have 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.340
 considerably more space requires just that good 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.569
 out further because maybe it's one 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:35.019
 bit of a brow is that makes that hard 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.590
 a piece such as the iphone then it is 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.139
 bush-era outlet still flatter 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:47.500
 So you can see it pretty much exactly 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:49.989
 that the usb socket in fact has said 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.109
 In this case, someone will be part of the power supply 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.109
 the iphone power supply manufacturer connection 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.260
 a little bit 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:22.789
 as already mentioned, he needs it 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:25.889
 just at 0.1 watts yes so much to the 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:29.190
 book city usb socket schuko a 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.520
 Great product very well made 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.360
 impeccable quality 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.580
 Bust hunter thought very much and joined 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.650
 of course, have this idea patented 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.070
 that means that we will not be of 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.479
 other manufacturers can get rough 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.509
 has fun 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.930
 This is available to everyone and warmly 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:55.979
 electrician or electric 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.130
 material shops on the internet so much too 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.169
 the bushy outlet so much of me
