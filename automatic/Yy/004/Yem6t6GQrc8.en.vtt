00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.390 
with 129 this is Bob maeín at C in g VW
I<00:00:09.269> convert<00:00:10.260> Volkswagens<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.130> run<00:00:11.280> on

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
I convert Volkswagens to run on

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.339 
I convert Volkswagens to run on
compressed<00:00:11.700> natural<00:00:11.969> gas<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.840> just<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
compressed natural gas this is just a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.480 
compressed natural gas this is just a
totally<00:00:14.250> stock<00:00:15.350> Jetta

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
totally stock Jetta

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.630 
totally stock Jetta
and<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.730> runs<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> blend<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.640> compressed

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and it runs with a blend of compressed

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.740 
and it runs with a blend of compressed
natural<00:00:20.820> gas<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.830> diesel<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:24.240> getting

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
natural gas and diesel and I'm getting

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.540 
natural gas and diesel and I'm getting
an<00:00:24.869> average<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.529> hundred<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.890> twenty<00:00:26.310> miles

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
an average of a hundred and twenty miles

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.720 
an average of a hundred and twenty miles
to<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.060> gallon<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.689> diesel<00:00:28.099> with<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> blend<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to the gallon of diesel with a blend of

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.799 
to the gallon of diesel with a blend of
C<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.179> G<00:00:30.679> meaning<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.540> about<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
C and G meaning that we use about a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.530 
C and G meaning that we use about a
50/50<00:00:34.590> split<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.309> two<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> three<00:00:35.790> split<00:00:36.360> of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
50/50 split up at two to three split of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.040 
50/50 split up at two to three split of
compressed<00:00:37.410> natural<00:00:37.469> gas<00:00:37.879> versus<00:00:38.879> diesel<00:00:39.390> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
compressed natural gas versus diesel so

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.670 
compressed natural gas versus diesel so
per<00:00:40.350> mile<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.800> cheaper<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> run<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.500> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
per mile is cheaper to run and here is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.670 
per mile is cheaper to run and here is
the<00:00:43.829> engine<00:00:44.250> compartment<00:00:44.840> it's<00:00:45.840> very<00:00:46.289> basic

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the engine compartment it's very basic

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940 
the engine compartment it's very basic
system<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.820> our<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.140> installed<00:00:49.379> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
system all our is to be installed is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.729 
system all our is to be installed is
this<00:00:50.520> regulator<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.899> modified<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
this regulator which is modified for the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.260 
this regulator which is modified for the
TDI<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.579> hose<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.809> an<00:00:54.930> adjustable<00:00:56.270> orifice

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
TDI a hose with an adjustable orifice

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
TDI a hose with an adjustable orifice
which<00:00:57.660> adjusts<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> amount<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.530> horsepower

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
which adjusts the amount of horsepower

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.729 
which adjusts the amount of horsepower
and<00:00:59.309> then<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.180> blend<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.170> before<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and then I blend it in just before the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
and then I blend it in just before the
intake<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.480> much<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
intake and that's pretty much it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.480 
intake and that's pretty much it
so<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:06.540> kit<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so in this kit here and it's just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.899 
so in this kit here and it's just
powered<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.210> switched<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
powered up and I switched back to the

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.149 
powered up and I switched back to the
driver's<00:01:11.909> compartment<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.470> line<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
driver's compartment and a line that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.760 
driver's compartment and a line that
comes<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.450> natural<00:01:16.020> gas<00:01:16.140> tank<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
comes in from the natural gas tank in

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
comes in from the natural gas tank in
the<00:01:16.920> trunk<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.210> pretty<00:01:18.330> straightforward

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the trunk so it's pretty straightforward

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
the trunk so it's pretty straightforward
and<00:01:19.200> inside<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> driver's<00:01:21.299> compartment

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and inside the driver's compartment

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
and inside the driver's compartment
there<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.439> off<00:01:22.710> switch<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
there is the on and off switch in the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.850 
there is the on and off switch in the
gas<00:01:23.729> gauge<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.869> tells<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.140> how<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.320> CNG

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
gas gauge that tells you how much CNG

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.899 
gas gauge that tells you how much CNG
you<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.130> left<00:01:26.400> plus<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.360> use<00:01:27.689> an<00:01:28.020> oxygen

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
you have left plus I use an oxygen

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
you have left plus I use an oxygen
exhaust<00:01:29.909> temperature<00:01:30.360> gauge<00:01:30.570> which

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
exhaust temperature gauge which

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.340 
exhaust temperature gauge which
regulates<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> CNG<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:32.939> off<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.570> due

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
regulates the CNG to come off and on due

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.990 
regulates the CNG to come off and on due
to<00:01:34.380> exhaust<00:01:34.860> temperature<00:01:35.600> for<00:01:36.600> drivability

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.750 

well<00:01:41.570> here<00:01:41.930> we<00:01:42.050> are<00:01:42.200> people<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.220> Bob<00:01:43.460> man

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
well here we are people this is Bob man

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.050 
well here we are people this is Bob man
I've<00:01:44.120> just<00:01:44.450> started<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.020> car<00:01:45.730> it's<00:01:46.730> going<00:01:47.000> to

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
I've just started the car it's going to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.350 
I've just started the car it's going to
run<00:01:47.270> on<00:01:47.450> diesel<00:01:47.900> it's<00:01:48.440> automatically<00:01:49.210> if<00:01:50.210> you

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
run on diesel it's automatically if you

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.970 
run on diesel it's automatically if you
can<00:01:50.540> see<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.900> switch<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.410> our<00:01:51.650> exhaust

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
can see the switch this is our exhaust

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.600 
can see the switch this is our exhaust
temperature<00:01:52.580> when<00:01:53.210> we<00:01:53.360> hit<00:01:53.540> 300<00:01:54.380> degrees<00:01:54.740> it's

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
temperature when we hit 300 degrees it's

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.480 
temperature when we hit 300 degrees it's
going<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:55.910> turn<00:01:56.180> on<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.870> CNG<00:01:57.290> blend<00:01:57.920> system

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
going to turn on the CNG blend system

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.990 
going to turn on the CNG blend system
which<00:01:59.150> is<00:01:59.330> going<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.510> give<00:01:59.720> us<00:01:59.900> a<00:02:00.250> big<00:02:01.250> boost<00:02:01.760> in

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
which is going to give us a big boost in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.110 
which is going to give us a big boost in
power<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.960> you're<00:02:03.200> about<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:03.980> see<00:02:04.820> how<00:02:04.940> that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
power and you're about to see how that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:14.620 
power and you're about to see how that
works

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.970 

see<00:02:14.900> that's<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.320> what<00:02:15.560> happens

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
see that's just what happens

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.020 
see that's just what happens
and<00:02:18.489> that's<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:19.030> stock<00:02:19.810> TDI<00:02:20.819> running<00:02:21.819> with

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and that's a stock TDI running with

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.440 
and that's a stock TDI running with
compressed<00:02:22.569> natural<00:02:22.750> gas<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:24.610> diesel<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.360> if

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
compressed natural gas in diesel and if

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.530 
compressed natural gas in diesel and if
I<00:02:25.569> go<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.080> shut<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.440> switch<00:02:26.680> off<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:28.239> I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
I go and just shut the switch off and I

baby

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:39.760 

in<00:04:32.480> this<00:04:32.630> faster

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.290 

I<00:04:39.800> mean<00:04:40.370> what<00:04:40.940> do<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.030> think<00:04:41.180> of<00:04:41.240> the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
I mean what do you think of the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.270 
I mean what do you think of the
performance<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:41.960> thing<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.860> drivable

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
performance of this thing you drivable

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.760 
performance of this thing you drivable
yeah<00:04:43.910> it's<00:04:44.330> like<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.630> gas<00:04:44.960> engine<00:04:45.760> running
