the notebook besides that basically the
only<00:01:14.640> part<00:01:14.939> where<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.299> find<00:01:15.450> plastic<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
only part where we will find plastic is

only part where we will find plastic is
on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> bottom<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> notebook<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
on the bottom of the notebook but in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
on the bottom of the notebook but in
general<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> build<00:01:18.869> quality<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.619> also

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
general just the build quality and also

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.580 
general just the build quality and also
the<00:01:20.430> materials<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.030> excellent<00:01:21.509> also<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the materials are excellent also the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
the materials are excellent also the
details<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.970> example<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.479> have

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
details are right so for example we have

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
details are right so for example we have
find<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.930> chamfered<00:01:25.320> edge<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.130> already

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
find this chamfered edge that we already

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.670 
find this chamfered edge that we already
know<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.820> device<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> HTC<00:01:27.750> One<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
know from device like the HTC One or the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
know from device like the HTC One or the
iPhone<00:01:29.040> 5<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> certainly<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.479> notebook

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
iPhone 5 so this is certainly a notebook

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.380 
iPhone 5 so this is certainly a notebook
that<00:01:30.930> stands<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> crowd<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.939> display

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that stands out of the crowd the display

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
that stands out of the crowd the display
on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> n550<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.890> also<00:01:35.340> excellent<00:01:35.700> real<00:01:36.000> find

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
on the n550 is also excellent real find

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.929 
on the n550 is also excellent real find
and<00:01:36.570> 50<00:01:36.990> inch<00:01:37.140> screen<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> resolution<00:01:38.280> of

1920 by 1080 so a Full HD resolution
display<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:43.049> also<00:01:43.470> IPS<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.790> find

this notebook and actually the first

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.890 
this notebook and actually the first
thing<00:02:55.189> I<00:02:55.489> thought<00:02:55.730> was<00:02:56.239> that<00:02:56.299> there<00:02:56.659> actually

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
thing I thought was that there actually

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.319 
thing I thought was that there actually
behind<00:02:57.409> these<00:02:57.650> machine<00:02:58.400> drilled<00:02:58.700> holes<00:02:59.060> in

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
behind these machine drilled holes in

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.390 
behind these machine drilled holes in
the<00:02:59.359> aluminum<00:02:59.709> now<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:00.859> is<00:03:00.950> at<00:03:01.040> least<00:03:01.189> one

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
the aluminum now this is at least one

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.709 
the aluminum now this is at least one
looks<00:03:01.609> like<00:03:01.669> when<00:03:01.969> you<00:03:02.090> look<00:03:02.269> at<00:03:02.389> it<00:03:02.510> online

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:02.719 
looks like when you look at it online

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.929 
looks like when you look at it online
but<00:03:03.469> actually<00:03:03.829> these<00:03:04.010> aren't<00:03:04.340> even<00:03:04.730> drilled

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
but actually these aren't even drilled

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.819 
but actually these aren't even drilled
holes<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.569> basically<00:03:06.049> just<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.530> pattern

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
holes this basically just a pattern

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.830 
holes this basically just a pattern
that's<00:03:07.189> printed<00:03:07.669> on<00:03:07.849> top<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.359> metal<00:03:08.540> and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
that's printed on top of the metal and

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.409 
that's printed on top of the metal and

it<00:03:37.790> sounds<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.299> little<00:03:38.419> bit<00:03:38.569> thin<00:03:38.840> even<00:03:39.139> with

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
it sounds a little bit thin even with

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.460 
it sounds a little bit thin even with
the<00:03:39.620> subwoofer<00:03:40.430> connected<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.269> also<00:03:42.169> just

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
the subwoofer connected and also just

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.830 
the subwoofer connected and also just
the<00:03:42.799> quality<00:03:43.220> isn't<00:03:43.370> very<00:03:43.519> good<00:03:43.909> now<00:03:44.599> this

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
the quality isn't very good now this

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.539 
the quality isn't very good now this
changes<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.409> little<00:03:45.530> bit<00:03:45.680> if<00:03:45.889> you<00:03:45.919> for<00:03:46.159> example

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
changes a little bit if you for example

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.999 
changes a little bit if you for example
watch<00:03:46.699> a<00:03:46.790> blu-ray<00:03:47.180> movie<00:03:47.569> then<00:03:48.229> the<00:03:48.500> subwoofer

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:49.009 
watch a blu-ray movie then the subwoofer

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.469 
watch a blu-ray movie then the subwoofer
definitely<00:03:49.519> makes<00:03:49.759> a<00:03:49.879> noticeable<00:03:50.060> difference

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:50.479 
definitely makes a noticeable difference

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.599 
definitely makes a noticeable difference
and<00:03:50.959> then<00:03:51.290> it's<00:03:51.470> certainly<00:03:51.680> above<00:03:52.129> average

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
and then it's certainly above average

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.300 
and then it's certainly above average
but<00:03:53.359> it's<00:03:53.479> not<00:03:53.629> a<00:03:53.659> standard<00:03:54.079> feature<00:03:54.379> and<00:03:54.739> so

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
but it's not a standard feature and so

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.219 
but it's not a standard feature and so
was<00:03:55.519> definitely<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> little<00:03:56.359> bit<00:03:56.509> disappointed

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
was definitely a little bit disappointed

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.289 
was definitely a little bit disappointed
the<00:03:58.040> battery<00:03:58.340> life<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.699> this<00:03:58.879> notebook<00:03:59.090> is

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
the battery life of this notebook is

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.390 
the battery life of this notebook is
around<00:03:59.599> four<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.019> five<00:04:00.259> hours<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:00.859> you<00:04:00.979> turn<00:04:01.220> on

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
around four to five hours if you turn on

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the brightness of this screen as well as

for example not used to backlight off
the<00:04:05.299> keyboard<00:04:05.509> and<00:04:05.840> just<00:04:06.079> browse<00:04:06.319> the

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
the keyboard and just browse the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.800 
the keyboard and just browse the
Internet<00:04:06.919> and<00:04:07.069> write<00:04:07.579> some<00:04:07.819> documents<00:04:08.419> then

Internet and write some documents then

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.719 
Internet and write some documents then
that's<00:04:09.019> certainly<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.379> realistic<00:04:09.919> number<00:04:09.949> but

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
that's certainly a realistic number but

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.640 
that's certainly a realistic number but
if<00:04:10.819> you<00:04:10.939> then<00:04:11.090> actually<00:04:11.629> use<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:11.989> heavily<00:04:12.319> for

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
if you then actually use it heavily for

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.140 
if you then actually use it heavily for
example<00:04:12.949> with<00:04:13.069> gaming<00:04:13.519> or<00:04:13.669> video<00:04:14.120> editing

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
example with gaming or video editing

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.569 
example with gaming or video editing
which<00:04:14.989> this<00:04:15.199> machine<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.709> fully<00:04:15.949> capable<00:04:16.190> of

which this machine is fully capable of

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.580 
which this machine is fully capable of
then<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.329> definitely<00:04:17.509> run<00:04:18.049> out<00:04:18.199> of<00:04:18.320> battery

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
then you definitely run out of battery

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.339 
then you definitely run out of battery
Lots<00:04:18.919> who<00:04:19.130> knew<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.909> terms<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.479> performance<00:04:20.719> as

Lots who knew in terms of performance as

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.950 
Lots who knew in terms of performance as
also<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:22.010> specs<00:04:22.490> suggest<00:04:22.969> this<00:04:23.330> machine<00:04:23.750> is

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
also the specs suggest this machine is

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.899 
also the specs suggest this machine is
pretty<00:04:24.260> much<00:04:24.409> a<00:04:24.469> beast<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.370> if<00:04:25.460> we<00:04:25.550> take<00:04:25.729> a<00:04:25.760> look

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
pretty much a beast so if we take a look

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:26.470 
pretty much a beast so if we take a look

right<00:04:26.750> here<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.140> look<00:04:27.290> at<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.530> OpenGL<00:04:28.100> score

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
right here and look at the OpenGL score

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.310 
right here and look at the OpenGL score
we<00:04:28.970> will<00:04:29.060> find<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.390> score<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.720> thirty<00:04:30.020> two

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
we will find the score of thirty two

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.250 
we will find the score of thirty two
point<00:04:30.620> six<00:04:31.010> nine<00:04:31.190> frames<00:04:31.790> per<00:04:32.030> second<00:04:32.420> so<00:04:32.960> this

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
point six nine frames per second so this

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260 
point six nine frames per second so this
is<00:04:33.470> in<00:04:33.680> comparison<00:04:34.010> for<00:04:34.370> example<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.940> area

of<00:05:21.020> let<00:05:21.200> on<00:05:21.380> were<00:05:21.680> their<00:05:22.010> speakers<00:05:22.490> but<00:05:23.060> I

of let on were their speakers but I

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
think that's definitely something with

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.530 
think that's definitely something with
all<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.740> other<00:05:24.920> great<00:05:25.190> aspects<00:05:25.850> that's<00:05:26.300> not

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
all the other great aspects that's not

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.380 
all the other great aspects that's not
too<00:05:26.780> important<00:05:27.350> and<00:05:27.650> so<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.490> have<00:05:28.820> to<00:05:29.000> say<00:05:29.180> I'm

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
too important and so I have to say I'm

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.210 
too important and so I have to say I'm
very<00:05:29.420> impressed<00:05:30.050> with<00:05:30.260> this<00:05:30.530> laptop<00:05:30.680> overall

now<00:05:31.430> it's<00:05:31.580> definitely<00:05:32.150> not<00:05:32.270> cheap<00:05:32.570> it's

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810
