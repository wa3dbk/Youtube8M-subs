00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.570 
sometimes but it usually just loads up
quite<00:06:02.330> quickly<00:06:02.680> okay<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:03.890> the<00:06:04.070> quality<00:06:04.340> is

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
quite quickly okay and the quality is

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.090 
quite quickly okay and the quality is
good<00:06:05.000> it's<00:06:05.240> just<00:06:05.420> on<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.990> resolution<00:06:06.320> so<00:06:06.950> when

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
good it's just on the resolution so when

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.460 
good it's just on the resolution so when
I<00:06:07.130> do<00:06:07.250> this<00:06:07.520> it's<00:06:07.850> a<00:06:08.030> little<00:06:08.270> bit<00:06:08.360> higher<00:06:08.570> when

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
I do this it's a little bit higher when

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.080 
I do this it's a little bit higher when
I<00:06:09.530> do<00:06:09.590> this<00:06:09.860> it<00:06:10.160> goes<00:06:10.310> a<00:06:10.340> little<00:06:10.550> bit<00:06:10.730> lower<00:06:10.940> so

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
I do this it goes a little bit lower so

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.990 
I do this it goes a little bit lower so
it's<00:06:11.450> fine<00:06:11.690> well<00:06:12.440> but<00:06:12.620> it<00:06:12.710> cut<00:06:12.890> your<00:06:13.010> plans<00:06:13.220> it

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
it's fine well but it cut your plans it

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.910 
it's fine well but it cut your plans it
is<00:06:14.300> going<00:06:14.510> to<00:06:14.600> load<00:06:14.810> properly<00:06:14.920> everything's
