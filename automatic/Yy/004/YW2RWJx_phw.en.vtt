00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.010
 hello it's rolled discovery 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.260
 today I propose to discover 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.029
 small chocolates and sauce with 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.619
 chocolate sounds star wars then the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.570
 packaging is just sublime 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.180
 so it's called cÃ©cile rise written 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.250
 there just down just below r2d2 and 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.520
 the mark so it's clicquot in lapland 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.489
 wolikow and if not for info it's 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.810
 342 calories for 60 grams then the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.149
 box is really sublime 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.860
 so when we remove the film so everything 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.120
 around the plastic protection we want 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.920
 discover the little box here that 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.719
 deaf simply by dismissing the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.769
 two sides so it's super clever 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.510
 know not played a little box of 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.800
 chocolate like that and that's the end and we 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.079
 can not take it off signed a small 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.579
 security in fact so super clever 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.140
 I really loved the box if not to 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.629
 inside so we discover a lot of 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.179
 chocolate that are each enrobed in 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.699
 a small gold embankment with 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.110
 drawn robots there writes star wars and the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.720
 bottom of the box same decorations and that's 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.820
 just great on the chocolate one can 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.100
 so find the little mark Cecilia 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.560
 so it's written on it and actually when 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.940
 we eat so it's milk chocolate 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.920
 inside it's not for nothing it's 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.479
 simply milk chocolate and 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.240
 so it's melting on the outside and 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.530
 the interior is a little more compact 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.630
 so this chocolate is still pretty 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.100
 sweet it was not bad but I 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.710
 was really expecting something from 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.090
 finer in fact so a little bit disappointed 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.860
 but hey it was still not too much 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.939
 too bad, especially since nico is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.009
 really a very good brand in Japan 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.670
 was it was the minute discovered by 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.670
 final show see you soon
