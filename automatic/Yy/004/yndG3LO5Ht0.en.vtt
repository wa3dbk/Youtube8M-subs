itself<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.699> first<00:00:27.269> i<00:00:27.539> didn't<00:00:28.140> care<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.619> in

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
itself at first i didn't care for it in

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.410 
itself at first i didn't care for it in
fact<00:00:28.800> i<00:00:29.099> felt<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.849> too<00:00:30.060> silly

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
fact i felt it was a little too silly

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.990 
fact i felt it was a little too silly
but<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.619> i<00:00:31.650> kept<00:00:32.070> listening<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
but the more i kept listening to it the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.549 
but the more i kept listening to it the
more<00:00:33.210> i<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:33.870> liked<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
more i really really liked it and the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.979 
more i really really liked it and the
song<00:00:34.739> itself<00:00:34.890> translates<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.850> assault<00:00:36.660> rock

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
song itself translates to assault rock

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
song itself translates to assault rock
and<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.890> fits<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.309> well<00:00:38.430> with

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and I think that fits really well with

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.250 
and I think that fits really well with
what's<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.629> they're

this<00:01:59.520> intro<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.030> liking<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:01.170> than

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
this intro I'm liking a lot more than

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
this intro I'm liking a lot more than
the<00:02:01.409> crap<00:02:01.649> fest<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.070> existed<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> last

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the crap fest that existed in the last

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
the crap fest that existed in the last
one<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.299> mean<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.869> time<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.229> least<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.530> don't

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
one I mean this time at least we don't

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.679 
one I mean this time at least we don't
have<00:02:04.829> them<00:02:04.979> doing<00:02:05.189> ballet<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> beach<00:02:06.180> now

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
have them doing ballet on the beach now

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.359 
have them doing ballet on the beach now
at<00:02:06.840> least<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.200> some<00:02:07.350> cool<00:02:07.590> action<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
at least get some cool action in a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.759 
at least get some cool action in a
pretty<00:02:08.640> decent<00:02:09.149> song<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.690> I'm<00:02:10.349> gonna<00:02:10.530> say

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
pretty decent song and I'm gonna say

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.229 
pretty decent song and I'm gonna say
that<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.069> war<00:02:11.370> arc<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.730> probably<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
that this war arc is probably going to

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.330 
that this war arc is probably going to
have<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> few<00:02:12.870> intros<00:02:13.349> altogether<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.069> don't

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
have a few intros altogether I don't

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.380 
have a few intros altogether I don't
think<00:02:14.519> this<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.910> be<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.360> that

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
think this is going to be the one that

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.750 
think this is going to be the one that
defines<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.170> entire<00:02:16.590> war<00:02:16.890> ark<00:02:17.130> itself<00:02:17.489> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
defines the entire war ark itself and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
defines the entire war ark itself and
there's<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.269> lot<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.450> reasons<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.170> they

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
there's a lot of reasons for that they

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.229 
there's a lot of reasons for that they
really<00:02:19.500> don't<00:02:19.739> show<00:02:20.069> much<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.610> anything<00:02:20.910> that

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
really don't show much of anything that

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.030 
really don't show much of anything that
happens<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> war<00:02:22.080> it's<00:02:22.620> basically<00:02:22.950> just

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
happens in the war it's basically just

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.650 
happens in the war it's basically just
all<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> characters<00:02:23.910> sort<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.239> standing

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
all the characters sort of standing

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.110 
all the characters sort of standing
around<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.140> looking<00:02:25.470> pool<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.819> thing<00:02:27.000> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
around and looking pool and one thing is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.030 
around and looking pool and one thing is
very<00:02:27.209> absent<00:02:27.900> from<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.170> intro<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.560> that's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
very absent from the intro and that's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.150 
very absent from the intro and that's
Naruto<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.030> his<00:02:30.209> QB<00:02:30.599> chakra<00:02:31.050> mode<00:02:31.200> which<00:02:31.530> you

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:46.880 
another intro down the line because
they're<00:02:46.140> probably<00:02:46.319> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.590> make<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.830> a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
they're probably going to make this a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800 
they're probably going to make this a
pretty<00:02:47.130> long<00:02:47.370> art<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.880> frankly<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.390> needs<00:02:48.630> to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
pretty long art and frankly it needs to

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.020 
pretty long art and frankly it needs to
be<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.069> war<00:02:50.310> arc<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.670> needs<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:50.910> be

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
be this is a war arc it needs to be

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.610 
be this is a war arc it needs to be
really<00:02:51.299> really<00:02:51.329> huge<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.900> over<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.230> top<00:02:52.260> and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
really really huge and over the top and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.650 
really really huge and over the top and
this<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.459> just<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.730> beginning<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.450> think

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
this is just the beginning and I think

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.720 
this is just the beginning and I think
the<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.170> song<00:02:55.410> exemplifies<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.340> perfectly

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the the song exemplifies it perfectly

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.780 
the the song exemplifies it perfectly
and<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.110> fun<00:02:58.140> exciting<00:02:58.829> intro<00:02:59.370> so

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
