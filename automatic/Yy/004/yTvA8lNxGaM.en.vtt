00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.670 
ratio is at every cell in the map you
also<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.769> your<00:00:43.890> wideband<00:00:44.309> o2<00:00:44.489> readings<00:00:45.680> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
also get your wideband o2 readings that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
also get your wideband o2 readings that
shows<00:00:46.979> you<00:00:47.159> what<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> engine<00:00:47.790> is<00:00:47.879> actually

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
shows you what the engine is actually

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.360 
shows you what the engine is actually

running at in that current cell and when

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 
running at in that current cell and when
you<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> difference<00:00:51.120> between<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.600> target

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you get a difference between your target

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
you get a difference between your target
air<00:00:52.079> fuel<00:00:52.290> ratio<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.280> actual<00:00:53.699> air<00:00:53.879> fuel

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.240 
can go back and look at your long term
fuel<00:01:30.000> trim<00:01:30.240> table<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:32.040> changes

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
fuel trim table and see what changes

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
fuel trim table and see what changes
were<00:01:32.549> made<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.030> apply<00:01:33.390> those<00:01:33.689> into<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.140> base

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
were made and apply those into your base

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
were made and apply those into your base
fuel<00:01:35.070> table<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.270> we're<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> fire<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.899> our

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
fuel table so we're going to fire up our

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.380 
fuel table so we're going to fire up our
2jz<00:01:37.470> engine<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.189> demonstration

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.490 

so<00:01:43.390> what<00:01:43.540> we're<00:01:43.659> going<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.810> do<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.259> we're<00:01:44.409> going

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.580 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:44.560> add<00:01:44.710> 10%<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.850> our<00:01:45.970> base<00:01:46.210> fuel<00:01:46.509> table<00:01:46.900> the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
to add 10% to our base fuel table the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.710 
to add 10% to our base fuel table the
ECU's<00:01:48.070> self-learning<00:01:48.850> capabilities<00:01:49.600> are

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
ECU's self-learning capabilities are

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.450 
ECU's self-learning capabilities are
going<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.900> recognize<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.470> it's<00:01:50.830> over<00:01:51.159> fueled

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
going to recognize that it's over fueled

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.910 
going to recognize that it's over fueled
and<00:01:51.729> start<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.600> remove<00:01:52.720> fuel<00:01:53.259> from<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.619> tune

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
and start to remove fuel from the tune

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.580 
and start to remove fuel from the tune
in<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.610> short<00:01:54.909> term<00:01:55.119> fuel<00:01:55.390> trim<00:01:55.689> and<00:01:55.899> as<00:01:56.409> soon

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
in the short term fuel trim and as soon

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.910 
in the short term fuel trim and as soon
as<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.740> gets<00:01:57.220> be<00:01:57.430> on<00:01:57.780> 3%<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.500> will<00:01:59.680> start

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
ECU learning the long term fuel trims

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.930 
ECU learning the long term fuel trims
and<00:02:07.090> applying<00:02:07.750> changes<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.530> table<00:02:08.940> once

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and applying changes to this table once

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.089 
and applying changes to this table once
it<00:02:10.149> started<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:10.750> learn<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.290> given<00:02:11.800> us<00:02:11.890> some

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
it started to learn and given us some

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.309 
it started to learn and given us some
values<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.090> actually<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.840> into<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.080> main

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
values we can actually go into the main

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.280 
values we can actually go into the main
setup<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:15.910> apply<00:02:16.000> those<00:02:16.630> changes<00:02:17.140> in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
setup and we can apply those changes in

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.370 
setup and we can apply those changes in
that<00:02:17.440> map<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.250> base<00:02:18.430> fuel<00:02:18.760> table<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
that map to the base fuel table and the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.340 
that map to the base fuel table and the
base<00:02:20.560> fuel<00:02:21.370> table<00:02:21.730> will<00:02:22.030> take<00:02:22.690> those<00:02:22.870> changes

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
base fuel table will take those changes

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.320 
base fuel table will take those changes
in<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> long<00:02:23.769> term<00:02:24.010> fuel<00:02:24.280> trim<00:02:24.519> Maps<00:02:24.760> will<00:02:25.209> go

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
in the long term fuel trim Maps will go

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.350 
in the long term fuel trim Maps will go
back<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.600> zero<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.350> start<00:02:26.650> learning<00:02:27.069> again<00:02:27.360> so

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
back to zero and start learning again so

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.340 
back to zero and start learning again so
now<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.540> we're<00:02:28.780> finished<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.200> our
