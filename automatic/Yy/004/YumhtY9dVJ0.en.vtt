muffled slap on the djembe this is not
as<00:00:11.700> common<00:00:12.320> but<00:00:13.320> sometimes<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:14.040> used<00:00:14.250> with

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
as common but sometimes it's used with

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.070 
as common but sometimes it's used with
the<00:00:14.700> bass<00:00:14.940> djembe<00:00:15.450> parts<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.279> soloist<00:00:18.240> can

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the bass djembe parts or the soloist can

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.040 
the bass djembe parts or the soloist can
use<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.920> embellish<00:00:20.630> what<00:00:21.630> they're<00:00:21.840> playing

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.340 
use it to embellish what they're playing
on<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> lead<00:00:22.830> parts<00:00:23.240> my<00:00:24.240> drum<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.170> is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
on the lead parts my drum I have here is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.500 
on the lead parts my drum I have here is
a<00:00:25.380> low<00:00:25.680> tuned<00:00:25.980> drum<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> bass<00:00:27.269> djembe<00:00:29.510> so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
a low tuned drum it's a bass djembe so

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.290 
a low tuned drum it's a bass djembe so
it's<00:00:30.660> low<00:00:31.430> Bemba<00:00:34.160> this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> sort<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.850> JB

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it's low Bemba this is a sort of JB

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.670 
it's low Bemba this is a sort of JB
that's<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> solo<00:00:37.020> djembe

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that's the solo djembe

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.369 
that's the solo djembe
so<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.340> muffled<00:00:38.820> slap<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> closed

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
so the muffled slap is like a closed

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.010 
so the muffled slap is like a closed
slap<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.730> way<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.660> by

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
slap and the way we do that is by

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
slap and the way we do that is by
keeping<00:00:43.440> our<00:00:43.829> hand<00:00:44.129> against<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> skin<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
keeping our hand against the skin of the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.200 
keeping our hand against the skin of the
drum<00:00:46.200> you'll<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.250> my<00:00:47.430> thumb<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
drum you'll see my thumb is out of the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.619 
drum you'll see my thumb is out of the
way<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.710> I<00:00:49.710> slide<00:00:50.070> my<00:00:50.100> hand<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.360> way<00:00:51.390> up

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
way and I slide my hand all the way up

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
way and I slide my hand all the way up
to<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.379> pinky<00:00:52.829> knuckle<00:00:53.010> lines<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
to my pinky knuckle lines up with the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
to my pinky knuckle lines up with the
rim<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.320> also<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:55.890> sure<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.879> there's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
rim and I also make sure that there's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.930 
rim and I also make sure that there's
one<00:00:57.420> space<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:59.219> space<00:00:59.609> for

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
one space for the right one space for

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.510 
one space for the right one space for
the<00:01:00.030> left<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.500> find<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.100> hands<00:01:02.340> are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the left if you find that your hands are

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.750 
the left if you find that your hands are
covering<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.750> same<00:01:03.989> space<00:01:04.470> either<00:01:05.430> your

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
covering the same space either your

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
covering the same space either your
technique<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.390> faulty<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.560> drum<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.830> too

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
technique is faulty or your drum is too

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.539 
technique is faulty or your drum is too
small<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.689> muffle<00:01:10.080> slap<00:01:10.320> chokes<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> drum

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
small so the muffle slap chokes the drum

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.469 
small so the muffle slap chokes the drum
like<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:13.670> sometimes<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.330> your

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
like this and sometimes you put your

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
like this and sometimes you put your
other<00:01:15.659> hand<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> even<00:01:16.470> make<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.860> tighter<00:01:17.280> like

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
other hand to even make it tighter like

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
other hand to even make it tighter like
this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.970 

it<00:01:26.100> sounds<00:01:26.430> different<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.850> bamba's<00:01:27.240> drum

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
it sounds different on bamba's drum

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.640 
it sounds different on bamba's drum
because<00:01:28.980> my<00:01:29.370> gym<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> solo<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.410> high

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because my gym is a solo to be very high

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.460 
because my gym is a solo to be very high
so<00:01:32.430> my<00:01:32.700> muffles<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.810> different<00:01:34.350> because

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so my muffles is look different because

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.580 
so my muffles is look different because
sooner<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.190> see<00:01:35.370> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.240> hear<00:01:36.510> how<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:37.080> hide

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
sooner you see you can hear how to hide

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
sooner you see you can hear how to hide
rubbish<00:01:38.190> do<00:01:38.370> you<00:01:38.580> see<00:01:39.980> see<00:01:43.160> no<00:01:44.160> different

rubbish do you see see no different
muffle<00:01:46.340> different<00:01:47.340> well<00:01:48.530> another<00:01:49.530> one

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
muffle different well another one

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.450 
muffle different well another one
you<00:01:51.360> got<00:01:51.480> another<00:01:51.660> world<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:53.130> got<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.370> this

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you got another world you got it this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.230 
you got another world you got it this
one<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.040> three<00:01:56.370> different<00:01:56.820> muffle

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
one so you got a three different muffle

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.780 
one so you got a three different muffle
a<00:01:57.590> longbow<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.890> pretty<00:01:59.190> give<00:01:59.460> me<00:01:59.580> along

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
a longbow you be pretty give me along

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:11.020 
a longbow you be pretty give me along
but<00:01:59.910> you<00:01:59.970> got<00:02:00.120> a<00:02:00.150> you<00:02:00.600> got<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> technique

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.870 

that's<00:02:12.030> how<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.390> play<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.500> muffled<00:02:13.980> slap<00:02:14.580> on

that's how you play the muffled slap on

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.330 
that's how you play the muffled slap on
the<00:02:15.000> djembe
