00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.870

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.970
 find his old friend sophia 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.310
 like a new video gameplay 10:30 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 special for christmas day the evening of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 christmas so I prepared you a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.150
 makeup an art 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 if you want and a car that I have more 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 because I had a summary on a hole 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.059
 and the 40 students the hairstyle is held 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 also for christmas so if he had listened 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.540
 loop and do not hesitate to like 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.670
 to make other students 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.040
 will have in this year's bowen kisses and I 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 leave you with the video 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 so how to think very simple in this 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.660
 moment the only thing that I use if 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.280
 this corrector from at revlon that I 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.870
 place on my tits and everything but 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.430
 redness and that's all I use 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.500
 for my complexion I find really great 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.789
 and I'm waiting for him medium then for 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.430
 the eyes I will apply the color 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.219
 golden tattoo from maybelline for already 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.750
 to have a very good base for 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.120
 then put the women I come 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.189
 then apply a copper lighthouse is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 in the hollow of my eye but not a 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.340
 outer corner really just in the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 hollow for it to be very intense and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.700
 then in the outer corner I'm going 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.369
 apply a little bronze color and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.320
 I will not move it in the hollow I 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.380
 really just leave it outside 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.030
 of the eye and that's a little doubt if 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.369
 according to you this is more intense and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.400
 then I put a golden color on my 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.100
 mobile banking 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.800
 underneath and copper is in the corner 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.750
 external to have a little gradient and 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.000
 I'm going to blur everything with a 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.880
 brush blurs hours afterwards as 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.100
 usually I do my liner stroke or 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.160
 unluckily do billions of times that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.630
 did not change and then give 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.580
 still intensity to my look I 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.920
 am going to apply a screaming black so that's 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.500
 the father version of home decay and 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.680
 manage a turnaround and redesign my 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.660
 worries with a simple pencil if the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.080
 joy that comes from bis makeup 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.060
 Then I'll move the lips and 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.890
 day for that i use nancras lips 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.200
 from the body shop and it's really 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.850
 a revelation this product because you 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.040
 apply it and as you go 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.840
 color intensifies and it does not make 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.940
 residue on the mouth so I thought 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.680
 that it was the perfect Christmas for you 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.060
 will eat all night we will not 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 have trip resident 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.930
 I add it works also for 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.820
 cheeks salty color in a way really 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.380
 very natural and very pretty for the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.600
 mouth is the same it does not really 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.490
 lipstick is very very natural 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.709
 and at the same time very intense it is 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.209
 really top this product is very small 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.090
 price so advise you to go test 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.709
 then went to the mayor denies so for 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.510
 the nails I'm lucid a classic 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.410
 who had made glitter 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.090
 for the red and choose 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.610
 at the body shop I have in the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.110
 advent calendar is just a 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.120
 layer that's enough as you see at 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.740
 the picture is really super intense 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.090
 when bernie there I put two 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.680
 really for the outfit but yes that 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 enough and then I use this 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.510
 beautiful payet from home and if I you 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.800
 will put in info bar the site on 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.990
 which I found them I find that the 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.940
 result is really very pretty and very 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.350
 festive we will then think about the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.470
 hairstyle so on the hairstyle I 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.790
 decided to do a bun so I 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.350
 had never done this before but 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.490
 you will see it's very simple 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.880
 start by making a ponytail 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.230
 that we will not totally close with the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.470
 nerves if you see we bring back the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.930
 hair on the front and then we go 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.330
 come and take what's left of us 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.980
 hair there behind and spread them 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.490
 in the middle with our fingers so 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.620
 very gently to actually make the 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.090
 knot so once we've dismissed them 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.860
 we scatter them a little like that for 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.440
 it's a bit thicker and we're going to come 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.940
 fix everything with flat pliers so 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.500
 preferably the color of rocks 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.180
 sir wanted her to see each other 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.740
 I did not have it on hand but 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.300
 it's prettier 6 and the color of 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.190
 your hair and then we bring back the 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.660
 wick that was in front of everything 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.820
 simply and we come the clamp is 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.160
 also behind and we try that the 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.670
 plastics does not sail and that's the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.500
 result 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.540
 for this super nice and christmas I think 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.570
 that this is the opportunity to test this 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.280
 kind of makeup and hairstyle if that 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.959

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.500
 I took a very simple black dress 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.270
 but at the same time very pretty at 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.950

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.120
