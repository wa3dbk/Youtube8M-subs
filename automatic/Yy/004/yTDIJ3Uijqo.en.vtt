00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.410
 the first advice is that the only 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.360
 the best person is the luck is 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.790
 say you have no rival point if you lose 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.920
 it's because of the ajax if they give you 6 to 0 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.900
 it is because of the critics that there is not 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.320
 have been none are the critics is the 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.630
 bitch 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.880
 acz the hacks is to blame for everything you 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.550
 you can not lose you are god you can not 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.829
 lose you are a pro second advice and 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.900
 almost almost the most important of all is 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.630
 that you have to look at yourself whole fucking 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.190
 pokemon anime that's the key to 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.030
 every pokemon player if you want to be 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.640
 the best 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.949
 Look at the test but the fucking anime 5 times 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.620
 day because in that mood are all the 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.160
 keys to be a teacher I have 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.519
 fact 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.170
 believe me look and see where I am the 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.789
 next tip is that the pros are 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.109
 dodgy people is to say that one can be 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.480
 kind you can not be a good person 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.789
 you are a pro you are above the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.350
 you are your god, you are his idol, the 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.480
 people see you on the street and want to be 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.339
 like you what this guy is like I could be 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.320
 so good because riding it happens to me 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.210
 Sometimes people on the street see me and I 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.700
 the other day a lady is worth it I went to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.940
 buy and a lady told me this is the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.180
 fucking I love this playing pokemon 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.700
 but the lady told me so you have 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.070
 to go bad people or be chunga people 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
 if they tell you something navajazo is already that way 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.560
 easy 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.380
 the next step advice and veil like 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.690
 you want to be pro is not to have a girlfriend 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.340
 under no circumstances and be able to be no 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.650
 never talk to girls if it can be 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.920
 never do it would be the right thing to do because 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.020
 because the pros do not need to have a girlfriend 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.030
 or talk to girls or in fact not 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.770
 you need neither to have friends is to say your 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.110
 only friend are you are you provoke 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.270
 how to look in the mirror and you're worth nate 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.990
 silver is so fucking I love that you do not need 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 nothing else is you and you and you provide and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.860
 that to promote ovules or that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.840
 very important do not buy games of 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.479
 pokÃ©mon never 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.370
 if you need any day for stamps 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.250
 that a supposed tournament of 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.170
 pokemon and you need a console then or 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.960
 well you steal someone you see by the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.540
 street or you ask a friend but 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.740
 good if you follow the step advice 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.500
 previous 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.360
 the lyrics you will not have friends so 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.820
 you are going to have to steal the suitcases 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.290
 before buying a bat batter hard and 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.280
 give someone in the head you see 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.170
 down the street and basically that's already 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.480
 is about to give to the head someone who 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.910
 Take the street and have a nintendo ds 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.620
 or a game because if the clear thing is to give for 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.150
 give no, neither is it the plan, there is no 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.820
 that be bad people like I said before 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.740
 but within what is legality 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.740
 although stealing someone's 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.629
 and finally to be pro the last step 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.580
 is to stop continuing to record because it 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.980
 the camera's battery is running out 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.940
 that is the most important step so 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.569
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.340
 I hope you are pro and pro pros and most 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.410
 important do not take this seriously 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.540
 video because I'm not worth 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.540
 sorry it was thanks to god 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.990
 Y
