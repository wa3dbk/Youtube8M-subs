 winner 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.720
 vision with the position of the statues 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.509
 that appear the two seated lions 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.149
 should be seen part of the 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.439
 testicular structures in the photo of 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.159
 the left where it does not appear 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.159
 no structure 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.200
 669 strings it seems that one of the two 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.540
 lions one of the two pieces is missing 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.060
 the testicles can be from a forgetfulness 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.620
 up to maybe some message precisely 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.850
 for the place where they were going to be located 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.850
 at the door of the legislative power 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.570
 to model the stimuli of this lion 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.820
 we had a first-hand reference 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 that the other lion gives is a small piece 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.690
 It is about 15 centimeters long by 8 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.690
 by 6 meters 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.340
 spicy kind software as I think that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.340
 we should put some testicles 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.350
 new to the lion the truth is diapers of 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.300
 neglected because I have stolen 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.420
 I think we should put it on as 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.090
 It is that they will put an added there 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.190
 a fatal pastiche would have to be 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.659
 full think now but I the news 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.880
 because when he says he's known 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.580
 but many, many, many Spaniards 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.130
 I knew something by references by twitter and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.190
 others it seemed to me that it was a 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.350
 curious news man I understand that 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.810
 analyzing it the best thing would be to deduct 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.030
 forgive Mr. President a question 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.360
 for the story channel please 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.360

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.450
 cristian a 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 in the stirrup 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.420
 and nobody had noticed that 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.330
 one of the lions of the race of san 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.610
 Jerónimo is missing the testicles channel 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.020

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.060
 load of san jerónimo results that no 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.440

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.670
 realized of it and now they have
