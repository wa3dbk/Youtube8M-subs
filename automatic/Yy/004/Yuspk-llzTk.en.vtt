around this is my backyard and I do have

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.150 
around this is my backyard and I do have
a<00:00:58.510> deck<00:00:58.809> which<00:00:59.050> makes<00:00:59.410> things<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.800> little<00:00:59.949> bit

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
a deck which makes things a little bit

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.090 
a deck which makes things a little bit
easier<00:01:00.219> because<00:01:00.760> really<00:01:01.570> could<00:01:02.440> use<00:01:02.469> anywhere

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
easier because really could use anywhere

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.920 
easier because really could use anywhere
up<00:01:03.370> on<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.850> surface<00:01:04.090> here<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.449> deck<00:01:04.750> because

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
up on the surface here the deck because

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.470 
up on the surface here the deck because
the<00:01:05.199> air<00:01:05.320> does<00:01:05.530> get<00:01:05.710> underneath<00:01:05.980> it<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.480> allow

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
the air does get underneath it and allow

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.180 
the air does get underneath it and allow
the<00:01:07.540> deck<00:01:07.840> surface<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.410> cool<00:01:08.590> enough<00:01:08.980> so<00:01:09.160> that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
the deck surface to cool enough so that

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.010 
the deck surface to cool enough so that
the<00:01:09.400> snow<00:01:09.520> will<00:01:10.000> accumulate<00:01:10.360> pretty<00:01:10.780> quickly

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
the snow will accumulate pretty quickly

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.080 
the snow will accumulate pretty quickly
without<00:01:11.890> having<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.280> worry<00:01:12.430> about<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.700> blowing

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
without having to worry about it blowing

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.310 
without having to worry about it blowing
off<00:01:13.240> or<00:01:14.230> melting<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:14.950> my<00:01:15.010> deck<00:01:15.520> surface<00:01:15.790> but

off or melting on my deck surface but

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.420 
off or melting on my deck surface but
one<00:01:17.320> thing<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.500> do<00:01:17.650> have<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.830> be<00:01:17.920> careful<00:01:18.310> of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
one thing you do have to be careful of

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.280 
one thing you do have to be careful of
is<00:01:18.940> how<00:01:19.090> close<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.690> house<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:20.050> are<00:01:20.080> you

is how close to the house you are you
can<00:01:20.380> see<00:01:20.500> my<00:01:20.650> house<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:21.070> right<00:01:21.250> here<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:21.760> do

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
can see my house is right here and I do

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.760 
can see my house is right here and I do
have<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.060> 2-story<00:01:22.570> I<00:01:22.810> don't<00:01:23.350> want<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.530> be<00:01:23.590> too

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.080 
out my deck doesn't go quite that far
but<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.920> goes<00:01:30.130> far<00:01:30.400> enough<00:01:30.430> I've<00:01:30.910> got<00:01:30.940> a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
but it goes far enough I've got a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.740 
but it goes far enough I've got a
tabletop<00:01:32.020> up<00:01:32.410> here<00:01:32.650> a<00:01:32.880> patio<00:01:33.880> table<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.630> can

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
tabletop up here a patio table you can

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.360 
tabletop up here a patio table you can
see<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.020> air<00:01:35.140> can<00:01:35.410> get<00:01:35.530> underneath<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.190> real

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
see the air can get underneath it real

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.860 
see the air can get underneath it real
well<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:36.670> when<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.060> snow<00:01:37.270> starts<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.630> fall

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
well so when the snow starts to fall

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.480 
well so when the snow starts to fall
later<00:01:38.110> tonight<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.590> will<00:01:38.710> stick<00:01:38.980> and<00:01:39.100> start<00:01:39.370> to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
later tonight it will stick and start to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.890 
later tonight it will stick and start to
accumulate<00:01:39.730> pretty<00:01:40.090> quickly<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.540> it's<00:01:40.660> big

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
accumulate pretty quickly and it's big

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.270 
accumulate pretty quickly and it's big
enough<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.320> there<00:01:41.800> shouldn't<00:01:41.950> be<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.130> whole

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
enough that there shouldn't be a whole

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.250 
enough that there shouldn't be a whole
lot<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.460> problem<00:01:42.940> with<00:01:43.090> blowing<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.230> drifting

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
lot of problem with blowing and drifting

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.410 
lot of problem with blowing and drifting
on<00:01:44.710> here<00:01:44.950> plus<00:01:45.250> it's<00:01:45.550> on<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.790> north<00:01:46.000> side<00:01:46.090> of

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
on here plus it's on the north side of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.840 
on here plus it's on the north side of
the<00:01:46.480> house<00:01:46.690> which<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.710> turn<00:01:47.890> means<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.670> any

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
the house which in turn means that any

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.070 
the house which in turn means that any
wind<00:01:49.150> that's<00:01:49.420> blowing<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.900> from<00:01:49.930> the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
wind that's blowing in from the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.900 
wind that's blowing in from the
Northeast<00:01:50.530> will<00:01:50.710> take<00:01:50.890> any<00:01:51.040> drifting<00:01:51.550> in<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
Northeast will take any drifting in the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.580 
Northeast will take any drifting in the
other<00:01:52.060> direction<00:01:52.450> so<00:01:52.630> really<00:01:52.960> this<00:01:53.080> is<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.290> good

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
other direction so really this is a good

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.860 
other direction so really this is a good
spot<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:54.040> go<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:54.430> if<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.870> kitchen

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
spot to go so if you have a kitchen

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.440 
spot to go so if you have a kitchen
table<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> deck<00:01:57.190> table<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.700> patio<00:01:58.030> table

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
table or a deck table a patio table

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.970 
table or a deck table a patio table
something<00:01:58.930> like<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> great

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
something like this this is a great

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.040 
something like this this is a great
thing<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.490> have<00:02:00.640> out<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:01.720> want<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:01.960> come

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
thing to have out if you want to come

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.990 
thing to have out if you want to come
out<00:02:02.170> here<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.410> do<00:02:02.620> your<00:02:02.860> snow<00:02:03.490> measuring<00:02:03.850> so

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
out here and do your snow measuring so

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.340 
out here and do your snow measuring so
I'll<00:02:04.120> come<00:02:04.330> out<00:02:04.450> here<00:02:04.630> later<00:02:04.840> tonight<00:02:05.050> when<00:02:05.260> it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
I'll come out here later tonight when it

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.500 
I'll come out here later tonight when it
starts<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.680> snow<00:02:05.850> stick<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.060> there<00:02:07.240> and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
starts to snow stick it in there and

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.230 
starts to snow stick it in there and
where<00:02:07.780> will<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.080> end

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
where will it end

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.660 
where will it end
somewhere<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.480> there<00:02:12.470> maybe<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.100> have<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.490> wait

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
somewhere in there maybe I have to wait

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.450 
somewhere in there maybe I have to wait
and<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:13.940> now<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:15.050> know<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.890> lot<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.130> you'd<00:02:16.310> like

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
and see now I know a lot of you'd like

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.800 
and see now I know a lot of you'd like
to<00:02:16.580> go<00:02:16.700> out<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.850> just<00:02:17.180> stick<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:17.600> in<00:02:17.720> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
to go out and just stick it out in the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.450 
to go out and just stick it out in the
grass<00:02:17.990> I'm<00:02:18.230> going<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.440> show<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.680> why<00:02:18.860> that's

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
grass I'm going to show you why that's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.600 
grass I'm going to show you why that's
not<00:02:19.670> necessarily<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.600> good<00:02:21.110> idea<00:02:21.460> because<00:02:22.460> when

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
not necessarily a good idea because when

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.730 
not necessarily a good idea because when
you<00:02:22.670> come<00:02:22.790> out<00:02:23.030> here<00:02:23.300> whoops<00:02:23.840> into<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> grass

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
you come out here whoops into the grass

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.330 
you come out here whoops into the grass
you'll<00:02:25.160> notice<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.990> there's<00:02:27.290> what<00:02:27.710> in<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
you'll notice that there's what in the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.790 
you'll notice that there's what in the
grass<00:02:28.720> when<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.810> snow<00:02:30.020> starts<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> fall<00:02:30.620> it

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
grass when the snow starts to fall it

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.590 
grass when the snow starts to fall it
doesn't<00:02:31.070> fall<00:02:31.280> through<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.910> sticks<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.360> top

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
doesn't fall through it it sticks on top

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.960 
doesn't fall through it it sticks on top
of<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.900> mats<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.410> down<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.490> fact<00:02:34.730> if<00:02:34.850> I

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
of it mats it down and in fact if I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.810 
of it mats it down and in fact if I
stick<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.360> ruler<00:02:35.750> in<00:02:35.930> here<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.370> can<00:02:37.580> see

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
stick the ruler in here so you can see

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.610 
stick the ruler in here so you can see
that<00:02:38.750> without<00:02:39.200> even<00:02:40.870> doing<00:02:41.870> anything

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
that without even doing anything

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.980 
that without even doing anything
I've<00:02:42.980> probably<00:02:43.340> got<00:02:43.760> about<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.060> half<00:02:44.330> inch<00:02:44.600> to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
I've probably got about a half inch to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.140 
I've probably got about a half inch to
an<00:02:45.380> inch<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.860> mat<00:02:46.220> I'm<00:02:46.550> gonna<00:02:46.700> say<00:02:46.910> I've<00:02:47.000> got

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
an inch of mat I'm gonna say I've got

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.700 
an inch of mat I'm gonna say I've got
about<00:02:47.240> three<00:02:47.570> quarters<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.990> an<00:02:48.140> inch<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.440> mat

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
about three quarters of an inch of a mat

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.550 
about three quarters of an inch of a mat
from<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.490> grass<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.930> if<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.110> were<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.290> measure

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
from the grass so if I were to measure

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.440 
from the grass so if I were to measure
out<00:02:51.830> here<00:02:52.010> in<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.190> grass<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.700> would<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.300> to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
out here in the grass I would have to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.000 
out here in the grass I would have to
subtract<00:02:53.930> three<00:02:54.260> quarters<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.620> an<00:02:54.800> inch<00:02:54.860> from

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
subtract three quarters of an inch from

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.710 
subtract three quarters of an inch from
my<00:02:55.100> total<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.850> order<00:02:56.270> to<00:02:56.360> get<00:02:56.510> an<00:02:56.600> accurate

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
my total in order to get an accurate

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.120 
my total in order to get an accurate
reading<00:02:57.200> now<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.620> going<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.830> be<00:02:57.920> one<00:02:58.100> of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
reading now that is going to be one of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.640 
reading now that is going to be one of
my<00:02:58.250> places<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:58.970> measure<00:02:59.240> because<00:02:59.650> when

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
my places that I measure because when

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.780 
my places that I measure because when
you<00:03:00.740> measure<00:03:00.920> snow<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.280> want<00:03:01.460> to<00:03:01.520> get<00:03:01.610> at

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
you measure snow you want to get at

my measure on my table down here I'll

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.450 
my measure on my table down here I'll
measure<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:36.050> grass<00:03:36.440> minus<00:03:36.950> three<00:03:37.130> quarters

you know what else does good work I can
measure<00:03:47.180> right<00:03:47.390> up<00:03:47.570> here<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.780> right<00:03:48.140> here<00:03:48.500> on

which is that direction over there I'm
not<00:03:57.020> too<00:03:57.260> worried<00:03:57.590> about<00:03:57.910> additional<00:03:58.910> snow

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
not too worried about additional snow

if anything a little bit may blow off as
a<00:04:03.710> result<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.340> that's<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.580> good<00:04:04.730> spot<00:04:05.000> now

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
a result but that's a good spot now

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.949 
a result but that's a good spot now
places<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.370> don't<00:04:07.520> want<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:09.520> concrete<00:04:10.520> in

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.810 
places you don't want to concrete in
general<00:04:11.959> this<00:04:12.530> wouldn't<00:04:12.890> be<00:04:13.130> too<00:04:13.370> bad<00:04:13.400> here

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
general this wouldn't be too bad here

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.130 
general this wouldn't be too bad here
because<00:04:14.060> it's<00:04:14.209> on<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.420> north<00:04:14.540> side<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
because it's on the north side of the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.620 
because it's on the north side of the
building<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.670> doesn't<00:04:16.940> get<00:04:17.000> sunlight<00:04:17.299> so

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
building and it doesn't get sunlight so

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.719 
building and it doesn't get sunlight so
it's<00:04:17.870> cold<00:04:18.229> already<00:04:18.560> it's<00:04:18.770> a<00:04:18.859> cold<00:04:19.250> surface

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
it's cold already it's a cold surface

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.310 
it's cold already it's a cold surface
but<00:04:20.239> in<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.419> front<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.750> my<00:04:20.780> yard<00:04:21.080> I<00:04:21.169> have<00:04:21.229> a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
but in the front of my yard I have a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.290 
but in the front of my yard I have a
driveway<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:22.100> that

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
driveway and that

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.510 
driveway and that
driveways<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.199> south<00:04:23.409> side<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.009> the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.219 
driveways on the south side of the the
building<00:04:24.819> and<00:04:24.909> that<00:04:24.970> gets<00:04:25.180> full<00:04:25.389> sunshine<00:04:25.659> all

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
building and that gets full sunshine all

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.800 
building and that gets full sunshine all
day<00:04:26.289> every<00:04:27.009> day<00:04:27.039> summer<00:04:27.819> winter<00:04:28.120> fall<00:04:28.509> spring

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
day every day summer winter fall spring

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.439 
day every day summer winter fall spring
so<00:04:29.440> as<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> result<00:04:29.680> it's<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.400> warm<00:04:30.699> surface<00:04:31.180> so<00:04:31.300> it

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
so as a result it's a warm surface so it

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.390 
so as a result it's a warm surface so it
is<00:04:31.569> not<00:04:31.720> going<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.960> accumulate<00:04:32.259> the<00:04:32.560> snow<00:04:32.800> has

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
is not going to accumulate the snow has

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.950 
is not going to accumulate the snow has
quit<00:04:33.789> now<00:04:33.879> one<00:04:34.060> thing<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.330> want<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.539> add<00:04:34.690> about

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
quit now one thing I want to add about

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.140 
quit now one thing I want to add about
measuring<00:04:35.560> good<00:04:35.919> places<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.460> measure<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:36.970> not

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
measuring good places to measure and not

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.240 
measuring good places to measure and not
so<00:04:37.330> good<00:04:37.449> places<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.840> measure<00:04:38.139> would<00:04:38.409> be<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.830> car

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
so good places to measure would be a car

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.279 
so good places to measure would be a car
now<00:04:39.490> if<00:04:39.669> your<00:04:39.819> car<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.180> what<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.419> call<00:04:40.629> a<00:04:40.870> cold

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
now if your car is what we call a cold

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.839 
now if your car is what we call a cold
car<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.889> is<00:04:42.009> it's<00:04:42.159> been<00:04:42.340> parked<00:04:42.669> outside

fact I wouldn't use a warm car in the
warm<00:05:07.150> cars<00:05:07.419> for<00:05:07.900> me<00:05:08.020> there's<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.590> car<00:05:08.770> that's

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
warm cars for me there's a car that's

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.320 
warm cars for me there's a car that's
been<00:05:09.039> used<00:05:09.190> anytime<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:09.789> the<00:05:09.819> last<00:05:09.879> 8<00:05:10.300> hours

been used anytime in the last 8 hours
the<00:05:10.659> car<00:05:11.050> maintains<00:05:11.590> enough<00:05:11.949> heat<00:05:12.219> that<00:05:12.400> it

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
the car maintains enough heat that it

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.159 
the car maintains enough heat that it
can<00:05:12.729> melt<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.210> lot<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.569> snow<00:05:13.810> at<00:05:13.960> least

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
can melt a lot of the snow at least

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.260 
can melt a lot of the snow at least
initially<00:05:14.440> as<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:14.889> starts<00:05:15.159> to<00:05:15.310> fall<00:05:15.550> when<00:05:16.150> you

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
initially as it starts to fall when you

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.029 
initially as it starts to fall when you
get<00:05:16.509> that<00:05:16.690> you<00:05:16.930> would<00:05:17.259> be<00:05:17.409> getting<00:05:17.830> an

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
get that you would be getting an

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.950 
get that you would be getting an
inaccurate<00:05:18.580> measurement<00:05:19.120> when<00:05:19.479> using<00:05:19.690> your

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
inaccurate measurement when using your

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.770 
inaccurate measurement when using your
car<00:05:20.199> to<00:05:20.650> measure<00:05:20.889> snowfall<00:05:21.460> so<00:05:22.449> there<00:05:22.629> you

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
car to measure snowfall so there you

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.170 
car to measure snowfall so there you
have<00:05:22.840> it<00:05:23.050> some<00:05:23.469> easy<00:05:23.889> ways<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.340> measure<00:05:24.759> snow

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
have it some easy ways to measure snow

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.820 
have it some easy ways to measure snow
and<00:05:25.479> get<00:05:25.569> it<00:05:25.719> fairly<00:05:26.229> accurate<00:05:26.620> you're<00:05:26.710> going

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
and get it fairly accurate you're going

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.350 
and get it fairly accurate you're going
to<00:05:26.889> take<00:05:27.009> all<00:05:27.190> those<00:05:27.340> numbers<00:05:27.729> from<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.060> three

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
to take all those numbers from the three

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.610 
to take all those numbers from the three
to<00:05:28.479> five<00:05:28.690> different<00:05:28.900> places<00:05:29.199> that<00:05:29.529> you

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
to five different places that you

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.920 
to five different places that you
measure<00:05:29.889> average<00:05:30.699> them<00:05:30.909> together<00:05:31.060> then<00:05:31.779> go<00:05:31.870> to

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
measure average them together then go to

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.379 
measure average them together then go to
my<00:05:32.080> Fox<00:05:32.349> STL<00:05:32.860> comm<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.699> can<00:05:33.909> post<00:05:34.150> them

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
my Fox STL comm and you can post them
