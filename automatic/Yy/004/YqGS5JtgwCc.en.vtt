the stats right and i was thinking

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.690 
the stats right and i was thinking

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.519 
such a satisfying feeling but with any
new<00:02:00.189> sniper<00:02:00.490> rifle<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.090> need<00:02:01.419> to<00:02:01.659> use<00:02:01.929> it<00:02:02.200> for

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
new sniper rifle you need to use it for

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.699 
new sniper rifle you need to use it for
a<00:02:02.709> while<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.369> get<00:02:03.459> used<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.909> end<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.419> I<00:02:05.079> kind<00:02:05.619> of

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
a while to get used to end I I kind of

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.499 
a while to get used to end I I kind of
started<00:02:06.039> getting<00:02:06.489> used<00:02:06.639> to<00:02:06.819> this<00:02:06.969> one<00:02:07.239> but

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
started getting used to this one but

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.620 
started getting used to this one but
it's<00:02:08.020> certainly<00:02:08.319> not<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.979> range<00:02:09.580> because<00:02:10.300> of

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
it's certainly not the range because of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.020 
it's certainly not the range because of
the<00:02:11.410> velocity<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.310> rounds<00:02:12.640> coming<00:02:12.849> out

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
the velocity of the rounds coming out

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.030 
the velocity of the rounds coming out
which<00:02:13.239> are<00:02:13.420> 400<00:02:13.930> meters<00:02:14.200> per<00:02:14.349> second<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.920> give

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
which are 400 meters per second to give

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.540 
which are 400 meters per second to give
some<00:02:15.280> perspective<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.810> m40a5<00:02:17.590> has<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
some perspective to that the m40a5 has a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.590 
some perspective to that the m40a5 has a
bullet<00:02:19.420> velocity<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.990> 400

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
bullet velocity of 400

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.010 
bullet velocity of 400
80<00:02:20.780> meters<00:02:21.350> per<00:02:21.500> second<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.340> Scout<00:02:22.670> elite

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
80 meters per second and the Scout elite

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.950 
80 meters per second and the Scout elite
has<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> velocity<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:25.060> 640<00:02:26.060> meters<00:02:26.420> per<00:02:26.570> second

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
has a velocity of 640 meters per second

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.830 
has a velocity of 640 meters per second
and<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.500> tend<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.130> think<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.640> cs5<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> sort

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and and tend to think the cs5 is a sort

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.680 
and and tend to think the cs5 is a sort
of<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.110> funny<00:02:30.650> amalgamation<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.880> these<00:02:32.120> two

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
of like funny amalgamation of these two

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.770 
of like funny amalgamation of these two
weapons<00:02:33.100> because<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.850> has<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> high<00:02:35.480> rate<00:02:35.750> of

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
weapons because it has a high rate of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.740 
weapons because it has a high rate of
fire<00:02:35.960> than<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.500> m40a5<00:02:37.100> which<00:02:37.760> has<00:02:38.030> 60<00:02:38.480> rounds

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
fire than the m40a5 which has 60 rounds

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.940 
fire than the m40a5 which has 60 rounds
per<00:02:38.900> minute<00:02:38.960> of<00:02:39.590> course<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> cs5<00:02:40.520> has<00:02:40.730> 63<00:02:41.950> so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
per minute of course the cs5 has 63 so

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.980 
per minute of course the cs5 has 63 so
just<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.250> Scout<00:02:43.490> elite<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:44.000> also<00:02:44.300> has<00:02:44.450> 63

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
just the Scout elite that also has 63

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.370 
just the Scout elite that also has 63
but<00:02:45.730> quite<00:02:46.730> importantly<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.870> Scout<00:02:48.200> elite

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
but quite importantly the Scout elite

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.710 
but quite importantly the Scout elite
has<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.830> lower<00:02:49.010> damage<00:02:49.280> model<00:02:49.820> whereas<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
has the lower damage model whereas the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.590 
has the lower damage model whereas the
cs5<00:02:51.290> has<00:02:51.650> exactly<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.220> same<00:02:52.490> damage<00:02:52.970> model<00:02:53.360> to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
cs5 has exactly the same damage model to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.420 
cs5 has exactly the same damage model to
the<00:02:53.690> best<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.990> my<00:02:54.050> knowledge<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:55.160> might

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
the best of my knowledge this might

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.670 
the best of my knowledge this might
change<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:55.940> full<00:02:56.150> release<00:02:56.420> but<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.810> has<00:02:56.990> the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
change in full release but it has the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.310 
change in full release but it has the
same<00:02:57.920> damage<00:02:58.190> model<00:02:58.670> as<00:02:58.820> an<00:02:58.970> m40a5<00:02:59.660> which<00:03:00.140> is

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
same damage model as an m40a5 which is

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.950 
same damage model as an m40a5 which is
really<00:03:00.740> important<00:03:01.370> even<00:03:01.760> though<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.720> going

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
really important even though you going

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.600 
really important even though you going
to<00:03:03.080> be<00:03:03.200> using<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.530> cs5<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.280> like<00:03:04.460> an

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
to be using the cs5 as like an

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.940 
to be using the cs5 as like an
aggressive<00:03:04.790> sniper<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:06.230> still<00:03:06.260> want<00:03:06.860> that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
aggressive sniper you still want that

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.540 
aggressive sniper you still want that
higher<00:03:07.310> damage<00:03:07.610> model<00:03:08.200> because<00:03:09.200> 100<00:03:10.070> meters

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
higher damage model because 100 meters

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.450 
higher damage model because 100 meters
is<00:03:10.730> not<00:03:11.000> far<00:03:11.300> away<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> sniper<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.830> not<00:03:13.160> get

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
is not far away for a sniper to not get

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.550 
is not far away for a sniper to not get
one<00:03:13.700> shot<00:03:13.970> pills<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.660> things<00:03:14.840> like<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.110> is

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
one shot pills and things like that is

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.040 
one shot pills and things like that is
frustrating<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:17.240> say<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.450> least<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:17.840> that's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
frustrating to say the least so that's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.620 
frustrating to say the least so that's
kind<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.470> why<00:03:18.740> I<00:03:18.770> avoid<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.880> scowl<00:03:20.180> elite<00:03:20.510> a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
kind of why I avoid the scowl elite a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.080 
kind of why I avoid the scowl elite a
lot<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:20.930> time<00:03:21.320> now<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.130> like<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.610> reload

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
lot of time now I like the reload

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.510 
lot of time now I like the reload
animation<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.080> cs5<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:24.800> when<00:03:25.190> it's<00:03:25.310> like

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
animation of the cs5 and when it's like

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.970 
animation of the cs5 and when it's like
chambering<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.210> bullet<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:27.380> talking<00:03:27.680> about

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
chambering a bullet but talking about

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.520 
chambering a bullet but talking about
reload<00:03:28.310> speeds<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.970> short<00:03:29.240> reload<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.960> the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
reload speeds the short reload is the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.610 
reload speeds the short reload is the
same<00:03:30.800> as<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.100> m40a5<00:03:31.670> which<00:03:32.300> is<00:03:32.480> 2.7<00:03:33.230> seconds

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
same as the m40a5 which is 2.7 seconds

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.850 
same as the m40a5 which is 2.7 seconds
it's<00:03:34.070> fairly<00:03:34.310> quick<00:03:34.640> but<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.600> long<00:03:36.080> reload<00:03:36.500> is

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
it's fairly quick but the long reload is

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.890 
it's fairly quick but the long reload is
a<00:03:37.100> little<00:03:37.400> bit<00:03:37.520> longer<00:03:37.640> it's<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.450> over<00:03:38.690> half

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
a little bit longer it's just over half

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.890 
a little bit longer it's just over half
a<00:03:39.020> second<00:03:39.380> longer<00:03:39.590> than<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.070> m40a5<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:41.750> is

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
a second longer than the m40a5 this is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.280 
a second longer than the m40a5 this is
like<00:03:42.080> it's<00:03:42.830> basically<00:03:43.700> very<00:03:44.120> similar<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.110> the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
like it's basically very similar to the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.040 
like it's basically very similar to the
m40a5<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.640> differences<00:03:47.240> are<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:47.660> course<00:03:47.870> II

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
m40a5 the differences are of course II

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.340 
m40a5 the differences are of course II
m40a5<00:03:48.890> has<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.640> bullet<00:03:49.940> velocity<00:03:50.110> but<00:03:51.110> the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
m40a5 has the bullet velocity but the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.530 
m40a5 has the bullet velocity but the
trade-off<00:03:51.770> is<00:03:51.830> with<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.310> cs5<00:03:52.880> you've<00:03:53.270> got<00:03:53.510> a

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
trade-off is with a cs5 you've got a

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.020 
trade-off is with a cs5 you've got a
slightly<00:03:53.960> high<00:03:54.230> round<00:03:54.590> per<00:03:54.860> minute<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:55.430> you're

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
slightly high round per minute so you're

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.990 
slightly high round per minute so you're
sort<00:03:56.270> of<00:03:56.300> weighing<00:03:56.480> up<00:03:56.780> those<00:03:56.990> two<00:03:57.320> things<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
sort of weighing up those two things the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.690 
sort of weighing up those two things the
11<00:03:59.540> round<00:03:59.750> magazine<00:04:00.290> on<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:01.040> sniper<00:04:01.280> rifle

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
11 round magazine on this sniper rifle

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.360 
11 round magazine on this sniper rifle
is<00:04:01.790> very<00:04:02.150> nice<00:04:02.450> it's<00:04:03.230> obviously<00:04:03.710> better<00:04:04.010> than

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
is very nice it's obviously better than

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.820 
is very nice it's obviously better than
the<00:04:04.460> Scout<00:04:04.760> elite<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.780> same<00:04:06.440> as<00:04:06.680> the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
the Scout elite and the same as the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.000 
the Scout elite and the same as the
m40a5<00:04:07.400> again<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.300> think<00:04:08.600> if<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.560> kind<00:04:09.830> of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
m40a5 again and I think if you kind of

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.620 
m40a5 again and I think if you kind of
going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.430> be<00:04:10.580> going<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.270> those<00:04:11.390> sort<00:04:11.600> of

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
going to be going for those sort of

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.140 
going to be going for those sort of
close<00:04:11.930> quarters<00:04:12.350> aggressive<00:04:12.950> sniping<00:04:13.310> that's

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
close quarters aggressive sniping that's

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.240 
close quarters aggressive sniping that's
quite<00:04:14.330> cool<00:04:14.660> with<00:04:14.720> this<00:04:15.050> weapon<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.920> fact

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
quite cool with this weapon the fact

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.920 
quite cool with this weapon the fact
that<00:04:16.370> you've<00:04:16.520> got<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.880> higher<00:04:17.150> fire<00:04:17.630> right

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
that you've got the higher fire right

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.920 
that you've got the higher fire right
and<00:04:18.140> you've<00:04:18.620> also<00:04:18.859> got<00:04:19.370> an<00:04:19.549> 11<00:04:19.820> round<00:04:20.330> magazine

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
and you've also got an 11 round magazine

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.980 
and you've also got an 11 round magazine
because<00:04:21.560> even<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.040> GOL<00:04:22.280> magnum<00:04:22.750> whilst<00:04:23.750> that

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
because even the GOL magnum whilst that

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.250 
because even the GOL magnum whilst that
has<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.260> 60<00:04:24.860> RPM<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.730> only<00:04:26.060> have<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.480> six<00:04:26.900> round

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
has a 60 RPM you only have a six round

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.770 
has a 60 RPM you only have a six round
magazine<00:04:27.860> so<00:04:28.250> that's<00:04:28.820> quite<00:04:29.000> an<00:04:29.210> important

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
magazine so that's quite an important

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.370 
magazine so that's quite an important
little<00:04:30.050> stat<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:31.490> cs5<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.479> as<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:32.840> say<00:04:33.169> it's

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
little stat so the cs5 is as I say it's

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.300 
little stat so the cs5 is as I say it's
balanced

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
balanced

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.580 
balanced
you're<00:04:34.700> not<00:04:34.880> going<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.270> be<00:04:35.450> blowing<00:04:36.170> all<00:04:36.470> the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
you're not going to be blowing all the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.890 
you're not going to be blowing all the
other<00:04:36.740> sniper<00:04:37.100> rifles<00:04:37.670> out<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.240> water<00:04:38.480> and

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
other sniper rifles out of the water and

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.960 
other sniper rifles out of the water and
when<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> comes<00:04:39.710> down<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.490> still<00:04:40.760> prefer

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
when it comes down to it I still prefer

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.070 
when it comes down to it I still prefer
my<00:04:41.330> SS<00:04:41.750> my<00:04:42.260> sr<00:04:42.800> r<00:04:43.070> so<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.570> me<00:04:44.600> is<00:04:44.990> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
my SS my sr r so that to me is the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.550 
my SS my sr r so that to me is the
all-round<00:04:45.710> best<00:04:46.160> sniper<00:04:46.490> rifle<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:48.500> only

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
all-round best sniper rifle but it only

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.070 
all-round best sniper rifle but it only
has<00:04:49.190> an<00:04:49.430> RPM<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:50.000> 40<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:50.600> it's<00:04:50.750> sort<00:04:50.960> of

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
has an RPM of 40 so it's sort of

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.020 
has an RPM of 40 so it's sort of
weighing<00:04:51.290> up<00:04:51.530> those<00:04:51.740> things<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.610> can<00:04:52.790> play<00:04:52.970> in

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
weighing up those things you can play in

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.030 
weighing up those things you can play in
team<00:04:53.270> deathmatch<00:04:53.480> or<00:04:53.900> domination<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.800> sorta

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
team deathmatch or domination you sorta

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.820 
team deathmatch or domination you sorta
like<00:04:55.360> determined<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.450> play<00:04:56.630> as<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.780> sniper<00:04:57.050> then

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
like determined to play as a sniper then

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.310 
like determined to play as a sniper then
the<00:04:58.220> cs5<00:04:58.670> is<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.910> really<00:04:59.420> nice<00:04:59.630> little<00:04:59.960> weapon

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
the cs5 is a really nice little weapon

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.710 
the cs5 is a really nice little weapon
to<00:05:00.470> do<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.950> now<00:05:01.490> interestingly<00:05:01.670> when<00:05:02.570> we

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
to do that now interestingly when we

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.320 
to do that now interestingly when we
started<00:05:03.110> seeing<00:05:03.410> leaked<00:05:04.100> about<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.910> weapon

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
started seeing leaked about this weapon

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.720 
started seeing leaked about this weapon
but<00:05:05.450> I<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:05.720> can<00:05:05.930> see<00:05:06.140> me<00:05:06.290> struggling<00:05:06.710> at<00:05:07.490> those

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
but I you can see me struggling at those

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.670 
but I you can see me struggling at those
ranges<00:05:08.330> just<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.810> get<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.050> distance<00:05:09.440> above

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
ranges just to get the distance above

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.280 
ranges just to get the distance above
the<00:05:09.920> enemy's<00:05:10.220> head<00:05:10.430> he<00:05:10.550> was<00:05:10.640> fairly<00:05:10.910> static

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
the enemy's head he was fairly static

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.650 
the enemy's head he was fairly static
but<00:05:12.290> interestingly<00:05:13.220> we<00:05:14.000> thought<00:05:14.270> that<00:05:14.480> this

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
but interestingly we thought that this

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.090 
but interestingly we thought that this
weapon<00:05:15.110> was<00:05:15.230> going<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.560> come<00:05:15.770> with<00:05:15.950> the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
weapon was going to come with the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.540 
weapon was going to come with the
suppressor<00:05:16.400> estándar<00:05:17.180> much<00:05:17.870> like<00:05:18.290> the<00:05:18.740> AS<00:05:19.160> VAL

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
suppressor estándar much like the AS VAL

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.740 
suppressor estándar much like the AS VAL
but<00:05:20.050> seems<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:22.610> suppressor<00:05:23.240> if<00:05:23.420> it<00:05:23.570> is

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
but seems that the suppressor if it is

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.900 
but seems that the suppressor if it is
on<00:05:23.780> there<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.170> standard<00:05:24.500> can<00:05:25.100> at<00:05:25.400> least<00:05:25.550> be

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
on there a standard can at least be

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.750 
on there a standard can at least be
removed<00:05:26.570> because<00:05:27.260> in<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.800> CTE<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.550> have

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
removed because in the CTE you have

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.670 
removed because in the CTE you have
different<00:05:29.390> options<00:05:29.510> as<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.080> what<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.530> want

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
different options as to what you want

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.860 
different options as to what you want
the<00:05:30.890> barrel<00:05:31.190> attachment<00:05:31.250> to<00:05:31.880> be<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:32.720> that's

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
the barrel attachment to be so that's

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.960 
the barrel attachment to be so that's
quite<00:05:33.050> interesting<00:05:33.230> because<00:05:33.940> had<00:05:34.940> that

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
quite interesting because had that

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.270 
quite interesting because had that
suppressor<00:05:35.630> being<00:05:36.170> as<00:05:36.410> standard<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.160> would

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
suppressor being as standard that would

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280 
suppressor being as standard that would
have<00:05:37.400> been<00:05:37.520> quite<00:05:37.880> a<00:05:37.910> limiting<00:05:38.540> factor<00:05:38.570> on

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
have been quite a limiting factor on

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.580 
have been quite a limiting factor on
this<00:05:39.530> rifle<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:40.730> have<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.180> bolt-action<00:05:41.810> rifle

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
this rifle to have a bolt-action rifle

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.620 
this rifle to have a bolt-action rifle
with<00:05:42.860> that<00:05:43.040> limitation<00:05:43.520> built-in<00:05:44.210> is<00:05:44.390> not

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
with that limitation built-in is not

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.130 
with that limitation built-in is not
good<00:05:44.960> it's<00:05:45.500> always<00:05:45.830> nice<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.310> have<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:47.030> as<00:05:47.270> an

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
good it's always nice to have it as an

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.040 
good it's always nice to have it as an
option<00:05:48.560> on<00:05:48.740> your<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:49.280> your<00:05:49.310> sniper<00:05:49.790> rifle<00:05:50.330> but

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
option on your on your sniper rifle but

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.500 
option on your on your sniper rifle but
I<00:05:51.260> must<00:05:51.530> admit<00:05:51.710> I've<00:05:51.920> been<00:05:52.130> enjoying<00:05:52.670> using<00:05:53.240> it

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
I must admit I've been enjoying using it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.540 
I must admit I've been enjoying using it
a<00:05:53.630> lot<00:05:53.660> and<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:54.140> do<00:05:54.200> think<00:05:54.770> it's<00:05:54.950> going<00:05:55.190> to<00:05:55.310> have

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
a lot and I do think it's going to have

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.780 
a lot and I do think it's going to have
a<00:05:55.730> place<00:05:56.120> as<00:05:56.510> an<00:05:57.290> aggressive<00:05:57.740> sniper<00:05:58.400> rifle

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
a place as an aggressive sniper rifle

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.260 
a place as an aggressive sniper rifle
it's<00:05:59.780> by<00:06:00.140> no<00:06:00.170> way<00:06:00.650> going<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.700> be<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.060> all-out

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
it's by no way going to be the all-out

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.750 
it's by no way going to be the all-out
best<00:06:03.170> aggressive<00:06:03.800> sniper<00:06:04.070> rifle<00:06:04.490> but<00:06:04.640> it's

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
best aggressive sniper rifle but it's

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.930 
best aggressive sniper rifle but it's
going<00:06:05.000> to<00:06:05.120> be<00:06:05.420> a<00:06:05.750> good<00:06:06.680> choice<00:06:06.980> a<00:06:07.400> good<00:06:07.700> choice

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
going to be a good choice a good choice

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.200 
going to be a good choice a good choice
amongst<00:06:08.450> them<00:06:08.630> i<00:06:08.840> would<00:06:09.410> say<00:06:09.710> probably<00:06:10.210> this

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
amongst them i would say probably this

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
amongst them i would say probably this
all<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.810> m40a5<00:06:12.440> would<00:06:13.430> be<00:06:13.760> my<00:06:14.450> kind<00:06:14.690> of<00:06:14.870> go<00:06:15.170> to

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
all the m40a5 would be my kind of go to

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.340 
all the m40a5 would be my kind of go to
sniper<00:06:15.980> rifle<00:06:16.580> as<00:06:16.760> I<00:06:17.300> say<00:06:17.450> it's<00:06:17.750> just<00:06:18.020> weighing

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
sniper rifle as I say it's just weighing

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.310 
sniper rifle as I say it's just weighing
up<00:06:18.740> whether<00:06:18.980> you<00:06:19.310> prefer<00:06:19.580> a<00:06:20.360> slightly<00:06:21.110> higher

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
up whether you prefer a slightly higher

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.450 
up whether you prefer a slightly higher
rate<00:06:21.950> of<00:06:21.980> fire<00:06:22.460> or<00:06:22.820> you<00:06:23.750> would<00:06:23.900> prefer<00:06:24.320> to<00:06:24.460> to

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
rate of fire or you would prefer to to

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.270 
rate of fire or you would prefer to to
have<00:06:25.670> that<00:06:25.970> extra<00:06:26.150> sort<00:06:26.660> of<00:06:26.920> distance<00:06:27.920> the

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
have that extra sort of distance the

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.250 
have that extra sort of distance the
ability<00:06:28.820> with<00:06:28.850> the<00:06:29.300> velocity<00:06:29.540> gives<00:06:30.080> you<00:06:30.200> on

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
ability with the velocity gives you on

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.160 
ability with the velocity gives you on
the<00:06:30.380> m40a5<00:06:30.950> so<00:06:31.580> in<00:06:31.820> that<00:06:32.450> sense<00:06:32.690> it's<00:06:32.900> very

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
the m40a5 so in that sense it's very

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.960 
the m40a5 so in that sense it's very
balanced<00:06:33.620> and<00:06:33.860> a<00:06:34.370> lot<00:06:34.730> of<00:06:34.850> fun<00:06:35.120> to<00:06:35.390> you

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
balanced and a lot of fun to you

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.640 
balanced and a lot of fun to you
but<00:06:36.970> that's<00:06:37.240> really<00:06:37.450> my<00:06:37.810> fault<00:06:38.230> on<00:06:38.500> this

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
but that's really my fault on this

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.200 
but that's really my fault on this
weapon<00:06:38.830> I<00:06:39.070> would<00:06:39.190> be<00:06:39.310> really<00:06:39.580> interested<00:06:39.700> to

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
weapon I would be really interested to

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.850 
weapon I would be really interested to
