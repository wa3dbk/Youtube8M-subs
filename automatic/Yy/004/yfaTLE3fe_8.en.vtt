00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.940 
and I've got a little jig designed here
that<00:02:28.950> shows<00:02:29.250> me<00:02:29.580> with<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:30.030> line<00:02:30.299> were<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:31.230> set

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
that shows me with this line were to set

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.949 
that shows me with this line were to set
the<00:02:32.160> end<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.400> my<00:02:32.519> board<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.750> make

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the end of my board so that I can make

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:51.070 
the end of my board so that I can make
four<00:02:34.349> cuts

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.640 

like<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.740> now<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.460> have<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.270> cross<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.440> is

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
like so and now I have a cross that is

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.760 
like so and now I have a cross that is
five<00:02:56.340> eighths<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.790> an<00:02:56.940> inch<00:02:57.030> across<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.900> about

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
five eighths of an inch across and about

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.550 
five eighths of an inch across and about
an<00:02:58.980> inch<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.400> half<00:02:59.430> thick<00:02:59.960> so<00:03:00.960> that<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.230> can

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
an inch and a half thick so that I can

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.630 
an inch and a half thick so that I can
take<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:02.160> over<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.330> bandsaw<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.640> with

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
take this over to my bandsaw and with

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
take this over to my bandsaw and with
the<00:03:05.790> bandsaw<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:09.860> book<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:12.840> crosses<00:03:13.740> off<00:03:13.980> and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
the bandsaw I book of crosses off and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920 
the bandsaw I book of crosses off and
then<00:03:15.660> with<00:03:16.230> another<00:03:16.430> jig<00:03:17.430> right<00:03:18.210> here<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.690> can

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
then with another jig right here you can

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.290 
then with another jig right here you can
see<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.440> I've<00:03:19.620> set<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.520> for<00:03:20.760> about<00:03:20.850> five

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
see that I've set it for about five

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.590 
see that I've set it for about five
sixteenths<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.580> run<00:03:23.820> there<00:03:26.060> with<00:03:27.060> my

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
sixteenths and I can run there with my

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.380 
sixteenths and I can run there with my
push<00:03:28.080> stick<00:03:28.500> for<00:03:29.430> those<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.240> are

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
push stick for those of you that are

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:39.780 
push stick for those of you that are
safety

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.890 

so<00:03:40.790> now<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.360> have<00:03:42.610> five<00:03:43.610> little<00:03:44.210> wooden<00:03:44.630> crosses

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
so now I have five little wooden crosses

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.740 
so now I have five little wooden crosses
that<00:03:45.380> all<00:03:45.770> they<00:03:46.160> need<00:03:46.370> now<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:46.970> hole<00:03:47.360> and

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
that all they need now is a hole and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.290 
that all they need now is a hole and
they<00:03:48.590> need<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:48.920> be<00:03:49.070> prayed<00:03:49.370> over<00:03:49.610> too<00:03:49.970> by<00:03:50.270> the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
they need to be prayed over too by the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.230 
they need to be prayed over too by the
way<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:54.110> here<00:03:54.380> we<00:03:54.530> are<00:03:54.560> now<00:03:55.310> we<00:03:55.370> come<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:55.940> the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
way so so here we are now we come to the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.170 
way so so here we are now we come to the
drill<00:03:56.480> press<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.860> this<00:03:58.100> drill<00:03:58.460> press<00:03:58.820> has<00:03:59.150> a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
drill press and this drill press has a

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.540 
drill press and this drill press has a
counter<00:03:59.690> here<00:03:59.900> because<00:04:00.860> I'm<00:04:01.040> not<00:04:01.070> smart

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
counter here because I'm not smart

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.570 
counter here because I'm not smart
enough<00:04:01.910> to<00:04:02.330> keep<00:04:02.720> up<00:04:02.990> with<00:04:03.260> an<00:04:04.070> interruption

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
enough to keep up with an interruption

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.900 
enough to keep up with an interruption
to<00:04:04.970> know<00:04:05.300> what<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.690> numbers<00:04:06.020> are<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:07.460> you

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
to know what the numbers are and so you

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.700 
to know what the numbers are and so you
can<00:04:08.090> see<00:04:08.300> here<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.690> my<00:04:09.080> number<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:10.180> 825<00:04:11.180> and

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
can see here that my number is 825 and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.350 
can see here that my number is 825 and
every<00:04:12.710> time<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:15.610> am<00:04:16.610> unplugged

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
every time I am unplugged

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:29.830 
every time I am unplugged
oh<00:04:25.660> look<00:04:26.660> technical<00:04:27.200> difficulty<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:29.750> know

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
oh look technical difficulty you know

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.560 
oh look technical difficulty you know
your<00:04:30.380> standards

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.650 

then<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.720> drill<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.200> hole<00:04:37.240> this<00:04:38.240> little

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
then I drill that hole this little

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.720 
then I drill that hole this little
counter<00:04:39.080> will<00:04:39.260> count

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
counter will count

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.820 
counter will count
and<00:04:41.240> we<00:04:41.450> have<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> right<00:04:41.900> here

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
and we have a right here

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.520 
and we have a right here
thousand<00:04:44.830> in<00:04:44.980> this<00:04:45.280> bucket<00:04:45.900> then<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.110> take

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
thousand in this bucket then I take

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.040 
thousand in this bucket then I take
those<00:04:47.920> from<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.850> bucket<00:04:50.280> take<00:04:51.280> them<00:04:51.750> put<00:04:52.750> them

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
those from the bucket take them put them

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:03.630 
those from the bucket take them put them
in<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.320> two<00:04:53.620> gallon<00:04:53.860> ziplock<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:02.430> put<00:05:03.430> in<00:05:03.610> a
