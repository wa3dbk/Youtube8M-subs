00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
at one of the cameras I have here one of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.910 
at one of the cameras I have here one of
the<00:01:21.000> Jay<00:01:21.180> X<00:01:21.390> series<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.470> course<00:01:22.650> looking

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
course the lens and the lens is
basically<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> five-time<00:01:28.920> zoom<00:01:29.250> lens<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
basically a five-time zoom lens and you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.359 
basically a five-time zoom lens and you
have<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> flashed<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.560> beside<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.220> and

have a flashed right beside that and
right<00:01:32.549> beside<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.180> also<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.540> an<00:01:33.630> LED

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
right beside that you also have an LED

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
right beside that you also have an LED
light<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.740> sort<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> blinks<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.490> it's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
light that sort of blinks and it's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
light that sort of blinks and it's
really<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.360> self<00:01:36.630> timer<00:01:36.869> feature

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really more for the self timer feature

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140 
really more for the self timer feature
where<00:01:37.590> once<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> counts<00:01:38.520> down<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.939> five

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
where once it counts down in five

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.670 
where once it counts down in five
seconds<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.600> starts<00:01:39.810> blinking<00:01:40.020> four<00:01:40.409> three

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
seconds it starts blinking four three

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.130 
seconds it starts blinking four three
two<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.369> okay<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> front

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
two one okay so that's just the front

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
two one okay so that's just the front
view<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> camera<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.640> guess<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.360> below

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
view of the camera I guess just below

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
view of the camera I guess just below
that<00:01:45.630> there's<00:01:46.020> also<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> microphone<00:01:46.710> input<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that there's also a microphone input and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.490 
that there's also a microphone input and
it's<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.210> where<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> obviously<00:01:49.049> record<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it's it's where you obviously record the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.160 
it's it's where you obviously record the
audio<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> video<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.720> top<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
audio for the video on the top of the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.600 
audio for the video on the top of the
camera<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> shutter<00:01:53.040> button<00:01:53.130> just

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
camera you have the shutter button just

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.160 
camera you have the shutter button just
like<00:01:53.759> any<00:01:53.939> shutter<00:01:54.240> button<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> push<00:01:54.750> halfway

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
like any shutter button you push halfway

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.310 
like any shutter button you push halfway
down<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.500> pre<00:01:55.770> focus<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> fully<00:01:57.149> press<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
down to pre focus and fully press to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.830 
down to pre focus and fully press to
actually<00:01:58.920> capture<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.399> shot<00:01:59.610> okay<00:01:59.840> looking

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
actually capture this shot okay looking

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
at one of the sides of this camera

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.550 
at one of the sides of this camera
really<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.180> plain<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.259> couple<00:02:04.439> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
screws but that's all on the opposite

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.570 
screws but that's all on the opposite

included<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:11.129> camera<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.610> know

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
included with this camera so you know

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
included with this camera so you know
obviously<00:02:11.910> drop<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> camera

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
obviously drop the camera

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.770 
obviously drop the camera
on<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.100> bottom<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.000> camera<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.540> have

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
on the bottom of this camera you have

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.280 
on the bottom of this camera you have
the<00:02:16.220> USB<00:02:17.220> connector<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.030> USB<00:02:18.840> connector

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the USB connector and that USB connector

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.320 
the USB connector and that USB connector
also<00:02:19.440> doubles<00:02:19.920> up<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.220> your<00:02:20.610> charger<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.240> it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
also doubles up as your charger so it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.320 
also doubles up as your charger so it
does<00:02:21.480> include<00:02:22.520> sort<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.700> plug<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.000> you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
does include sort of a plug that you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.360 
does include sort of a plug that you
plug<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.780> wall<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.620> USB<00:02:25.860> cable<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
plug to the wall and a USB cable that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.650 
plug to the wall and a USB cable that
connects<00:02:26.670> directly<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.210> camera<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.600> you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
connects directly to this camera and you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.240 
connects directly to this camera and you
would<00:02:27.810> charge<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.350> way<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.950> battery

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
would charge it that way so the battery

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.610 
would charge it that way so the battery
still<00:02:29.460> stays<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.510> camera<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.350> got<00:02:31.470> your

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
still stays in the camera you got your

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.610 
still stays in the camera you got your
tripod<00:02:31.860> mount<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.940> also<00:02:33.120> got<00:02:33.510> your<00:02:33.620> speakers

tripod mount you also got your speakers

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.410 
tripod mount you also got your speakers
so<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.490> playback<00:02:35.670> your<00:02:36.030> audios
