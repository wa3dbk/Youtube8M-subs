00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.360
I refuse to accept that a painter
may or must do nothing but paint.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.240
I mean that while many regard
reading books a waste of time...

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.240
while to me it seems that if one tries to
improve on other areas as well...

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.440
one works more and better
as a result.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.080
Although one thing is of importance,
and a great influence on the work...

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.160
namely the point of view
from which one sees things...

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.920
and the approach to life one has.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.600
I completely agree with this.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.800
That's what we...

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.120
I'm not so much interested
in Vincent the painter...

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.160
I'm interested in reality.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.120
One of the things you learn is
that the word has to become flesh.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.560
What you say has to contain the truth.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.120
That is what Vincent did.
That's the aspect that speaks to me.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200
And I've cried once in those nine years.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.440
Jo Bonger, Theo's wife...

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.440
writes him for the first time.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.680
Dear Vincent, you don't know me yet,
but I'm at Theo's place now.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.560
Last Sunday, we viewed
all your paintings in our room.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.680
That's when I had to cry.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.280
It was so sweet of her.
She loved Theo very much.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.840
My contribution
to the Van Gogh Museum...

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.400
are the five books.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.000
They contain all letters.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.760
I've recorded myself reading these
letters, forty-five minutes each day.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.560
These tapes are displayed on a panel.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.560
The height of these stacks is determined
by the thickness of the books.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.560
If the word has ever becomes flesh.
It has become flesh on tape.
