00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.930

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.460
 in a folder 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.590
 then the kiosk app 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.350
 of applications that allows you to 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.370
 watch the newspaper magazines 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.440
 directly from your ipod 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.920

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.060

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.100

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.210
 majority of people do not use 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.590
