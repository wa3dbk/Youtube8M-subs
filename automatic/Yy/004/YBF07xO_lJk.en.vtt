00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
some countries have this panic button

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.130 
some countries have this panic button
and<00:00:25.439> some<00:00:26.430> doesn't<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.810> panic<00:00:28.109> button

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and some doesn't and the panic button

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.080 
and some doesn't and the panic button
makes<00:00:28.949> your<00:00:29.160> car<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.580> crazy

procedure to changing the battery and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
procedure to changing the battery and
the<00:00:47.340> battery<00:00:47.370> itself<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> same<00:00:48.960> no

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the battery itself is all the same no

matter if you have this panic button or

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.290 
matter if you have this panic button or
not<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.489> worry<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
so what do we do or what we need to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.939 
so what do we do or what we need to
change<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.280> battery<00:00:59.809> well<00:01:00.809> obviously<00:01:01.410> we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
change the battery well obviously we

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.759 
change the battery well obviously we
need<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.850> battery<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.650> use

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
need a battery and we're going to use

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.179 
need a battery and we're going to use
the<00:01:05.040> SR<00:01:06.030> 16<00:01:06.770> 23<00:01:07.770> volts<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.560> obviously<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.830> well

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the SR 16 23 volts and obviously as well

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.140 
the SR 16 23 volts and obviously as well
we<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:12.090> some<00:01:12.299> tools<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.400> we<00:01:14.400> need<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.760> fairly

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
we need some tools and we need a fairly

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.770 
we need some tools and we need a fairly
big<00:01:15.540> flat<00:01:16.140> headed<00:01:16.350> screwdriver<00:01:16.470> when

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
big flat headed screwdriver when

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.840 
big flat headed screwdriver when
changing<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> battery<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> key

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
changing the battery on this key

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
changing the battery on this key
normally<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.780> work<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.200> keys<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
normally when you work on keys and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.249 
normally when you work on keys and
changing<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> battery<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.600> use<00:01:24.869> rather

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
changing the battery you use rather

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.590 
changing the battery you use rather
small<00:01:25.650> batteries<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.000> case<00:01:27.240> we're

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
small batteries but in this case we're

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
small batteries but in this case we're
going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> use<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.200> fairly<00:01:28.770> big<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
going to use a fairly big one as you can

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.710 
going to use a fairly big one as you can
see<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.340> that's<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.060> need<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.630> know

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
see so that's all you need to know

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.679 
see so that's all you need to know
before<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.890> begin<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> procedure<00:01:35.880> so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
before we begin with the procedure so

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.030 
before we begin with the procedure so
let's<00:01:37.290> go<00:01:37.439> ahead<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> change<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.610> battery

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
let's go ahead and change the battery

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.490 
let's go ahead and change the battery
okay<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.100> first<00:01:41.909> step<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.360> still<00:01:42.810> opening<00:01:43.290> up

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
okay so first step is still opening up

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.139 
okay so first step is still opening up
our<00:01:43.740> key<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.320> should<00:01:46.380> locate

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
our key and to do that we should locate

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.780 
our key and to do that we should locate
one<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> side<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.110> key<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.640> as<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
one of the side of the key and as you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
one of the side of the key and as you
can<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.090> there's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.600> hole<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.250> here<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
can see there's a hole in here on the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.539 
can see there's a hole in here on the
side<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.259> in<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.470> hole<00:01:55.740> there's<00:01:56.189> another

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
side and in that hole there's another

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.410 
side and in that hole there's another
hole<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.860> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.219> attack<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.210> hole

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
hole and you want to attack that hole

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.190 
hole and you want to attack that hole
and<00:02:01.189> get<00:02:02.189> our<00:02:02.399> edge<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.420> screwdriver<00:02:03.869> into

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and get our edge on the screwdriver into

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.740 
and get our edge on the screwdriver into
that<00:02:04.530> hole<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.920> we're<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> attack

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that hole so we're just going to attack

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.919 
that hole so we're just going to attack
at<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.200> 90<00:02:07.770> degrees<00:02:08.129> angle<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:09.509> just

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
at a 90 degrees angle and then just

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.460 
at a 90 degrees angle and then just
decrease<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.649> angle<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.979> bit<00:02:11.510> until<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.540> feel

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
decrease the angle a bit until we feel

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.980 
decrease the angle a bit until we feel
that<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.920> screwdriver<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.090> falling<00:02:15.720> into

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
that the screwdriver is falling into

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.640 
that the screwdriver is falling into
that<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.670> hole<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:18.410> we're<00:02:19.410> just

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
that little hole and then we're just

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.670 
that little hole and then we're just
going<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.890> turn<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.250> screwdriver<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
going to turn the screwdriver and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.320 
going to turn the screwdriver and
hopefully<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> key<00:02:23.250> will<00:02:23.460> just<00:02:23.670> pop<00:02:24.150> out

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
hopefully the key will just pop out
