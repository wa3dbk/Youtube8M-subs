00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.350
 yes as girls hi everyone I am 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.029
 sacred laces and this is minecraft 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.680
 We are Monday and are up to date 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.120
 tutorials and the truth that tutorial of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.010
 today I like it a lot because it 's a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.590
 kind of it elevator in this 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.349
 agreement and century for example that you're going to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.029
 the mine and imagine fine stone but 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.529
 you still have four diamond spikes 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.930
 five diamond peaks or you have a trunk 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.340
 have peaks where you pikes and good you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.080
 full look at them I will explain a method 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.960
 to make it go up to your house to leave the 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.860
 objects this is very simple 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.690
 today there is a hiccup 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.699
 good 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.989
 they have hostel that agrees and the 8 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.309
 that high but let's go you can tell 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.309
 of height that you want you can not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 do what is high that turn it up 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.469
 I turn it back to go down that good 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.149
 to 100 can do grows of the win worth 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.140
 and well you can here says it is 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.640
 style objects 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.640
 and if they arrive they arrive 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.039
 well it has not come up I do not know why but 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.629
 he has to go up, he just moved 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.629
 I also have the garden 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.490
 in principle you have to climb to plains 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.810
 I say it if not those uploaded by a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.320
 small sometimes suffers 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.320
 but let's see 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.220
 There you are, what have you gone up? 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.329
 Go up up 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.159
 up here stays 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.990
 maybe it has fallen down but 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.729
 because I have not I have covered the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.799
 principle in the mine tells you this capped 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.350
 which is not going to fall down or anything 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.600
 you arrive you would take yourself here day 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.060
 always loosing knot you come here and you do 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.060
 until then you say it all at once 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.240
 there it goes up or for example imagine 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.509
 but you have everything is here you give it 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.509
 here 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.159
 A) Yes 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.030
 It is done 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.890
 you have climbed because you have them in the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.110
 mincyt to the current is ok because if not 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.110
 they do not do not fit well 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.830
 they have to go with an exact speed 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.730
 because if they go with more speed does not rise 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.620
 that is, the cost has already gone up you see that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.590
 They have fallen back but good to climb it 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.210
 which it was what we wanted it to 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.060
 we need for this as a block 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.510
 anybody let's take the others 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.510
 blocks of 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.969
 because that quartz for putting a block does not 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.829
 We need to go see glass 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.420
 we will need ice that is not ice 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:44.010
 compact is ice according 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.010
 and with a stream of water 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.810
 well we come here 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.840
 around here we do like this like this and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.840
 well here a fence and here another 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.080
 we break and put a block of ice 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.670
 of ice and hope that broken is here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.670
 unwittingly 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.430
 here we are going to put glass until the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.430
 crystal is the crystal ok 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.690
 It's over there 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.890
 if this crystal crystal crystal glass 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.290
 crystal glass ok east this 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.150
 this this one and this one goes up vale is some 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.989
 cross plus a cross and the middle of agreement 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.180
 you upload what you want for example 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.650
 up here is higher than that there 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.040
 that you are at the bottom and your mine is 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.019
 very bottom 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.610
 he is very player is very good because one 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.910
 is up doing things you say to him 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.090
 skype or any other program 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.830
 I take you to the objects 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.879
 that all the strips and the one that is 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.349
 ready to catch them all and 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.230
 save them in such a way that you do not have to 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.480
 one is going up going down biting the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.680
 insufferable development is true 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.340
 that is not very expensive because realistic already 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.470
 you see even if they burn the ice 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.310
 I would get the refrains I have a 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.319
 tutorial of an ice farm which 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.900
 Automatic orange ice that is very 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.940
 ok ok and you can see it without problem 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.720
 good in principle this then I for 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.580
 decorate just put ice here is worth 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.460
 and so you picas a knot of ice picas all 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.199
 about this you have a touch of silk and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.949
 with touches of silk since you already apply everything 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.949
 who wants to agree 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.060
 walking 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.020
 besides hey let me do well sincerely 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.090
 I think I'm going to break the mouse one day 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.070
 these is to say that you are buying one 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.630
 nadal is good more luma in buying it 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.930
 in the future a new but still shy 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.580
 some incredible and magnificent models today 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.520
 I will make a picture to ask complements 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.699
 good 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.880
 we have what would be true 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.010
 jesus thank you 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.560
 we already have what would be the tower then 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.350
 we put for example so and so and so a 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.480
 more block so that it does not slip 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.160
 decoration the ice of the latter what 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.840
 put by the core a5 of the crystal 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.210
 would agree but more generated 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.220
 in case it gets out of the book because I am 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.930
 these crystals that rise and it comes out 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.840
 the ship was going to the side so that it would not 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.680
 happen in agreement 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.090
 granada is like this I do not remember sincerely 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:38.919
 when is what they will be so leaving 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:43.710
 your world 123456789 bot mode 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.710
 so 4 5 6 7 8 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.499
 so that 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.850
 and great 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:02.290
 here they go two are eight voucher of the seventh 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:05.380
 sides of ice and the 6 and 5 2 blocks 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.960
 and then again ice 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.150
 is what it will do is the water gives a 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.140
 speed and if you put ice under it da 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.670
 higher speed 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.100
 this is going to stop it 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.500
 because if it goes too fast the block does not 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.560
 will go up voucher has an exact speed 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.000
 if you see that you do it and Spain does it and 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.000
 it does Spain area and it is more stockings 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.920
 incredible blocks that you see that no no 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.990
 It works because it goes too fast 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.760
 you have to go to some kind of block worth 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.760
 now we can the water stream 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.020
 and ready 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.200
 now we throw it away but here not here 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.590
 so let's see how it comes out 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:50.280
 well goes well goes up goes up goes up rises 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:54.600
 go up you see until the end there is for 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.510
 take out to dress height does not matter what 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.740
 you agree but exactly the same 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.729
 that you can also do can you put a 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.969
 dispenses up here 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:07.569
 here or here rather 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:09.069
 for example here spencer that they go to 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:11.319
 background measure the objects you give the 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:14.259
 lever and throwing them all useless 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:15.579
 what is your throwing up going alone or 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.169
 good chair like you 

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:19.449
 you want to agree is an elevator 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.709
 items is cheaper than other elevators 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:23.679
 of interest that exist that are with 

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:25.509
 dispenser with hoppers and others that finally 

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:28.659
 and afterwards they are more expensive considered that 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:30.789
 getting ice is pretty cheap and a 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:33.189
 block any is yes that is cheap a 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:35.739
 bucket of water is mega cheap fence 

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:37.269
 please do not forgive my mega that mega 

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:39.009
 cheap and burn sand by place in the 

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:41.049
 so many parts or a little coal and 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:43.419
 ready then I think this is a method of 

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:45.429
 get up is super super economical and what 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.199
 only clear is the touch of silk is what 

00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:50.019
 unique that I consider to be expensive and 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:52.119
 until the rest there is no more your day this 

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:54.969
 it's perfect so nothing if you like it 

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:55.989
 the video gives like suscribe and nothing 

00:07:54.969 --> 00:08:00.539
 tomorrow plays tuesday 

00:07:55.989 --> 00:08:00.539
 more videos and better even the guys
