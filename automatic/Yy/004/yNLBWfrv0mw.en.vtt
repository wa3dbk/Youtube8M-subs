actually seeing the mark is kind of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.759 
actually seeing the mark is kind of
turning<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.410> around<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:27.439> that's<00:00:28.439> pretty

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
turning it around here that's pretty

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.620 
turning it around here that's pretty
neat

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.540 

how<00:00:37.170> high<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:37.890> without<00:00:38.130> hitting<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
how high can you go without hitting the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
how high can you go without hitting the
fans<00:00:38.820> mark

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.150 

is<00:00:44.110> it<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.440> rescue<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.980> do<00:00:45.130> that<00:00:47.040> in<00:00:48.040> the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
is it to rescue to do that in the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:01:02.709 
is it to rescue to do that in the
poolroom<00:00:48.400> here

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.109 

so<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:03.469> an<00:01:03.620> autopilot<00:01:04.100> mode<00:01:04.460> right<00:01:04.729> now<00:01:04.940> I'm

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
so it's an autopilot mode right now I'm

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:32.889 
so it's an autopilot mode right now I'm
assuming

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.010 

that's<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:34.049> front-facing<00:01:34.500> camera<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.020> then

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that's a front-facing camera and then

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
that's a front-facing camera and then
you've<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> downward<00:01:38.070> facing<00:01:38.219> camera<00:01:38.880> as

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you've got a downward facing camera as

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.380 
you've got a downward facing camera as
well

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.130 

there<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.480> goes<00:01:44.510> that's<00:01:45.510> what<00:01:45.690> it<00:01:45.780> looks<00:01:45.930> like

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
there it goes that's what it looks like

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.390 
there it goes that's what it looks like
I<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.560> okay<00:01:48.380> beautiful
