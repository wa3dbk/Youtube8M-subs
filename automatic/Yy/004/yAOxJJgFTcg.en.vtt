00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.640
 good friends of what happened today we are 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.109
 on the field fernando teruel de la 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.450
 city â€‹â€‹of la vega we find ourselves with 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.610
 rigoberto mendoza first selection of 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.469
 draft for the real ones of the vega el 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.509
 government in the night today a great 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.009
 match not only on the offensive side 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.900
 but also on the offensive side to 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.419
 what do you attribute that great performance of 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.939
 this good night we went out with a lot 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.829
 decision we have to win the game already 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.300
 that we have little chance to enter the 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.640
 classification but we will not allow that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.739
 no team comes sought to improve 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 record with us we are going to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.800
 go out hard always defend I feel 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.420
 well pleased because he is giving me more 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.120
 opportunities and I can develop more my 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.129
 talent inside the court you had 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.239
 given minutes throughout the tournament the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.429
 match yesterday and today's 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.350
 specifically we were with a 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.589
 different attitude we saw you more aggressive 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.230
 and taking more participation at the time of 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.730
 go to the attack to what is due that change in 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.100
 the attitude and in the game of rigoberto 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.899
 mendoza there was a defensive failure because 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.879
 He felt so much with us because I had 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.589
 that I take care of that and I feel like 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.780
 more confidence now with the team and by 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.680
 that was what happened what happened the game 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.350
 Yesterday as today 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.350
 my strong penetration and I'm going to 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.780
 continue with that until you can not 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.190
 how hard is the work done 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.290
 defensive we know that they have the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.670
 responsibility to defend the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 Welsh stellar teams 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.860
 opposites and you have to stop the flow of 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.119
 points when they are on 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.070
 the good party I lent myself for that 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.500
 manager always tells me ever since the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.520
 half I go focused on defense to the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.110
 offensive goes out alone I never tried to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.460
 in front to pick up the ball and everything 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.020
 point I try to defend well because 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.110
 a good defense brings a good offense 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.000
 a basket today in the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.860
 open field in a counterattack the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.420
 team of the real ones that returned the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.390
 advantage to the team after having been 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.820
 down that you thought when you got the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.470
 ball at that moment when you thought to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.899
 when making that decision I thought about 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.910
 throw to never never never me yesterday 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.920
 only do not take the set because if 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.410
 I'm alone and if I have confidence and I 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.020
 he threw and I was released free cast 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.000
 single 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 finally the attitude of rigoberto 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.800
 mendoza and all the real team of the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.230
 vega facing the next good game 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.810
 let's continue hard hard hard hard hard 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.460
 and to win a match what we have left 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.930
 they have said that we have the record the year 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.840
 last and the team was better the year 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.000
 past but here's talent for that 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.670
 to show thanks to rigoberto 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.210
 mendoza you friends keep up with what 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.210
