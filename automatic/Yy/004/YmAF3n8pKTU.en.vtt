00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.559
 hello friends we are with a new video and 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.599
 we return with weight 2014 if gentlemen 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.519
 tutorial today we will learn to 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.929
 how to handle the goalie so I 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.240
 they had asked in several videos that 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.160
 you want to manage a better 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.130
 form the goalkeeper and be able to avoid some 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.660
 goals really is very easy and good 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.060
 we go with the controls to control 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.640
 the goalkeeper both in 2013 and in the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.620
 2014 is done in the same way there 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.320
 appeared holding the button 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.329
 of l1 on playstation and the right stick 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.400
 pressing we select the goalkeeper 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.590
 or in xbox with the eve and the right stick 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.760
 there it is we selected you after 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.860
 that we have it selected what 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.600
 we can move where we want with 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.160
 the left stick we can also 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.020
 run with the archer 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.520
 any player I want to show you 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.989
 that when our goalkeeper is out or 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.790
 is in a position that we do not want and 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.130
 we want it to come back, you just have to 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.950
 hold down the a button on 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.570
 xbox or the x on playstation with this 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.430
 our goalkeeper will automatically return 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.079
 to the arch and it's going to be placed in a 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.030
 right position to be able to tackle 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.590
 any balloon I recommend it for 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.269
 when our goalkeeper is misplaced 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.979
 we just keep pushing and he gets 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.909
 will automatically locate now I'm going to 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.249
 show how to get out 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.810
 there are ball but as the goalkeeper 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.490
 he threw himself to the floor 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.530
 to get the ball out we 'll see here 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.140
 again we select the goalkeeper and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.030
 when the ball is let's say divided 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.100
 we went running with our doorman to 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.079
 all unfair when we are reaching 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.509
 ball we press the be o button 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.250
 social sweep or circle button 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.649
 in play station is the sweep button 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.630
 and the goalkeeper will go out with everything to catch the 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.670
 ball and well it will also serve us 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.250
 to shrink or to try to recover 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.049
 the ball when they are so long men 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.369
 that goes to the forwards if 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.920
 some of you will realize 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.110
 I use the porter a lot or I use it 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.190
 quite in the online matches because 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.170
 Most people try 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.509
 send a ball enclosed to try 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.610
 hang the goalkeeper who is in by 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.130
 automatic assumption the one that handles the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.170
 computer what I do is that 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.349
 select the goalkeeper and just before 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.849
 that they send the ball over I do 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.350
 the magic the archer will come out and then 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:07.590
 I come back quickly and with that 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.479
 of having the balloons the goals of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.270
 globito which are now very much 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.670
 fashion in online matches something that 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 I also recommend you is that when 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 are facing a player and 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.440
 go backing out of space that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.850
 usually if they kick from a distance 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.410
 long our goalkeeper the proxy 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.720
 will come down and as our examples and see 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.250
 as it goes backwards and in the end then we do not 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.319
 they will be able to score the goal will be very 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.300
 difficult to handle the good of the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.100
 goalkeeper is that we also our 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.720
 defenses are going to exert pressure that is not 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.430
 they are going to stand looking and 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.900
 meanwhile we can handle 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.930
 the goalkeeper and place it in a better 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.370
 position if I noticed that in the shots 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.260
 corner our defenses too 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.000
 jump to nod when we're not 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.160
 handling us already when you drive them 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.650
 that the computer while we have the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.019
 doorman or we can give him many uses 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.510
 already with the practice we will be able to use it 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.580
 in different ways, well, I was 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.110
 forgetting for those who ask what 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.489
 button you have to press to cover 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.989
 throw yourself the goalie is shot 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.760
 you do not have to press automatically 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.100
 no button we just have to 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.640
 position it in a good place so that 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.830
 he gets the ball 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.750
 there is a manual way to throw yourself that is 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.380
 moving the left stick of 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.600
 move and see or circle and with this 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.390
 our goalkeeper will pull to the side 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.380
 that the ball goes but as I tell you 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.150
 strip automatically 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.510
 we will not have to press any button 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.930
 to guess the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.220
 the shots to the direction they go 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.230
 but friends I hope you liked the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.560
