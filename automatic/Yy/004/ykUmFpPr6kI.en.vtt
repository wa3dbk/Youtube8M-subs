gather<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:12.070> scarf<00:02:12.460> back<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:14.560> you

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
gather the scarf back like that like you

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.950 
gather the scarf back like that like you
were<00:02:14.800> tying<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.520> ponytail<00:02:16.030> with<00:02:16.480> your<00:02:16.600> hair<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
were tying a ponytail with your hair and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.060 
were tying a ponytail with your hair and
then<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:19.440> cross<00:02:20.440> over<00:02:20.830> can<00:02:20.980> you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
then what you do is cross over can you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.650 
then what you do is cross over can you
see<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.400> cross<00:02:21.670> over<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.260> two<00:02:24.270> halves<00:02:25.270> of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
see that cross over the two halves of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.230 
see that cross over the two halves of
the<00:02:25.840> scarf<00:02:26.110> basically<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.860> then<00:02:27.580> come<00:02:28.209> back

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
the scarf basically and then come back

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.449 
the scarf basically and then come back
round<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.950> guess<00:02:30.100> why<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.280> is

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
round and so you can guess why this is

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:39.500 
round and so you can guess why this is
going<00:02:30.610> right<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.390> bring<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:36.340> half<00:02:37.590> over

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
going right you just bring one half over

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.960 
going right you just bring one half over
like<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.950> get<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.130> bit<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.370> height<00:02:42.580> up

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
like that so you get a bit of height up

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.320 
like that so you get a bit of height up
on<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.390> scalp<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.840> then<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.239> were

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.770
