00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.350
 hello youtube friends as a student 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.320
 How to download minecraft 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.570
 the launcher Sijin and more like never 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.570
 happens if they do not come out I 'll leave them in the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.760
 description as always and we're going to 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.180
 have a mediafire page on how 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.610
 to do is download it where there is not yet 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.040
 and it's going to seem like a message to me 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.410
 I want to download you depending 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 the browser that they have 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.090
 downloaded we will be the 20 more 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.739
 those that have been opened and 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.609
 this index will be 28 tutorials 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.609
 we open it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.470
 we hope that if now 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.080
 I already have it open if I forget 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.200
 then since we managed to get a lot 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.610
 play 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.490
 it will be like this 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.310
 let's do is see him 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.420
 the profile and here are going to be all 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.140
 Minecraft versions 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.740
 the 83 the last one that came out has from the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:40.649
 1 until the 83 of leaving another estimate 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.369
 since he has put play he will give in 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:48.990
 download and good download some 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:53.700
 native files for the minecraft in its 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.670
 Minecraft point folder and it already has 1 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.600
 point the version that was pointed there is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 because he already discharged 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.890
 the good you have done to us you carry the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.170
 year since the launcher has been closed 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.640
 the window will appear to us already of mark 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.640
 but we will make them open 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.010
 I would soon open it, I'll put it 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.700
 now I return you 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.709
 either open minecraft let's hope that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.129
 finish opening well they appeared 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.900
 of molle as a rule when he achieved 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.360
 the provider is coming down and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:46.290
 Startled from giving an error of no 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.290
 answer but do not worry after 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.000
 and he takes care well there is not going to be 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.810
 any 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.020
 and also that it is not expected it does not take 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.020
 much 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.099
 since it has loaded well 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.440
 as you say the minecraft kingdom 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:33.000
 I'm going to let you open 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.450
 because it must be a prize account and if 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.800
 are the pirates then either here 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.800
 it was multiplayer 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.190
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.190
 tutorial
