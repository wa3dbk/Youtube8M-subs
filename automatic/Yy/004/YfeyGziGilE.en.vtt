00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.510
 remember the batman television series 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.370
 of the seventies maybe not all but 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.179
 those who remember this series with 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.420
 nostalgia we received in 2003 a last 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 gift of the cast of this movie 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.189
 although I suspect that maybe the gift 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.769
 it was more for them than for us 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.279
 a movie called the return to the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.340
 baticueva the return to the batcave the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649
 bad adventures of adam and board is a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.649
 relatively short and simple movie 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.320
 that remembers and recreates the dynamics of 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.280
 that series sometimes with self mockery already 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.280
 times with pride 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.010
 and actor Adam West who played 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.230
 batman in the series receives an invitation 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.820
 mysterious and prepares to go to 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.820
 a charity auction 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.799
 affectation and laying 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.290
 there he meets bert words loving 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.500
 in the series who also received a 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.500
 invitation 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.070
 but it is a transaction 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.800
 but there are clues the criminal leaves them a 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.800
 riddle 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:47.969
 the wish 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:51.170
 I wonder who the water will be but you 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.170
 never point 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 solution 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.310
 from this moment the adventure of 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.680
 present is mixed with a series of 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.450
 flashbacks that detail several anecdotes 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.450
 sometimes fun 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.060
 sometimes sad 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.660
 sometimes frightening fate image 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.660
 and tenerife 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.980
 sometimes stimulating 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.830
 of the life of both actors while 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.300
 they participated in the series of course 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.300
 that we have a fight scene 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.280
 deadly traps and the narrator of the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.280
 end of episodes 23 power 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.570
 this movie has a low budget 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.050
 and you notice it between the address 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.200
 unfocused the inaccurate edition and the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.100
 improvised performances the rhythm changes 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.100
 from rampant to tedious several times 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.930
 it's a meeting of old friends 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.720
 sharing remembrances and reliving 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.400
 an adventure for the old days if 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.100
 you do not remember or you do not want to know 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.220
 about the series this movie does not have 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.440
 nothing for you but if you're a fan like me 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.430
 and what I told you woke up your bad and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.970
 nostalgia you can not miss it that way 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.970
 the return to the batcave exists
