00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
on your heels this could be an issue
that<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.459> may<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.909> out<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:04.020> you're

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that you may have out there if you're

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.199 
that you may have out there if you're
not<00:02:04.289> a<00:02:04.409> great<00:02:04.619> bunker<00:02:05.069> player<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.819> can<00:02:06.030> see

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
not a great bunker player you can see

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.330 
not a great bunker player you can see
straight<00:02:06.569> away<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.229> angle<00:02:07.739> of<00:02:07.799> attacks<00:02:08.160> are

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
straight away this angle of attacks are

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.669 
straight away this angle of attacks are
not<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.819> right<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.810> body<00:02:10.140> rotation

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
not going to be right this body rotation

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.800 
not going to be right this body rotation
is<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> work<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:11.970> his<00:02:12.420> body<00:02:12.569> is

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
is not going to work because his body is

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.110 
is not going to work because his body is
not<00:02:13.019> in<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> position<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.129> work<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.970> go

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
not in a position that it can work so go

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.720 
not in a position that it can work so go
from<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.510> set<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.079> into<00:02:16.650> where<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.549> to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
from that set up into where you like to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.640 
from that set up into where you like to
play<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.090> shot<00:02:18.299> from<00:02:19.609> much<00:02:20.609> more<00:02:20.910> athletic

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
play the shot from much more athletic

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.170 
play the shot from much more athletic
much<00:02:22.650> more<00:02:22.890> difficult<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:24.030> this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
much more difficult to be in this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.059 
much more difficult to be in this
position<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:24.959> boy<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.829> to<00:02:25.890> make<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
position but boy it's going to make a

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.559 
position but boy it's going to make a
massive<00:02:26.430> difference<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.209> Bunker<00:02:27.540> play

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
massive difference to the Bunker play

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.990 
massive difference to the Bunker play
technique<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:29.040> performance<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.879> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
technique and and the performance of the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.839 
technique and and the performance of the
shot<00:02:30.209> from<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.799> there's<00:02:32.010> Tom<00:02:32.370> there's

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
shot from here so there's Tom there's

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.150 
shot from here so there's Tom there's
his<00:02:33.090> setup<00:02:33.329> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.079> can<00:02:34.290> get<00:02:34.440> Tom's<00:02:34.709> technique

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
his setup if you can get Tom's technique

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.280 
his setup if you can get Tom's technique
and<00:02:35.400> his<00:02:35.760> work<00:02:36.030> ethic<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.750> too<00:02:36.959> can<00:02:37.139> be<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
and his work ethic you too can be a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.549 
and his work ethic you too can be a
