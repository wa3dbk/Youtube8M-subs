map<00:00:47.180> which<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.829> really<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.129> well<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.800> this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
map which I really like as well so this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.720 
map which I really like as well so this
is<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.340> pre-recorded<00:00:54.000> footage<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:55.730> it's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
is some pre-recorded footage and it's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.240 
is some pre-recorded footage and it's
basically<00:00:57.000> showing<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.329> around<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> map<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
basically showing you around the map I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.660 
basically showing you around the map I
tried<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> make<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.730> sort<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:01.520> professional<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
