here that air coming out in the lower
part<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> plenum<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.489> there's<00:00:57.180> an

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
part of the plenum here there's an

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
part of the plenum here there's an
intercooler<00:00:57.719> sits<00:00:58.140> right<00:00:58.320> inside<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
intercooler sits right inside here and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000 
intercooler sits right inside here and
as<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> air<00:01:00.359> flows<00:01:01.140> through<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> cools

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
as the air flows through there it cools

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.799 
as the air flows through there it cools
down<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.850> goes<00:01:03.030> into<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> intake

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
down and then it goes into the intake

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
down and then it goes into the intake
runners<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:04.890> unique<00:01:05.070> very

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
runners so it's a very unique very

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
runners so it's a very unique very

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
of the things that we focused on was

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.290 
of the things that we focused on was
trying<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.220> eliminate<00:02:38.370> all<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.880> multiple

pieces that other competitors have

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.940 
pieces that other competitors have
we've<00:02:42.450> only<00:02:42.600> got<00:02:42.810> several<00:02:43.230> ceiling<00:02:43.620> joints

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
we've only got several ceiling joints

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.980 
we've only got several ceiling joints
we've<00:02:44.070> got<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> intake<00:02:44.610> face<00:02:44.880> here<00:02:45.150> they<00:02:45.630> uses

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
we've got the intake face here they uses

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.230 
we've got the intake face here they uses
the<00:02:46.110> original<00:02:46.200> Ford<00:02:46.830> style<00:02:47.400> or<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.910> style

in the stock position using the standard
fuel<00:02:54.180> rail<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.620> all<00:02:55.770> we<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.310> ceiling

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
fuel rail and so all we have for ceiling

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
fuel rail and so all we have for ceiling
wise<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.360> an<00:02:57.570> upper<00:02:57.780> cover<00:02:57.990> gasket<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.890> the

front of the gear case so we've

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.199 
front of the gear case so we've
eliminated<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.660> quite<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.350> few<00:03:01.880> potential<00:03:02.880> leak

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
eliminated a quite a few potential leak

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.660 
eliminated a quite a few potential leak
areas<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:04.800> again<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.310> look<00:03:05.340> at<00:03:05.550> the
