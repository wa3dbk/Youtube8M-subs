all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.989> just<00:00:01.170> doing<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.350> little<00:00:01.410> checking

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
all right just doing a little checking

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.220 
all right just doing a little checking
here<00:00:01.949> these<00:00:02.129> are<00:00:02.570> that's<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.689> lower<00:00:03.899> control

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
here these are that's a lower control

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.810 
here these are that's a lower control
arm<00:00:04.500> off<00:00:05.420> hard<00:00:06.420> body<00:00:07.340> don't<00:00:08.340> know<00:00:08.429> exactly

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
arm off hard body don't know exactly

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.070 
arm off hard body don't know exactly
what<00:00:09.000> year<00:00:10.940> late<00:00:11.940> 720<00:00:12.509> doesn't<00:00:12.750> really<00:00:12.870> matter

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
what year late 720 doesn't really matter

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.039 
what year late 720 doesn't really matter
anyway<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> frame<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.929> 520<00:00:15.929> what

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
anyway this is a frame for a 520 what

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.560 
anyway this is a frame for a 520 what
I'm<00:00:16.139> checking<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:17.000> look<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.330> fits

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
I'm checking here look at that that fits

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.200 
I'm checking here look at that that fits
perfect<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.740> means<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> torsion

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
perfect so that means that the torsion

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.570 
perfect so that means that the torsion
bar<00:00:21.359> splines<00:00:21.720> that's<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.619> Sun<00:00:22.830> bolt<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
bar splines that's the Sun bolt or the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.560 
bar splines that's the Sun bolt or the
torsion<00:00:26.580> bar<00:00:26.730> anchor<00:00:27.000> bolt<00:00:27.210> something<00:00:27.480> like

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
torsion bar anchor bolt something like

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.920 
torsion bar anchor bolt something like
that

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.150 
that
I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> anchor<00:00:28.500> bolts<00:00:28.710> actually<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
I think the anchor bolts actually at the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.389 
I think the anchor bolts actually at the
other<00:00:29.279> side<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:30.779> torsion<00:00:31.140> bar<00:00:31.289> anchor<00:00:31.740> on

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
other side but the torsion bar anchor on

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.440 
other side but the torsion bar anchor on
the<00:00:32.870> black<00:00:33.870> control<00:00:34.260> arm<00:00:34.610> just<00:00:35.610> fits<00:00:36.120> right<00:00:36.210> on

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the black control arm just fits right on

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
the black control arm just fits right on
there<00:00:36.480> beautifully<00:00:37.489> which<00:00:38.489> means<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
there beautifully which means the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
there beautifully which means the
torsion<00:00:39.930> bar<00:00:45.200> I'm<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> modify

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
torsion bar I'm going to do is modify

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.600 
torsion bar I'm going to do is modify
this<00:00:47.640> arm<00:00:47.969> right<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:49.440> work<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.039> 520

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
this arm right here to work on the 520

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
this arm right here to work on the 520
now<00:00:51.000> I'll<00:00:51.120> need<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.449> couple<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.989> spacers<00:00:52.410> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
now I'll need a couple of spacers in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.590 
now I'll need a couple of spacers in
here<00:00:52.910> that'll<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.000> easy<00:00:54.149> enough<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> figure

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
here that'll be easy enough to figure

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.950 
here that'll be easy enough to figure
out<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.579> torsion<00:00:57.239> bar<00:00:57.390> anchor<00:00:57.780> right

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
out but that torsion bar anchor right

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.560 
out but that torsion bar anchor right
there<00:00:58.199> since<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.489> fit<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> splines<00:01:00.300> that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
there since it will fit the splines that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.219 
there since it will fit the splines that
means<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.730> could<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> arm<00:01:04.049> on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
means that I could I can put this arm on

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.310 
means that I could I can put this arm on
without<00:01:04.439> any<00:01:04.710> problem<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.140> fit

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
without any problem and it will fit

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.789 
without any problem and it will fit
right<00:01:07.470> in

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
right in

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
right in
I<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> knew<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.549> before<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I think I knew that before but I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.609 
I think I knew that before but I
definitely<00:01:09.659> wanted<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> double-check<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
definitely wanted to double-check it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.320 
definitely wanted to double-check it
before<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> started<00:01:11.130> cutting<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> arm<00:01:12.479> up

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
before I started cutting the arm up

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.039 
before I started cutting the arm up
hopefully<00:01:15.330> I'll<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.840> project

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
hopefully I'll get to this project

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:41.520 
hopefully I'll get to this project
pretty<00:01:16.350> soon

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.780 

all<00:01:42.490> right<00:01:42.820> Dave<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.300> get<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:44.670> got<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
all right Dave and I get the got the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.350 
all right Dave and I get the got the
supports<00:01:46.180> up<00:01:46.810> that<00:01:47.590> ought<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.800> be<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:49.180> than

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
supports up that ought to be more than

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.990 
supports up that ought to be more than
strong<00:01:49.690> enough<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.080> just<00:01:50.110> need<00:01:50.410> to<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
strong enough we just need to take the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.110 
strong enough we just need to take the
suspension<00:01:52.360> out<00:01:52.600> from<00:01:52.810> behind<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.260> now<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.650> I

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
suspension out from behind it now and I

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.920 
suspension out from behind it now and I
think<00:01:55.120> it'll<00:01:55.330> do<00:01:55.510> what<00:01:55.690> we<00:01:55.810> need<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.229> do

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
think it'll do what we need it to do

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.990 
think it'll do what we need it to do
yeah<00:01:58.930> some<00:01:59.260> old<00:01:59.410> bed<00:01:59.560> frame<00:01:59.590> rails<00:02:00.040> keep

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
yeah some old bed frame rails keep

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.120 
yeah some old bed frame rails keep
everything

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.550

yeah those those are work so we have our

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.170 
yeah those those are work so we have our
plate<00:02:11.800> hanging<00:02:12.130> out<00:02:12.250> here<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.459> space<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.030> we're

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
plate hanging out here in space so we're

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.400 
plate hanging out here in space so we're
getting<00:02:13.360> ready<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:15.720> put<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.780> hub<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.170> stuff

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
getting ready to put the hub on it stuff

Oh actually if I can do it with that we

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:34.170 
Oh actually if I can do it with that we
can<00:02:22.750> run<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> camera<00:02:23.260> too<00:02:23.380> much<00:02:32.850> wow<00:02:33.850> that's<00:02:34.090> a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
can run the camera too much wow that's a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.150 
can run the camera too much wow that's a
short<00:02:34.450> cover<00:02:34.690> arm<00:02:36.209> that's<00:02:37.209> like<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> baby<00:02:37.660> arm

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
short cover arm that's like a baby arm

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.010 
short cover arm that's like a baby arm
Wow

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
might not work positive right I'm

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
just got to rotate the frame around the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.360 
just got to rotate the frame around the
spindle<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.769> make<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.010> line<00:03:09.130> up<00:03:12.360> well<00:03:14.370> I'm

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
spindle to make it line up well I'm

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.520 
spindle to make it line up well I'm
gonna<00:03:15.519> be<00:03:15.670> alright<00:03:16.480> Dave<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.959> are<00:03:16.989> playing

gonna be alright Dave and I are playing
with<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.060> ball<00:03:19.060> joint<00:03:19.329> mod<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.989> our<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.799> frame

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
with the ball joint mod on our the frame

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.300 
with the ball joint mod on our the frame
520<00:03:21.610> frame<00:03:22.269> clip<00:03:22.480> here<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.920> far<00:03:24.130> it's

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
520 frame clip here and so far it's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.600 
520 frame clip here and so far it's
actually<00:03:24.670> looking<00:03:24.820> pretty<00:03:25.000> darn<00:03:25.390> nice

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
actually looking pretty darn nice

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.190 
actually looking pretty darn nice
initial<00:03:27.610> measurements<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:28.959> we've<00:03:29.079> got

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
initial measurements you know we've got

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.340 
initial measurements you know we've got
there<00:03:29.380> our<00:03:29.850> plate<00:03:30.850> there<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.420> track

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
there our plate there that is track

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.060 
there our plate there that is track
width<00:03:32.620> ride<00:03:32.890> height<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.540> we<00:03:35.350> basically<00:03:35.650> put

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
width ride height and we basically put

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.870 
width ride height and we basically put
the<00:03:36.190> spindle<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.440> hub<00:03:38.650> mounted<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.640> there

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
the spindle and the hub mounted on there

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.979 
the spindle and the hub mounted on there
we've<00:03:40.090> taken<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.420> look<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.690> we've<00:03:40.780> measured

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
we've taken a look and we've measured

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.250 
we've taken a look and we've measured
and<00:03:41.380> what<00:03:41.860> we're<00:03:41.980> getting<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.370> far<00:03:42.579> is<00:03:42.760> that

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
and what we're getting so far is that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.500 
and what we're getting so far is that
this<00:03:44.260> arm<00:03:44.500> needs<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.860> be<00:03:44.980> shortened<00:03:45.370> an<00:03:46.329> inch

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
this arm needs to be shortened an inch

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.390 
this arm needs to be shortened an inch
and<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> quarter<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.100> will<00:03:48.220> make<00:03:48.340> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
and a quarter and that will make it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.430 
and a quarter and that will make it
really<00:03:48.790> darn<00:03:49.060> close<00:03:49.360> we'll<00:03:49.660> do<00:03:49.780> exact

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
really darn close we'll do exact

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.130 
really darn close we'll do exact
measurements<00:03:51.239> once<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.360> arms<00:03:52.599> cut<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.900> kind

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
measurements once the arms cut that kind

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.500 
measurements once the arms cut that kind
of<00:03:53.200> thing<00:03:53.349> so<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:54.580> video<00:03:54.849> is<00:03:54.970> almost<00:03:55.120> more

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
of thing so this video is almost more

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.330 
of thing so this video is almost more
my<00:03:55.689> notes<00:03:55.930> than<00:03:56.280> anything<00:03:57.280> else<00:03:57.549> so<00:03:57.909> if<00:03:59.159> if<00:04:00.159> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
my notes than anything else so if if the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.729 
my notes than anything else so if if the
steering<00:04:00.519> stop<00:04:00.879> gets<00:04:01.120> cut<00:04:01.299> right<00:04:01.480> here<00:04:01.739> maybe

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
steering stop gets cut right here maybe

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.190 
steering stop gets cut right here maybe
with<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.980> plasma<00:04:03.370> cutter<00:04:03.489> around<00:04:03.670> here<00:04:04.200> when

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
with a plasma cutter around here when

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.569 
with a plasma cutter around here when
that's<00:04:05.379> loose<00:04:05.739> then<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.129> whole<00:04:06.250> thing<00:04:06.459> will

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
that's loose then the whole thing will

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.130 
that's loose then the whole thing will
just<00:04:06.610> slide<00:04:07.060> back<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.420> inch<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.930> quarter

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
just slide back the inch and a quarter

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.830 
just slide back the inch and a quarter
and<00:04:08.290> get<00:04:08.530> welded<00:04:08.920> back<00:04:09.069> on<00:04:09.280> here<00:04:09.579> again<00:04:09.840> so

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
and get welded back on here again so

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.770 
and get welded back on here again so
that'll<00:04:11.110> save<00:04:11.379> and<00:04:11.739> keep<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.640> steering<00:04:13.480> stop

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
that'll save and keep the steering stop

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.800 
that'll save and keep the steering stop
integrity<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.799> its<00:04:15.519> spacing<00:04:16.060> exactly<00:04:16.660> where

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
integrity and its spacing exactly where

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.939 
integrity and its spacing exactly where
we<00:04:16.930> want<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.320> stuff<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:17.709> that<00:04:17.829> ought<00:04:17.919> to

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
we want it that stuff so that ought to

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.789 
we want it that stuff so that ought to
be<00:04:18.070> perfect<00:04:18.459> so<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.959> shock<00:04:20.199> adjuster<00:04:20.650> there

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
be perfect so the shock adjuster there

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.260 
be perfect so the shock adjuster there
this<00:04:20.949> is<00:04:21.130> basically<00:04:21.579> sitting<00:04:21.789> right<00:04:22.000> at<00:04:22.120> right

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
this is basically sitting right at right

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.200 
this is basically sitting right at right
height<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.690> we've<00:04:23.500> measured<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.979> arm<00:04:24.490> swing

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
height and we've measured the arm swing

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.090 
height and we've measured the arm swing
with<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.479> shock<00:04:25.750> on<00:04:25.990> all<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.710> way<00:04:26.800> up<00:04:26.830> all<00:04:27.070> the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
with the shock on all the way up all the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.050 
with the shock on all the way up all the
way<00:04:27.190> down<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:30.010> has<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> shock<00:04:30.460> length<00:04:30.699> of<00:04:30.789> 11

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
way down this has a shock length of 11

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.779 
way down this has a shock length of 11
inches<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.389> is<00:04:31.449> right<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:32.169> between<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:33.010> 9<00:04:33.430> to

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
inches that is right in between the 9 to

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.110 
inches that is right in between the 9 to
13<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:35.050> quarter<00:04:35.789> travel<00:04:36.789> we've<00:04:36.940> already

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
13 and a quarter travel we've already

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.240 
13 and a quarter travel we've already
noted<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:41.020> let's<00:04:41.199> drop<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.770> down<00:04:42.039> a<00:04:42.100> bit

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
noted so so let's drop this down a bit

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.120 
noted so so let's drop this down a bit
and<00:04:42.550> then<00:04:43.120> throw<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.539> spindle<00:04:44.050> back<00:04:44.199> on<00:04:44.470> we've

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
and then throw the spindle back on we've

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.300 
and then throw the spindle back on we've
also<00:04:45.310> checked<00:04:45.729> it<00:04:45.970> with<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:50.160> we've<00:04:51.160> also

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
also checked it with the we've also

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.800 
also checked it with the we've also
checked<00:04:51.699> it<00:04:51.820> with<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:51.970> other<00:04:52.150> control<00:04:52.600> arm

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
checked it with the other control arm

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.529 
checked it with the other control arm
built<00:04:53.110> for<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.470> other<00:04:53.740> mod<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.539> basically

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
built for the other mod and basically

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.480 
built for the other mod and basically
the<00:04:55.720> other<00:04:55.840> control<00:04:56.229> arm<00:04:56.440> is<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:57.250> right

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
the other control arm is the right

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.320 
the other control arm is the right
length<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:58.150> go<00:04:58.990> with<00:04:59.199> this<00:04:59.470> lower<00:05:00.340> control<00:05:00.729> arm

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.879 

so<00:05:04.330> if<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:04.750> lower<00:05:04.960> control<00:05:05.320> arm<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.800> we

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
so if this lower control arm and we

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.230 
so if this lower control arm and we
measured<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.520> it's<00:05:06.639> an<00:05:06.910> inch<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.210> a

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
measured it and it's an inch and a

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.510 
measured it and it's an inch and a
quarter<00:05:07.389> too<00:05:07.660> long<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.830> reason<00:05:09.190> we<00:05:09.310> built

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
quarter too long the reason we built

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.640 
quarter too long the reason we built
that<00:05:09.699> upper<00:05:09.970> control<00:05:10.210> arm<00:05:10.510> was<00:05:11.139> to<00:05:11.289> make<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.560> an

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
that upper control arm was to make it an

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.790 
that upper control arm was to make it an
inch<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:11.949> a<00:05:11.979> quarter<00:05:12.130> longer<00:05:13.199> so

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
inch and a quarter longer so

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.490 
inch and a quarter longer so
we<00:05:16.699> gotta<00:05:16.880> go<00:05:17.000> look<00:05:17.120> at<00:05:17.240> some<00:05:17.389> stock<00:05:17.630> arms<00:05:18.020> hit

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
we gotta go look at some stock arms hit

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.379 
we gotta go look at some stock arms hit
the<00:05:18.620> scrapyard<00:05:19.130> maybe<00:05:19.280> tomorrow<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:22.210> we<00:05:23.210> may

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
the scrapyard maybe tomorrow and we may

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.020 
the scrapyard maybe tomorrow and we may
just<00:05:23.630> find<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:24.080> stock<00:05:24.770> 720<00:05:25.460> is<00:05:25.580> going<00:05:25.759> to<00:05:25.880> put

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
just find that stock 720 is going to put

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.340 
just find that stock 720 is going to put
some<00:05:26.180> caster<00:05:26.600> to<00:05:26.630> this<00:05:26.840> thing<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.229> actually

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
some caster to this thing and actually

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.129 
some caster to this thing and actually
be<00:05:27.740> really<00:05:28.190> darn<00:05:28.400> close<00:05:28.699> at<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.660> very<00:05:29.840> least

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
be really darn close at the very least

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.760 
be really darn close at the very least
I've<00:05:30.830> been<00:05:31.100> told<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:32.050> stock<00:05:33.050> 720<00:05:33.620> arm

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
I've been told that the stock 720 arm

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.890 
I've been told that the stock 720 arm
the<00:05:33.919> pivot<00:05:34.250> fits<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.669> 521<00:05:35.300> bolt<00:05:35.690> holes

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
the pivot fits the 521 bolt holes

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.770 
the pivot fits the 521 bolt holes
perfectly<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.820> at<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.150> very<00:05:38.180> least<00:05:38.389> I<00:05:38.720> will

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
perfectly so at the very least I will

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.810 
perfectly so at the very least I will
build<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.199> arm<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:40.400> hold<00:05:40.580> use<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.210> 720<00:05:42.110> pivot

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
build the arm to hold use the 720 pivot

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.400 
build the arm to hold use the 720 pivot
so<00:05:43.820> yeah<00:05:44.360> so<00:05:44.539> let's<00:05:44.690> just<00:05:44.750> raise<00:05:45.050> that<00:05:45.080> up

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
so yeah so let's just raise that up

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.340 
so yeah so let's just raise that up
there<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:50.270> ball<00:05:50.539> joints<00:05:50.840> not<00:05:50.990> exactly

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
there and the ball joints not exactly

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.689 
there and the ball joints not exactly
straight<00:05:51.590> up<00:05:51.800> and<00:05:51.919> down<00:05:51.979> but<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:52.340> can<00:05:52.490> see

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
straight up and down but you can see

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.570 
straight up and down but you can see
that<00:05:52.970> it<00:05:53.240> is<00:05:53.300> not<00:05:53.870> very<00:05:54.830> far<00:05:54.919> off<00:05:55.250> at<00:05:55.460> all

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
that it is not very far off at all

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:03.760 
that it is not very far off at all
that's<00:05:56.410> inch<00:05:57.410> and<00:05:57.560> a<00:05:57.590> quarter<00:05:57.770> maybe<00:05:58.039> oh<00:06:02.770> this

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
that's inch and a quarter maybe oh this

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.350 
that's inch and a quarter maybe oh this
is<00:06:03.889> an<00:06:03.979> inch<00:06:04.130> and<00:06:04.190> a<00:06:04.280> quarter<00:06:04.430> piece<00:06:04.699> of<00:06:04.850> square

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
is an inch and a quarter piece of square

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.310 
is an inch and a quarter piece of square
tubing<00:06:05.720> so<00:06:06.310> if<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:08.000> hold<00:06:08.479> it<00:06:08.630> up<00:06:08.720> there<00:06:08.870> or<00:06:08.930> if<00:06:09.199> I

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
tubing so if I hold it up there or if I

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.140 
tubing so if I hold it up there or if I
if<00:06:09.830> I<00:06:09.919> get<00:06:10.070> fairly<00:06:10.310> close<00:06:10.520> I'm<00:06:10.789> just<00:06:10.940> guessing

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
if I get fairly close I'm just guessing

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.939 
if I get fairly close I'm just guessing
yeah<00:06:11.389> it's<00:06:11.930> less<00:06:12.289> than<00:06:12.500> an<00:06:12.590> inch<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.919> a

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
yeah it's less than an inch and a

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:18.550 
yeah it's less than an inch and a
quarter<00:06:13.130> oh<00:06:16.479> yeah<00:06:17.509> so<00:06:17.810> once<00:06:18.380> we<00:06:18.530> actually

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
quarter oh yeah so once we actually

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.800 
quarter oh yeah so once we actually
start<00:06:19.340> cutting<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:19.639> arm<00:06:19.789> we'll<00:06:20.330> have<00:06:20.449> a<00:06:20.479> much

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
start cutting the arm we'll have a much

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.600 
start cutting the arm we'll have a much
better<00:06:20.870> idea<00:06:21.139> of<00:06:21.500> exactly<00:06:21.770> how<00:06:22.099> much<00:06:22.220> to<00:06:22.400> take

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
better idea of exactly how much to take

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.500 
better idea of exactly how much to take
off<00:06:22.900> I<00:06:23.900> probably<00:06:24.830> should<00:06:25.070> have<00:06:25.099> kept<00:06:25.340> the

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
off I probably should have kept the

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.160 
off I probably should have kept the
upper<00:06:26.510> arm<00:06:26.780> out<00:06:26.960> oh<00:06:27.169> well<00:06:27.560> next<00:06:27.949> time
