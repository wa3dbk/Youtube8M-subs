00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.490 
by 11 I mean that was really incredible
and<00:03:05.340> I'm<00:03:06.210> really<00:03:06.450> giving<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.870> puzzle<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.350> lot

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and I'm really giving this puzzle a lot

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.320 
and I'm really giving this puzzle a lot
more<00:03:07.650> credit<00:03:08.010> than<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.160> did<00:03:08.400> with<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.610> 12<00:03:08.880> by<00:03:09.060> 12

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
more credit than I did with the 12 by 12

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.930 
more credit than I did with the 12 by 12
I<00:03:09.540> think<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> reason<00:03:10.290> why<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.710> did<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.100> was

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
I think the reason why I did that was

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.300 
I think the reason why I did that was
because<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.420> was<00:03:12.810> very<00:03:12.930> skeptical<00:03:13.500> about<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.040> so

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
because I was very skeptical about it so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.850 
because I was very skeptical about it so
thereby<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.000> harped<00:03:15.600> way<00:03:15.960> too<00:03:16.020> much<00:03:16.440> about<00:03:16.740> the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
thereby I harped way too much about the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.400 
thereby I harped way too much about the
poor<00:03:17.070> quality<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.900> what<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:19.230> should

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
poor quality and what I really should

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.410 
poor quality and what I really should
have<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.710> said<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.580> also<00:03:21.000> includes

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
have just said and this also includes

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.390 
have just said and this also includes

for the eight by eight and the 11 by 11

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.430 
for the eight by eight and the 11 by 11
it<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.910> course<00:03:24.120> has<00:03:24.360> low<00:03:24.510> quality<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.260> it's

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
it of course has low quality but it's

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
it of course has low quality but it's
still<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.830> fully<00:03:26.190> functional<00:03:26.730> puzzle<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.450> yeah

spokesperson for V cubes like I guess he

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.930 
spokesperson for V cubes like I guess he
gets<00:03:46.350> together<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.770> them<00:03:47.010> every<00:03:47.550> now<00:03:47.700> and

your<00:04:54.240> puzzle<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.080> advertise<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:56.069> or<00:04:57.060> in

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
your puzzle and advertise it or in

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.189 
your puzzle and advertise it or in
advertise<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:58.490> they<00:04:59.490> made<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.449> think

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
advertise that they made it I think

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.290 
advertise that they made it I think
that's<00:05:01.500> basically<00:05:02.099> what<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.550> reasoning<00:05:03.030> is

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
that's basically what the reasoning is

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.230 
that's basically what the reasoning is
there<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.470> kind<00:05:05.310> of<00:05:05.400> seems<00:05:05.669> like<00:05:05.789> Tony

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
there so it kind of seems like Tony

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.960 
there so it kind of seems like Tony
Fisher<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.810> stealing<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.800> credit<00:05:08.190> away<00:05:08.460> but

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
Fisher is stealing the credit away but

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.589 
Fisher is stealing the credit away but
I'm<00:05:09.240> not<00:05:09.680> I'm<00:05:10.680> not<00:05:10.740> I'm<00:05:11.099> really<00:05:11.729> don't<00:05:12.300> know

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
I'm not I'm not I'm really don't know

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:13.760 
I'm not I'm not I'm really don't know
what<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.020> think<00:05:13.050> about<00:05:13.289> the<00:05:13.470> whole<00:05:13.560> situation

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
what to think about the whole situation

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.460 
what to think about the whole situation
and<00:05:14.370> purposefully<00:05:15.180> purposefully<00:05:16.110> have

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
and purposefully purposefully have

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.260 
and purposefully purposefully have
stayed<00:05:16.740> out<00:05:16.979> of<00:05:17.009> the<00:05:17.370> topic<00:05:17.759> discussion

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
stayed out of the topic discussion

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.270 
stayed out of the topic discussion
because<00:05:18.479> it's<00:05:18.630> just<00:05:18.690> like<00:05:18.900> whoa<00:05:19.139> man<00:05:20.039> it's

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
because it's just like whoa man it's

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.370 
because it's just like whoa man it's
like<00:05:20.520> they're<00:05:21.330> firing<00:05:21.539> bazookas<00:05:22.080> at<00:05:22.229> each

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
like they're firing bazookas at each

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.640 
like they're firing bazookas at each
other<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:24.300> anyway<00:05:24.690> that's<00:05:25.229> my<00:05:25.320> thoughts

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
other so but anyway that's my thoughts

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.999 
other so but anyway that's my thoughts
about<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.130> whole<00:05:26.280> thing<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:27.110> i<00:05:28.110> believe<00:05:28.889> the

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
about the whole thing and i believe the

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.740 
about the whole thing and i believe the
last<00:05:29.220> thing<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.550> wanted<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:29.910> talk<00:05:30.150> about<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:30.720> a

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
last thing I wanted to talk about is a

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.170 
last thing I wanted to talk about is a
video<00:05:31.259> of<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.680> cube<00:05:31.889> for<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.160> Tara<00:05:32.520> meets<00:05:32.759> his

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
video of the cube for you Tara meets his

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.830 
video of the cube for you Tara meets his
emerged<00:05:34.080> so<00:05:34.650> James<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.759> owner<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:36.060> cute<00:05:36.570> view

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
emerged so James the owner of cute view

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.980 
emerged so James the owner of cute view
has<00:05:37.199> made<00:05:38.099> a<00:05:38.130> prototype<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:39.270> here's<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.870> video

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
has made a prototype so here's the video

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.990 
has made a prototype so here's the video
again<00:05:40.530> from<00:05:40.830> some<00:05:41.099> random<00:05:41.460> chinese<00:05:41.940> website

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.360 

I<00:06:22.949> know<00:06:24.090> y'all<00:06:25.090> don't<00:06:25.199> know<00:06:26.199> y'all<00:06:26.229> so<00:06:26.889> again

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
I know y'all don't know y'all so again

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.129 
I know y'all don't know y'all so again
just<00:06:27.400> like<00:06:27.970> with<00:06:28.180> those<00:06:28.419> other<00:06:28.630> cubes<00:06:29.020> I

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
just like with those other cubes I

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.800 
just like with those other cubes I
talked<00:06:29.320> about<00:06:29.350> this<00:06:29.800> has<00:06:30.310> poor<00:06:30.850> quality<00:06:31.479> and

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
talked about this has poor quality and

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.779 
talked about this has poor quality and
it's<00:06:32.380> like<00:06:32.590> the<00:06:32.770> guy<00:06:32.919> who<00:06:32.979> is<00:06:33.220> mixing<00:06:33.580> it<00:06:33.699> up

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
it's like the guy who is mixing it up

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.969 
it's like the guy who is mixing it up
when<00:06:34.060> one<00:06:34.600> side<00:06:34.870> wouldn't<00:06:35.229> turn<00:06:35.380> he<00:06:35.620> would<00:06:35.740> try

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
when one side wouldn't turn he would try

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.490 
when one side wouldn't turn he would try
to<00:06:36.009> go<00:06:36.250> and<00:06:36.460> turn<00:06:36.639> another<00:06:37.000> side<00:06:37.419> so<00:06:38.050> that

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
to go and turn another side so that

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.430 
to go and turn another side so that
prototype<00:06:39.009> has<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.820> looks<00:06:40.780> like<00:06:40.840> it<00:06:41.020> has<00:06:41.139> a<00:06:41.169> lot

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
prototype has a looks like it has a lot

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.409 
prototype has a looks like it has a lot
of<00:06:41.470> lockup<00:06:41.830> problems<00:06:42.490> so<00:06:42.610> I<00:06:42.639> hope<00:06:42.880> future

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
of lockup problems so I hope future

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.939 
of lockup problems so I hope future
prototypes<00:06:44.020> will<00:06:44.169> turn<00:06:44.350> out<00:06:44.500> a<00:06:44.530> lot<00:06:44.860> better<00:06:45.330> so

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
prototypes will turn out a lot better so

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.710 
prototypes will turn out a lot better so
yeah<00:06:47.949> I'm<00:06:48.490> still<00:06:48.820> very<00:06:49.000> skeptical<00:06:49.539> about

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
yeah I'm still very skeptical about

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.980 
yeah I'm still very skeptical about
whether<00:06:50.050> this<00:06:50.470> puzzle<00:06:51.460> will<00:06:51.729> be<00:06:52.270> worth<00:06:52.539> buying

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
whether this puzzle will be worth buying

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.189 
whether this puzzle will be worth buying
so<00:06:53.949> if<00:06:54.280> it<00:06:54.520> is<00:06:54.639> good<00:06:54.910> quality<00:06:55.150> then<00:06:55.630> yeah<00:06:56.169> I

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 
so if it is good quality then yeah I

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.830 
so if it is good quality then yeah I
probably<00:06:56.680> will<00:06:56.979> buy<00:06:57.190> it<00:06:57.250> but<00:06:57.580> who<00:06:58.120> knows<00:06:58.240> all

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
probably will buy it but who knows all

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.450 
probably will buy it but who knows all
right<00:06:59.050> I<00:06:59.229> believe<00:06:59.289> that's<00:06:59.620> everything<00:06:59.860> i<00:07:00.250> had

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
right I believe that's everything i had

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.340 
right I believe that's everything i had
