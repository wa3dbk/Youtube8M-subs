00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.040
 presence of venezuela in the block as 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.720
 what it takes from that deputy is an old age 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.270
 irregular the summit of montevideo 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.610
 carried out in July of this year woke up 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.460
 curiosities and generated an environment of 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.230
 uncertainty inside the block 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.440
 venezuela officially entered and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.170

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.280
 did not travel to Uruguay 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.760
 before that we do not have anything

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.890
 the suspension to Paraguay had its days 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.659
 counted the decisions that the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.260
 government that starts its mandate in 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:58.030
 Paraguay will seek to clarify the panorama 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.040
 obscured by the unexpected punishment 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.230
 imposed on the country that leaves a huge 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.069
 scar to the set of nations of the

 the next sentence that invites a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.950
 deep reflection the mercosur has a 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.259
 institutional crisis and 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.289
 commercial relationship have to 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.960
 sit down and think about where you 're going and 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.240
 where should you go to the mercosur should you go back 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.940
 to its origins represented by the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.789
 free movement of goods services and 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.830
 productive factors between countries the 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.630

 economic and sectoral between 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.750
 States parties and the harmonization of 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.620
 legislations to achieve
