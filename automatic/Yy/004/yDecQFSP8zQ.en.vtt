00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
a blender but normally I do actually

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.830 
a blender but normally I do actually
just<00:03:58.799> flip<00:03:59.099> this<00:03:59.280> okay<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.389> got<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.599> flour

other one should be preheated to about
180<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:08.510> it's<00:06:08.780> probably<00:06:09.020> going<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.170> stay<00:06:09.230> in

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
180 and it's probably going to stay in
