 yes 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.600
 let's continue with him 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.250
 the next note and in this case to a young artist guitarist so he tarra 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.350
 classic develops it in a very particular way and how they really felt 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.820
 his kira mentor's close relatives happen mudito within this form of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.830
 execute it and Aleppo he is now doing studies in paris and 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.400
 from france the children to tender to be reassigned a little bit of the air 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.949
 guatemal de coki needs we find it and talk to him so that 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.949
 yourself 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.820
 ja 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.820
 qatar 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.190
 they asked me, well, it's now Luis Suarez who are 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.870
 and I told him that I wanted to be nobody because I can not define myself. 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.870
 human being when it stops the human being is limited 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 alcaraz 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 Obviously that is what cost you the most proud of its origin is zero 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.750
 jesus montero considered that he no longer begins to stop having nationality 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.280
 I consider that every human being without brakes 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.000
 I consider that we are all expo geniuses of Asia and we only have to expand 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 our mind we must 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.910
 maybe we should not but we have the opportunity to expand not to expand 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.910
 the knowledge and search gustavo is sought 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.960
 I am always interested in Basques, we have not really 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.000
 in a bit of literature but the music was one of the facts will be processed 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.880
 more transcendental work I also have an assembly following the assembly 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.690
 of French improvisation of the l2 sun we are eight musicians the French musician 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.310
 he is a Venezuelan and I 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.460
 and that has also allowed me suddenly one by one 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.140
 perception of life different 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.009
 martÃ­nez ruiz something and then he dies he starts and dies and that's where everything ends 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.429
 and that pleases me because it's like getting to the side of the dissident 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.639
 and appropriate something leaves us aside that of been that ambition of transportation 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.389
 must own something is a thing that happens 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.339
 I consider music as art, at least for my respect for points 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.049
 of sight 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.159
 I feel that art is like an energy that 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.319
 it passed through every human being and that 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.109
 and I only instruct the aediles that make up the 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 have 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.649
 everton 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.119
 nadal y ferrer was the first instrument of succession suffered by my brother 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.299
 when I was about 13 14 years old 15 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.039
 the new 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.969
 links to the dessert to work pianos and that at all times algid with the 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.809
 advantage leo messi for etarras 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.129
 I think it's the aspect of the vibration that swears it does not have to match 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.349
 of the body I think it is also because it can be taken anywhere 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.629
 the world 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.629
 the beginning is really to deepen in the study of music 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.619
 I really intend to specialize 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:24.629
 I intend to take a deep study deep dew of the world as much as possible 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.459
 can be sustainable standing I will make my first album which gave the wish 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.859
 record in france porro to offer a quality that is an international size 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.299
 innovated natality that stays only in guatemala I want to make a product 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.669
 that is detested for sale anywhere in the world and that can 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.189
 be appreciated by anyone from the world musicians and by what kind of 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.189
 person 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.959
 I do not consider myself alone and lazy but 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.649
 aside from all the things that I am 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.379
 I am a Mexican is an essential part of me 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.560
 seven surrounds more mind the only thing I know
