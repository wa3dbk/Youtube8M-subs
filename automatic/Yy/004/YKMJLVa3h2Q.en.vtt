 I want to show you how you can at home 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.309
 conditions make chocolate soap that 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.349
 for this we will need us 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.720
 need cocoa butter 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:23.369
 5 grams of cocoa butter he two cocoa powder 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.900
 teaspoons chocolate alcohol flavoring 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.730
 in order to remove the bubbles to us or 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.000
 I use silicone mold today 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.219
 the form of the form is different there are plastic 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.770
 but today will be like this 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 chocolate cake and of course we need 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.270
 soap base 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.399
 I use transparent Russian 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.070
 soap base how to determine the right 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.140
 amount of it take the form which 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 you will be pouring the soap around 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.920
 eye cut off that piece that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.100
 fit the shape here so here i am 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.879
 I define also we will need a wand 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 to mix the brush and today 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.310
 I will decorate the soap like this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.270
 confectionery trembling so that was 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.479
 fun interesting and beautiful and and why 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.729
 let's start it with the fact that we will go to stoke 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.430
 soap base I'll melt it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.070
 microwave oven 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 watch the soap very carefully 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 put literally 5 and 5-10 seconds 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.770
 depending on your power from power 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.680
 your microwave because soap 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.680
 can run away and then will be very 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.939
 bothering to wash our microwave 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.090
 the oven well everything I went to melt the soap foundation 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.979
 and then come back and continue to show 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.170
 telling how are we going to cook 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.299
 chocolate on our raspberry base i 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.579
 I warmed up here such it turned out 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.079
 liquid and now our task as possible 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:01.619
 faster sooner more and more finish 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.049
 throw 5 grams of cocoa butter 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.830
 look carefully do not add much 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.790
 because she will say 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.050
 After all, the soap itself, that is, the soap later 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:21.280
 It is bad mylitsya all mix 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:23.260
 butter all cocoa butter good 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.040
 dissolved because we are lina again 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.240
 hot and now we will add here 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.200
 cocoa powder 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:38.980
 we need two teaspoons i use 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:44.980
 Here is such a measuring spoon and also all 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:52.209
 stir it until completely full 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:55.660
 dissolving everything here is such a result 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:00.420
 on chocolate mass and here we will add 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.580
 literally three droplets of chocolate flavors 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.620
 one two Three 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.910
 you can add as you like 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.690
 well i think that three droplets on this 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.690
 will be able to enter 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:24.540
 so take our form and we will pour in 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.280
 neatly our base soap chocolate 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.330
 so a little bit here I am left now 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.030

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.050
 remaining 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.140
 the soap base was my trick 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:48.090
 little thin soap all this is not 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:53.680
 forget to sprinkle with alcohol to 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:57.160
 formed bubbles disappeared well and 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.060
 wait for complete cooling then we will 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.790

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.489

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.750
 firmly and now we will take it out 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:10.570
 molds for this we need like this 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.080
 stretch the edges of the silicone mold very 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.080
 easy 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.410

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.590

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:40.160
