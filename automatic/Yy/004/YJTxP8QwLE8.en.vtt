00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.759
 the eclectic style allows you to combine 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.039
 different trends in a single space 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.869
 create an eclectic style gives you license 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.259
 to put in reality what you more 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.150
 you like it and that makes a space something more 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.150
 unique and with a more personal stamp 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.980
 I find it bold and typical of style 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.890
 eclectic daring to have this mix 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.620
 of objects I have a Cusco table 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.470
 carved in wood next to a sofa 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.470
 contemporary in black leather accompanied 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.250
 of a red armchair that breaks with this 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.250
 harmony in euros 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.850
 to continue rescuing ideas, we have to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.860
 take a tour of local in Lima 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.510
 that were also decided by this 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.070
 trend 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.960
 this cultural cafe and has 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.890
 different elements that make it 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.930
 in an eclectic style that and details of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.990
 contrasts of materials and times in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.240
 this space makes it an eclectic place 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.720
 but they also generate a very 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.720
 cozy 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.370
 and I'm very struck 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.740
 have an industrial ministry by 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.510
 example on the floor with cement and even 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.210
 on the roof with metal installations 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:48.200
 but have a wall like this 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:49.580
 intervened on stone and brick today 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.100
 day I have a challenge 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.560
 I have this room blank and I want 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 turn it into an electric room in 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.280
 few hours but still want to create a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.030
 space that is warm and the space that 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.030
 I invited you to stay
