that what I'd recently and not so far
away<00:02:48.250> we've<00:02:48.489> already<00:02:48.640> seen<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.180> let's<00:02:49.540> go

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
away we've already seen this let's go

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.340 
away we've already seen this let's go
again<00:02:50.230> ok<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:51.459> raudel<00:02:51.880> faster<00:02:52.450> cycle<00:02:52.930> camera

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
again ok the raudel faster cycle camera

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.080 
again ok the raudel faster cycle camera
would<00:02:53.530> yeah<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:53.950> all<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.100> need<00:02:54.280> let's<00:02:54.970> go

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
would yeah this is all I need let's go

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.840 
would yeah this is all I need let's go
fast<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.720> shoot<00:02:56.019> things<00:02:56.260> they<00:02:56.769> are<00:02:56.850> clearly

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
fast and shoot things they are clearly

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.670 
fast and shoot things they are clearly
there's<00:02:58.209> no<00:02:58.360> limit<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.750> my<00:02:59.110> laser<00:02:59.410> power

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
there's no limit to my laser power

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.530 
there's no limit to my laser power
unlike<00:03:00.070> real<00:03:00.310> lasers<00:03:00.730> which<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:01.030> course<00:03:01.090> heat

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
unlike real lasers which of course heat

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.780 
unlike real lasers which of course heat
up<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.840> cool<00:03:02.080> down<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.070> need<00:03:03.190> power<00:03:03.400> apply<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
up and cool down and need power apply to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.270 
up and cool down and need power apply to
them<00:03:04.090> Wow<00:03:04.750> also<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> noticed<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:06.070> is

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
them Wow also I noticed that this is

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.440 
them Wow also I noticed that this is
actually<00:03:06.489> following<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.780> non-newtonian

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
actually following the non-newtonian

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.030 
actually following the non-newtonian
motion<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.600> space<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:11.320> like<00:03:11.500> Star<00:03:11.799> Wars

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
motion in space it's like Star Wars

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.060 
motion in space it's like Star Wars
really<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.750> not<00:03:13.870> like<00:03:13.930> real<00:03:14.380> space<00:03:14.799> fighter

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
really it's not like real space fighter

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.220 
really it's not like real space fighter
physics<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.120> real<00:03:16.330> space<00:03:16.810> vital

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
physics that you see in real space vital

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.470 
physics that you see in real space vital
things<00:03:17.620> which<00:03:18.370> are<00:03:18.549> completely<00:03:19.000> unrealistic

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
things which are completely unrealistic

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.140 
things which are completely unrealistic
in<00:03:20.320> fact<00:03:20.530> I'll<00:03:21.010> bet<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:21.850> if<00:03:21.940> somebody

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
in fact I'll bet you if somebody

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.479 
in fact I'll bet you if somebody
complains<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:23.080> game<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.560> less<00:03:24.010> realistic

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
complains this game is less realistic

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.120 
complains this game is less realistic
than<00:03:25.000> say<00:03:25.209> star<00:03:25.600> citizen<00:03:26.079> I<00:03:26.320> will<00:03:26.560> point<00:03:26.860> out

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
than say star citizen I will point out

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.009 
than say star citizen I will point out
that<00:03:27.430> space<00:03:27.760> fighters<00:03:28.120> are<00:03:28.269> completely<00:03:28.750> not

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
that space fighters are completely not

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.410 
that space fighters are completely not
realistic<00:03:29.680> at<00:03:29.829> all<00:03:29.890> at<00:03:30.519> least<00:03:30.579> space<00:03:30.970> fighters

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420

realistic at all at least space fighters
with<00:03:31.570> people<00:03:31.900> inside<00:03:32.200> them<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.769> might<00:03:32.920> as

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
with people inside them you might as

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.949 
with people inside them you might as
well<00:03:33.070> have<00:03:33.459> any<00:03:33.670> piece<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:33.910> bread<00:03:34.269> with<00:03:34.480> lasers

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
well have any piece of bread with lasers

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.170 
well have any piece of bread with lasers
and<00:03:35.200> stuff<00:03:35.380> fitted<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.920> because<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.730> piece

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
and stuff fitted to it because a piece

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.710 
and stuff fitted to it because a piece
of<00:03:37.209> bread<00:03:37.450> can<00:03:37.810> handle<00:03:38.170> much<00:03:38.470> higher<00:03:38.739> g-forces

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
of bread can handle much higher g-forces

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.940 
of bread can handle much higher g-forces
you<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:40.870> need<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.019> computer<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.500> obviously

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
you just need a computer to obviously

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.650 
you just need a computer to obviously
help<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.310> bread<00:03:42.579> do<00:03:42.850> what<00:03:43.090> it's<00:03:43.239> doing<00:03:43.420> maybe

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
help the bread do what it's doing maybe

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.050 
help the bread do what it's doing maybe
you<00:03:43.840> could<00:03:44.019> make

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
you could make

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.140 
you could make
read<00:03:45.510> computer<00:03:46.459> okay<00:03:47.459> let's<00:03:47.730> go<00:03:47.910> for<00:03:48.060> the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
read computer okay let's go for the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.760 
read computer okay let's go for the
shield<00:03:48.420> generator<00:03:48.510> things<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.349> think<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.680> is

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
shield generator things I think this is

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.620 
shield generator things I think this is
what<00:03:49.920> you're<00:03:50.040> supposed<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.340> do<00:03:50.520> well<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.120> on

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
what you're supposed to do well and on

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.710 
what you're supposed to do well and on
my<00:03:52.110> tail<00:03:53.180> yes<00:03:54.180> as<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:55.530> said<00:03:55.590> realism<00:03:56.550> is<00:03:56.880> very

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
my tail yes as I said realism is very

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.530 
my tail yes as I said realism is very
important<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.260> me<00:03:58.470> oh<00:03:58.620> yes<00:03:59.040> excellent<00:03:59.790> now<00:04:00.300> as

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
important to me oh yes excellent now as

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.089 
important to me oh yes excellent now as
to<00:04:00.569> whether<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.050> would<00:04:01.319> be<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.500> good<00:04:01.680> idea<00:04:01.830> to

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
to whether it would be a good idea to

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.280 
to whether it would be a good idea to
build<00:04:02.430> rai<00:04:02.819> fighters<00:04:03.300> that<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.750> something<00:04:04.080> i

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
build rai fighters that is something i

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.170 
build rai fighters that is something i
am<00:04:04.470> not<00:04:04.800> going<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.220> be<00:04:05.310> drawn<00:04:05.610> on<00:04:05.819> at<00:04:06.030> this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
am not going to be drawn on at this

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.970 
am not going to be drawn on at this
point<00:04:06.620> yeah<00:04:08.900> now<00:04:09.900> let's<00:04:10.290> see<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.590> for<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
point yeah now let's see as for the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.220 
point yeah now let's see as for the
ironing<00:04:11.489> board<00:04:11.519> let's<00:04:12.120> turn<00:04:12.599> around<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.140> get

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
ironing board let's turn around and get
