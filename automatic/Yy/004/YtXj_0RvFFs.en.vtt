and after that you go ahead and you take

and if you're doing this anyway you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.190 
and if you're doing this anyway you
really<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.510> want<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> wash<00:02:23.930> your<00:02:24.110> vehicle

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
you've done washing the vehicle you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.390 
you've done washing the vehicle you
write<00:02:32.480> your<00:02:32.870> final<00:02:33.260> step<00:02:33.470> for<00:02:33.709> your<00:02:34.069> rinse<00:02:34.250> it

off<00:02:34.870> it's<00:02:35.870> pretty<00:02:36.080> much<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.280> regular

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
off it's pretty much just like a regular

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.220 
off it's pretty much just like a regular
washing<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.330> vehicle<00:02:38.720> with<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.870> added

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
washing of the vehicle with the added

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.979

step<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.590> degreaser<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.750> you're<00:02:41.750> done

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
step of the degreaser and you're done

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.870 
step of the degreaser and you're done
and<00:02:42.290> now<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:42.800> just<00:02:42.860> want<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.280> rinse<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.819> then

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
and now I just want to rinse it and then

00:02:43.880 --> 00:03:04.520 
and now I just want to rinse it and then
you'll<00:02:44.150> dry<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.750> you'll<00:02:45.080> be<00:02:45.110> done<00:02:45.319> with<00:02:45.380> it

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.530 

and<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.490> pretty<00:03:05.640> much<00:03:05.700> wraps<00:03:05.850> up<00:03:06.300> how<00:03:06.480> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and that pretty much wraps up how you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.060 
and that pretty much wraps up how you
want<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.870> clean<00:03:07.050> your<00:03:07.230> car<00:03:07.410> if<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.740> have<00:03:07.770> ash

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070
