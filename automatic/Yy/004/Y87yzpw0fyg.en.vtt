00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.570
 good afternoon my dear we continue with 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.570
 you are our master class 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.200
 after we translated all of our 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.530
 patterns here is a body pattern 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:28.920
 pattern handles leg pattern we are with you 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:32.379
 let's start sewing without cutting anything 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.159
 try to make the most of these 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.949
 pieces of fabric so that they do not embroider 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:42.039
 thought that he might shift 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:46.030
 go somewhere and i have already cleared 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:48.510
 here so i still need 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.710
 pin up 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.530
 you have to scribble 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.969
 and not thinking about anything a little stitch 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:05.280
 Komi 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:10.960
 now we will sew our dolls and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:16.750
 only then cut connect all 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.810
 Circuits pretty good all go 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.640
 on the sewing machine guts installed on 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.640
 dvoechke as I said 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.300
 Be sure to do the tack and on our 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.100
 lines that we circled in 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.320
 which encircled patterns 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.810
 we are not scribbling anywhere in a hurry 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.130
 there is no hurry then how you sew 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.210
 will depend on how your 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.880
 the finished product can be 22 with 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.350
 half you put the same thing 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.840
 The threads are in tone of the fabric for the body I have 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.210
 beige strings naturally and up and 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.479
 way down 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.500
 At first we do the tack I start with 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.200
 legs up legs leave open 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.069
 in the same way when we sew hands 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.560
 leave open here these 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.840
 then when fastening the times we will 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.269
 turn out 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.260
 anise in the pupa this one will be left 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:31.319
 open 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 I am showing the torso now the yard 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.959
 cut us Circuits we sewed them now 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.379
 cut out at a distance leave allowance 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.709
 on the seam somewhere on the floor centimeter 57 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:52.879
 millimeters 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:57.260
 neatly cut along the contour 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:00.260
 leg and so with all the details do 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.480
 if you have a curly scissors 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.949
 zigzag it will be fine because 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.409
 they will give 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:10.909
 without from it is not to there we will turn out the cloth 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:14.790
 they will give us flawless 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:18.199
 line if they do not despair you should not 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.199
 we just 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:26.909
 make the necessary ground cuts 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.000
 rounds and like for example now iâ€™m 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.030
 will show 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.030
 but 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.570
 when we cut the legs we make a cutter 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:50.510
 small not reaching slightly to the seam 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:53.880
 one, two, three, that's where the line is 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.780
 it bends it will help us gently 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:06.180
 unscrew the leg in the line of the knee exactly 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:07.730
 do the same on three rivers and you can still in 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:15.780
 several places 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:17.450
 purely for safety net 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:24.500
 about 2 centimeters 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.500
 do on a trolley so then we need 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.970
 now we need to turn our our 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.030
 product for this we take a wand for 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:43.060
 sushi 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:54.470
 first twist the leg with your fingers 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:05:04.850
 then take a wand with a blunt end 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:07.300
 her legs and body like this 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.130
 will present for you no difficulty 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.500
 slight twisting difficulty 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.670
 Now you can to change the stick on 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.880
 flat edge slight difficulty may 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:23.330
 call hands but it is also like all 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.770
 comes with experience and anything is possible if 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.380
 suddenly you will be for you 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.500
 sushi stick not thin enough 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:36.020
 for pens take thinner anything 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.690
 Yurachku pencil that gets thinner 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.030
 but you find that it is desirable not to 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.920
 dirty anything like this 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:49.280
 we turn out all our parts 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:53.680
 then iron them like this deserve 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.920
 and iron and on both sides 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.680
 weak weak iron on dvadhechke and 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.110
 Our parts will be ready to be tamped. 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.700
 in this way 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.580
 stay with us next video we 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.850
 continue working on making the pupa for now 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.850
 until
