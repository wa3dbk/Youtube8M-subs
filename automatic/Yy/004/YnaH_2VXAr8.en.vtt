00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 quantum we started filipe and this is 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.540
 felipe pc today we are going to make a 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.309
 boxing and an installation of a heatsink 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.860
 for ram that I do not have since 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.080
 Chinese then let's see how it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.730
 install and why should we install 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.730
 some anticipators in that rom memory 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.420
 good guys to make a little 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.189
 parenthesis here I forgot to explain 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.810
 that this is a new section of the channel 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.029
 in which we are going to upload tutorials of 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.400
 pc is worth only tutorials nights of 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.650
 software or anything like that but hardware 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.590
 voucher to change ram memory to clean 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.390
 the computer and toxo so do not wait 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.670
 tutorials to start the program but 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.650
 that as change parts as avoid 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.059
 problems and all that is worth then is 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.100
 a small thing not to forget in the 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.600
 comments that believe that if it's good 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.580
 I do this to my channel in new 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.140
 tutorials about new things as it is 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.000
 more learning speak more than me 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.770
 little party you and open another channel 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.090
 apart for this but decide better not 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.010
 do it since there are more people in 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.329
 this channel is worth then do not forget 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.980
 also give your law and now we go 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.539
 we follow but good guys tutorial 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 let's proceed with the unboxing of 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.729
 package I hope it 's what I'm 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.860
 waiting for the heatsink for the ram 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.570
 but offered by the size has to be 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.399
 stable plus I have not asked anything else what 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.460
 another pp and it was canceled because they have 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:21.310
 been in the complete units and yes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.680
 Gentlemen, look at a memory heatsink 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.990
 good ram let's just uncover what 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.340
 It cost me less than five dollars, good not 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.900
 I know if I already told you 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.030
 well here is a heatsink 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.180
 for the ram but I do not know how it 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.180
 opens 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.509
 this is for thinking people we are going to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.700
 see how this good heatsink opens 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.869
 we have already managed to open it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 come with directions I think it 's very 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.780
 well this what it does 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.180
 It is aluminum and so is gold color is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 what tells us only what it does good 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.340
 after opening it was scratched look you know 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.080
 what is this comes super tight the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.930
 two the two hooks these that you have to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.509
 put after they come super tight 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.959
 it's better not go easy and says there 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.790
 to remove this before using it 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.950
 ok let's see more or less how it is 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.959
 ok good the good thing is that you do not do 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.819
 contact with ram 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.739
 now let's proceed to the installation 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.239
 of our heat sink for 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.829
 Rom memory for the kid we work 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.659
 our pc disconnected everything 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.090
 completely the first thing we're going to 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.760
 to do is to force our drawer with the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.409
 hands is worth to release all the energy 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.120
 static that we can have in it already 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.370
 that this can damage the components and 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.049
 the same thing we do touching the floor is worth 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.760
 it's very important since I do not have 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.769
 through static but it's a way of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.079
 the most common to be able to retire 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.370
 worth to try how to do is to withdraw 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.659
 the glasses if you have screws 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.500
 Well, they remove it, as I do not have them 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:53.470
 Well, it does not withdraw directly and we have 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.970
 our pc uncovered good 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.010
 in this part we have 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.800
 all the wiring of the computer if it is 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.070
 disorganized I already know but what we 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.560
 matter now is this is it worth is that 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.750
 here in our ram memory we are not going 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.820
 to withdraw voucher to place this 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.100
 We are not going to remove the artifact 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.570
 necessary ready just let's place 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.210
 above but first we are going to measure it 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.100
 to see if cutting 7 size as 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.200
 can notice the size is ideal for 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.450
 our ram memory is a good size 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.760
 so to speak now what are we going to 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.440
 to do is simply withdraw the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.780
 pieces of paper that told us that we have to 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.300
 previously removed 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.370
 are this one here worth those two pieces of paper 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.380
 we have to withdraw that they are like a 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.970
 thermal paste so to speak between the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.970
 RAM memory and the aluminum heatsink 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.880
 good guys since we have retired 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.680
 our two pieces of paper what we're going to 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.270
 to do is good this has no side 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.710
 on both sides is the same in everything 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.080
 that the mansion is simply take it here 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.120
 above 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.760
 to keep it open and put it 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.129
 on top of ram memory 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.840
 after what we have on top of 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.670
 memory what we are going to do simply 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.430
 is to press vale 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.650
 good since we have pressed the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.239
 protector of ram memory on the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.970
 ram we are going to place the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.230
 hooks that go in these two points 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.209
 the hooks can open them with a 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.400
 screwdriver because they are pretty hard 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.500
 then to avoid damaging or pressing 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.609
 a lot of this ram memory what I did 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.470
 factory a little bit with a 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.510
 screwdriver and it will 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.380
 enter in the two lines in which 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.090
 they went that in my case is here and here 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.260
 well now in the last step is to place 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.260
 our hooks as I told you 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.200
 as you can see when you enter the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.180
 hooks are going to make a small click 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.400
 It's worth that means that they are fine 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.530
 posts because in memory 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.690
 the volume sink steal there is a 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.000
 small opening where these enter 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.410
 points we're going to the here the hooks 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.730
 they have a few dots as to see by 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.640
 inside and that those who are going to click 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.650
 in voucher ready we have already installed no 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.110
 I'm separated for ram memory what 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.090
 do the clicks it's just tighten 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.950
 the contacts and make it happen more the 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.150
 heat is what the heat goes through from that 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.070
 tape that we had seen as of 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.930
 Dissipation to the aluminum part is worth 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.640
 now let's cover the computer and what 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.110
 let's teach good guys now let's go 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.480
 to go with a more or less theoretical part 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.250
 It is a small piece that makes our 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.810
 success on this heatsink what it does is 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.610
 which is a is an aluminum material 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.950
 like all the heatsinks of all 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.890
 parts is worth as the chipset as the 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.660
 of the processor like some ram memory 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.890
 they also bring it in aluminum because 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.020
 because aluminum is a material that is 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.090
 it cools very fast, and that always 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.100
 you play a piece of aluminum usually 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.020
 it is always at a lower temperature 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.640
 then what aluminum does 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.010
 just dissipate the heat and you know 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.360
 that if less temperature minus 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.969
 heat have more 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.289
 fast is not that component worth in 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.669
 this case the memory meeting of the 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.620
 most important components of 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.330
 computer because the one in charge of doing 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.409
 all computer calculations all 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
 the calculations that they have to do to 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.039
 open a program to run a game 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.360
 what ram does and what it does is 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.460
 the small heatsink that is very 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.069
 economic is to dissipate that heat so that 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.680
 can go much faster then it's worth 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.990
 it is good to have all the memory the ram 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.669
 it should have the case in the case of 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.560
 the ram memory of computers 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.689
 gaming all have a heatsink even 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.639
 much thicker to be able to do that 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.020
 dissipate much easier the heat is worth in 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.610
 this case a thin heatsink but 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.080
 functional then we will install it 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.909
 if you have two or three ram memory 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.500
 that may be the case they install them in 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.599
 all because it's going to be something very 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.860
 effective and in this case my computer 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.900
 that you learned are already giving normal and 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.279
 I hope you walk much better magnetic 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.050
 of success out there if you liked asked for 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:30.310
 please do not forget to comment and 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.310
 its that stand out until then
