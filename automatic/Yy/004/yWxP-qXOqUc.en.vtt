spinning sides been going down back side

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.630 
spinning sides been going down back side
and<00:01:36.289> then<00:01:36.530> there's<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.770> reverse<00:01:37.100> one<00:01:37.429> where

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
and then there's a reverse one where

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.109 
and then there's a reverse one where
you'll<00:01:38.329> go<00:01:38.570> one<00:01:38.810> way<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:39.409> flick<00:01:40.189> back<00:01:40.429> let's

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
you'll go one way and flick back let's

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.889 
you'll go one way and flick back let's
go<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.720> other<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:43.159> throw<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.490> ball

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
go the other so you throw the ball

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.419 
go the other so you throw the ball
you'll<00:01:44.899> come<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.319> like<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:46.130> do<00:01:46.250> with

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
you'll come in like that and to do with

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.910 
you'll come in like that and to do with
the<00:01:46.490> reverse<00:01:46.789> one<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:47.600> got<00:01:47.869> back<00:01:48.440> on<00:01:48.799> yourself

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the reverse one you got back on yourself

00:01:48.920 --> 00:02:07.270 
the reverse one you got back on yourself
so<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.899> then<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.649> one<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:06.920> can<00:02:07.069> do<00:02:07.159> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
so and then on that one you can do the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.830 
so and then on that one you can do the
same<00:02:07.429> you<00:02:07.490> can<00:02:07.759> put<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> same<00:02:08.119> types<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.569> spin

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
same you can put the same types of spin

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.710 
same you can put the same types of spin
on<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.110> can<00:02:09.229> come<00:02:09.349> across<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:10.190> side<00:02:10.459> up<00:02:11.360> with

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
good server so you try to constantly out

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.119 
good server so you try to constantly out
think<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:49.810> it's<00:03:49.959> been<00:03:50.079> bowling<00:03:50.319> in<00:03:50.620> quickly

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
think like it's been bowling in quickly

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.000 
think like it's been bowling in quickly
trying<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.670> constantly<00:03:52.180> out<00:03:52.299> think

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
trying to constantly out think

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.250 
trying to constantly out think
outmaneuver<00:03:54.010> your<00:03:54.190> opponent<00:03:55.410> through<00:03:56.410> were

very issue
so<00:04:00.670> back<00:04:00.910> stick<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.560> shop<00:04:02.829> serve<00:04:04.440> again

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
so back stick on the shop serve again

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.410 
so back stick on the shop serve again
the<00:04:05.709> softer<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.250> touch<00:04:06.459> on<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.700> ball<00:04:06.940> better

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
it goes over its class is a long serve

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.040 
it goes over its class is a long serve

it has gone long
chances<00:04:30.729> are<00:04:30.820> already<00:04:31.090> be<00:04:31.270> slow<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.220> your
