00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.960
 Michelangelo first of all welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.400
 arona if one of the great promises of the 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.360
 Italian football tell me about yours 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.550
 prospects what pushed you 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.230
 above all choose this square 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.500
 first of all thanks for the welcome e 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 good morning to all the first thing that me 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 pushed to come to this square 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.949
 just wanting to see a square 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.369
 ambitious in a nice team with one 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.309
 well organized story with a big one 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.529
 coach a big company 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:31.319
 all around that supports the team is 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.000
 precisely the desire to be able to demonstrate in 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:37.620
 field what I have become is that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 that I want 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.739
 I want to become naturally growing up 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.410
 and improving on training days 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.640
 and demonstrating on Saturdays from both 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.589
 times of Bologna but above all of the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.120
 milan darmian firms speak each other a 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.249
 great good then you had a slight one 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.780
 bending also the parenthesis with the 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.280
 even last year getafe has 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.170
 played little at varese what happened 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.879
 I didn't say it before I went in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.059
 spain and I found myself very well 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.370
 because however experience was part 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 as a positive director in things for 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.970
 soccer i was unlucky because 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.430
 I had a physical problem with a 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.610
 bacterium I was sick for two months and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 half so I could not train 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.700
 practically never in two and a half months a 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.829
 that point I asked to come back in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.719
 italy i am back in varese but you know 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.149
 very well that the January market a 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.250
 repair market where teams 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.290
 they are already formed and therefore difficult 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.630
 play even more for a young person 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.119
 maybe a role like the defender I have 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.030
 played two games that went well 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.979
 and now i hope to find more space e 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.350
 to demonstrate what he speaks in the field 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.600
 however milan i want to understand you had a 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.369
 model because you were in fact a few 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.109
 year in the milan renato also in withdrawal if 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 I'm not mistaken with the Rossoneri team on 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.159
 your model your point of reference 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.259
 who was my my point of reference 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.630
 idol has always been maldini both like 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.359
 person how do you help kids in 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.070
 field, however, now no longer plays certain and 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.270
 so I have this too, there is a phenomenon 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.130
 you love 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.929
 an incredible explosiveness is also a 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.840
 good boy so now thiago silva 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.360
 or here in verona as it was said there will be 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.129
 so much competition not all more like 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.720
 central defensive especially there in 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.819
 half there are so many moras players 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.849
 the same t-shirt look there so there 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.739
 it will be elbowing you if I am I feel 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.019
 more in the middle then I can also do the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.450
 fullback with no problem for what 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.030
 it's about competition that's okay 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.760
 the day after day I repeat I will grow up 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.379
 I will try to do my best to grow 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.390
 and always improve and report 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.680
 carve out the space it deserves 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.180
 we are also curious to understand for 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.950
 introduce yourself to fans of Verona that type 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.290
 player you are out of the field what do you do? 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.810
 like to do what your hobbies are but me 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.090
 I am a player and outside the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.220
 field a very quiet boy instead 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.630
 stay with family with people with 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.640
 which is good for friends 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.640
 a quiet girl series between where
