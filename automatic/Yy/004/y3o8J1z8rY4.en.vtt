00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.740
 Hello, my name is swift 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.990
 Vladislav we are in the club on 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.150
 crossfit on metalwork today i want 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.400
 talk about strict exits on the rings 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.470
 I think everyone represents what it looks like. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.960
 this exercise so i want to touch 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.750
 only preparatory and summing up stages 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.150
 to this exercise the first is stretching 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.130
 clavicular sternum rib part large 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.589
 pectoral muscle I will show two main 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.539
 exercises first look as follows 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.809
 the way the hands should be a little higher 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.260
 parallels at about 45 degrees you're not 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.840
 should scroll the joint go out 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.039
 forward feel great tension 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.420
 pectoral muscle is the first option and 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.420
 second option this way 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 this is the first exercise the second also we 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.289
 we put our hand we rest on remallah on the wall 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.600
 no matter the hand should be a little higher 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.799
 parallels and take the case as possible 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.799
 more back 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.530
 the second is training the brachial muscles 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.220
 Belts with the first exercise need to be 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.880
 neat and do it smoothly elbows 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.299
 should be straight sit down and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.320
 gently tossed all the weight on the heels of 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.080
 one pelvis back and feel the tension 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.179
 elbow and shoulder joints 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.640
 another exercise it looks like 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:40.289
 the previous video is as follows 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.869
 fail tass respectively all 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:49.140
 weight you will have on your shoulders and leave 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:52.440
 forward now let's talk about the preparation 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.710
 muscles of the elbow joint 1 you need a neck 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.239
 can do it on the floor or on 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.599
 bench bench 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.599
 we raise the neck and straight arms 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.450
 take as much forward as possible 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:09.660
 feeling of elbow tension 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.450
 we will hold a certain position 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.700
 as long as possible in principle 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.120
 will keep it to be around 20-30 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.470
 seconds then set aside a little higher 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.930
 then hold water vertically upwards 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.660
 with the next exercise you need to be 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.170
 a little careful if it's hard to do 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.060
 you can ask a partner who will 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.459
 hold your back and help you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.629
 do this exercise he also 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.269
 useful for muscles 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.379
 elbow joint and in principle helpful 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.900
 for strength 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.090
 she looks that way you leave 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.790
 back you even have a deep hold 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.540
 then lower your elbows until you 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.849
 can hold then back 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.099
 done so several times feel 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.099
 the tension is completely gone joint 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.040
 summing up exercise to exit 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.500
 rings is also a jump on the rings 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.620
 when you overcome the lower part 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.780
 output and the top of the already work out 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.420
 and due to inertia or due to hand strength 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.920
 will be the next way to make 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.500
 a small jump and further up already 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.390
 make the exit yourself then jump 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.390
 can shrink or jump with one foot 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.920
 the next exercise is effective 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.600
 then when you do it 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.970
 pull-ups and for example not enough 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.470
 chest stretch marks when we need 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.470
 help respectively partner 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:53.390
 insurer try his task 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.980
 pull up as high as possible in the spring 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.920
 pull up and then I help you 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.920
 do directly exit and again 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.450
 fine 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.310
 most of the output itself depends on 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.620
 grip and 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.989
 to train grip can be done 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.350
 next exercise take deep 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.550
 grip 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.040
 open the palm and try to hang here 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.530
 on this part and you get something 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.340
 then you can exit with 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.070
 open palm and so it was 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.650
 basic summing up exercises for 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.979
 exit rings stretching shoulder 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.139
 chest and elbow joints in principle 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.229
 if you can do this 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.630
 movement then and in them on the rings you will master 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.450
