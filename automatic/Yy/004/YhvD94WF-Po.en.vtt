little<00:00:22.680> look<00:00:23.150> now<00:00:24.830> switch<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.220> normal

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
little look now switch it on it's normal

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.189 
little look now switch it on it's normal
guys<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.090> guess<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.480> already<00:00:27.630> seen<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.109> from

version of this radio you have to move a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.219 
version of this radio you have to move a
jumper<00:01:13.110> cut<00:01:13.409> some<00:01:13.590> wires<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:15.229> do

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
jumper cut some wires then it will do

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
jumper cut some wires then it will do
what<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.009> let's<00:01:17.280> say<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> to

and<00:01:51.290> here<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> new<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> say

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and here this is the new as I say

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
and here this is the new as I say
version<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.030> hands<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.049> increased

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
version from hands with the increased

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.539 
version from hands with the increased
audio<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> mic<00:01:58.140> gain<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:59.219> nine

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
audio as you see the mic gain is at nine

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.350 
audio as you see the mic gain is at nine
o'clock<00:02:00.290> or<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.530> two<00:02:01.799> three<00:02:02.130> four<00:02:02.430> one<00:02:03.030> two

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
o'clock or one two three four one two

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.290 
o'clock or one two three four one two
and<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.140> devel<00:02:07.140> -<00:02:07.350> mic<00:02:07.729> one<00:02:08.729> one

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and this is on the devel - mic one one

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.150 
and this is on the devel - mic one one
two<00:02:09.539> three<00:02:09.810> four

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
two three four

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.070 
two three four
and<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.210> course<00:02:11.450> obviously<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.960> FM<00:02:13.840> one<00:02:14.840> two

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and of course obviously in FM one two

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.480 
and of course obviously in FM one two
three<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:16.940> stronger<00:02:17.240> in<00:02:17.510> AM<00:02:18.490> variable

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
three so it's stronger in AM variable

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.410 
three so it's stronger in AM variable
power<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:22.370> turn<00:02:22.550> up<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.760> little<00:02:22.850> bit<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.390 

turn<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.690> zero<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:29.240> press<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.350> hold<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.650> F

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:43.360 

let's<00:02:34.400> try<00:02:34.610> GA<00:02:40.630> today<00:02:41.630> go<00:02:41.870> twenty<00:02:42.800> five<00:02:42.980> six

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
let's try GA today go twenty five six

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.800 
let's try GA today go twenty five six
one<00:02:43.580> five<00:02:43.880> two<00:02:44.980> three<00:02:45.980> zero<00:02:46.310> 105<00:02:49.810> everything

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
one five two three zero 105 everything

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.110 
one five two three zero 105 everything
else<00:02:50.990> is<00:02:51.230> pretty<00:02:51.440> much<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.890> same<00:02:52.100> power<00:02:52.880> is

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
else is pretty much the same power is

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.500 
else is pretty much the same power is
about<00:02:53.390> 1<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.960> 12<00:02:54.230> watts<00:02:54.620> or<00:02:54.950> 13<00:02:55.490> because<00:02:56.270> it

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
about 1 to 12 watts or 13 because it

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.580 
about 1 to 12 watts or 13 because it
only<00:02:56.660> has<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> small<00:02:57.340> 16<00:02:58.340> watt<00:02:59.590> transistor

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
only has a small 16 watt transistor

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.240 
only has a small 16 watt transistor
inside<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.340> no<00:03:01.610> great<00:03:01.850> power<00:03:02.210> as<00:03:02.480> such<00:03:02.690> just

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
inside so no great power as such just

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.200 
inside so no great power as such just
leave<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> at<00:03:04.490> 12<00:03:06.640> all<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.850> other<00:03:08.030> buttons

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
leave it at 12 all the other buttons
