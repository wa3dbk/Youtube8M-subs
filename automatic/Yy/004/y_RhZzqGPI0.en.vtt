you have to change around a lot the gear
like<00:03:49.480> red<00:03:49.840> LIC<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.010> all<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.370> they're

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
like red LIC and all that they're

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.070 
like red LIC and all that they're
getting<00:03:51.850> into<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.240> city<00:03:52.390> scented<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.900> little

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.170 
getting into the city scented a little
bit<00:03:53.200> tricky<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:54.370> see<00:03:54.490> that's<00:03:54.730> what<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
bit tricky you see that's what the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.820 
bit tricky you see that's what the
luxury<00:03:55.690> coach<00:03:55.960> operators<00:03:56.290> have<00:03:56.680> been

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
luxury coach operators have been

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.010 
luxury coach operators have been
pinpointing<00:03:57.610> their<00:03:58.090> buses<00:03:58.540> come<00:03:58.720> into<00:03:58.930> the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
pinpointing their buses come into the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.050 
pinpointing their buses come into the
central<00:03:59.560> parts<00:03:59.860> of<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.040> city<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.580> they

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
central parts of the city so they

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.330 
central parts of the city so they
probably<00:04:01.390> would<00:04:01.630> avoid<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.230> longer<00:04:02.830> duration

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340
