00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.880
 excellent widget to show the time 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.480
 of life on the battery of your device 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.480
 android 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.129
 this will be another video in which they 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.140

 Android tablet and this time they 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.039
 I will show a widget from which I received 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.439
 many questions in the comments of 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.150
 my videos past the widget that I 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.340
 I mean it's just the one they're seeing in 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.650
 screen as you can observe what 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.470
 this shows us is the percentage of 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.940
 remaining battery in our device 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.460
 and what makes this widget different 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.410
 of the rest is that it looks amazing and that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.140
 has a wide list of options 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.480
 to be able to modify it to our liking and 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.489
 make it fit perfectly to the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:56.300
 customization that we want to achieve in 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:58.489
 our device the name of this 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.980
 widget is sweep reborn and in the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.899
 description of this video you will find the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.780
 link to it so you can download it 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.759

 who find it can add it to 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.220
 any of your screens 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.170
 just like any other widgets for 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.479
 configure it simply they should 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.970
 in it and a wide list of options 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.430
 will appear and something that makes things easier 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.009
 even more is that this widget has a menu 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.869
 available in Spanish within this 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.170
 options menu we can modify 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.240
 virtually every aspect of the widget in 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.680
 the first tab we can decide what 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.200
 is what we want to see inside the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.539
 circle either the remaining percentage of 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.939
 battery or it can also be time 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.039
 remaining use and in this part also 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.259
 we can select the background color 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.020
 for the circle and the color of the 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.390
 numbers and letters another of the options 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.759
 most useful is the battery line 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.740
 remaining here we can select the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.890
 color of the line surrounding the circle 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.229
 just like its thickness and this widget is 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.450
 so customizable that we can even 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.369
 add a shadow to its outline and 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.049
 also decide what color we want 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.000
 let this shadow be 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.769
 It should be noted that this widget is also 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 can be added to the screens of 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.620
 unblocking and personally consider 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.569
 which makes them look very attractive 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.790
 and a quality of personalization that 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.500
 It should also be noted that this 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.540
 widget allows us to select what 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.879
 action we want to happen when 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.310
 we press so as I mentioned 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.099
 before this is probably the widget of 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.920
 more complete and customizable battery 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.720
 today the reality is that you can 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.090
 make this widget adapt to the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.650
 perfection to your android is simply 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.989
 question that you play with the options 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.780
 of configuration until you achieve the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.090
 result that you like the most and before 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.640
 finish with this video I want to mention 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.470
 so quickly that this widget also 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.450
 includes a section of tabs in the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.060
 which we found more customization 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.069
 advanced as well as specific data 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.530
 related to the use of the battery in 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.019
 the device and to enter this 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.269
 section you should simply slide your 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.940
