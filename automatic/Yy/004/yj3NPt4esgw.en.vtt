 pontoon this phone is the nokia n97 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 it would be excellent 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.799
 I spent days and weeks and suddenly 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 came out this is the nokia 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269
 the 97 mini 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.789

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.659
 account season you can imagine 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.999

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.040
 to lend 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.390
 and this one that made sense to the seal 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.490
 activated immediately distinguishes 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.960
 the size 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 that and let's say substantially smaller altar we do not ask we can 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.230
 I'm also in two hours and 16 more or less the same a little thinner 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.430
 this one but the important thing is true that they are taken or this phone feels 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.899
 Compact feels friendly 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.919
 do not feel every big one got as bulky as this one that is also not 

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:16.750

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.280
 in general 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.780
 but not what they did to him is that they took away this is like the course 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.300
 not like peron course they removed it since it does not have it here the keyboard or it

 appreciates almost equal in size or almost equal 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.039
 we have now all these seemingly metallic years 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.170
 so there is no doubt how much one measures 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.560
 there is our surface 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.440
