I'll do is I'll take these and these are
on<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> gimbal<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.710> move<00:00:31.859> them

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
on a gimbal so that you can move them

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.240 
on a gimbal so that you can move them
around<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.329> set<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:34.230> far<00:00:34.559> away<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> want

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
them from you and you can set how or you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.740 
them from you and you can set how or you
know<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:39.329> spray<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> rods<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.129> want<00:00:41.399> out

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
gonna take them out of what's called a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.039 
gonna take them out of what's called a
drift<00:01:43.979> master<00:01:44.430> rod<00:01:44.670> system<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.810> see

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
drift master rod system that you see

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
drift master rod system that you see
right<00:01:46.290> hand<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.549> drift<00:01:47.820> master<00:01:48.210> rod

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
right hand and that drift master rod

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.590 
right hand and that drift master rod
system<00:01:48.630> keeps<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.140> rods<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.600> separated

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
system keeps these rods up and separated

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
system keeps these rods up and separated
so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> big<00:01:52.530> tangled<00:01:53.189> mess<00:01:53.369> where

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
so I don't have a big tangled mess where

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.190 
so I don't have a big tangled mess where
I<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> whole<00:01:54.030> bunch<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> rods<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> love

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I have a whole bunch of rods that love

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
I have a whole bunch of rods that love
to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.530> together<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.030> I've<00:01:57.119> done<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.390> I've

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to be together so what I've done is I've

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.819 
to be together so what I've done is I've
separating<00:01:58.290> them<00:01:58.380> out

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
separating them out

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.340 
separating them out
you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.969> comes<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> plate<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
you can also this comes with a plate it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.709 
you can also this comes with a plate it
goes<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.649> top<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.369> locks<00:02:02.670> down<00:02:02.969> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
goes on top of this and locks down so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.450 
goes on top of this and locks down so
when<00:02:04.110> you're<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.409> someplace<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.219> want

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
when you're out someplace and you want

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
when you're out someplace and you want

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
spook fish with the boat we're pushing

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.350 
spook fish with the boat we're pushing
those<00:03:03.600> baits<00:03:03.870> through<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.590> fish<00:03:05.150> before<00:03:06.150> we

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
those baits through the fish before we

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.590 
those baits through the fish before we
get<00:03:06.510> there<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.709> we<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.850> eight<00:03:09.030> rods<00:03:09.330> out

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
get there and we have eight rods out

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.120 
get there and we have eight rods out
what<00:03:09.989> we're<00:03:10.140> doing<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.470> we're<00:03:10.650> pushing<00:03:10.950> all

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
what we're doing is we're pushing all

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.949 
what we're doing is we're pushing all
those<00:03:11.280> baits<00:03:11.580> through<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> school<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.420> fish<00:03:12.630> and

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
those baits through a school of fish and

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.720 
those baits through a school of fish and
we're<00:03:13.590> going<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.770> try<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> catch<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:14.400> many<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
we're going to try to catch as many of

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.789 
we're going to try to catch as many of
those<00:03:14.820> fish<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.239> we<00:03:15.390> push<00:03:15.720> through<00:03:15.750> them<00:03:16.140> and

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
those fish as we push through them and

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.650 
those fish as we push through them and
when<00:03:17.130> we're<00:03:17.280> tournament<00:03:17.790> fishing<00:03:18.000> that's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
when we're tournament fishing that's

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.780 
when we're tournament fishing that's
really<00:03:19.320> important<00:03:19.830> when<00:03:20.010> we<00:03:20.190> edge<00:03:20.340> up<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
really important when we edge up to a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.030 
really important when we edge up to a
tree<00:03:21.180> it's<00:03:21.360> laying<00:03:21.570> into<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.989> water<00:03:22.230> or<00:03:22.769> some

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
tree it's laying into the water or some

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.160 
tree it's laying into the water or some
kind<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.310> structure<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:24.330> gotta<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
kind of structure we gotta have that and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.400 
kind of structure we gotta have that and
then<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.299> sometimes<00:03:27.299> we<00:03:27.510> need<00:03:27.660> shorter<00:03:28.140> rods

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
then and sometimes we need shorter rods

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.280 
then and sometimes we need shorter rods
so<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.430> we<00:03:29.549> get<00:03:29.700> more<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.420> rods<00:03:30.660> into<00:03:31.019> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
so that we get more of the rods into the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.860 
so that we get more of the rods into the
strike<00:03:31.650> zone<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.610> we'll<00:03:32.730> go<00:03:32.880> with<00:03:33.030> 14<00:03:33.450> footers

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
strike zone so we'll go with 14 footers

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.080 
strike zone so we'll go with 14 footers
or<00:03:34.110> twelve<00:03:34.410> footers<00:03:34.650> if<00:03:35.310> you're<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.640> beginner

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
or twelve footers if you're a beginner

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.090 
or twelve footers if you're a beginner
out<00:03:36.330> there<00:03:36.600> go<00:03:37.170> with<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> twelve<00:03:37.830> footers

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
out there go with the twelve footers

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.250 
out there go with the twelve footers
first<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.820> get<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.030> technique<00:03:39.600> down<00:03:39.660> before

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
first and get the technique down before

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.200 
first and get the technique down before
you<00:03:40.350> go<00:03:40.470> big<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:41.360> little<00:03:42.360> before<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.810> go<00:03:42.959> big
