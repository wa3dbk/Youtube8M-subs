00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.510 

here's<00:00:00.960> how<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.140> calibrate<00:00:01.530> your<00:00:01.949> speedometer

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
here's how to calibrate your speedometer

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.919 
here's how to calibrate your speedometer
on<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.700> motorcycle<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.300> could<00:00:03.449> use<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.689> for<00:00:03.899> a

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
on a motorcycle you could use this for a

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.889 
on a motorcycle you could use this for a
car<00:00:04.170> too<00:00:04.560> so<00:00:05.009> first<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> way<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.629> probably

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
car too so first the way and probably

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.059 
car too so first the way and probably
the<00:00:06.990> most<00:00:07.109> reliable<00:00:07.319> way<00:00:07.649> would<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:07.859> if<00:00:08.010> you

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the most reliable way would be if you

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.640 
the most reliable way would be if you
had<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.220> battery-powered<00:00:08.690> GPS<00:00:09.690> unit<00:00:10.050> take<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
had a battery-powered GPS unit take a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.740 
had a battery-powered GPS unit take a
ride<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:10.920> your<00:00:11.219> motorcycle<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.940> say<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.540> can

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
ride on your motorcycle and say you can

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.509 
ride on your motorcycle and say you can
set<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.170> miles<00:00:13.410> an<00:00:13.620> hour<00:00:13.740> mode<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.309> one

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
set it in miles an hour mode so this one

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.460 
set it in miles an hour mode so this one
tells<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> miles<00:00:15.360> an<00:00:15.570> hour<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.960> also<00:00:16.080> tells

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
tells you miles an hour it also tells

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.859 
tells you miles an hour it also tells
you<00:00:16.619> your<00:00:16.800> your<00:00:17.220> moving<00:00:17.520> average<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.119> your

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
you your your moving average and your

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.349 
you your your moving average and your
maximum<00:00:19.619> speed<00:00:19.820> anybody<00:00:20.820> want<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> send<00:00:21.210> a

with using these these either one of
these<00:00:53.100> GPS<00:00:53.550> units<00:00:54.329> would<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.320> want<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> get

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
these GPS units would be you want to get

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.830 
these GPS units would be you want to get
your<00:00:55.860> bike<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> consistent<00:00:57.059> speed<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
your bike up to a consistent speed and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.740 
your bike up to a consistent speed and
then<00:00:58.500> keep<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.850> while<00:00:59.969> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
then keep it there for a little while so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
then keep it there for a little while so
the<00:01:00.899> thing<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.230> adjust<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.800> seems<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> lag<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the thing can adjust it seems to lag a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.799 
the thing can adjust it seems to lag a
little<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.820> behind<00:01:02.940> where<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> regular

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
little bit behind where a regular

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
little bit behind where a regular
speedometer<00:01:04.379> would<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.460> are

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
speedometer would be but it's they are

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
speedometer would be but it's they are
very<00:01:05.880> accurate<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> was

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
very accurate this is this one I was

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.899 
very accurate this is this one I was
testing<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.159> car<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.700> good

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
testing out with my car and it was good

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.440 
testing out with my car and it was good
today<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.670> here's<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> your

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
today so here's what you do on your

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.929 
today so here's what you do on your
motorcycle<00:01:12.979> once<00:01:13.979> you've<00:01:14.189> figured<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.640> what

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
motorcycle once you've figured out what

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.390 
motorcycle once you've figured out what
speed<00:01:15.360> equals<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.900> speed<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
speed equals what speed so if you have a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
speed equals what speed so if you have a
vehicle<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> speedometer<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
vehicle with the speedometer like you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
vehicle with the speedometer like you
can<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.470> speedometers<00:01:20.009> stuck<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.880> 20

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
can see this speedometers stuck on 20

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
can see this speedometers stuck on 20
miles<00:01:21.330> an<00:01:21.509> hour<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> took<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
miles an hour all the time so I took it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
miles an hour all the time so I took it
out<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> GPS<00:01:24.180> unit<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.720> made<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> note

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
out with a GPS unit and just made a note

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.310 
out with a GPS unit and just made a note
of<00:01:26.299> what<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> speedometer<00:01:27.869> read<00:01:28.020> when<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.229> was

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
of what the speedometer read when I was

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.170 
of what the speedometer read when I was
doing<00:01:28.470> 40<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.130> doing<00:01:29.310> 60<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
doing 40 and when I was doing 60 and I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.210 
doing 40 and when I was doing 60 and I
put<00:01:30.420> labels<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.710> works<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.100> your

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
put labels on them that works if your

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.440 
put labels on them that works if your
speedometer<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.670> working<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
speedometer is working but it's just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929 
speedometer is working but it's just
inaccurate<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.740> consistent<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.700> if

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
inaccurate but it's consistent now if

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.280 
inaccurate but it's consistent now if
your<00:01:36.150> speedometer<00:01:36.570> isn't<00:01:36.780> working<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.110> all

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
your speedometer isn't working at all

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.520 
your speedometer isn't working at all
but<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> tachometer<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:39.659> could<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
but you have a tachometer you could you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
but you have a tachometer you could you
know<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:41.040> into<00:01:41.189> top<00:01:41.549> gear<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:45.360> know

know get into top gear and then you know

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
know get into top gear and then you know
move<00:01:45.630> consistently<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.439> 65<00:01:46.890> miles<00:01:47.159> an<00:01:47.310> hour

and figure out what the RPM is and top

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
and figure out what the RPM is and top
gear<00:01:49.649> at<00:01:49.740> 65<00:01:50.189> equals<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.759> put<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> 65

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
gear at 65 equals and just put a 65

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
gear at 65 equals and just put a 65
sticker<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:52.740> least<00:01:52.799> when
