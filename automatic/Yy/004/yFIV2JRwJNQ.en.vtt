00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.549 

you<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.670> soon<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.629> good<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.809> roll<00:00:49.109> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
you do soon so it's good to roll and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.579 
you do soon so it's good to roll and
then<00:00:50.249> you<00:00:50.370> backward<00:00:51.289> because<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> lot<00:00:52.559> of

ceiling<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.069> going<00:00:53.339> white<00:00:53.839> it's<00:00:54.839> easier<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
ceiling is going white it's easier to

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.779 
ceiling is going white it's easier to
just<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.710> coat<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.609> doing<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
just do one coat because we're doing a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.029 
just do one coat because we're doing a
darker<00:00:57.120> color<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.479> my<00:00:57.569> ceiling<00:00:57.829> it's<00:00:58.829> better

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
darker color on my ceiling it's better

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.129 
darker color on my ceiling it's better
to<00:00:59.190> roll<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.729> back<00:00:59.940> roll<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.079> we

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:01.139 
to roll and then back roll so now we
