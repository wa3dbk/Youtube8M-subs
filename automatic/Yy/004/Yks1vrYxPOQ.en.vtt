00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello writer hello writer the job 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.950
 with books for more than 30 years and has 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 thing I've heard all these years and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 which continues to be repeated on the internet 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.869
 I keep seeing on the blogs of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.869
 writers and what a nonsense 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.890
 people think that if you pay 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.149
 enough advertising with exposure in the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 book you guarantee a best seller 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.480
 This is such an astronomical nonsense if 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.540
 You stop to think that it is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.930
 completely absurd because this is a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.039
 silly because if money only 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 ensures that the book would be a success. 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.010
 all the rich publishers would be 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 richer because they would sellers 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.239
 and in qaboun comes another end a victory and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.760
 is not that what you see what you see are 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.650
 books that are successful here 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.040
 the unexpected book there about 50 shades of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.130
 gray that came no one knows where it is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.770
 books that make success do not 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.619
 success because the publisher invests 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.400
 Lots of money on it Books do 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.990
 success because the public liked that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 book and the public like this or 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.880
 that book is a bet it's a risk 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.400
 nobody knows what the public will like 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.590
 the profession of publisher is a profession of 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.280
 risk we think they will like this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.259
 You think you will like what but 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.409
 it is not guaranteed 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.310
 the public may like this year 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.740
 vampires next year's zombies and the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.680
 next year to test all this and if 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.310
 fall in love with adventurous girls in 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.679
 Dystopic future no one knows what's going on 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.420
 make a success 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.440
 So you, as an author, have to understand 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.630
 this does not have 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.810
 Ian does not even think you have not 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.900
 money because it is unknown that you 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.950
 there is no chance of success you have more 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:31.320
 do not think you have a guarantee of 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.770
 success also has no one has even 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.820
 very famous writers with stephen 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.000
 king of life who already has a 30 10 seller 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.610
 in his history 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.130
 suddenly the next book he throws 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.420
 It did not come so much so did not fall in satisfaction 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.720
 of the public 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.700
 so there really are no guarantees 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.250
 you as the author have to face the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.320
 next you are entering a species 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.620
 of a horse race 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.130
 if you want to compete for the general public 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.100
 You have a chance, of course the most 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.500
 have more chance but you have 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.240
 chance you have some 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.250
 characteristics that I will comment that 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.380
 leave you in the possibility of competing 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.930
 attention in the public so always 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.590
 thinks of pleasing the public 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.590
 it is
