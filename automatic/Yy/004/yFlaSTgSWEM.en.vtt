00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
actually he's really free-range because

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.160 
actually he's really free-range because
he<00:02:34.760> can<00:02:35.000> get<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.540> pen<00:02:35.690> anyhow<00:02:36.110> he

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.259 
wants and he does and then he gets back
in<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:39.280> but<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:40.370> usually<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:40.849> him<00:02:41.000> running

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269

now<00:02:52.430> cuz<00:02:52.730> he's<00:02:52.760> an<00:02:53.030> anchor<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.989> cage<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
now cuz he's an anchor in a cage and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.660 
now cuz he's an anchor in a cage and
this<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.709> actually<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.129> cage<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.549> we're

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
this is actually the cage that we're

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.690 
this is actually the cage that we're
using<00:02:55.879> temporarily<00:02:56.450> as<00:02:56.810> our<00:02:57.650> grow<00:02:57.890> up<00:02:58.069> in<00:02:58.310> it's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
using temporarily as our grow up in it's

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.180 
using temporarily as our grow up in it's
like<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> ferret<00:02:59.780> cage<00:03:00.019> or<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.409> critter<00:03:00.920> cage

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
like a ferret cage or a critter cage

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.849 
like a ferret cage or a critter cage
that's<00:03:01.750> multi-level<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.319> we<00:03:03.409> just<00:03:03.590> laid<00:03:03.739> it

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
that's multi-level and we just laid it

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.559 
that's multi-level and we just laid it
on<00:03:03.980> its<00:03:04.129> side<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.849> our<00:03:05.000> temporary<00:03:05.299> grow

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
on its side and it's our temporary grow

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.960 
on its side and it's our temporary grow
up<00:03:05.690> in<00:03:05.870> because<00:03:06.079> we<00:03:06.379> have<00:03:07.340> new<00:03:07.549> rabbits<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.150> so

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
up in because we have new rabbits and so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.289 
up in because we have new rabbits and so
we<00:03:10.970> had<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.420> come<00:03:11.750> up<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:11.989> new<00:03:12.109> cages<00:03:12.879> so<00:03:13.879> this

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
we had to come up with new cages so this

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.360 
we had to come up with new cages so this
gave<00:03:14.510> them<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.750> lot<00:03:14.989> more<00:03:15.140> room<00:03:15.409> but<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.220> is
