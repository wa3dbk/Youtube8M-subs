00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.820 
yesterday prolite coli was a little
difficult<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:05.670> speed<00:02:06.670> s<00:02:07.050> was<00:02:08.050> about<00:02:09.539> 150<00:02:10.830> foot

punch<00:02:12.069> through<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:14.170> change<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.560> software<00:02:15.010> so

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
punch through we change the software so

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.610 
punch through we change the software so
we<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.430> two<00:02:18.430> systems<00:02:19.060> today<00:02:21.840> are<00:02:22.840> these<00:02:22.989> now

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
we have two systems today are these now

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.060 
we have two systems today are these now
these<00:02:23.890> prototype<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:24.940> these<00:02:25.060> both<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.800> is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
these prototype are these both this is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.479 
these prototype are these both this is
products<00:02:27.580> or<00:02:27.820> dads<00:02:28.320> with<00:02:29.320> we're<00:02:29.920> testing

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
products or dads with we're testing

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.810 
products or dads with we're testing
production<00:02:31.090> heads<00:02:31.300> with<00:02:32.080> two<00:02:32.820> different

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
production heads with two different

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.630 
production heads with two different
software<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.820> we're<00:02:36.820> uh<00:02:38.100> that's<00:02:39.100> that's<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
software so we're uh that's that's the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.900 
software so we're uh that's that's the
great<00:02:39.850> thing<00:02:39.880> about<00:02:40.090> updatable<00:02:41.080> software<00:02:41.910> we

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
great thing about updatable software we

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.670 
great thing about updatable software we
can<00:02:43.060> pick<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.360> choose<00:02:43.420> which<00:02:44.080> one<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.440> want

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
can pick and choose which one you want

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.660 
can pick and choose which one you want
and<00:02:46.050> today<00:02:47.050> we're<00:02:47.800> gonna<00:02:47.950> pick<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.430> choose

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
and today we're gonna pick and choose

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.410 
and today we're gonna pick and choose
software<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:50.140> production<00:02:50.800> heads<00:02:51.209> all<00:02:52.209> right

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
software for production heads all right

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.260 
software for production heads all right
let's<00:02:52.930> get<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.140> go
