00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone my name is us and you are 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.690
 channel dedicated to the designer Lego 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.490
 collection of comic figures and other 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.800
 giant things you know lately 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.960
 somehow I talk a lot about stormtroopers 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.599
 the dark side of empire power and the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.699
 like this need to be fixed therefore 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.840
 today I have scheduled a review of the lego set 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.640
 star wars 7502 seventy one sky 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 hopper t-16 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.000
 what are you waiting for quickly carry popcorn and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
 we begin 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.710
 Yes 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.350
 I would like to start my story 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.589
 minifigures 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 Their set of two pieces I'm not all new 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.370
 you know the absence of visual figures to me 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.909
 a little embarrassed because almost all 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.100
 sets 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.649
 In this price category there is a fruit 3 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 figurines can set creators decided 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.850
 that the ordinary gray rat will replace 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.740
 full character would add more 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.460
 one Tuscan raider and there would be 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.009
 no problem 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.020
 ways to not get hung up on this shadow 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.210
 let's figure out the figures in more detail first 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 pilot hopper great minifigure 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 which has a dark red quote 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.009
 gray helmet and double expression 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.470
 faces 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.899
 if we compare the new pilot with the early 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 versions, then I have a few words of the company 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:35.550
 league you well done keep up the same 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:38.280
 spirit on turn Tashkent minifigure 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.259
 raider people of the sands more commonly called 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.619
 tuscan raiders or just longing 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.979
 us 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.970
 primitive nomadic tribes dtu and on 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.310
 hostile to local 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.289
 the settlers are pretty aggressive 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.869
 beings and by no means impossible 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.580
 refer to people by the way the people of the sands and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.920
 could see the fourth episode of the film 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.929
 star wars new hope 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.330
 And now let's pay attention to the ligovsky 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.580
 version of the raider figure looks simple 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.129
 delightfully main feature of the new 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.300
 version of longing for is his head she 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.289
 unlike the previous version 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.869
 non-standard 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.150
 with many small parts on the body 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.640
 there are wonderful prints which 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.830
 reveals the real inhabitants of the desert in 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.470
 hands he holds a weapon called gdf 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.550
 oh oh yeah she didnâ€™t forget about the rat 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.550
 also available 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.560
 and now finally go skywalker 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.020
 t-16 and by tradition a little 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.910
 information entry sky hopper 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.890
 t-16 is high speed we 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.700
 orbital shuttle 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.280
 are intended solely for 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 entertainment just such a car dreamed 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.880
 would have your garage 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.070
 Any young scamman in civilian 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.710
 there were no weapons but there were 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.720
 exemptions for example planetary police 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.270
 Used on this technique laser 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.100
 guns immediately want to warn you that to 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.840
 Sorry, there were no details in the kit 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.390
 I had to replace her 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.430
 so do not pay attention to Lego 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.900
 skywalker has only one main weapon 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.900
 and a couple of rockets trigger 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.959
 in addition to the shooting function of the t-16 can 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.269
 regulate the wings 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.129
 when landing they bend and when flying 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.129
 take the standard look 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.190
 cockpit can open inside 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.230
 there is a place for me figures 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.160
 and there is a small cargo in the back 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.160
 compartment with a box 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.629
 the fourth episode of the movie star wars 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.180
 and flashed a small model sky hot arab 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:04:00.840
 hands of skywalker hatch maybe that is not 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:03.180
 everyone noticed her looking at the set 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.769
 compared the 2003 version in more detail 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.870
 only good thoughts arise 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.610
 by the way there are cool not interesting 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.079
 these blocks especially tuscan raiders 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.930
 which make them set a bit 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.090
 Uniquely again I repeat the absence 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.870
 3 minifigures confused me a little 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.820
 so I put on the mountain 4 points out of five 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.169

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.600
