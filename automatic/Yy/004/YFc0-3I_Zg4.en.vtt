pop of pink my last lily don't want to
get<00:02:18.080> too<00:02:18.230> crowded<00:02:18.440> because<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.190> lilies<00:02:19.520> are

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
get too crowded because the lilies are

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.850 
get too crowded because the lilies are

very fragile and the petals will break

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.370 
very fragile and the petals will break
off<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:23.090> at<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.270> end<00:02:23.420> we<00:02:23.720> will<00:02:23.810> take<00:02:24.020> off<00:02:24.170> all

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380

pollen off but they come off really easy
and<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.700> saves<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.300> trouble<00:02:38.450> of

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
and that saves you the trouble of

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.010 
and that saves you the trouble of
getting<00:02:39.530> pollen<00:02:40.100> off<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.430> anything<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.959> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
getting pollen off of anything and the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.320 
getting pollen off of anything and the
other<00:02:42.560> way<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.860> we<00:02:43.100> get<00:02:43.430> pollen<00:02:43.880> off<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
other way that we get pollen off of the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.979 
other way that we get pollen off of the
petals<00:02:44.750> are<00:02:45.739> these<00:02:45.920> chenille<00:02:46.310> stems<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.930> you

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
petals are these chenille stems so you

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.259 
petals are these chenille stems so you
could<00:02:48.110> take<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.260> chenille<00:02:48.620> stem<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.280> just

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
could take a chenille stem and just

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.850 
could take a chenille stem and just
clean<00:02:50.510> off<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:52.489> pedal<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.440> cleans<00:02:54.680> off

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
clean off the pedal so this cleans off

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.060 
clean off the pedal so this cleans off
any<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.310> pollen<00:02:56.180> that's<00:02:56.300> fallen<00:02:56.810> off

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
any of that pollen that's fallen off

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.070 
any of that pollen that's fallen off
we're<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:58.190> going<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.430> spot<00:02:58.820> all<00:02:59.120> these

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
we're just going to spot all these

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.160 
we're just going to spot all these
little<00:03:01.450> petals<00:03:04.989> clean<00:03:05.989> those<00:03:06.170> off

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
little petals clean those off

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.589 
little petals clean those off
take<00:03:08.680> off<00:03:08.800> any<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.280> other<00:03:09.430> pollen

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.479 

and<00:03:16.019> there's<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.260> very<00:03:16.500> elegant<00:03:16.829> Lily

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
and there's a very elegant Lily

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.329 
and there's a very elegant Lily
arrangement
