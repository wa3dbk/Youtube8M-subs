00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.750
 Welcome to nice in our third 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.639
 Valentine's proposal we are going to 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.320
 moisten the hair to start a 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.840
 simple french braid 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.000
 it stops in three the hair gives the first 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.390
 return to the braid and when you go 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.390
 right side 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.860
 you are going to separate a small piece 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.079
 you put it on your left hand you add 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.879
 hair to keep tensing here I would 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.160
 support of a comb so that it does not 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.070
 It messed up the hair because it is very smooth 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.710
 And below I do it with just my fingers 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.290
 the piece you separate, you pass it to 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.820
 front to stop it there again 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.820
 you separate a piece 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.610
 add hair to continue tracing 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 and you pass the piece to the front this is the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.350
 first stage of the hairstyle from 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.940
 now let's add another movement 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.140
 which is the one that will help us do 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.270
 The hearts 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 you separate you put on your left hand 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.710
 you add hair to keep braiding 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.719
 and pay attention to the first piece that 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.930
 we separate what you are going to join the braid 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.840
 leaving it loose to form the first 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.030
 part of the heart 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.409
 and what separates this you turn to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.409
 stop in front 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.490
 separated 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.210
 you add hair to braid 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.760
 and you take the previous piece to form 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.760
 another semicircles or half a heart 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.020
 you pass that piece to the front 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.209
 again it stops 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.209
 add hair to braid 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.640
 and you take the previous piece to form 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.050
 another semicircle or half heart and in what 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.050
 that separates this steps to the front 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.790
 you have to moisten and add gel this is 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.550
 a very smooth hair and it's easier 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.650
 form the hearts if you are going to comb a 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.799
 Wavy hair or Chinese 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.959
 you have to put rigor in the water and the gel 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.569
 so that hearts do not miss us 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.379
 they deform to make them stay 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.379
 symmetrical 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.370
 remember to stop 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.560
 you add hair to braid 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.800
 you take the previous piece 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.830
 leaving it loose and the rest you pass 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.060
 front you're going to continue in this way 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.060
 until the end 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.390
 I like this hairstyle a lot and I already 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.090
 you could see the results in the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.099
 Photographs 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.099
 it's a hairstyle that looks a lot 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.140
 I will be a father we did and it is very good for 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.140
 Valentine's Day 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.900
 I assure you that you will have very good 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.900
 comments on this hairstyle 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:42.639
 here we are ending up subject with a 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.340
 elastic and comes back to stretch a little 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.229
 all the ties you made in case 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.249
 some retired at the time of combing 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.969
 as here stretches gently to achieve 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.969
 the shape 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.750
 and ready 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.970
 It is a beautiful hairstyle for san 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.680
 valentine who enjoy it and who have 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.680
 a happy day until the next
