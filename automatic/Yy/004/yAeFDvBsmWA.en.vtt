00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
could not get the same exact switches

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
could not get the same exact switches
although<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:41.939> isn't<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.420> horrible<00:01:42.780> switch

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
although this isn't a horrible switch

what<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.100> pay<00:03:58.250> for<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.610> know<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:58.850> not<00:03:59.030> it's

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
what you pay for you know it's not it's

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.870 
what you pay for you know it's not it's
not<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.230> Sanwa<00:04:01.600> submit<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.810> type<00:04:03.260> style<00:04:03.880> control

our<00:04:05.030> menus<00:04:05.330> are<00:04:05.450> definitely<00:04:05.900> they<00:04:06.200> feel

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
our menus are definitely they feel

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.520 
our menus are definitely they feel
cheaper<00:04:06.830> than<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.630> but<00:04:08.630> it's<00:04:08.780> uh<00:04:08.989> that's

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
cheaper than that but it's uh that's

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.680 
cheaper than that but it's uh that's
what<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.730> bought<00:04:10.940> this<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:11.450> I'm

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
what it is and I bought this so I'm

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.180

super<00:04:49.680> got<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.980> I'm<00:04:50.280> kind<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.580> tinkering<00:04:50.970> with

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
super got it I'm kind of tinkering with

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.510 
super got it I'm kind of tinkering with
that<00:04:51.240> over<00:04:51.510> here<00:04:51.690> on<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.930> floor<00:04:52.400> kind<00:04:53.400> of

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
that over here on the floor kind of

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.660 
that over here on the floor kind of
getting<00:04:53.700> ideas<00:04:53.850> for<00:04:54.390> it<00:04:54.540> i<00:04:54.920> modified<00:04:55.920> power

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
getting ideas for it i modified power

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.890 
getting ideas for it i modified power
supply<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.380> I'm<00:04:58.500> running<00:04:58.830> my<00:04:59.180> my<00:05:00.180> power<00:05:00.390> LED

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
supply so I'm running my my power LED

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.110 
supply so I'm running my my power LED
it's<00:05:01.080> gonna<00:05:01.200> be<00:05:01.440> over<00:05:02.430> here<00:05:02.550> in<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.730> corner

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
it's gonna be over here in the corner

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.830 
it's gonna be over here in the corner
and<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:04.830> got<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.190> get<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.310> 10k<00:05:05.700> pot<00:05:05.940> but<00:05:06.750> I'm

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
and I got to get a 10k pot but I'm

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.110 
and I got to get a 10k pot but I'm
basically<00:05:07.200> gonna<00:05:07.380> have<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.770> pot<00:05:08.120> mounted

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
basically gonna have the pot mounted

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.380 
basically gonna have the pot mounted
over<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.140> then<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.310> LCD<00:05:11.880> I<00:05:12.030> did<00:05:12.240> some

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
over here and then this LCD I did some

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.920 
over here and then this LCD I did some
homework<00:05:12.420> I'm<00:05:13.170> gonna<00:05:13.380> reuse<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:13.950> LCD<00:05:14.340> and

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
homework I'm gonna reuse this LCD and

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.740 
homework I'm gonna reuse this LCD and
I'm<00:05:15.930> basically<00:05:16.260> gonna<00:05:16.470> be<00:05:16.590> outputting

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
I'm basically gonna be outputting

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.150 
I'm basically gonna be outputting
voltages<00:05:18.750> onto<00:05:19.140> this<00:05:19.290> display<00:05:19.710> this<00:05:19.920> lights

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
voltages onto this display this lights

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.020 
voltages onto this display this lights
up<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.930> I'll<00:05:21.930> be<00:05:22.140> able<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.380> adjust<00:05:22.740> my<00:05:23.520> voltage

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
up and I'll be able to adjust my voltage

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.380 
up and I'll be able to adjust my voltage
and<00:05:24.300> see<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.020> readout<00:05:25.320> right<00:05:25.350> there<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:27.030> I'll

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
and see the readout right there so I'll

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.170 
and see the readout right there so I'll
show<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:27.780> how<00:05:28.050> I'm<00:05:28.200> gonna<00:05:28.350> do<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.800> when<00:05:29.370> when

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
show you how I'm gonna do that when when

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.510 
show you how I'm gonna do that when when
that<00:05:30.300> happens<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.930> then<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.800> didn't<00:05:32.280> keep<00:05:32.370> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
that happens and then I didn't keep the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.410 
that happens and then I didn't keep the
original<00:05:32.850> PSU<00:05:33.300> because<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:34.910> guess<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.060> wanted<00:05:36.330> to

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
original PSU because I guess I wanted to

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.820 
original PSU because I guess I wanted to
keep<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.690> negative<00:05:37.020> five<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.470> didn't<00:05:37.710> want

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
keep the negative five and I didn't want

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.170 
keep the negative five and I didn't want
the<00:05:37.950> variable<00:05:38.310> voltage<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.880> building<00:05:39.120> a

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
the variable voltage and building a

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.640 
the variable voltage and building a
variable<00:05:39.540> voltage<00:05:39.630> circuit<00:05:40.260> for<00:05:40.500> the

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
variable voltage circuit for the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.340 
variable voltage circuit for the
existing<00:05:41.070> PSU<00:05:41.490> was<00:05:42.240> gonna<00:05:42.360> be<00:05:42.540> tough<00:05:42.840> because

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
existing PSU was gonna be tough because

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.860 
existing PSU was gonna be tough because
look<00:05:43.800> how<00:05:43.980> like<00:05:44.490> crammed<00:05:45.060> this<00:05:45.360> thing<00:05:45.630> was

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
look how like crammed this thing was

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.920 
look how like crammed this thing was
it's<00:05:46.620> just<00:05:47.130> no<00:05:47.850> room<00:05:48.090> at<00:05:48.180> all<00:05:48.300> doing<00:05:48.630> anything

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
it's just no room at all doing anything

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.730 
it's just no room at all doing anything
they<00:05:49.080> didn't<00:05:49.350> spare<00:05:49.920> any<00:05:50.160> kind<00:05:50.490> of<00:05:50.550> room<00:05:50.760> so

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
they didn't spare any kind of room so

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.130 
they didn't spare any kind of room so
I'm<00:05:52.740> gonna<00:05:52.860> go<00:05:53.040> ahead<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.540> just<00:05:54.540> use<00:05:54.750> this<00:05:54.900> one

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
I'm gonna go ahead and just use this one

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.630 
I'm gonna go ahead and just use this one
and<00:05:55.290> I'll<00:05:55.380> keep<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.830> fan<00:05:56.070> and<00:05:56.310> all<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.490> other

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
and I'll keep the fan and all the other

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.190 
and I'll keep the fan and all the other
stuff<00:05:56.850> in<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.030> back<00:05:58.340> so<00:05:59.340> that's<00:05:59.790> my<00:06:00.630> momentary

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
stuff in the back so that's my momentary

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.170 
stuff in the back so that's my momentary
