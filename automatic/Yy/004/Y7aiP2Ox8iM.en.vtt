00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.730
 before these two welcome back to 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.529
 destination and today I bring you a 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.020
 small tutorial on how to get 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.420
 pieces of weapons faster 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.939
 are two methods there are actually more but 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.760
 these are the fastest or are at least 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.490
 that I like when I'm short of arms 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.120
 and in fact right now I'm like that and it 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.270
 did this all this tutorial 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.399
 this video should not have risen ago 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.090
 about two weeks sorry one 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.710
 week but I missed the second method or 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.600
 Sandra more knows how to include methods and that 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.969
 add steel forget to record why 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.670
 like I'm late and they hear something from 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.600
 background is that electro sound sprouts act 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.370
 background 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.629
 because I was trying to pass alone from 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.149
 I would like to do a streaming 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.350
 after passing the ball on the ground but 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.629
 they do not see themselves saying good 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.000
 there is a tutorial is quite simple is 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.340
 very simple and the first way you should 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.200
 explain today wait a minute now if 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 he does the only thing they have to do 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.640
 is to get into the playlist of 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.250
 assaults and choose the one that has greater 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.920
 level or that flat in the rewards 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.770
 say that they will give you this much more 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.409
 changed by d lc before the vanguard and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.380
 now he is a dragon of the avant-garde because 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.030
 we choose this good if in playing this 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.190
 type of assault they will have noticed 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.560
 that at the end of the assault actually 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.899
 they are released in law, they are going to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.000
 releasing no other stops in the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.880
 screen of equal rewards you can 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.690
 drop in great more or blue weapons or 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.490
 blue armor or blue shipowners 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.560
 weapons that say blue creams is another 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.200
 thing that should give them at least three 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.750
 things can give them meaning good luck 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.580
 of esval 2 engrams and one at the end 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.350
 when they go out to orbit 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.870
 what we want are the pieces of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.460
 weapons you can dismantle the weapons but 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.690
 equal to what we can get out of this is 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.450
 can level up 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.600
 the creep tarka which with each rise 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.240
 is going to give us a legendary packet 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.920
 which brings you more engrams but 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.590
 just another thing that we're going to get is 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.110
 to be able to get the teachings of the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.730
 vanguard more quickly and so 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.280
 Well, if you urgently buy a weapon 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.990
 legendary and then you set her up but 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.040
 well as you know these jumps are 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.840
 level 28 and 28 random so you can 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.660
 be a little long if you do not have a 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.970
 good level good weapons or a good team 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.880
 and you do not concentrate especially on getting there 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.320
 at the end of the mission for this you 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.800
 I recommend that if you're playing with 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.750
 friends concentrate only on the enemies 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.280
 important skip everything you can 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.080
 of the mission and if you're playing with 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.990
 random it may be that it is left behind it 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.390
 is left behind trick pÃ³sitos new friends 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.400
 random are left far behind once 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.310
 get to a boss room or an area 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.560
 where they should stop and if you arrive first 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.180
 commit suicide this is what you are going to do is 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.189
 activate healthy darkness 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.950
 to restart to where you stay 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.799
 I repeat this we do to make it more 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.629
 fast now the second method involves to 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.489
 the wolves to which they arrive from time in 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.530
 when and the end is in a good chest 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.680
 we will see these chests if it is left 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.290
 far piss good not technically not farmar 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.590
 because it's completely legal we're going to 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.939
 get them nothing else very fast 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.280
 how much we have to do is go to 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.840
 the moon exploration and once you 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.760
 we have to go to the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.769
 mouth of hell exactly here is 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.750
 where the wolves appear once 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.250
 come here where we have actor the fast 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.139
 if you have a friend to help you and 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.900
 anyone get the pieces or 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.669
 they want to get the key to chests 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.859
 Well much better but the point is that 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.200
 we must be very quick to kill 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.120
 these wolves once they killed us 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.400
 and the chest has just appeared 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.260
 let's go for him that would be the first chest 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.780
 now the next thing we have to do 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.549
 is quickly to go to the anchor 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.739
 light following the path that leaves them in 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.419
 screen this is the reason why 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.579
 I tell them they must be quick because they do not 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.959
 is that we end up with the mouth of hell 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.910
 almost immediately they will begin to arrive 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.580
 the anchor wolves of light 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.700
 but I recommend the light anchor 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.709
 do not kill them so quickly because the most 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.390
 sure is that we still have the key to 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.880
 ether that they gave us in the mouth of the 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.980
 hell and we can not open the chests 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.630
 with the same key now if we see that 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.250
 there are many random players and they go to 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.200
 kill the wolves before we are 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.550
 finish the key this has to be with 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.100
 anticipation very important people 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.590
 we have to go the archer line which 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.050
 It is where we expose where the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.090
 Wolves will appear shortly after 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.250
 the anchor of light here if you can give us 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.830
 time to lose the first key 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.240
 before they give us a new one now 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.580
 sheen given that they end up with a 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.160
 anchor and try them with a 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.930
 archer to see if at that time with much 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.390
 lucky with this method can get 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.980
 up to three chests in five minutes now 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.600
 we simply have to perform at 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.880
 mouth in hell to return is for the 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.950
 wolves this process is not very slow 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.500
 because the wolves arrive inside more or 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.870
 minus 6 or 7 minutes once you return 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.940
 nothing else you hide in this cave and 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.430
 magazines whatsapp youtube or any 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.600
 thing and so you repeat until you get what 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.700
 what do you need 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.980
 and a people these are the methods that 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.290
 I was coming to tell you, I know I'm 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.020
 lately very inactive but it is not 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.700
 because you are busy are reasons that are not 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.560
 I'm going to say right now I'll tell you in another 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.720
 but thank you very much to those who 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.430
 they asked where he was going but good here 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.560
 I'm back see you in the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.560
 next up then see you
