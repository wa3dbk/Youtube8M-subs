00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 Good day, well, everything is not 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.849
 the final will see a video about but 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.940
 galaxy four 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:18.930
 such a small probably review 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.449
 thoughts out loud with this we see a screenshot 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.430
 really copy as it turned out to be Chinese 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.320
 It was the Chinese devices that they were like 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.680
 Once nothing but galaxy s4 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.750
 look at it in more detail 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.950
 as we see that the screen is of course crazy 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.739
 clear about 400 quarrel 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.610
 440 to 420 ppi very 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 big figure that is 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:56.699
 amoled screen draws attention to itself 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 and these are the moments, yes, we all look like 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 called with trance leader with vois with health 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.080
 samsung completely copy approach apple 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.979
 to sales 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.619
 its products makes a complete analog 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 that is strong marketing their own some 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:25.170
 chips all prefix with get 2 software then 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.310
 there are doing such a to their system which 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.729
 people need to get used to 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.890
 with s with s with galaxy s everywhere words either 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.520
 galaxy without a thousand people so 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.920
 zombie but it works as we see 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.079
 galaxy above all sold and in the background 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 flagships from sony and htc with such a strong 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.700
 marketing and people rather watch it 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.430
 side though honestly graham materials 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 the case and in general the xperia z design itself to me 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.920
 like more thanks to the marketing 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.570
 samsung takes its own shame probably 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.600
 what is the only major player on 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.060
 android 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.630
 so if honestly say well and 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.950
 here we can see by the way 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 we have the opportunity means like 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:17.370
 called floating scroll for that is you 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.040
 there is a specific type of sensor well 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.650
 which respond to overlap type too 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.710
 when still approaching a little different 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.000
 his way of working is very necessary for 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.560
 so that a person can flip through 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.930
 means the information on the screen without touching 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.080
 his ie in the air another row 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.780
 fingers will be a function I have seen 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.420
 honestly can not show us believe 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.600
 she is now he body from 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.630
 polycarbonate is such a point 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.760
 a little 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.800
 what we got in the end how i already 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 spoke 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.230
 such a galaxy s3 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.330
 so everything is a little bit more 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.510
 updates 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:08.890
 2,600 but weakly for such a course 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.920
 Makhina weak tink and despite the fact that the iphone 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.380
 5 is only content with the battery 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.690
 thousand after 50 amperes an hour 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.740
 pictures of galaxy s4 which 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.560
 in the form of the United States for the press such issued 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.960
 screenshot well, in general there is nothing 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.120
 supernatural design say what 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.380
 disgustingly normal but i think 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.950
 the body will quickly go to the state 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.290
 horror especially back i can't 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.310
 count and which is dyed painted 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.100
 plastic Anton 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.360
 I think quickly spread well and 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.830
 actual specifications android 4 lies 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.010
 42 there is a five-inch screen of 16 gigs 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.280
 RAM 32 and 64 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.340
 and yet at the same time especially with him there 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.130
 Altai support 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.170
 of some very superfast now 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.150
 also features that there networks 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.960
 scrolling video playback in 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.769
 the window everything everything everything else is nonsense 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:23.040
 damn for this purely marketing move 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.230
 to interest a person 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.200
 nichrome behold you that to me smartphones then 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.550
 have all the functions they carry most 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.350
 not practical application 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.430
 I thought who would flip through 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.260
 page there is a procession in the air someone 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.630
 uses smart stay to turn off 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.780
 the phone there with open eyes plows 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:49.290
 the function is very pro not working yes a lot 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:51.180
 many nonsense samsung i have unwound it 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.780
 probably the largest manufacturer 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.940
 electronics in the world and now just nobody 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.560
 can not be 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.750
 not because they probably can't even 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.910
 do better because marketing a 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.930
 if already speak simple language and 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:11.240
 pressed 3 flagships honor a silan 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:15.210
 galaxy s4 and xperia z and man will come and 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.040
 Even he probably and you wise simple until 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.740
 simple such a person who at all 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.140
 understands nothing phones smart he 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.650
 so ask a consultant what to buy and 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.500
 but let's start telling him that you are looking for 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.230
 won 4 megapixel camera and even if it 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.260
 will tell there is there a super camera 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.170
 there are some ultra pixels which 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.360
 there is a super photosensitive he will say 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.960
 not fiat 4 megapixels what is it at all 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.350
 such a 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.990
 d crane is juicier on of 4 and the battery 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.840
 more yes and samsung 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.270
 consider it is not clear that there will be 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.150
 how will he show himself 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:58.530
 I will take a minute of 4 fast down iksperiya 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.520
 z well yes it seems prettier but android 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.770
 the previous version of the battery is weaker 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.200
 Here is the screen on dimmer Well, in short, that's 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.860
 everything says everything about taking and 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.600
 ps4 they say i will take from 4 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.120
 talking about how will be ordinary 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.280
 consumer therefore samsung everything is already 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.530
 caught it will be like iphone iphone 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.860
 cisco nothing new nothing new someone 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.160
 buys and the same thing happened with 4 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.790
 sole profit and 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.770
 the device that they quickly only respond 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:36.430
 no more apple devices 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:38.510
 there is no profit but you think what I want 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:43.790
 expressed his like a small point 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:46.210
 view sharpens and in general, all so 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.210
 bye everyone
