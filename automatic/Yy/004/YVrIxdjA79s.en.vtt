show you what you can do with the
polymer<00:00:08.189> clay<00:00:08.340> leftovers<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:10.290> know

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
polymer clay leftovers that you you know

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.640 
polymer clay leftovers that you you know
you<00:00:10.679> don't<00:00:10.980> use<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.580> always<00:00:12.300> don't<00:00:12.750> throw<00:00:13.349> away

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
you don't use I always don't throw away

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
you don't use I always don't throw away
any<00:00:14.009> polymer<00:00:14.490> clay<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.759> course<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.960> all

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
any polymer clay of course this is all

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.370 
any polymer clay of course this is all
little<00:00:16.890> bits<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.810> colors<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.840> combine

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
little bits of colors that combine

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.670 
little bits of colors that combine
together<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.939> wasteful<00:00:21.680> polymer

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
together and this is wasteful polymer

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.269 
together and this is wasteful polymer
clay<00:00:22.910> sometimes<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:25.279> for

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
clay sometimes you you can do for

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.720 
clay sometimes you you can do for
example<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.539> pick<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.050> up<00:00:28.289> from<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
example we just pick it up from here you

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.709 
example we just pick it up from here you
can<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.480> marbles<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:32.070> your<00:00:32.540> charms<00:00:33.540> or

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
can do like marbles for your charms or

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.459 
can do like marbles for your charms or
something<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
something like that

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.180 
something like that
they're<00:00:35.340> quite<00:00:35.550> pretty<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.870> I've<00:00:37.739> got<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> cool

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
they're quite pretty but I've got a cool

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.150 
they're quite pretty but I've got a cool
idea<00:00:38.340> remember<00:00:39.239> when<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> did<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.770> polymer

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
idea remember when I did the polymer

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580 
idea remember when I did the polymer

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you know jars of course this was used to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
you know jars of course this was used to
be<00:00:47.960> as<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.620> our<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.550> jam<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.300> sauce

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
be as you can see our a jam or sauce

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.430 
be as you can see our a jam or sauce
tomato<00:00:52.800> sauce<00:00:53.160> jar<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.850> mean<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.719> cap<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
tomato sauce jar I mean with a cap and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.599 
tomato sauce jar I mean with a cap and
then<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> cap<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> what

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
then what you can do with a cap so what

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.939 
then what you can do with a cap so what
we<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.829> this

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we gonna do with this so I have this

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.010 
we gonna do with this so I have this
idea<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.840> using<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.549> leftovers<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> my

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
idea of using the leftovers of my

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.590 
idea of using the leftovers of my
polymer<00:01:07.020> clay<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.250> roller<00:01:08.600> my

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
polymer clay so I got my roller my

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.770 
polymer clay so I got my roller my
cutter<00:01:10.040> knife<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> course<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:12.710> sauce<00:01:13.710> jar

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
cutter knife and of course my sauce jar

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.310 
cutter knife and of course my sauce jar
cap<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.520> I've<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.320> leftovers

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
cap and then I've got my leftovers

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.450 
cap and then I've got my leftovers
polymer<00:01:20.220> clay<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:21.990> gonna<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.799> I'm

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
polymer clay so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.539 
polymer clay so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:01:23.729> roll<00:01:24.650> I'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> condition<00:01:26.100> first

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
gonna roll I'm going to condition first

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.289 
gonna roll I'm going to condition first
I'm<00:01:27.060> gonna<00:01:27.530> condition<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> polymer<00:01:29.130> clay

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
I'm gonna condition the polymer clay

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.469 
I'm gonna condition the polymer clay
leftovers<00:01:31.250> I'm<00:01:32.250> gonna<00:01:32.610> roll<00:01:32.939> them<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.890> then

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
leftovers I'm gonna roll them and then

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.270 
leftovers I'm gonna roll them and then
what<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.540> decided<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:40.040> simply<00:01:41.899> combine

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
what I decided to do is simply combine

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.719 
what I decided to do is simply combine
you<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.399> different<00:01:44.759> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> colors<00:01:46.729> like

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you know different kind of colors like

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:47.990 
you know different kind of colors like
that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.550 
that
for<00:01:48.899> example<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.950> well<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
for example as well if you want to you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950 
for example as well if you want to you
can<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.950> come<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> cutter<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
can just come with a cutter like a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.830 
can just come with a cutter like a
circle<00:01:55.500> cutter<00:01:56.060> just<00:01:57.060> come

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
circle cutter just come

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
circle cutter just come
at<00:01:59.520> different<00:02:00.520> shapes<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.329> it<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.810> then<00:02:01.990> start

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
at different shapes of it and then start

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.670 
at different shapes of it and then start
putting<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.289> on<00:02:05.289> top<00:02:05.829> of<00:02:06.070> your<00:02:08.250> jar<00:02:09.250> cap<00:02:10.680> so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
putting on on top of your jar cap so

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
putting on on top of your jar cap so
that's<00:02:11.860> what<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.040> do<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:14.319> then<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.590> come<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that's what I do and then I come to a

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.070 
that's what I do and then I come to a
different<00:02:16.209> color<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.269> just

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
different color and like this just

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.809 
different color and like this just
conditioned<00:02:21.120> roll<00:02:22.769> with<00:02:23.769> your<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.450> know
