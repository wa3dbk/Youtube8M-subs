00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.450 

I<00:00:27.380> was<00:00:28.380> able<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.620> get<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:28.890> four<00:00:29.190> of<00:00:29.340> these

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
I was able to get the four of these

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
I was able to get the four of these
little<00:00:30.420> tabs<00:00:31.310> with<00:00:32.310> the<00:00:32.430> drill<00:00:32.640> I'll<00:00:33.090> zoom<00:00:33.300> out

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
little tabs with the drill I'll zoom out

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600 
little tabs with the drill I'll zoom out
that<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:34.080> one<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.710> there<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.220> one<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that that one that one there is one in

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400 
that that one that one there is one in
the<00:00:35.670> center<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.750> there's<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.290> there

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the center and there's one over there

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.030 
the center and there's one over there
and<00:00:38.300> then<00:00:39.300> there's<00:00:39.480> two<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.590> got<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and then there's two in here I got that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.299 
and then there's two in here I got that
one<00:00:41.220> on<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.400> far<00:00:41.580> end<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.770> over

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
one on the far end but not the one over

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
one on the far end but not the one over
towards<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.790> end<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.199> reason<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.590> that

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
towards the end and the reason for that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.410 
towards the end and the reason for that
is<00:00:47.699> I<00:00:47.879> can't<00:00:48.320> get<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.470> drill<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.970> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
is I can't get the drill in there if I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.760 
is I can't get the drill in there if I
did<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.840> drill<00:00:52.050> would<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.410> sideways

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
did it the drill would be going sideways

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.170 
did it the drill would be going sideways
so<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.400> figure<00:00:53.610> something<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.030> think

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
so I got to figure something out I think

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.860 
so I got to figure something out I think
I've<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> solution<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> let<00:00:56.160> me<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.340> check

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
I've got a solution so let me go check

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.939 
I've got a solution so let me go check
all<00:00:57.870> right<00:00:57.989> here's<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> solution<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.860> I'm

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
all right here's the solution that I'm

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.710 
all right here's the solution that I'm
going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> try<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.610> this<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.940> tool

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
going to try I have this little tool

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.710 
going to try I have this little tool
here<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> an<00:01:01.890> offset<00:01:02.630> kind<00:01:03.630> of

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
here it's kind of an offset kind of

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.880 
here it's kind of an offset kind of
drilling<00:01:03.989> tool<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.850> flexible<00:01:06.740> as<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
drilling tool and it's flexible as you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.880 
drilling tool and it's flexible as you
can<00:01:08.009> see<00:01:08.160> there<00:01:08.420> but<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:10.140> turn<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
can see there but you turn one in you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.889 
can see there but you turn one in you
check<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.399> in<00:01:11.550> your<00:01:11.670> drill<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
check this up in your drill and on the

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.030 
check this up in your drill and on the
other<00:01:13.050> end<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:14.210> see<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> spins<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.740> basically

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
other end you see it spins so basically

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.510 
other end you see it spins so basically
I'm<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.550> have<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.020> forego<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.520> pilot

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I'm going to have to forego the pilot

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.080 
I'm going to have to forego the pilot
drill<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.020> come<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.619> with

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
drill and then just come in here with

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.940 
drill and then just come in here with
the<00:01:24.090> self<00:01:24.750> drilling<00:01:24.990> screws<00:01:25.170> stick<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> in

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the self drilling screws stick that in

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.630 
the self drilling screws stick that in
there<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:27.740> see<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.039> get<00:01:29.160> this<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> work

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
there and see if I can get this to work

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.020 
there and see if I can get this to work
so<00:01:29.670> we'll<00:01:30.360> give<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.690> shot<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:32.030> hopefully

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so we'll give this a shot and hopefully

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.449 
so we'll give this a shot and hopefully
it<00:01:33.330> works

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
it works

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.900 
it works

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
let me show you why real fast it's a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.910 
let me show you why real fast it's a
two-part<00:02:17.660> thingamajig<00:02:18.660> see<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.770> there's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
two-part thingamajig see that there's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.170 
two-part thingamajig see that there's
one<00:02:20.069> part<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.520> take<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.819> out<00:02:21.000> just

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
one part you can take this out just

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.000 
one part you can take this out just
takes<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.510> quarter-inch<00:02:22.489> little<00:02:23.489> driver<00:02:24.300> bit

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
takes a quarter-inch little driver bit

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.900 
takes a quarter-inch little driver bit
so<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:27.300> then<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.319> got<00:02:28.530> this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so you have this and then you got this

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.789 
so you have this and then you got this
and<00:02:29.910> what<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.180> have

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
and what I do have
