00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.670 

so<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.330> going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.810> pool<00:01:49.080> party<00:01:49.140> where

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
so if you're going to a pool party where

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
so if you're going to a pool party where
you<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.189> actually<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> swim

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you think you're actually going to swim

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
you think you're actually going to swim
I<00:01:51.479> suggest<00:01:52.080> not<00:01:52.229> wearing<00:01:52.500> any<00:01:52.650> makeup<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.070> all

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
I suggest not wearing any makeup at all

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
I suggest not wearing any makeup at all
just<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.640> bare<00:01:53.790> face<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.750> not

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
just your bare face but if you are not

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.039 
just your bare face but if you are not
going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> swim<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.880> suggest<00:01:57.540> something<00:01:57.720> like<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
going to swim I suggest something like a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.880 
going to swim I suggest something like a
BB<00:01:58.409> cream<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.220> light<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.759> fresh<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.560> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
BB cream so it's light and fresh and it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770 
BB cream so it's light and fresh and it
also<00:02:02.009> has<00:02:02.130> SPF<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> will<00:02:03.600> protect

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
also has SPF in it so it will protect

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
also has SPF in it so it will protect
you<00:02:04.110> from<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.799> Sun<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.970> just<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.390> to
