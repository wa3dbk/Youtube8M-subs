00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.650

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 lasagne bolognese I will make 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.340
 lasagne a bit special 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 let's go see them ingredients like 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.230
 ingredients we need a sauce I 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.390
 use a béchamel sauce 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 ham lasagna naturally 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 cooked with fontina and parmesan 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.239
 then as first thing I have 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:43.379
 used a four flight dog 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:46.430
 I call the bottom of the sauce a la 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.430
 spread well 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.790
 we take our lasagna and the other me 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.790
 I divide it in half 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.630
 in this way 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.660
 I put the béchamel sauce on it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.500
 baked ham 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.500

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.209
 other lasagna 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.580
 I would say gravy 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.079
 parmesan 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.280
 and second layer of lasagna 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.569
 bechamel 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.440
 other ham 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.380
 holster 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.450
 another aspect of lasagna 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.170
 finally gravy 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.819
 and parmesan 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.210
 now that our lasagna is ready 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.350
 put in the oven at 200 degrees for about 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.900
 20 minutes 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.790
