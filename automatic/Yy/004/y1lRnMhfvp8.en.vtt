00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.059 
fiber
9:40<00:02:58.430> right<00:02:59.090> now<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.540> when<00:03:00.499> I<00:03:00.590> saw<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:00.859> was<00:03:00.980> like

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
9:40 right now so when I saw it was like

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.720 
9:40 right now so when I saw it was like
yeah<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.670> got<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:01.999> pick<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.329> thing<00:03:02.389> up<00:03:02.749> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
yeah I got to pick that thing up and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.429 
yeah I got to pick that thing up and
it's<00:03:04.730> got<00:03:04.879> some<00:03:05.030> awesome<00:03:05.269> alumina<00:03:06.139> of

blue<00:03:10.579> bag<00:03:10.790> spacers<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.389> like<00:03:11.599> sick<00:03:12.700> flow

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
blue bag spacers just like sick flow

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.099 
blue bag spacers just like sick flow
through<00:03:13.909> construction<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:14.659> one<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:14.930> well

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
through construction on this one as well

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.379 
through construction on this one as well
that's<00:03:15.799> not<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.459> case<00:03:16.609> with<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.939> original

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
that's not the case with the original

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.619 
that's not the case with the original
the<00:03:17.420> original<00:03:17.569> has<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:19.670> closed<00:03:20.060> up<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.510> it's

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
the original has it's closed up and it's

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.890 
the original has it's closed up and it's
got<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.849> think<00:03:22.849> it's<00:03:23.030> like<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> purple<00:03:24.159> anodized

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
got I think it's like a purple anodized

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.110 
got I think it's like a purple anodized
back<00:03:26.900> spacer<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:29.299> this<00:03:29.620> version

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
back spacer but really like this version

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.589 
back spacer but really like this version
smooth<00:03:32.120> as<00:03:32.329> butter<00:03:32.359> I<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.379> I<00:03:34.209> love<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
smooth as butter I just I love the

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.959 
smooth as butter I just I love the
smoothness<00:03:38.599> of<00:03:39.019> bench<00:03:39.799> maids<00:03:40.069> like<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.549> the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:40.969 
smoothness of bench maids like the the

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.899 
smoothness of bench maids like the the
grip<00:03:41.180> Tilian<00:03:41.629> was<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:42.799> had<00:03:43.069> was<00:03:43.280> extremely

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
grip Tilian was that I had was extremely

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.539 
grip Tilian was that I had was extremely
smooth<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.449> was<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.750> nine<00:03:44.930> no<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:46.040> seven<00:03:46.370> ten

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
smooth so was the nine no the seven ten

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.069 
smooth so was the nine no the seven ten
that<00:03:46.699> I<00:03:46.730> had<00:03:46.909> was<00:03:47.090> extremely<00:03:47.569> smooth<00:03:47.780> as<00:03:47.930> well

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
that I had was extremely smooth as well

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.369 
that I had was extremely smooth as well
but<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.489> think<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.299> carbon<00:03:50.629> fiber<00:03:50.870> just<00:03:51.169> looks

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
but I think this carbon fiber just looks

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.569 
but I think this carbon fiber just looks
sick<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.989> it's<00:03:57.650> just<00:03:57.799> a<00:03:57.919> very<00:03:58.489> very

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
sick and it's just a very very

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.830 
sick and it's just a very very
attractive<00:03:59.389> looking<00:04:00.079> blade<00:04:00.469> with<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:00.859> I

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
attractive looking blade with that I

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.189 
attractive looking blade with that I
think<00:04:02.840> it's<00:04:02.959> called<00:04:03.169> like<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.349> reverse<00:04:03.769> tanto

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
think it's called like a reverse tanto

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:13.210 
think it's called like a reverse tanto
but<00:04:06.250> yeah

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.330 

Osborn<00:04:14.220> design<00:04:14.549> s9<00:04:15.480> TV<00:04:15.829> this<00:04:16.829> will<00:04:17.010> be<00:04:17.130> my

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
Osborn design s9 TV this will be my

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.390 
Osborn design s9 TV this will be my
first<00:04:18.060> experience<00:04:18.690> with<00:04:19.169> s90<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:22.400> heard

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
first experience with s90 so I heard

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.480 
first experience with s90 so I heard
it's<00:04:23.610> got<00:04:24.440> ridiculous<00:04:25.440> edge<00:04:25.680> retention<00:04:25.860> so

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
it's got ridiculous edge retention so

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.320 
it's got ridiculous edge retention so
we'll<00:04:26.729> see<00:04:27.440> both<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.590> these<00:04:28.710> will<00:04:29.310> be<00:04:29.340> carried

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
we'll see both of these will be carried

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.900 
we'll see both of these will be carried
and<00:04:30.510> used<00:04:31.040> just<00:04:32.040> like<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.400> rest<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.610> my<00:04:32.699> knives

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
and used just like the rest of my knives

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.290 
and used just like the rest of my knives
I<00:04:33.090> don't<00:04:33.270> have<00:04:33.389> any<00:04:33.570> safe<00:04:33.810> Queens<00:04:34.370> but<00:04:35.370> yeah

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
I don't have any safe Queens but yeah

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.760 
I don't have any safe Queens but yeah
just<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.949> nice<00:04:37.949> little<00:04:38.220> EDC<00:04:38.850> knife<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.449> mean<00:04:40.410> it's

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
just a nice little EDC knife I mean it's

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.770 
just a nice little EDC knife I mean it's
it's<00:04:41.220> quite<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> bit<00:04:41.639> smaller<00:04:41.669> than<00:04:42.150> what<00:04:42.750> I

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
it's quite a bit smaller than what I

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.340 
it's quite a bit smaller than what I
normally<00:04:43.410> carry<00:04:43.860> but<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:45.750> know<00:04:45.840> I'm<00:04:46.229> okay

normally carry but you know I'm okay

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.830 
normally carry but you know I'm okay
with<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:47.100> can<00:04:47.639> always<00:04:47.940> carry<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.570> as<00:04:48.810> a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
with it I can always carry this as a

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.040 
with it I can always carry this as a
secondary<00:04:49.440> blade<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:50.760> know<00:04:50.900> carry<00:04:51.900> my

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
secondary blade you know carry my

secondary blade you know carry my
Strider<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.650> then<00:04:52.770> also<00:04:53.070> carry<00:04:53.310> this<00:04:53.720> because

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
Strider and then also carry this because

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.320 
Strider and then also carry this because
in<00:04:55.500> my<00:04:55.710> opinion<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.250> can't<00:04:56.460> have<00:04:56.699> enough

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
in my opinion you can't have enough

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:06.820 
in my opinion you can't have enough
knives<00:04:57.600> on<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:58.729> so<00:05:01.970> really<00:05:02.970> happy<00:05:03.150> with<00:05:03.419> these
