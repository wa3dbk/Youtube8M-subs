00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.060
 make predictions in our bender 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 and today we talk as usual doing 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.950
 about the spain championship my favorite 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.020
 profile championship and in this report us 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.250
 the thirty third round awaits us immediately 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.730
 some real 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.010
 butt-frontal battles will be classics 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.350
 bilbao athletics will take 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.470
 Barcelona will be a direct fight for the league 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 champions between was fought with poison and valencia 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.080
 In general, there is plenty to choose from, but I 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.880
 Of course I will focus on the Madrid derby 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.550
 still derby is derby 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.140
 models of athletics at your home on the landing 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 calderon will take Real Madrid 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.090
 athletics holds resort spectacular 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.130
 phenomenal season for yourself team 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.800
 very cool you built sholina 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.549
 trained is of course the coaching team 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.860
 on the difference in nature this 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.380
 mirror reflection of impulsiveness 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.039
 temperament his mentor diego 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.810
 Pavla Semyon and immediately managed to inject 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.369
 their ideology and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.740
 football player 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.560
 This is reflected in the team results. 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.020
 now first aid kit 3 this match besides 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.929
 that he is a status image of irrigation 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.909
 after all, the derby also has a direct 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.219
 value in the standings real goes 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.020
 third best between teams 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:39.030
 three points but people fans carefully 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.639
 following European football of course 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.549
 well aware that for 12 years 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:47.009
 the difference can't beat lost whether 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.770
 game at home whether it's a game away but here 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.159
 it does not work in any way and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.609
 now it seems to me the best 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.060
 moment 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:00.840
 to catch the victory of athletics madrid 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 I will explain why Varius continues his 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.619
 performance in the Champions League real played 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 Wednesday in Dortmund 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.270
 had a tough match 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.700
 the championship against athletics will be held in 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.160
 saturday and tuesday 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.660
 next tuesday already at the real response 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.470
 the game against darth is between 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.510
 matches 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.060
 Champions League semi final also 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.830
 madrid derby plus real 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.620
 There are certain personnel problems. 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.209
 it was evident from the match with the children myself 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.739
 the last round of the championship where they gave 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.600
 opportunity to play young cantor 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.790
 I do not exclude that in the derby 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.770
 cupid cannot expose well 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.380
 mixed composition keeping in mind of course 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.420
 return game against Borussia therefore 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.640
 athletics 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.019
 it's fine now or never 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.090
 understands that this is a good opportunity 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.070
 first real catch up on the tournament 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.060
 table scoring three points and respectively 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.810
 catch up with the real number 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 points 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.390
 plus here is the story of confrontation 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.459
 background who are against athletics too 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.280
 should somehow motivate further 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.980
 matrices and don't forget that these same commands 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.100
 will play with each other in the cup final and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.959
 sleep there of course 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.570
 the favorite will definitely be real 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.489
 because the Champions League will 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.850
 Already real will accept as he played in 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.230
 semi final will prepare for the final 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.989
 incomprehensible maybe already finish 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.750
 their league performance that in general cup 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.269
 where the match decides everything and the game goes on 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.940
 result and there is a fight for the title it 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.340
 its all the same championship here and it is not 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.230
 as a priority for Real Madrid what is the difference 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.140
 second or third place is equal to it will be 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.410
 Champions League I already lost the championship 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.940
 so I suggest catching in this match 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.380
 victory athletics madrid 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.990
 but I would still recommend and recommend 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.020
 decided to stay on the version of athletics 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.430
 madrid with a handicap 0 in other words if 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.710
 there will be a draw then this is an expense 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.270
 but if wins distract to then our 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.120
 bet wins 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.240
 good odd ratio of 215 at the bad bureau 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.670
 so my proposal today is video 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.280
 the forecast will be exactly this difference 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.650
 Madrid derby with a handicap 0 match against 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.650
 Real Madrid with a coefficient of 215
