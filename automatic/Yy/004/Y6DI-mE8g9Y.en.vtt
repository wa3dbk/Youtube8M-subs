00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.279
 Hello, girls, how are you? 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.590
 week I hope it's great and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
 welcome one more day to the channel today as 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.279
 what is promised is debt I bring you the video 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.590
 that last week you asked me if 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 through social networks to each 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 my children through social networks have 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.109
 let's go to the one who left her let's go all the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 world to follow me in the last week 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.040
 I had the privilege of attending a 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 masterclass from the hand of ghd us 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 they presented their four new curlers 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.129
 230 chairs and sliders to be more 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.019
 exact and we had the opportunity of the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.180
 hand of the equipment professionals 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.400
 hd to try them and work them in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.110
 our in our hair after 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.989
 try the four I opted for the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.659
 that has a cone shape that is this and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.970
 you will say why then for me it was the one 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.519
 gives a more natural effect or at least the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.530
 effect roads I like in my hair and it's 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.449
 that having different thickness because the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.610
 wave gets thicker up wider 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 up and finite below and it falls like 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.060
 more natural way to me at least 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.600
 seem because it is in the end is matter 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.189
 of tastes then then after 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.790
 try the four then the one that more me 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.580
 liked it was this 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.920
 I'll show you how it comes and what it is 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.850
 what he brings 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 it's in the box 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.060
 on the one hand you have 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 a book in which 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.350
 or small tricks are taught as a 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.350
 mini masterclass 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.670
 for the use of laughter 2 and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.200
 also for which you do not have much skill 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.200
 well in a glove 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.840
 what covers everything 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.390
 306 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.359
 and the one that is perfect then to grab 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.189
 the hair and if we touch the curling iron 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.350
 do not burn, I recognize that now 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.020
 but when I had my first curler I 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.599
 It burned a lot because you do not have a hand and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.830
 by catching them to the best that is that is 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.989
 taking the hair and suddenly touching them from 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.790
 the chair or anything and you burn me 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.519
 I know him to give me more mcdonald like this 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.790
 that I consider it quite useful and then 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.370
 another trick 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.230
 is to apply good I always apply some 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.629
 kind of protector when I'm going to apply 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.180
 heat to wing meleka is the one I'm 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.340
 using now is perfect because 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.989
 power the curl then in addition to 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.299
 protect then what does that when 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.239
 we believe the waves with the 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.430
 curly because the liquid the power and the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.769
 I'm really happy with him 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.019
 because at least the hair does not suffer 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.599
 the time to apply lime so perfect 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.280
 the characteristics of the plate two 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.819
 things that I liked a lot of them 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.109
 are that the cable is fully rotated with 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.370
 which we are not going to have to be 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.109
 doing it in the shape probe 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.970
 orthopedic what I know him taking 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.370
 once it has happened to me of being pulling 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.650
 because the cable did not come right and then 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.650
 it takes very little time to turn on you will see 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.590
 is ready to use it with which 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.850
 steals us very little time is to say no 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.490
 we have to wait for nothing and we can 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.110
 do it quickly in the morning 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.610
 yes we have if we are going out at night 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.920
 we have little time to change and 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.660
 give us a retouch because it does not steal 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.670
 time and it allows us to do it in a 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.130
 super fast and now once I 've 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.050
 explained everything we go to the tutorial and 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.520
 I teach you how I do these waves 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.520
 you want to see it in video 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.640
 a trick that they taught me the other day is 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.160
 that depending on how we wind the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.170
 hair around the director for 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.230
 we will have one type of wave or another 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.300
 I explain if I, for example, always 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.300
 the curl inwards you see 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.310
 and that implied that the one that having all 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.190
 the hair full of waves will be more 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.380
 fallen instead if I do it towards 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.540
 outside 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.080
 the bandai curls noticing one over 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.990
 of the other and at the end will be a mane 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.920
 with more volume I have a week with the 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.880
 song of that pretty rosary flowers 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.880
 to give singing 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.440
 it reminds me of the time when 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.080
 we were at school and someone was entering 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.940
 in the morning singing a song and 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.129
 end of the day everyone left from 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.610
 arabia 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.610
 for equal 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.680
 I think it's changing in the light that 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.680
 comes 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.490
 now we stand face down and we 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.490
 we throw the salt here 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.820
 and up to here the tutorial what has 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.100
 seemed super fast and super easy 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.830
 I hope you put it into practice and I 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.510
 you comment remember to like it 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.070
 He liked it because it will make me very happy 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.070
 and see you in the next video
