00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
you can see we got if you're playing
with<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.460> hands<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.000> touchpad<00:00:48.480> you

with just your hands just touchpad you
have<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> joystick<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.280> moves

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
have a joystick right here that moves

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.139 
have a joystick right here that moves
things<00:00:50.670> around<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.809> drive<00:00:52.110> by<00:00:52.350> pressing<00:00:52.739> this

things around you drive by pressing this
and<00:00:54.149> move<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> works<00:00:56.460> out

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and move like that and it works out

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
and move like that and it works out
pretty<00:00:56.640> nicely<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.440> too

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pretty nicely actually so it's not too

what it looks like let's exit out of
this<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.750> 6<00:02:17.989> X<00:02:18.140> controller<00:02:19.450> now<00:02:20.450> all<00:02:20.810> these<00:02:21.230> are

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
this so 6 X controller now all these are

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.370 
this so 6 X controller now all these are
the<00:02:22.459> buttons<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:22.940> were<00:02:23.060> using<00:02:23.290> let's<00:02:24.290> see

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
the buttons that we were using let's see

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.610 
the buttons that we were using let's see
if<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.650> zoom<00:02:24.829> in<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.100> bit<00:02:25.130> here<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:27.320> as<00:02:27.500> you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
if I can zoom in a bit here so as you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.220 
if I can zoom in a bit here so as you
can<00:02:27.769> see<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.790> essentially<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.570> mapping<00:02:30.049> out

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
can see it essentially is mapping out

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.920 
can see it essentially is mapping out
when<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.130> press<00:02:31.459> square<00:02:31.850> what<00:02:32.450> that's<00:02:32.630> going<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
when I press square what that's going to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.420 
when I press square what that's going to
hit<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> touchscreen<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.190> if<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.340> hit

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
hit on the touchscreen so if I hit

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.610 
hit on the touchscreen so if I hit
square<00:02:34.790> that's<00:02:35.150> where<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:36.200> know<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> jump

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
and stuff is just to slowly move it

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.300 
and stuff is just to slowly move it
around<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.260> not<00:04:20.260> drag<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.620> controllers<00:04:21.100> as

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
around and not drag the controllers as

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.890 
around and not drag the controllers as
much<00:04:23.520> there's<00:04:24.520> really<00:04:24.760> if<00:04:25.270> there's<00:04:25.570> any<00:04:25.750> way

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
much there's really if there's any way

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.740

around<00:04:25.930> just<00:04:26.500> having<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.450> circle<00:04:28.450> here<00:04:28.570> in

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
around just having this circle here in

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.390 
around just having this circle here in
one<00:04:28.990> fixed<00:04:29.350> spot<00:04:29.530> that'd<00:04:29.860> be<00:04:29.979> great<00:04:30.220> but<00:04:30.250> I

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
one fixed spot that'd be great but I

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.710 
one fixed spot that'd be great but I
haven't<00:04:30.580> been<00:04:30.700> able<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.970> find<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.330> way<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.479> do

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
haven't been able to find a way to do

down X and I'm holding down square let's

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.830 
down X and I'm holding down square let's
see<00:04:45.520> alright<00:04:46.090> let's<00:04:46.330> get<00:04:46.419> out<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.630> car

have that won't that haven't been set up

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.320 
have that won't that haven't been set up
yet<00:05:16.020> because<00:05:16.139> it's<00:05:16.590> just<00:05:16.889> been<00:05:17.190> kind<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.240> a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
yet because it's just been kind of a

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.480 
yet because it's just been kind of a
pain<00:05:18.509> just<00:05:18.840> doing<00:05:19.259> this<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:19.680> mapping<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.370> all

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
pain just doing this and mapping it all

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.249 
pain just doing this and mapping it all
together<00:05:20.669> and<00:05:21.060> making<00:05:21.569> all<00:05:21.750> of<00:05:21.780> them<00:05:21.960> work<00:05:22.110> at

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
together and making all of them work at

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.140 
together and making all of them work at
once<00:05:22.470> because<00:05:22.800> usually<00:05:23.009> if<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.280> set<00:05:23.550> up<00:05:23.580> one<00:05:23.940> the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
once because usually if I set up one the

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.879 
once because usually if I set up one the
other<00:05:24.270> wouldn't<00:05:24.569> work<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:25.440> is<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.740> most

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
other wouldn't work this is the most

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.740 
other wouldn't work this is the most
functional<00:05:26.250> setup<00:05:26.819> and<00:05:26.970> mapping<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.449> I<00:05:27.479> have

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
functional setup and mapping that I have

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.529 
functional setup and mapping that I have
and<00:05:28.050> I'm<00:05:28.680> going<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.130> save<00:05:29.669> this<00:05:29.910> mapping<00:05:30.360> and

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
and I'm going to save this mapping and

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.360 
and I'm going to save this mapping and

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
with just you know saving the mapping

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.129 
with just you know saving the mapping
and<00:05:41.280> how<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.729> works<00:05:41.940> as<00:05:42.180> well<00:05:42.509> but<00:05:43.020> anyway

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
and how that works as well but anyway

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.830 
and how that works as well but anyway
the<00:05:43.800> buttons<00:05:44.400> that<00:05:44.550> do<00:05:44.759> not<00:05:44.909> work<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:45.389> far<00:05:45.569> and

the buttons that do not work so far and
if<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.080> guys<00:05:46.229> can<00:05:46.560> figure<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:46.979> out<00:05:47.039> that'd

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
if you guys can figure that out that'd

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.050 
if you guys can figure that out that'd
be<00:05:47.490> awesome

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
be awesome

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.749 
be awesome
I<00:05:48.199> have<00:05:49.199> the<00:05:49.470> home<00:05:49.650> button<00:05:49.949> here<00:05:50.130> doesn't<00:05:50.550> work

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
I have the home button here doesn't work

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.540 
I have the home button here doesn't work
so<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.419> have<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:51.720> touch<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:52.430> change<00:05:53.430> the

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
so you have to touch that change the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.890 
so you have to touch that change the
camera<00:05:53.819> what<00:05:54.120> doesn't<00:05:54.419> work<00:05:54.509> so<00:05:54.690> you<00:05:54.720> have<00:05:54.780> to

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
camera what doesn't work so you have to

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.930 
camera what doesn't work so you have to
do<00:05:55.050> that<00:05:55.199> on<00:05:55.319> your<00:05:55.349> own<00:05:55.520> but<00:05:56.520> these<00:05:56.669> are<00:05:56.819> all

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
do that on your own but these are all

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.149 
do that on your own but these are all
buttons<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.539> really<00:05:57.990> you<00:05:58.199> don't<00:05:58.530> need<00:05:58.949> to

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
buttons that really you don't need to

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.010 
buttons that really you don't need to
have<00:05:59.340> on<00:05:59.580> hand<00:05:59.849> and<00:06:00.090> you<00:06:00.180> can<00:06:00.330> take<00:06:00.539> a<00:06:00.569> second

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
have on hand and you can take a second

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.390 
have on hand and you can take a second
to<00:06:01.139> like<00:06:01.259> put<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.800> controller<00:06:02.130> down<00:06:02.340> and

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
to like put the controller down and

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.149 
to like put the controller down and
touch<00:06:03.169> they're<00:06:04.169> just<00:06:04.380> very<00:06:04.470> minimal<00:06:04.919> things

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
touch they're just very minimal things

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.760 
touch they're just very minimal things
and<00:06:06.060> then<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.360> think<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.780> last<00:06:07.110> thing<00:06:07.620> that's

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
and then I think the last thing that's

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.270 
and then I think the last thing that's
really<00:06:08.039> important<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:09.389> use<00:06:09.630> is<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:11.009> horn

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
really important to use is the horn

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.890 
really important to use is the horn
button<00:06:11.639> but<00:06:12.360> I<00:06:12.419> mean<00:06:12.539> I<00:06:12.630> think<00:06:12.659> the<00:06:12.870> other

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
button but I mean I think the other

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.510 
button but I mean I think the other
times<00:06:13.139> you<00:06:13.199> use<00:06:13.469> a<00:06:13.500> horn<00:06:13.800> in<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:13.949> games<00:06:14.219> where

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
times you use a horn in the games where

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.920 
times you use a horn in the games where
you're<00:06:14.729> stopping<00:06:15.000> and<00:06:15.360> trying<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:15.780> get

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
you're stopping and trying to get

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.209 
you're stopping and trying to get
somebody<00:06:16.199> to<00:06:16.229> come<00:06:16.409> over<00:06:16.560> or<00:06:16.800> something<00:06:17.099> like

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
somebody to come over or something like

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.580 
somebody to come over or something like
that<00:06:17.280> so<00:06:17.639> once<00:06:18.360> again<00:06:18.509> it's<00:06:18.810> these<00:06:19.289> aren't

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
that so once again it's these aren't

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.950 
that so once again it's these aren't
that<00:06:19.830> big<00:06:20.070> of<00:06:20.190> a<00:06:20.280> deal<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.729> try<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.300> get<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.630> most

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
that big of a deal I try to get the most

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.600 
that big of a deal I try to get the most
functioning<00:06:22.469> ones<00:06:22.650> I<00:06:22.919> believe<00:06:23.340> there's<00:06:23.550> a

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
functioning ones I believe there's a

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.270 
functioning ones I believe there's a
special<00:06:24.419> mission<00:06:25.349> button<00:06:25.800> or<00:06:25.919> something<00:06:26.070> like

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
special mission button or something like

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.300 
special mission button or something like
that<00:06:26.340> that<00:06:26.520> I'm<00:06:26.789> missing<00:06:27.060> out<00:06:27.180> on<00:06:27.240> too<00:06:28.310> but

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
that that I'm missing out on too but

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.610 
that that I'm missing out on too but
this<00:06:29.820> is<00:06:29.940> what<00:06:30.090> I<00:06:30.120> have<00:06:30.270> so<00:06:30.479> far<00:06:30.509> if<00:06:31.169> you<00:06:31.440> guys

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.409 
this is what I have so far if you guys
can<00:06:31.919> you<00:06:32.190> know<00:06:32.280> make<00:06:32.490> it<00:06:32.610> better<00:06:32.820> you<00:06:33.180> know

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.640 
build a better post in the comments
hopefully<00:06:36.210> this<00:06:36.389> helped<00:06:36.599> but<00:06:36.960> this<00:06:37.409> is<00:06:37.560> the

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
hopefully this helped but this is the

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.129 
hopefully this helped but this is the
way<00:06:37.740> to<00:06:37.800> prove<00:06:38.099> that<00:06:38.130> yes<00:06:39.060> it<00:06:39.300> does<00:06:39.599> work<00:06:39.900> to

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
way to prove that yes it does work to

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:41.930 
way to prove that yes it does work to
use<00:06:40.500> a<00:06:40.530> PlayStation<00:06:41.490> 3<00:06:41.639> controller

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
use a PlayStation 3 controller

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.029 
use a PlayStation 3 controller
wirelessly<00:06:42.509> to<00:06:43.199> play<00:06:43.469> Grand<00:06:43.740> Theft<00:06:43.800> Auto
