know their their credit to themselves I

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.189 
know their their credit to themselves I
mean<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.980> a<00:04:33.220> full-on<00:04:34.030> job<00:04:34.479> but<00:04:34.960> not<00:04:35.080> only

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
mean it is a full-on job but not only

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.960 
mean it is a full-on job but not only
that<00:04:35.320> we<00:04:35.500> have<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.860> remember<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:36.220> the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
that we have to remember that the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.210 
that we have to remember that the
managers<00:04:37.389> have<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.840> private<00:04:38.500> family<00:04:38.680> life<00:04:39.040> as

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.670 
managers have a private family life as
well<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:40.600> think<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.139> biggest<00:04:41.290> biggest

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
well and I think the biggest biggest

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.890 
well and I think the biggest biggest
thing<00:04:41.979> what<00:04:42.220> will<00:04:43.030> come<00:04:43.270> out<00:04:43.389> of<00:04:43.449> it<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.750> the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
thing what will come out of it is the

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.170 
thing what will come out of it is the
time<00:04:44.139> management<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:44.889> crucial<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.580> wanted<00:04:46.060> to
