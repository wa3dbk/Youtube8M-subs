00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
but obviously if you have the official

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.020 
but obviously if you have the official
version<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:07.229> double<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> nice<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.760> would<00:01:08.880> be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
version you double the nice it would be

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609

laid<00:02:03.560> out<00:02:03.590> more<00:02:04.100> presented<00:02:04.550> like<00:02:05.210> I've

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
laid out more presented like I've

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.270 
laid out more presented like I've
already<00:02:05.450> mentioned<00:02:05.720> does<00:02:06.110> pictures<00:02:06.530> explain

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
already mentioned does pictures explain

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.910 
already mentioned does pictures explain
for<00:02:07.700> example<00:02:07.760> here<00:02:08.270> we've<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.380> command

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
for example here we've got the command

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.640 
for example here we've got the command
phase<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.759> have<00:02:11.000> an<00:02:11.330> explanation<00:02:11.650> to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
phase so you have an explanation to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.810 
phase so you have an explanation to
accompany<00:02:12.890> these<00:02:13.220> pictures<00:02:14.200> which<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.350> good

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
accompany these pictures which is good

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.220 
accompany these pictures which is good
makes<00:02:16.820> it<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.090> lot<00:02:17.270> easier<00:02:17.630> when<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.870> learn<00:02:18.050> how

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
makes it a lot easier when you learn how

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.920 
makes it a lot easier when you learn how
to<00:02:18.260> play<00:02:18.670> explain<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.030> obviously

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
to play explain to you obviously

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.180 
to play explain to you obviously
everything<00:02:21.800> about<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.100> movement<00:02:22.520> terrain

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
everything about the movement terrain

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.880 
everything about the movement terrain
this<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.400> pretty<00:02:25.580> simple<00:02:25.940> set<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.209> rules<00:02:26.890> and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
this is a pretty simple set of rules and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.160 
this is a pretty simple set of rules and
there's<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.340> lot<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.640> abstract<00:02:29.170> abstractions

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
there's a lot of abstract abstractions

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.340 
there's a lot of abstract abstractions
in<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.380> because<00:02:30.920> obviously<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:32.140> about<00:02:33.140> these

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
in it because obviously it's about these

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.430 
in it because obviously it's about these
big<00:02:33.590> big<00:02:34.459> battles<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:36.050> you're<00:02:36.170> not<00:02:36.230> going<00:02:36.350> to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
big big battles so you're not going to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.280 
big big battles so you're not going to
be<00:02:36.500> looking<00:02:36.770> at<00:02:37.570> individual<00:02:38.570> weapon<00:02:38.870> systems

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
be looking at individual weapon systems

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.990 
be looking at individual weapon systems
and<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.769> know<00:02:39.860> does<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.370> bullet<00:02:40.700> hit<00:02:40.850> that

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and you know does this bullet hit that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.470 
and you know does this bullet hit that
tank<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.570> things<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.290> more<00:02:43.480> this

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
tank and things like that it's more this

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.090 
tank and things like that it's more this
more<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.900> general<00:02:45.290> overview<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.920> what's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
more of a general overview on what's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.160 
more of a general overview on what's
going<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.519> in<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.420> battle<00:02:47.600> rather<00:02:47.900> than

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
going on in the battle rather than

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.780 
going on in the battle rather than
concentrating<00:02:48.470> on<00:02:48.860> what<00:02:48.950> individual<00:02:49.430> units

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
concentrating on what individual units

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.750 
concentrating on what individual units
and<00:02:50.000> tanks<00:02:50.269> are<00:02:50.390> doing<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:52.010> focuses<00:02:52.519> more<00:02:52.700> on

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
and tanks are doing this focuses more on

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.840 
and tanks are doing this focuses more on
command<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.450> control<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.670> being

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
command and control but that that being

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.250 
command and control but that that being
said<00:02:56.060> obviously<00:02:56.180> different<00:02:56.690> tanks<00:02:56.959> do<00:02:57.110> do

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
said obviously different tanks do do

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.449 
said obviously different tanks do do
different<00:02:57.590> amounts<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.950> damage<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.370> each

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
different amounts of damage to each

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.670 
different amounts of damage to each
other<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.820> stuff<00:02:59.030> it's<00:02:59.239> not<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.110> general<00:03:00.530> that

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
other and stuff it's not so general that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.539 
other and stuff it's not so general that
every<00:03:00.890> tank<00:03:01.130> is<00:03:01.250> pretty<00:03:01.430> much<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.760> same<00:03:03.549> so

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
every tank is pretty much the same so

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.690 
every tank is pretty much the same so
yeah<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.150> goes<00:03:05.329> into<00:03:05.690> information<00:03:06.079> about<00:03:06.700> in

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
yeah it goes into information about in

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.340 
yeah it goes into information about in
anti-tank<00:03:08.570> guided<00:03:08.720> weapons<00:03:09.140> which<00:03:09.260> is

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
anti-tank guided weapons which is

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.590

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
obviously a really key feature in any

because the official version is

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.219 
because the official version is
