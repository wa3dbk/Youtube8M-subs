so<00:01:28.500> good<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.490> many<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.759> my<00:01:29.970> shots<00:01:30.210> I've<00:01:30.390> had

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
so good and on many of my shots I've had

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
so good and on many of my shots I've had
the<00:01:30.750> focusing<00:01:31.259> was<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.770> spite<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
I'm also irritated by the fact that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.539 
I'm also irritated by the fact that
they're<00:01:37.259> most<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> settings<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> can't

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
they're most of the settings you can't

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
they're most of the settings you can't

actually see the whole picture in the
viewfinder<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.369> means<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.850> get

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
viewfinder which means you can get

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.569 
viewfinder which means you can get
things<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.470> your<00:01:43.470> fingers<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> shot

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
