hey<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:00.989> cipher<00:00:01.410> HK<00:00:01.770> from<00:00:02.010> in<00:00:02.129> a

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys this is cipher HK from in a

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.519 
hey guys this is cipher HK from in a
year<00:00:02.490> now<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.300> am<00:00:03.689> here<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.230> show<00:00:04.470> you

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
year now today I am here to show you

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.120 
year now today I am here to show you
around<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.279> Empire's<00:00:05.879> border<00:00:06.540> map<00:00:07.130> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
around the Empire's border map the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.030 
around the Empire's border map the
amount<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.700> restricted<00:00:09.510> only<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.559> Chinese

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
amount is restricted only to the Chinese

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.870 
amount is restricted only to the Chinese

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
server on World of Tanks because we've

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.939 
server on World of Tanks because we've
complained<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.690> bit<00:00:15.839> too<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.199> about<00:00:16.529> coming

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
complained a bit too much about coming

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.269 
complained a bit too much about coming
too<00:00:17.039> many<00:00:17.220> Asian<00:00:17.520> maps<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.560> do<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.650> think<00:00:19.740> they

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
too many Asian maps so do you think they

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.679 
too many Asian maps so do you think they
got<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.609> because<00:00:20.699> they're<00:00:20.939> Chinese<00:00:21.270> nope<00:00:21.449> it's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
got it because they're Chinese nope it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.400 
got it because they're Chinese nope it's
our<00:00:21.869> fault

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
our fault

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.170 
our fault
in<00:00:23.130> theory<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> did<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> look<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:27.029> this

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
in theory so I did have a look at this

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.750 
in theory so I did have a look at this
map<00:00:27.390> before<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.920> recording<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.429> too<00:00:29.580> long

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
map before but my recording was too long

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.220 
map before but my recording was too long
so<00:00:31.070> cut<00:00:32.070> cut<00:00:32.279> off<00:00:32.399> near<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> end<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:33.960> gonna<00:00:34.110> do

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so cut cut off near the end I'm gonna do

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.610 
so cut cut off near the end I'm gonna do
it<00:00:34.320> again<00:00:35.390> we<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.510> tell<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.870> there's<00:00:37.110> four

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it again we can tell that there's four

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040 
it again we can tell that there's four
lanes<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.160> engagement<00:00:38.700> there's<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.239> here

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
lanes of engagement there's one here

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.510 
lanes of engagement there's one here
there's<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.420> um<00:00:42.890> there's<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.040> down

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
there's one here um there's one down

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.799 
there's one here um there's one down
here<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.010> this<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
here and this one here so we're going to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
here and this one here so we're going to
go<00:00:48.960> through<00:00:49.200> most<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.160> I'll<00:00:50.370> show

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
go through most of them and I'll show

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.100 
go through most of them and I'll show
you<00:00:51.379> how<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.500> work

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
you how they work

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
you how they work
so<00:00:55.110> you're<00:00:55.770> typically<00:00:56.280> probably<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.270> ahead

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so you're typically probably going ahead

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.530 
so you're typically probably going ahead
down<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:59.010> engagement<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:04.369> yeah<00:01:05.540> um

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
down here and engagement and yeah um

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.090 
down here and engagement and yeah um
it's<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.170> open<00:01:07.560> no<00:01:07.950> rocks<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.470> whole<00:01:10.799> track

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it's very open no rocks the whole track

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
it's very open no rocks the whole track
doesn't<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.610> enough<00:01:11.820> horsepower<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.900> climb

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
doesn't have enough horsepower to climb

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.260 
doesn't have enough horsepower to climb
these<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> things

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
these kind of things

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
these kind of things
that's<00:01:15.270> passable<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.500> over<00:01:16.650> into<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that's passable you can go over into the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.469 
that's passable you can go over into the
town<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:19.189> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> another<00:01:20.580> high<00:01:20.939> lane<00:01:21.210> here

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
town and this is another high lane here

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.990 
town and this is another high lane here
I'm<00:01:21.600> assuming<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.009> head<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
I'm assuming you can head up there and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.630 
I'm assuming you can head up there and
fight<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.270> suppose

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
fight I suppose

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.300 
fight I suppose
I'm<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> turn<00:01:30.630> back<00:01:30.660> now<00:01:31.070> take<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> look

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
I'm going to turn back now take a look

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
I'm going to turn back now take a look
too<00:01:32.430> long<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.660> three-lane<00:01:36.660> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
too long so it's like a three-lane it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.390 
too long so it's like a three-lane it's
got<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> five<00:01:37.380> line<00:01:37.620> map<00:01:37.830> actually<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
got a five line map actually that I

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.690 
got a five line map actually that I
didn't<00:01:38.850> explore<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.330> line<00:01:39.480> earlier<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
didn't explore that line earlier and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.070 
didn't explore that line earlier and
this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> town<00:01:42.240> area<00:01:42.450> you're<00:01:42.750> gonna<00:01:42.870> about

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
this is the town area you're gonna about

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.020 
this is the town area you're gonna about
engagement<00:01:44.070> down<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.700> Lane<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:47.310> found

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
engagement down this Lane and I found

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
engagement down this Lane and I found
that<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> houses<00:01:49.440> here<00:01:49.860> are

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that a lot of the houses here are

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.450 
that a lot of the houses here are
destroyed<00:01:50.910> on<00:01:51.420> purpose<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.470> upon<00:01:53.190> map

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
destroyed on purpose like upon map

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.450 
destroyed on purpose like upon map
loading<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.740> should<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.860> three<00:01:56.070> destroyed

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
loading so should be three destroyed

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.740 
loading so should be three destroyed
buildings<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.120> Oh<00:01:57.680> mine<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.950> guess<00:01:59.940> I<00:02:00.210> guess

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
buildings here Oh mine I guess I guess

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.390 
buildings here Oh mine I guess I guess
they<00:02:00.870> were<00:02:00.930> destroyed<00:02:01.320> last<00:02:01.470> time<00:02:01.770> because<00:02:01.979> of

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
they were destroyed last time because of

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.090 
they were destroyed last time because of
the<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:04.080> other<00:02:04.229> player<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.830> going

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the the other player that was going

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.350 
the the other player that was going
through<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:07.489> let's<00:02:08.489> keep<00:02:08.640> continuing<00:02:09.149> on

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.830 

through<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:13.020> gate<00:02:13.620> over<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.750> can

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
through the gate over there and you can

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.810 
through the gate over there and you can
see<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> other<00:02:16.350> Lane<00:02:16.650> comes<00:02:16.980> down<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.370> end<00:02:17.520> so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
see the other Lane comes down the end so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.120 
see the other Lane comes down the end so
this<00:02:18.030> would<00:02:18.239> be<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> maybe<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.320> heavy<00:02:19.530> tank<00:02:19.860> lane

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
this would be a maybe a heavy tank lane

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.320 
this would be a maybe a heavy tank lane
and<00:02:20.959> this<00:02:21.959> these<00:02:22.380> are<00:02:22.680> two<00:02:23.250> gates<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.730> so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and this these are two gates here so

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.479 
and this these are two gates here so
it's<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.750> no-man's<00:02:25.080> land<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.650> camping<00:02:26.250> fest

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
it's a no-man's land or camping fest

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.910

there's not a lot of cover here on this

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.570 
there's not a lot of cover here on this
map<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.360> how<00:02:57.360> many<00:02:57.450> rocks<00:02:57.840> or<00:02:58.140> hardcover<00:02:58.620> maybe

it's an envelope everywhere so here you

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.560 
it's an envelope everywhere so here you
can<00:04:16.920> sweep<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.370> map<00:04:17.640> branches<00:04:17.970> down<00:04:18.150> there

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
can sweep the map branches down there

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.180 
can sweep the map branches down there
and<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.109> you've<00:04:19.230> seen<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.530> gap<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.040> wall
