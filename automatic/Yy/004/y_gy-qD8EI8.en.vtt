00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.000 
review and if any of you were interested
in<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> M<00:00:26.180> pal<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> code<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.500> right<00:00:28.650> here

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
in the M pal or the code it's right here

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.679 
in the M pal or the code it's right here
so<00:00:29.160> whoever<00:00:29.369> gets<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> watch<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.090> first<00:00:30.359> can

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
so whoever gets to watch this first can

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020 
so whoever gets to watch this first can
definitely<00:00:31.080> get<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> code<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.730> says<00:00:32.880> right

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
definitely get the code so it says right

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.150 
definitely get the code so it says right
here<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.329> code<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.660> n/a<00:00:34.140> xt<00:00:34.800> -<00:00:35.430> w<00:00:36.090> w6<00:00:36.630> h<00:00:36.840> -<00:00:37.290> YF<00:00:37.890> h

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
here the code is n/a xt - w w6 h - YF h

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.750 
here the code is n/a xt - w w6 h - YF h
x<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.180> where<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.420> gots<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> code

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
x so where we gots to use the code

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.950 
x so where we gots to use the code
congratulations<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> use<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> well

and<00:00:43.440> here's<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> basic<00:00:44.820> instructions<00:00:45.360> pretty

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and here's the basic instructions pretty

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.610 
and here's the basic instructions pretty
much<00:00:46.200> got<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.829> green<00:00:47.789> blade<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.620> I'll

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
much got to put the green blade and I'll

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
much got to put the green blade and I'll
lock<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> there's<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:51.030> notch<00:00:51.300> here

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
lock it there's a little notch here

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.740 
lock it there's a little notch here
little<00:00:52.260> space<00:00:52.530> right<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.750> little

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
little space right there and a little

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
little space right there and a little
thing<00:00:55.649> right<00:00:55.800> there<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.460> going

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
thing right there so you're just going

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.439 
thing right there so you're just going
to<00:00:56.610> lock<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.710> just<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.430> I<00:01:00.149> guess<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to lock it just like so and I guess this

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.790 
to lock it just like so and I guess this
one<00:01:00.629> makes<00:01:00.840> sound<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.500> sure<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
one makes sound I'm not sure if it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.609 
one makes sound I'm not sure if it
lights<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.840> there's<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> button<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
lights up and there's a button there's a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
lights up and there's a button there's a
switch<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.659> there's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> button<00:01:06.900> right

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
switch right here there's a button right

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.289 
switch right here there's a button right
here<00:01:07.189> but<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.310> course<00:01:08.490> before<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.180> need

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
here but of course before that you need

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.050 
here but of course before that you need
to<00:01:09.510> switch<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.350> switch<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.820> there's<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
to switch or switch it on so there's a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
saber same with the mace windu it'll be

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
saber same with the mace windu it'll be
nice<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.930> lights<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> sounds<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.159> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
course that's already asking too much

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.899 
course that's already asking too much
because<00:01:58.079> again<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.280> McDonald's<00:01:59.790> Happy

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.980 
Meal toy but I would have rather
preferred<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.790> light-up<00:02:03.060> lightsaber<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> Yoda

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
preferred a light-up lightsaber of Yoda

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990 
preferred a light-up lightsaber of Yoda
and<00:02:04.290> mace<00:02:04.590> windu<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.189> blue<00:02:05.520> green<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.880> purple

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and mace windu for blue green and purple

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.459 
and mace windu for blue green and purple
and<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.390> would<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.659> look<00:02:06.869> really<00:02:07.140> cool

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and they would just look really cool

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.619 
and they would just look really cool
just<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> Anakin<00:02:08.670> Skywalker<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.330> chill

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
just like the Anakin Skywalker I chill

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.470 
just like the Anakin Skywalker I chill
in<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> dark<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.140> anyway

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
in the dark so anyway

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.610 
in the dark so anyway
so<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> guess<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.110> hold<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.470> button

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so I guess you have to hold the button

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
so I guess you have to hold the button
if<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.370> want<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.640> sound<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.030> you're

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
if you want the sound so if you're

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240 
if you want the sound so if you're
really<00:02:21.299> going<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.810> sound<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.319> it's<00:02:22.829> very

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
really going with a sound it it's very

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.789 
really going with a sound it it's very
slow<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.939> you<00:02:24.000> were<00:02:24.299> actually<00:02:24.510> moving<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.110> if

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
slow if you were actually moving it if

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.130 
slow if you were actually moving it if
I'm<00:02:25.980> gonna<00:02:26.129> go<00:02:26.250> any<00:02:26.400> faster<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.060> then<00:02:27.870> maybe

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
I'm gonna go any faster and then maybe

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.059 
I'm gonna go any faster and then maybe
like<00:02:28.379> go<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.750> just<00:02:30.810> shuts<00:02:31.170> off<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.769> it's<00:02:31.950> very

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
like go it just shuts off so it's very

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.520 
like go it just shuts off so it's very
Wow<00:02:32.579> Wow<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.900> not<00:02:34.049> very<00:02:34.230> fast<00:02:34.409> like<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.930> there

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
