00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370 

I'm<00:00:00.510> going<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.780> try<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.930> teach<00:00:01.140> you<00:00:01.170> the

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
I'm going to try to teach you the

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.970 
I'm going to try to teach you the
sandbox<00:00:01.829> struggle<00:00:06.529> this<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> pretty

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
sandbox struggle this is a pretty

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.790 
sandbox struggle this is a pretty
advanced<00:00:08.460> pattern<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:09.599> kind<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> similar<00:00:10.710> to

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
advanced pattern it's kind of similar to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.190 
advanced pattern it's kind of similar to
Romeo<00:00:11.160> as<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> Rubenstein's<00:00:11.880> revenge<00:00:12.080> but<00:00:13.080> if

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
Romeo as a Rubenstein's revenge but if

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.270 
Romeo as a Rubenstein's revenge but if
you<00:00:13.290> ask<00:00:13.410> me<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.679> think<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:13.980> harder<00:00:14.250> than

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
you ask me I think it's harder than

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.039 
you ask me I think it's harder than
either<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.700> those<00:00:14.820> patterns<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.450> those<00:00:15.929> are

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
either of those patterns and those are

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.450 
either of those patterns and those are
pretty<00:00:16.170> difficult<00:00:16.440> patterns<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.160> if<00:00:17.340> you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
pretty difficult patterns so if you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.380 
pretty difficult patterns so if you
don't<00:00:17.640> already<00:00:17.820> know

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
don't already know

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.880 
don't already know
Romeo's<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.900> Rubenstein's<00:00:19.170> revenge<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
Romeo's with Rubenstein's revenge I

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.170 
Romeo's with Rubenstein's revenge I
recommend<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.460> learn<00:00:20.640> them<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> make

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
recommend you go learn them and make

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.670 
recommend you go learn them and make
sure<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.480> them<00:00:21.600> down<00:00:21.779> pat<00:00:22.230> before<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
sure you have them down pat before you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.400 
sure you have them down pat before you
try<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.980> pattern<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.820> pretty<00:00:24.060> hard<00:00:24.410> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
try this pattern it's pretty hard the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.050 
try this pattern it's pretty hard the
first<00:00:25.619> thing<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.800> notice<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
first thing you notice about it is that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.540 
first thing you notice about it is that
it's<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.019> complete<00:00:28.769> pattern<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it's not a complete pattern as I like to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.040 
it's not a complete pattern as I like to
call<00:00:29.640> them<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.480> all<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> balls

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
call them because not all of the balls

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
call them because not all of the balls
go<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> each<00:00:32.130> position<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:33.090> three

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
go to each position there are three

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.910 
go to each position there are three
distinct<00:00:33.750> positions<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.350> each<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> balls

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
distinct positions and each of the balls

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.459 
distinct positions and each of the balls
stay<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.460> those<00:00:35.550> different<00:00:35.940> positions<00:00:36.469> I'll

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
stay in those different positions I'll

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
stay in those different positions I'll
try<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> show<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.920> what<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.070> mean<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:39.149> unlit

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
try to show you what I mean the unlit

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
try to show you what I mean the unlit
ball<00:00:39.750> right<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> call<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> top

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
ball right now is what I call the top

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.510 
ball right now is what I call the top
position<00:00:42.230> see<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> bring<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.100> put<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
position see I bring it around I put it

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.279 
position see I bring it around I put it
on<00:00:44.579> top<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> ball<00:00:45.149> pop<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.809> bring<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.200> on

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
on top of the ball pop it up bring it on

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.500 
on top of the ball pop it up bring it on
out<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> other<00:00:46.680> ball<00:00:47.000> that's<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> does

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
out of the other ball that's all it does

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
out of the other ball that's all it does
the<00:00:49.379> two<00:00:49.530> balls<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> bottom<00:00:50.280> each<00:00:50.730> have

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the two balls on the bottom each have

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.299 
the two balls on the bottom each have
one<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> their<00:00:51.270> sides<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.899> stay<00:00:52.140> on

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
one of their sides and they stay on

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.500 
one of their sides and they stay on
there's<00:00:53.309> sort<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> bottom<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.090> ball<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there's sort of a bottom right ball and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.029 
there's sort of a bottom right ball and
a<00:00:54.539> bottom<00:00:54.780> left<00:00:54.960> ball<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> take

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
a bottom left ball so I'm going to take

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
a bottom left ball so I'm going to take
out<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> top<00:00:56.489> ball<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:57.660> gonna<00:00:57.780> try<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> teach

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
out the top ball I'm gonna try to teach

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.360 
out the top ball I'm gonna try to teach
you<00:00:58.289> step<00:00:58.500> by<00:00:58.530> step<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
you step by step what to do with the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.979 
you step by step what to do with the
bottom<00:00:59.640> two<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.300> add<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.719> later

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
bottom two and then add that one later

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.360 
bottom two and then add that one later
and<00:01:01.199> hopefully<00:01:01.500> it'll<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.829> come<00:01:01.859> together

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and hopefully it'll all come together

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.799 
and hopefully it'll all come together
all<00:01:02.730> right<00:01:02.820> here's<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> motion<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
all right here's the motion for the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.230 
all right here's the motion for the
bottom<00:01:04.080> two<00:01:04.199> balls

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 

it's<00:01:09.810> pretty<00:01:10.170> awkward<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.280> try

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it's pretty awkward so I'm going to try

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.950 
it's pretty awkward so I'm going to try
to<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.580> slow<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.510> sure<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.840> can

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
to go slow on this and make sure you can

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
to go slow on this and make sure you can
follow<00:01:13.110> me<00:01:13.350> start<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
follow me start out with two of the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.330 
follow me start out with two of the
bowls<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.750> strong<00:01:15.990> hand<00:01:16.159> now<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.220> going

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
bowls in your strong hand now I'm going

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.380 
bowls in your strong hand now I'm going
to<00:01:17.400> start<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.670> almost<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.300> just

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to start out almost like you're just

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.990 
to start out almost like you're just
going<00:01:18.659> normal<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.590> hand<00:01:19.800> but<00:01:20.760> on<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
going normal to in one hand but on the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.609 
going normal to in one hand but on the
first<00:01:21.210> throw<00:01:21.540> you're<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> follow<00:01:22.380> with

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
first throw you're going to follow with

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.160 
first throw you're going to follow with
your<00:01:22.740> left<00:01:22.979> hand<00:01:23.420> above<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.690> first<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.049> all

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
your left hand above that first of all

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.320 
your left hand above that first of all
so<00:01:25.440> we're<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.800> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.159> this

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
so we're going to go kind of like this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.770 
so we're going to go kind of like this
follow<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.479> around<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:29.479> now<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> do

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
follow it around and down now if you do

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450 
follow it around and down now if you do
this<00:01:30.899> right<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.590> second<00:01:31.920> bubble<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.250> throat

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
this right the second bubble your throat

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550 
this right the second bubble your throat

catch<00:04:54.940> both<00:04:55.120> at<00:04:55.240> once<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.930> then<00:04:56.020> you<00:04:56.080> end<00:04:56.229> up

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
catch both at once and then you end up

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.680 
catch both at once and then you end up
doing<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.490> same<00:04:57.520> things<00:04:57.910> before<00:04:58.300> but

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
doing the same things before but

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.589 
doing the same things before but
backwards

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.369 

and<00:05:06.279> that's<00:05:07.279> what<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.550> should<00:05:07.669> look<00:05:07.699> like<00:05:07.819> I

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
and that's what it should look like I

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.419 
and that's what it should look like I
really<00:05:09.379> hope<00:05:09.499> you<00:05:09.649> can<00:05:09.679> figure<00:05:09.889> that<00:05:10.009> because

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:10.429 
really hope you can figure that because

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:11.829 
really hope you can figure that because
I'm<00:05:10.669> getting<00:05:10.879> confused<00:05:11.149> just<00:05:11.300> talking<00:05:11.719> about

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:11.839 
I'm getting confused just talking about

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.859 
I'm getting confused just talking about
it<00:05:12.050> much<00:05:12.439> less<00:05:12.619> doing<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.300> but<00:05:14.300> just<00:05:14.330> remember

00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:14.869 
it much less doing it but just remember

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:17.139 
it much less doing it but just remember
both<00:05:15.349> balls<00:05:15.619> stand<00:05:16.159> their<00:05:16.429> own<00:05:16.550> size<00:05:16.819> they

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:17.149 
both balls stand their own size they

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:19.600 
both balls stand their own size they
don't<00:05:17.300> really<00:05:17.449> cross<00:05:17.629> over<00:05:17.959> and<00:05:18.429> every<00:05:19.429> time

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
don't really cross over and every time

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.649 
don't really cross over and every time
you<00:05:19.699> throw<00:05:19.819> a<00:05:19.909> ball<00:05:20.089> it<00:05:20.209> should<00:05:20.360> be<00:05:20.449> calling

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
you throw a ball it should be calling

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.719 
you throw a ball it should be calling
straight<00:05:21.139> and<00:05:21.409> you're<00:05:22.309> carrying<00:05:22.490> around<00:05:22.610> a

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
straight and you're carrying around a

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.189 
straight and you're carrying around a
little<00:05:22.849> circle<00:05:23.240> do<00:05:23.479> another<00:05:23.629> column<00:05:23.959> straight

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
little circle do another column straight

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.439 
little circle do another column straight
so<00:05:24.800> see<00:05:25.429> if<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.610> can<00:05:25.759> do<00:05:25.849> it<00:05:25.939> again<00:05:26.089> for<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:26.360> real

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
so see if I can do it again for you real

so see if I can do it again for you real
quick<00:05:26.479> I'll<00:05:26.749> try<00:05:26.929> to<00:05:26.990> do<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.139> in<00:05:27.229> slow<00:05:27.379> motion

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.760 

all<00:05:56.120> right<00:05:56.240> here<00:05:56.629> comes<00:05:56.840> that<00:05:57.050> third<00:05:57.289> ball<00:05:57.530> now

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
all right here comes that third ball now

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.529 
all right here comes that third ball now
the<00:05:57.979> top<00:05:58.280> ball<00:05:58.490> you're<00:05:59.060> going<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.240> start<00:05:59.419> out

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
the top ball you're going to start out

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.270 
the top ball you're going to start out
again<00:05:59.780> two<00:06:00.439> balls<00:06:00.620> in<00:06:00.710> your<00:06:00.800> right<00:06:00.919> hand<00:06:00.949> and

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
again two balls in your right hand and

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.559 
again two balls in your right hand and
the<00:06:01.520> top<00:06:01.699> ball<00:06:01.909> is<00:06:02.000> going<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.180> be<00:06:02.240> in<00:06:02.300> your<00:06:02.360> left

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
the top ball is going to be in your left

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.390 
the top ball is going to be in your left
hand<00:06:02.750> so<00:06:03.530> of<00:06:03.620> course<00:06:03.860> instead<00:06:04.159> of<00:06:04.280> just

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
hand so of course instead of just

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.249 
hand so of course instead of just
following<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:05.150> first<00:06:05.360> throw<00:06:05.629> empty<00:06:05.870> handed

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
following the first throw empty handed

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.300 
following the first throw empty handed
you're<00:06:06.409> going<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:06.590> carry<00:06:06.770> this<00:06:06.919> one<00:06:07.039> around

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
you're going to carry this one around

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.450 
you're going to carry this one around
and<00:06:07.610> follow<00:06:08.150> it<00:06:08.330> just<00:06:08.629> like<00:06:08.750> that

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
and follow it just like that

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.709 
and follow it just like that
so<00:06:10.460> it's<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.669> same<00:06:10.789> as<00:06:10.909> before<00:06:11.000> but<00:06:11.389> now

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
so it's the same as before but now

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.300 
so it's the same as before but now
there's<00:06:11.930> an<00:06:12.020> added<00:06:12.289> element<00:06:12.469> of<00:06:12.860> confusion

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
there's an added element of confusion

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.409 
there's an added element of confusion
when<00:06:13.430> you're<00:06:13.520> trying<00:06:13.699> to<00:06:13.819> catch<00:06:13.969> both<00:06:14.150> balls

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
when you're trying to catch both balls

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.209 
when you're trying to catch both balls
at<00:06:14.569> once<00:06:14.750> you<00:06:15.439> got<00:06:15.560> to<00:06:15.650> get<00:06:15.770> rid<00:06:15.860> of<00:06:15.919> this<00:06:16.009> top

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
at once you got to get rid of this top

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.899 
at once you got to get rid of this top
ball<00:06:17.379> so<00:06:18.379> when<00:06:19.189> you're<00:06:19.310> doing<00:06:19.430> this<00:06:19.639> exchange

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
ball so when you're doing this exchange

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.119 
ball so when you're doing this exchange
over<00:06:20.270> here<00:06:20.560> instead<00:06:21.560> of<00:06:21.650> just<00:06:21.740> going<00:06:21.949> like

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
over here instead of just going like

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:23.770 
over here instead of just going like
that<00:06:22.189> you<00:06:22.879> have<00:06:23.000> to<00:06:23.120> get<00:06:23.240> rid<00:06:23.360> of<00:06:23.419> this<00:06:23.539> one<00:06:23.689> the

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
that you have to get rid of this one the

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.100 
that you have to get rid of this one the
same<00:06:23.930> time<00:06:24.789> so<00:06:25.789> this<00:06:26.030> is<00:06:26.180> where<00:06:26.360> remember<00:06:26.990> when

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
same time so this is where remember when

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.180 
same time so this is where remember when
I<00:06:27.169> told<00:06:27.229> you<00:06:27.439> you<00:06:27.530> have<00:06:27.620> to<00:06:27.680> try<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:27.889> pretend

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
I told you you have to try to pretend

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
I told you you have to try to pretend
both<00:06:28.430> of<00:06:28.550> them<00:06:28.639> are<00:06:28.699> going<00:06:28.789> to<00:06:28.849> go<00:06:28.940> back<00:06:29.090> up

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
both of them are going to go back up

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.300 
both of them are going to go back up
again<00:06:29.300> you<00:06:29.629> actually<00:06:30.560> do<00:06:30.650> have<00:06:30.680> to<00:06:30.860> go<00:06:31.009> up<00:06:31.129> to

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
again you actually do have to go up to

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.700 
again you actually do have to go up to
throw<00:06:31.520> this<00:06:31.669> top<00:06:31.909> ball<00:06:32.090> upwards<00:06:32.479> so<00:06:33.409> you<00:06:33.469> throw

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
throw this top ball upwards so you throw

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.170 
throw this top ball upwards so you throw
both<00:06:33.919> of<00:06:33.949> them<00:06:34.159> up<00:06:34.280> come<00:06:34.669> back<00:06:34.699> down<00:06:34.819> to<00:06:35.030> catch

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
both of them up come back down to catch

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.950 
both of them up come back down to catch
the<00:06:35.270> botton<00:06:35.509> one<00:06:36.909> it's<00:06:37.909> a<00:06:38.120> very<00:06:38.360> difficult

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
the botton one it's a very difficult

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.529 
the botton one it's a very difficult
maneuver<00:06:39.560> to<00:06:39.650> master<00:06:40.330> starting<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:41.389> middle

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539 
maneuver to master starting the middle

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.540 
maneuver to master starting the middle
of<00:06:41.599> a<00:06:41.629> pattern<00:06:41.960> but<00:06:42.409> that's<00:06:43.099> what<00:06:43.250> you<00:06:43.340> have<00:06:43.430> to

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
of a pattern but that's what you have to

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.029 
of a pattern but that's what you have to
end<00:06:43.699> up<00:06:43.759> doing<00:06:43.940> so<00:06:44.930> follow<00:06:45.259> it<00:06:45.349> around<00:06:45.620> throw

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 
end up doing so follow it around throw

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:52.669 
end up doing so follow it around throw
up<00:06:47.949> sorry<00:06:48.949> buddy<00:06:49.210> all<00:06:50.210> right

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:52.679 

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.199 

now<00:06:53.679> that<00:06:54.309> top<00:06:54.549> ball<00:06:54.729> is<00:06:54.819> going<00:06:54.939> to<00:06:54.999> hang<00:06:55.119> in

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:55.209 
now that top ball is going to hang in

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:57.209 
now that top ball is going to hang in
the<00:06:55.269> air<00:06:55.299> first<00:06:55.569> I<00:06:55.719> think<00:06:55.929> while<00:06:56.859> you're<00:06:57.129> in

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
the air first I think while you're in

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.429 
the air first I think while you're in
this<00:06:57.339> cross<00:06:57.579> guard<00:06:57.789> position<00:06:58.149> and<00:06:59.079> you're

00:06:59.429 --> 00:06:59.439 
this cross guard position and you're

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:00.569 
this cross guard position and you're
going<00:06:59.559> to<00:06:59.589> do<00:06:59.679> just<00:06:59.859> like<00:06:59.919> before<00:07:00.099> throw<00:07:00.519> up

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:00.579 
going to do just like before throw up

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:01.949 
going to do just like before throw up
this<00:07:00.699> column<00:07:00.939> carry<00:07:01.449> your<00:07:01.569> left<00:07:01.719> hand<00:07:01.869> around

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:01.959

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 
this pattern because it is awkward you

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:35.969 
this pattern because it is awkward you
have<00:07:34.719> to<00:07:34.809> catch<00:07:34.929> both<00:07:35.139> bolts<00:07:35.439> at<00:07:35.529> once<00:07:35.679> to<00:07:35.860> do

all<00:07:36.099> this

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:36.459 
all this

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.369 
all this
tons<00:07:37.059> of<00:07:37.179> stuff<00:07:37.360> before<00:07:37.719> you<00:07:37.749> catch<00:07:37.959> that<00:07:38.139> top

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:38.379 
tons of stuff before you catch that top

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:40.889 
tons of stuff before you catch that top
one<00:07:38.529> again<00:07:38.969> the<00:07:39.969> most<00:07:40.209> important<00:07:40.689> thing<00:07:40.809> you

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:40.899 
one again the most important thing you

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.369 
one again the most important thing you
can<00:07:41.049> really<00:07:41.199> pay<00:07:41.409> attention<00:07:41.439> to<00:07:41.949> is<00:07:43.139> this<00:07:44.139> part

can really pay attention to is this part

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:47.249 
can really pay attention to is this part
if<00:07:44.709> you<00:07:45.399> don't<00:07:45.669> throw<00:07:45.939> this<00:07:46.419> ball<00:07:46.749> high<00:07:46.989> enough

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:47.259 
if you don't throw this ball high enough

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:48.929 
if you don't throw this ball high enough
when<00:07:47.709> you<00:07:47.769> go<00:07:47.860> like<00:07:48.009> that<00:07:48.039> you're<00:07:48.699> not<00:07:48.819> going

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:48.939 
when you go like that you're not going

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.129 
when you go like that you're not going
to<00:07:49.029> have<00:07:49.119> enough<00:07:49.299> time<00:07:49.449> to<00:07:49.659> complete<00:07:49.719> the<00:07:49.989> rest

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139 
to have enough time to complete the rest

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:52.109 
to have enough time to complete the rest
of<00:07:50.229> the<00:07:50.289> pattern<00:07:50.409> so<00:07:51.159> try<00:07:51.429> to<00:07:51.459> make<00:07:51.669> sure<00:07:51.819> the

00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:52.119 
of the pattern so try to make sure the

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:53.759 
of the pattern so try to make sure the
when<00:07:52.239> you<00:07:52.329> come<00:07:52.479> down<00:07:52.509> you<00:07:52.929> really<00:07:53.139> do<00:07:53.529> it<00:07:53.619> some

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:53.769 
when you come down you really do it some

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:56.399 
when you come down you really do it some
lift<00:07:54.009> and<00:07:54.719> get<00:07:55.719> it<00:07:55.839> up<00:07:55.929> high<00:07:56.049> enough<00:07:56.079> so<00:07:56.289> you

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:56.409 
lift and get it up high enough so you

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.619 
lift and get it up high enough so you
have<00:07:56.499> enough<00:07:56.679> time<00:07:56.709> your<00:07:57.669> hand<00:07:57.939> on<00:07:58.149> top<00:07:58.209> should

00:07:58.619 --> 00:07:58.629 
have enough time your hand on top should

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:00.359 
have enough time your hand on top should
remain<00:07:58.929> palm<00:07:59.289> down<00:07:59.499> the<00:07:59.649> whole<00:07:59.799> time<00:07:59.979> so<00:08:00.039> it's

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:00.369 
remain palm down the whole time so it's

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:02.909 
remain palm down the whole time so it's
kind<00:08:00.549> of<00:08:00.579> a<00:08:00.669> weird<00:08:00.789> throw<00:08:01.589> but<00:08:02.589> that's<00:08:02.769> what's

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 
kind of a weird throw but that's what's

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:06.659 
kind of a weird throw but that's what's
got<00:08:03.069> to<00:08:03.159> be<00:08:03.189> done<00:08:03.249> I<00:08:03.639> hope<00:08:04.239> that<00:08:04.449> helps
