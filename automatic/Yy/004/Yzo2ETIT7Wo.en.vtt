00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
alive after you had some mice where this

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.370 
alive after you had some mice where this
is<00:02:09.729> too<00:02:09.910> rough<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.960> is<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.230> about<00:02:11.290> perfect

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.300 
so when you're having you know long
gaming<00:02:13.569> sessions<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.830> going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.010> slip

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
