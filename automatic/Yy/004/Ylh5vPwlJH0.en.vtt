00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.050 

Joey<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> quest<00:01:34.409> banner<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> see

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
Joey in a quest banner so you can see

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.630 
Joey in a quest banner so you can see
that<00:01:36.110> it's<00:01:37.110> got<00:01:37.259> my<00:01:37.500> name<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> top<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that it's got my name at the top so I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.170 
that it's got my name at the top so I
think<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:40.430> pretty<00:01:41.430> good<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.759> well<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
think that's pretty good as well and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.429 
think that's pretty good as well and
then<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.600> change<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> bus<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.170> time

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
then you can change a bus to the time

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.569 
then you can change a bus to the time
and<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.710> look<00:01:43.950> leave<00:01:44.159> nothing<00:01:44.460> then
