00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.850
 in poker online.it hardly 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.990
 you will find a hotter bubble than 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.730
 that of the sunday million 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.010
 do you want some advice on how 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.430
 play it feel what i have been told 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.430
 our pros 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 we are in the sunday bubble phase 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.450
 million 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.130
 my advice is to start 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 really pushing this maybe it's a 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.810
 advice always valid even in tournaments 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.280
 important indeed especially in tournaments 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.200
 important which ones are the best will be 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.330
 many players who will be but niskers 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.420
 will want to do result 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.100
 maybe qualifications have arrived 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.960
 I can imagine that maybe for many of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.190
 you the same fear do not end up in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.440
 the money but that moment in which 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.900
 we can attack accumulate 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.270
 take advantage and maybe earn some 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.130
 more chance to get to the table 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.990
 final where maybe the pennies are still 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.000
 most important 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 then the bubble to the sunday million I can 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.140
 advise you if I'm at the table 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.880
 surely to always found because ce 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.979
 he will always have it because the bubble is 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.040
 will play its own nikiniki then separately 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.050
 this is definitely aggravating it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.640
 obviously as natural in all 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.670
 tournaments in the bubble because in any case the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.509
 bubble will be 5 600 euros to many people like 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.720
 may and there is no advice 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.759
 particular apart from not playing too many 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.539
 buy in marginal situations clearly 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.369
 how to play the bubble point the bubble is 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.410
 a stage of the tournament that needs to be addressed in 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.259
 based on the chips we have at the table e 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.520
 also based on how much is exposed to go 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.770
 prizes in the tournament we are playing 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.649
 the sunday million at the tournament enough 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.119
 cute and the bubble will be worth hundreds of 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.569
 euros several hundred euros 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.830
 so it's something nice 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.600
 I give a court in chips advice 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.790
 to wait because there are not many 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.440
 long alternatives in chips report 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.950
 respect the same when 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.830
 we see players who are afraid of 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.569
 this bubble that feel the difference 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.760
 between going not going to cash 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.830
 There are situations where we can 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.860
 take that extra dark can do 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.870
 that continuation 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.550
 it bids many situations to the marginal tar 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.400
 you have to be sagacious in finding one 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.530
 bubble is just one of the hot phases 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.650
 let's say the first hot phase of the tournament 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.010
 then attack obviously choose 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.490
 spoto just and to the right 8 and then 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.710
 to assert the weight of the chips of 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.720
 awards hot area plenty in 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.450
 emilia is not clear that it would always be 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.820
 nice to get a lot of you to be able to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.960
 exploit while in the eventuality of 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.230
 get there instead from short stacks and me 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.970
 I don't see it as an impediment to doing 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.580
 certain plays because they are 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.830
 of the opinion that when you play a 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.450
 tournament the bubble must not be a 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.190
 goal but rather a stage 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.080
 intermediate that is the goal to be 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.760
 always the one to go all the way 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.530
 however it is clear that in a tournament 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.480
 as prestigious as the saint emilion like 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.700
 it can be a great tournament for example 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.240
 live and if we have qualified with a few 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.980
 euro or with a few fpp this can 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.690
 can make the difference maybe for the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.550
 our bank roll and therefore it is important 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.920
 go to premium and clear that then in 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.590
 that case we can adopt one 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.510
 more conservative strategy and I said it is 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.950
 clear that we become a target 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.430
 we become a target for others 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.650
 players 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.660
 so this this kind of 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.500
 that is, awareness of what we must have 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.130
 and it can happen that some big stars 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.470
 tend to be branded and therefore will tend to 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.350
 realize with more more frequency on 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.660
 our buy so this can be 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.850
 let's say a weapon we can 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.970
 take advantage of trying to do a double 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.970
 up
