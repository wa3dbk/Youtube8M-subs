00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.360
 hi everyone is welcome on the 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.799
 nonsense shock but she today I 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.680
 invites you to discover the chicken 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.750
 piccata so basically it's a recipe 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.610
 Italian but hey I discovered them 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.110
 in the United States in the restaurants there 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.640
 down so here I tried the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.710
 reproduce and it's really delicious 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.240
 so it's a chicken that's going to be free and 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.310
 then there will be a sauce with some 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.140
 lemon capers butter it's 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.839
 really delicious all the steps in 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.550
 video to start this recipe you 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.010
 go take a big plate and 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.739
 you go place and maizena with 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.430
 Parmesan freshly grated with salt and 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.260
 pepper 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.750
 you're going mix so this is small 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.309
 mixture with a fork and then 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.920
 you have rolled so beautiful 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.899
 chicken schnitzels so really good 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.930
 want to ride well or to impregnate well 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.699
 and then you book we'll go 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.230
 then at cooking you will take 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.269
 a big stove you will do 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.119
 heat olive oil and on a 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.729
 medium-high heat we will brown every 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.979
 face so about 2 3 minutes of 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.110
 each face and then we will cover 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.050
 like that it'll finish cooking and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.399
 you stay tender when the chicken 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.810
 finished leather so that's enough 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.280
 quick seen against cooked anyway at 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.080
 smother it with a lid 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.670
 count 5 6 minutes our accounts the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.619
 cooking is over you will remove 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.530
 the chicken cutlets wanted to book 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.530
 and always on a bright medium fire in the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.270
 same pan we will add the lemon on 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.789
 continue adding the broth of 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.830
 vegetables the capers the piece of butter 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.720
 if you prefer, you can put some 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.000
 the margarine instead you put 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.560
 then salt and pepper and you 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.849
 mix well then there is still a 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.170
 nice little boil so always 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:46.720
 on a medium high fouga 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.599
 but do not put too much 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.459
 of salt because the vegetable broth 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:53.140
 dehydrated already contains a little bit 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.819
 so be careful that it is not too much 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.300
 salty it needs better their room and after 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:00.520
 eventually we put it back in 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.340
 this sauce the chicken cutlets 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.010
 we will add the parsley freshly 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.750
 chased 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.600
 and there you will set fire to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.700
 minimum you put back the lid and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.370
 you will continue cooking another 5 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.960
 minutes after 5 minutes you 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.150
 turn off the fire and there you have left 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.250
 more than serve you draw your 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.840
 plate with the chicken you serve with 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.060
 pasta green beans 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.280
 carrots of rice everything that makes you 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.620
 fun and you pour that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.800
 generously all that sauce capers 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.690
 and it's really delicious here 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.830

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.040
 a lot of ingredients and 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.500
