smaller scale small grains go through

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.450 
smaller scale small grains go through
three<00:00:48.880> stages<00:00:49.270> of<00:00:49.600> ripeness<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.890> milk<00:00:51.130> stage

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
three stages of ripeness the milk stage

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.520 
three stages of ripeness the milk stage
is<00:00:51.820> where<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.149> grains<00:00:52.420> fill<00:00:52.899> with<00:00:53.079> a<00:00:53.110> milky

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
is where the grains fill with a milky

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.470 
is where the grains fill with a milky
liquid<00:00:53.680> that<00:00:54.220> spills<00:00:54.610> out<00:00:54.790> when<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.120> grain<00:00:55.300> is

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
liquid that spills out when the grain is

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.780 
liquid that spills out when the grain is
pinched<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.620> stalks<00:00:56.950> will<00:00:57.250> start<00:00:57.550> turning

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
pinched the stalks will start turning

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.569 
pinched the stalks will start turning
from<00:00:58.270> green<00:00:58.329> to<00:00:58.960> yellow<00:00:59.190> then<00:01:00.190> there's<00:01:00.399> the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
from green to yellow then there's the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.209 
from green to yellow then there's the
dough<00:01:00.790> stage<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.899> grain<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.320> harder<00:01:02.739> but

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
dough stage the grain is harder but

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.249 
dough stage the grain is harder but
still<00:01:03.460> easy<00:01:03.969> to<00:01:04.149> dent<00:01:04.509> with<00:01:04.659> your<00:01:04.780> fingernail

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
still easy to dent with your fingernail

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.100 
still easy to dent with your fingernail
then<00:01:05.829> there<00:01:06.009> is<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.250> mature<00:01:06.610> stage<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.840> grain

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
then there is the mature stage the grain

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.990 
then there is the mature stage the grain
cannot<00:01:08.680> be<00:01:08.860> dented<00:01:09.219> with<00:01:09.369> your<00:01:09.520> fingernail

many<00:01:17.770> farmers<00:01:18.130> recommend<00:01:18.700> harvesting<00:01:19.420> in<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
many farmers recommend harvesting in the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.929 
many farmers recommend harvesting in the
late<00:01:19.959> dough<00:01:20.289> stage<00:01:20.709> then<00:01:21.520> they<00:01:21.670> allow<00:01:21.880> the

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
late dough stage then they allow the

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.819 
late dough stage then they allow the
grain<00:01:22.209> to<00:01:22.389> dry<00:01:22.630> which<00:01:23.020> makes<00:01:23.319> for<00:01:23.529> the<00:01:23.590> best

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829
