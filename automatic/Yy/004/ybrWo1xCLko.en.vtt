already done a mod on this which was
very<00:01:29.579> very<00:01:29.850> popular<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.240> video<00:01:30.420> much<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.689> had

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
very very popular the video much I had

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.980 
very very popular the video much I had
and<00:01:31.340> it's<00:01:32.340> slightly<00:01:32.700> changed<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.240> before<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and it's slightly changed now before you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.890 
and it's slightly changed now before you
casted<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.799> lasted<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.189> 30<00:01:35.900> however

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
casted it and it lasted about 30 however

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.069 
casted it and it lasted about 30 however
now<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:38.040> cast<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.610> he<00:01:39.270> lasts<00:01:39.450> forever<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
now you cast it he lasts forever and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
now you cast it he lasts forever and
then<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> cast<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> again<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> turn<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> off<00:01:41.520> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
then you cast it again to turn it off so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
then you cast it again to turn it off so
it's<00:01:41.970> incredibly<00:01:42.659> useful<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.170> much<00:01:43.740> better

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it's incredibly useful when much better

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
it's incredibly useful when much better
it's<00:01:44.610> much<00:01:44.759> better<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.270> general<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> lot

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
