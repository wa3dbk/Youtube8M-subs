anything<00:00:00.719> higher<00:00:00.840> than<00:00:00.900> that<00:00:01.260> then<00:00:01.920> you're

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
anything higher than that then you're

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.100 
anything higher than that then you're
running<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.460> risk<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.300> actual<00:00:03.720> server

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
running the risk of the actual server

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.680 
running the risk of the actual server
that<00:00:04.680> you're<00:00:04.830> streaming<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.400> not<00:00:06.150> accepting

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
that you're streaming to not accepting

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.059 
that you're streaming to not accepting
that<00:00:06.810> fast<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.259> connection<00:00:07.470> unless<00:00:07.770> you're

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
that fast of a connection unless you're

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.500 
that fast of a connection unless you're
probably<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.429> partner<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:09.030> them<00:00:09.120> like<00:00:09.330> on

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
probably a partner with them like on

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.459 
probably a partner with them like on
justin.tv<00:00:09.900> around<00:00:11.480> so<00:00:12.480> if<00:00:12.840> you're<00:00:13.170> just

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
justin.tv around so if you're just

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.560 
justin.tv around so if you're just
starting<00:00:13.590> streaming<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> 2

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
starting streaming and you have a 2

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.830 
starting streaming and you have a 2
megabit<00:00:16.020> upload<00:00:16.379> try<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.150> 1300<00:00:18.150> bit<00:00:18.330> rate<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
megabit upload try a 1300 bit rate and a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.670 
megabit upload try a 1300 bit rate and a
1300<00:00:19.650> buffer<00:00:20.330> and<00:00:21.330> see<00:00:21.810> how<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.020> works<00:00:22.410> if

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
1300 buffer and see how that works if

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.429 
1300 buffer and see how that works if
you<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.100> higher<00:00:23.400> than<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.210> have

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
you have higher than that if you have

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.550 
you have higher than that if you have
fios<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.949> fiber<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.760> home<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.470> you<00:00:28.470> have

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
fios or fiber to the home and you have

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.040 
fios or fiber to the home and you have
like<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> 20<00:00:28.920> megabit<00:00:29.429> upload<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.179> set<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.840> at

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
like a 20 megabit upload then set it at

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
like a 20 megabit upload then set it at
2,000<00:00:31.740> bit<00:00:31.890> rate<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.309> 2000<00:00:32.910> buffer<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.300> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
2,000 bit rate and 2000 buffer this is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.510 
2,000 bit rate and 2000 buffer this is
just<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.719> start<00:00:34.020> off<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.920> tweak<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> later

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
just a start off you can tweak it later

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940 
just a start off you can tweak it later
you<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.880> lower<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> put<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> higher

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you can lower it you can put it higher

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.450 
you can lower it you can put it higher
it's<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.020> suggest<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.070> going

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's up to you but I suggest not going

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.540 
it's up to you but I suggest not going
over<00:00:41.730> 2,000<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.840> first<00:00:43.140> stream<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
over 2,000 on your first stream just to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
over 2,000 on your first stream just to
get<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> stream<00:00:45.059> working<00:00:45.510> without<00:00:45.809> lag<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
get the stream working without lag and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
get the stream working without lag and
then<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.890> start<00:00:47.129> messing<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> both

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
then you can start messing with it both

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.220 
then you can start messing with it both
lowering<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> BVB<00:00:50.100> buffer<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.230> increasing

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
lowering the BVB buffer and increasing

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.950 
lowering the BVB buffer and increasing
the<00:00:52.320> actual<00:00:52.620> bitrate<00:00:53.239> now<00:00:54.239> under<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the actual bitrate now under that is the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
the actual bitrate now under that is the
resolution<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> default<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.390> just

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
resolution this is the default I just

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.819 
resolution this is the default I just
leave<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.780> default<00:00:58.079> stage<00:00:58.320> resolution

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
leave it on default stage resolution

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.500 
leave it on default stage resolution
this<00:00:58.949> basically<00:00:59.609> means<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.030> default

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
this basically means the default

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
this basically means the default
resolution<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> said<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.739> justin.tv

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
resolution that you said in justin.tv

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.870 
resolution that you said in justin.tv
which<00:01:03.210> we'll<00:01:03.390> talk<00:01:03.420> about<00:01:03.660> after<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.880> audio

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
which we'll talk about after this audio

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.719 
which we'll talk about after this audio
encoding<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.530> there's<00:01:07.530> various<00:01:07.920> different

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
encoding now there's various different

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.030 
encoding now there's various different
formats<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.780> audio<00:01:10.020> encoding<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.890> not

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
formats for audio encoding you're not

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.109 
formats for audio encoding you're not
going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> need<00:01:11.369> stereo<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.670> set<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
going to need stereo you can set it to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
going to need stereo you can set it to
stereo<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> keep<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:16.979> mono

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
stereo if you want but I keep it on mono

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.200 
stereo if you want but I keep it on mono
and<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:18.119> put<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> 44<00:01:19.710> dot<00:01:20.340> 100<00:01:20.909> kilohertz

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and I put it to 44 dot 100 kilohertz

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
and I put it to 44 dot 100 kilohertz
16-bit<00:01:22.170> mono<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.880> audio<00:01:24.270> encoding

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
16-bit mono and then the audio encoding

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.740 
16-bit mono and then the audio encoding
bitrate<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.070> 3200<00:01:26.070> alright<00:01:26.970> should<00:01:27.570> say

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
bitrate is 3200 alright should say

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.840 
bitrate is 3200 alright should say
32,000<00:01:28.619> that's<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.610> low<00:01:29.880> quality<00:01:30.150> audio

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
32,000 that's pretty low quality audio

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.679 
32,000 that's pretty low quality audio
but<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> reason<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.960> save

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
but the reason I do that is to save

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.109 
but the reason I do that is to save
upload<00:01:36.689> speed<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.439> my<00:01:37.590> actual<00:01:37.979> video<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
upload speed for my actual video if you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.760 
upload speed for my actual video if you
want<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.900> enough<00:01:40.140> upload<00:01:40.470> speed

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
want if you have enough upload speed

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.960 
want if you have enough upload speed
like<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.009> said<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.340> working<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.729> fiber

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
like I said if you're working on fiber

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.330 
like I said if you're working on fiber
optics<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.530> having<00:01:43.770> any<00:01:43.890> problem

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
optics and you're not having any problem

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.740 
optics and you're not having any problem
and<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:44.520> streaming<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:44.880> 2,000<00:01:45.509> yet<00:01:45.630> your

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and you're streaming at 2,000 yet your

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.560 
and you're streaming at 2,000 yet your
bitrate<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.350> 20<00:01:46.770> megabits<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.420> set

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
bitrate is 20 megabits then you can set

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
bitrate is 20 megabits then you can set
that<00:01:48.720> higher<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.259> set<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.390> 64,000<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that higher you can set it to 64,000 you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.590 
that higher you can set it to 64,000 you
could<00:01:51.600> sit<00:01:52.130> 128,000<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.579> higher<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.299> bitrate

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
could sit 128,000 the higher the bitrate

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840 
could sit 128,000 the higher the bitrate
of<00:01:54.780> your<00:01:55.079> audio<00:01:55.409> encoding<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.579> better

that's<00:02:38.970> basically<00:02:39.450> everything<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.020> how

you configure the channel it's very easy

it's not difficult at all if you have

you and next we're going to talk about

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.450 
you and next we're going to talk about
resolution<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:52.020> mean<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.710> but<00:02:52.980> wraps<00:02:53.250> up

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
resolution and I mean that but wraps up

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.390 
resolution and I mean that but wraps up
setting<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.300> actual<00:02:54.540> xsplit<00:02:55.050> client<00:02:55.440> okay

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
setting up the actual xsplit client okay

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.280 
setting up the actual xsplit client okay
now<00:02:56.580> we're<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.850> talk<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.290> resolution

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
now we're going to talk about resolution

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.440 
now we're going to talk about resolution
before<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.490> talk<00:02:59.670> about<00:02:59.820> resolution<00:03:00.330> I'm

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
before we talk about resolution I'm

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.260 
before we talk about resolution I'm
going<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> stress<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.380> once<00:03:01.650> again<00:03:01.920> unless

going to stress this once again unless

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.870 
going to stress this once again unless
you<00:03:03.270> have<00:03:03.540> at<00:03:03.900> least<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.620> 2<00:03:04.980> megabit<00:03:05.490> upload

you have at least a 2 megabit upload
don't<00:03:06.720> try<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.050> stream<00:03:07.470> at<00:03:07.770> 720p<00:03:08.610> and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
don't try to stream at 720p and

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.440 
don't try to stream at 720p and
especially<00:03:09.540> not<00:03:09.870> 1080p<00:03:11.120> because<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.240> need

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
especially not 1080p because you need

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.880 
especially not 1080p because you need

bitrate to stream it an HD resolution
and<00:03:19.560> even<00:03:20.130> then<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.580> get<00:03:21.209> some<00:03:21.420> issues<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.470> if

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
and even then you get some issues so if

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.640 
and even then you get some issues so if
you<00:03:23.100> have<00:03:23.400> for<00:03:23.820> example<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:24.330> 1.5<00:03:25.050> megabit

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
you have for example a 1.5 megabit

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.060 
you have for example a 1.5 megabit
upload<00:03:25.980> or<00:03:26.520> 1<00:03:26.970> megabit<00:03:27.360> upload<00:03:27.890> stream<00:03:28.890> at<00:03:29.040> a

lower resolution than 720p it doesn't

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.770 
lower resolution than 720p it doesn't
mean<00:03:31.860> your<00:03:31.980> stream<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.400> look<00:03:32.489> bad

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
mean your stream is going to look bad

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.199 
mean your stream is going to look bad
your<00:03:33.780> stream<00:03:34.020> could<00:03:34.170> still<00:03:34.380> look<00:03:34.470> good<00:03:35.209> it

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
your stream could still look good it

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.479 
your stream could still look good it
just<00:03:36.570> means<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.800> won't<00:03:37.980> be<00:03:38.160> able<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.400> do

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
just means that you won't be able to do

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.880 
just means that you won't be able to do
it<00:03:38.520> at<00:03:38.670> 720p<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.600> if<00:03:40.200> they<00:03:40.350> decide<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> make

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
it at 720p and if they decide to make

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.470 
it at 720p and if they decide to make
your<00:03:41.070> stream<00:03:41.280> full<00:03:41.489> screen<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.209> will<00:03:42.300> be<00:03:42.450> a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
your stream full screen it will be a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.449 
your stream full screen it will be a
little<00:03:42.660> bit<00:03:42.870> less<00:03:43.050> quality<00:03:43.440> but<00:03:43.739> most<00:03:44.040> people

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
little bit less quality but most people

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.740 
little bit less quality but most people
don't<00:03:44.489> do<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.910> they<00:03:45.150> watch<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.570> at<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
don't do that they watch it at the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.770 
don't do that they watch it at the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
640 by 480 854 x or yeah a 54 x 480 and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.600 
640 by 480 854 x or yeah a 54 x 480 and
then<00:04:34.910> I<00:04:35.030> picked<00:04:35.300> 1280<00:04:35.870> by<00:04:36.110> 720<00:04:36.560> which<00:04:36.950> is<00:04:37.100> 720p

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
then I picked 1280 by 720 which is 720p

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.030 
then I picked 1280 by 720 which is 720p
in<00:04:38.470> 1920<00:04:39.470> x<00:04:39.950> 1080<00:04:40.400> which<00:04:41.120> is<00:04:41.270> 1080p<00:04:42.310> then<00:04:43.310> those

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
in 1920 x 1080 which is 1080p then those

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.760 
in 1920 x 1080 which is 1080p then those
display<00:04:46.040> in<00:04:46.250> view<00:04:46.670> resolution<00:04:47.630> now<00:04:48.530> that's

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
for example I'm local recording so I've

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.740 
for example I'm local recording so I've
selected<00:04:59.380> 1080p<00:05:00.380> when<00:05:01.130> i<00:05:01.160> stream<00:05:01.610> i<00:05:02.000> select

selected 1080p when i stream i select

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.000 
selected 1080p when i stream i select
720p<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:05.060> make<00:05:05.330> sure<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.540> do<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.110> set<00:05:06.890> it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
720p so make sure to do that and set it

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.150

up before you stream if you want to
stream<00:05:10.310> at<00:05:10.430> 720p<00:05:10.880> like<00:05:11.720> i<00:05:11.870> said<00:05:11.930> select<00:05:12.620> 720p

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.370 
if you want to stream lower quality than

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
that then select that resolution there's

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.200 
that then select that resolution there's
nothing<00:05:18.770> wrong<00:05:18.890> with<00:05:18.950> streaming<00:05:19.730> lower<00:05:20.030> than

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
nothing wrong with streaming lower than

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.360 
nothing wrong with streaming lower than
720p<00:05:21.280> if<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.790> can't<00:05:24.010> because<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.130> don't<00:05:25.310> want

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
720p if you can't because you don't want

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
to start messing around and having tons

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.540 
to start messing around and having tons
of<00:05:26.900> problems<00:05:27.050> with<00:05:27.260> lag<00:05:27.590> on<00:05:27.830> your<00:05:27.980> stream<00:05:28.220> and

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
of problems with lag on your stream and

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.240 
of problems with lag on your stream and
and<00:05:28.670> people<00:05:29.450> won't<00:05:29.600> watch<00:05:29.810> it<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.830> it's<00:05:30.980> better

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
and people won't watch it so it's better

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.720 
and people won't watch it so it's better
to<00:05:31.430> get<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.670> stream<00:05:31.940> running<00:05:32.950> smoothly<00:05:33.950> than

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
to get the stream running smoothly than

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.940 
to get the stream running smoothly than
to<00:05:34.940> do<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.090> high<00:05:35.330> quality<00:05:35.530> so<00:05:36.530> if<00:05:36.620> you<00:05:36.710> can<00:05:36.830> get

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
to do a high quality so if you can get

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.290 
to do a high quality so if you can get
it<00:05:37.040> running<00:05:37.130> smoother<00:05:37.820> at<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.060> lower

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
it running smoother at a lower

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.060 
it running smoother at a lower
resolution<00:05:38.570> then<00:05:39.230> you<00:05:39.320> can<00:05:39.470> slowly<00:05:39.710> work<00:05:40.040> your

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
resolution then you can slowly work your

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.680 
resolution then you can slowly work your
way<00:05:40.310> up<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.640> see<00:05:40.790> what<00:05:40.940> type<00:05:41.090> of<00:05:41.120> resolutions

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
way up to see what type of resolutions

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.230 
way up to see what type of resolutions
at<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.530> should<00:05:42.710> be<00:05:42.800> messing<00:05:42.980> with<00:05:43.240> and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
at you you should be messing with and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.100 
at you you should be messing with and
that's<00:05:44.420> basically<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:45.020> that's<00:05:45.590> configuring

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
that's basically it that's configuring

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.710 
that's basically it that's configuring
xsplit<00:05:48.110> to<00:05:48.500> get<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:49.490> actually<00:05:49.580> stream<00:05:50.240> there's

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
xsplit to get to actually stream there's

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.530 
xsplit to get to actually stream there's
a<00:05:50.780> little<00:05:50.930> bit<00:05:51.080> more<00:05:51.260> options<00:05:51.680> a<00:05:51.830> game<00:05:52.070> source

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540

point<00:05:56.870> i<00:05:56.900> want<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.200> put<00:05:57.980> across<00:05:58.250> is<00:05:58.550> you<00:05:59.360> have

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
point i want to put across is you have

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.710 
point i want to put across is you have
to<00:05:59.780> stream<00:06:00.050> in<00:06:00.170> windowed<00:06:00.470> mode<00:06:00.650> using<00:06:01.040> xsplit

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
to stream in windowed mode using xsplit

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.070 
to stream in windowed mode using xsplit
now<00:06:03.880> you<00:06:04.880> can<00:06:05.030> get<00:06:05.180> around<00:06:05.420> that<00:06:05.570> using<00:06:05.870> game

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
now you can get around that using game

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.870 
now you can get around that using game
source<00:06:06.410> now<00:06:06.920> what<00:06:07.040> game<00:06:07.250> source<00:06:07.490> allows<00:06:07.730> you

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
source now what game source allows you

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.910 
source now what game source allows you
to<00:06:08.000> do<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.390> allows<00:06:08.720> you<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:08.930> scream<00:06:09.200> a<00:06:09.320> stream

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
to do is allows you to scream a stream

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.920 
to do is allows you to scream a stream
at<00:06:10.100> full<00:06:10.340> screen<00:06:10.700> but<00:06:10.970> it's<00:06:11.090> very<00:06:11.210> buggy<00:06:11.570> and

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
at full screen but it's very buggy and

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.000 
at full screen but it's very buggy and
it's<00:06:12.110> in<00:06:12.260> beta<00:06:12.410> right<00:06:12.560> now<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:12.890> i<00:06:12.980> don't

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
it's in beta right now and i don't

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.690 
it's in beta right now and i don't
suggest<00:06:13.340> using<00:06:13.700> it<00:06:14.050> so<00:06:15.050> if<00:06:16.040> you're<00:06:16.280> ever<00:06:16.430> going

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
suggest using it so if you're ever going

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.570 
suggest using it so if you're ever going
to<00:06:16.760> stream<00:06:17.420> make<00:06:17.780> sure<00:06:17.810> to<00:06:17.990> set<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.800> game

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
to stream make sure to set the game

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.490 
to stream make sure to set the game
you're<00:06:19.730> streaming<00:06:20.000> at<00:06:20.210> into<00:06:20.870> windowed<00:06:21.320> mode

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
you're streaming at into windowed mode

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.790 
you're streaming at into windowed mode
or<00:06:21.880> borderless<00:06:22.880> window<00:06:23.240> mode<00:06:23.740> that<00:06:24.740> will

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
or borderless window mode that will

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.500 
or borderless window mode that will
allow<00:06:25.160> the<00:06:25.220> actual<00:06:25.640> screen<00:06:25.940> capture<00:06:26.390> to

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
allow the actual screen capture to

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.510 
allow the actual screen capture to
happen<00:06:26.870> if<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.410> don't<00:06:27.710> then<00:06:28.070> it's<00:06:28.220> just<00:06:28.340> going

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
happen if you don't then it's just going

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.900 
happen if you don't then it's just going
to<00:06:28.550> be<00:06:28.640> a<00:06:28.730> black<00:06:28.970> screen<00:06:30.340> now<00:06:31.340> there<00:06:31.550> is<00:06:31.670> a<00:06:31.700> way

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
to be a black screen now there is a way

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.030 
to be a black screen now there is a way
around<00:06:32.060> it<00:06:32.360> there<00:06:32.510> is<00:06:32.630> a<00:06:32.660> way<00:06:33.050> to<00:06:33.080> stream<00:06:33.740> at

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
around it there is a way to stream at

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.490 
around it there is a way to stream at
full<00:06:34.400> screen<00:06:34.790> and<00:06:35.120> that<00:06:35.840> is<00:06:35.990> using<00:06:36.230> a<00:06:36.290> program

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
full screen and that is using a program

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.590 
full screen and that is using a program
called<00:06:36.680> dxtory<00:06:37.580> and<00:06:37.880> i'll<00:06:38.090> be<00:06:38.240> making<00:06:38.360> a

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
called dxtory and i'll be making a

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.790 
called dxtory and i'll be making a
tutorial<00:06:38.810> on<00:06:39.170> that<00:06:39.380> another<00:06:39.890> time

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
tutorial on that another time

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.649 
tutorial on that another time
for<00:06:40.979> now<00:06:41.099> I<00:06:41.129> just<00:06:41.250> wanted<00:06:41.610> to<00:06:41.669> set<00:06:42.120> up<00:06:42.210> xsplit

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
for now I just wanted to set up xsplit

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:44.570 
for now I just wanted to set up xsplit
and<00:06:42.960> get<00:06:43.710> some<00:06:43.860> people<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.220> little<00:06:44.310> bit<00:06:44.400> more

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
and get some people a little bit more

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.100 
and get some people a little bit more

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
windowed mode you can download a program

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.779 
windowed mode you can download a program
you<00:06:55.620> can<00:06:55.680> google<00:06:56.009> it<00:06:56.069> it's<00:06:56.280> called<00:06:56.370> shift

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
you can google it it's called shift

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.180 
you can google it it's called shift
window<00:06:57.240> and<00:06:57.479> what<00:06:58.229> shift<00:06:58.500> window<00:06:58.800> allows<00:06:59.039> you

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
window and what shift window allows you

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.730 
window and what shift window allows you
to<00:06:59.280> do<00:06:59.490> is<00:06:59.729> put<00:07:00.659> games<00:07:00.930> that<00:07:01.139> don't<00:07:01.349> have

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
to do is put games that don't have

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.480 
to do is put games that don't have
windowed<00:07:02.430> mode<00:07:02.610> or<00:07:03.979> games<00:07:04.979> that<00:07:05.129> do<00:07:05.310> have

windowed mode into windowed mode and it
emulates<00:07:08.520> full<00:07:08.940> screen<00:07:09.210> so<00:07:09.330> it<00:07:09.419> looks<00:07:09.659> will

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
emulates full screen so it looks will

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.350 
emulates full screen so it looks will
screen<00:07:10.169> to<00:07:10.289> you<00:07:10.440> but<00:07:11.280> to<00:07:11.310> xsplit<00:07:11.849> its<00:07:12.000> windowed

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
screen to you but to xsplit its windowed

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.149 
screen to you but to xsplit its windowed
mode<00:07:12.539> now<00:07:13.050> shift<00:07:13.379> window<00:07:13.650> doesn't<00:07:13.830> work<00:07:14.009> with

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:14.159 
mode now shift window doesn't work with

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:16.550 
mode now shift window doesn't work with
all<00:07:14.340> games<00:07:14.659> some<00:07:15.659> games<00:07:15.900> it<00:07:16.080> won't<00:07:16.229> work<00:07:16.319> with

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
all games some games it won't work with

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.110 
all games some games it won't work with
so<00:07:17.219> you're<00:07:17.370> just<00:07:17.430> going<00:07:17.580> to<00:07:17.669> have<00:07:17.699> to<00:07:17.819> test
