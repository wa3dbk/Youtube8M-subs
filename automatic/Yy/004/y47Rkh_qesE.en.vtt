speed but then what do we do when we get
there<00:00:29.619> David<00:00:30.619> Shelton<00:00:30.830> was<00:00:31.099> working<00:00:31.460> on

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
there David Shelton was working on

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.430 
there David Shelton was working on
flying<00:00:31.880> cars<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.570> did<00:00:32.930> he<00:00:32.989> came<00:00:33.199> up<00:00:33.320> with

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
flying cars and did he came up with

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.619 
flying cars and did he came up with
something<00:00:33.650> much<00:00:34.040> more<00:00:34.309> simple<00:00:34.730> why<00:00:35.239> not<00:00:35.420> stick

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
something much more simple why not stick

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.930 
something much more simple why not stick
a<00:00:35.690> motorbike<00:00:36.230> under<00:00:36.800> your<00:00:36.949> plane<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:37.820> we

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
a motorbike under your plane so we

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.880 
a motorbike under your plane so we
designed<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.390> pond<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.720> do<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.080> one<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.650> the<00:00:39.710> main

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
designed a pond to do it one of the main

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.460 
designed a pond to do it one of the main
benefits<00:00:40.820> is<00:00:41.059> there's<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.629> lot<00:00:41.809> more<00:00:41.839> airports

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
benefits is there's a lot more airports

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.520 
benefits is there's a lot more airports
that<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:42.799> can<00:00:43.010> utilize<00:00:43.900> half<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.080> airport's

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
that you can utilize half the airport's

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.509 
that you can utilize half the airport's
out<00:00:45.710> there<00:00:45.860> don't<00:00:46.010> have<00:00:46.220> ground

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
out there don't have ground

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.969 
out there don't have ground
transportation<00:00:46.970> so<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:47.780> can<00:00:48.199> pick<00:00:48.379> any<00:00:48.559> airport

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
transportation so I can pick any airport

transportation so I can pick any airport
on<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.100> map<00:00:49.370> go<00:00:49.760> there<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:50.470> reliably<00:00:51.470> drive

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
on the map go there and reliably drive

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.880 
on the map go there and reliably drive
to<00:00:52.400> where<00:00:52.549> I'm<00:00:52.640> going<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:54.260> also<00:00:54.409> saves<00:00:54.769> a

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
to where I'm going and it also saves a

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.350 
to where I'm going and it also saves a
lot<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:55.070> time<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:55.640> a<00:00:55.699> lot<00:00:55.850> quicker<00:00:56.089> than

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
lot of time it's a lot quicker than

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.990 
lot of time it's a lot quicker than
renting<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.809> car<00:00:57.049> waiting<00:00:57.320> for<00:00:57.650> taxi<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.430> you

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
renting a car waiting for taxi so you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.539 
renting a car waiting for taxi so you
know<00:00:59.199> my<00:01:00.199> neighbor<00:01:00.409> has<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:00.680> cirrus<00:01:01.220> and<00:01:01.430> he's

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
know my neighbor has a cirrus and he's

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.490 
know my neighbor has a cirrus and he's
got<00:01:01.729> about<00:01:01.940> 10<00:01:02.210> knots<00:01:02.449> on<00:01:02.750> me<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.110> that<00:01:03.290> that

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
got about 10 knots on me and that that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.830 
got about 10 knots on me and that that
saves<00:01:03.890> him<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.190> few<00:01:04.339> minutes<00:01:04.549> in<00:01:04.850> flight<00:01:05.059> but<00:01:05.689> I

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
saves him a few minutes in flight but I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.109 
saves him a few minutes in flight but I
oftentimes<00:01:06.439> save<00:01:06.710> 20<00:01:07.189> or<00:01:07.280> 30<00:01:07.490> minutes<00:01:07.850> on<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
oftentimes save 20 or 30 minutes on the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.179 
oftentimes save 20 or 30 minutes on the
ground<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:08.600> can<00:01:08.780> land<00:01:08.960> at<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> closer<00:01:09.619> airport

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
ground I can land at a closer airport

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.220 
ground I can land at a closer airport
and<00:01:10.369> hit<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> roads<00:01:10.820> right<00:01:11.090> away<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.600> he<00:01:12.020> went

attention<00:01:27.320> well<00:01:28.160> I've<00:01:28.370> been<00:01:28.550> interested<00:01:28.790> in

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
attention well I've been interested in

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.270 
attention well I've been interested in
roadable<00:01:29.420> aircraft<00:01:29.420> from<00:01:30.110> for<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.860> long<00:01:31.010> time

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
roadable aircraft from for a long time

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.370 
roadable aircraft from for a long time
and<00:01:31.310> they've<00:01:31.760> been<00:01:31.910> trying<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.360> make<00:01:32.930> runnable

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
and they've been trying to make runnable

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.070 
and they've been trying to make runnable
airplanes<00:01:33.800> since<00:01:34.130> Oh<00:01:34.400> 19<00:01:35.090> 18<00:01:35.480> or<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:35.990> they

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
airplanes since Oh 19 18 or so and they

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.600 
airplanes since Oh 19 18 or so and they
spent<00:01:36.350> about<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.560> hundred<00:01:36.770> different<00:01:37.040> designs

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
spent about a hundred different designs

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.640 
spent about a hundred different designs
but<00:01:37.940> if<00:01:38.480> your<00:01:38.690> airplane<00:01:38.990> has<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.320> carry<00:01:39.560> around

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
but if your airplane has to carry around

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.040 
but if your airplane has to carry around
a<00:01:39.950> bunch<00:01:40.159> of<00:01:40.280> carp<00:01:40.610> bits<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.330> pieces<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:41.900> vice

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
a bunch of carp bits and pieces and vice

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.140 
a bunch of carp bits and pieces and vice
versa<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:43.040> wind<00:01:43.280> up<00:01:43.400> with<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.580> compromised

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
versa you wind up with a compromised

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.460 
versa you wind up with a compromised
vehicle<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.840> it's<00:01:44.960> not<00:01:45.140> really<00:01:45.440> a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
vehicle and it's not really a

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.440 
vehicle and it's not really a
specialized<00:01:46.130> car<00:01:46.520> or<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> specialized

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
specialized car or a specialized

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.630 
specialized car or a specialized
airplane<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.830> tend<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.130> lose<00:01:49.220> about<00:01:49.580> half

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
airplane so you tend to lose about half

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.310 
airplane so you tend to lose about half
your<00:01:50.030> performance<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:50.690> double<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> price

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
your performance and double the price

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.560 
your performance and double the price
okay<00:01:51.740> great<00:01:52.130> idea<00:01:52.580> but<00:01:52.790> fishing<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.360> big

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
okay great idea but fishing that big

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.360 
okay great idea but fishing that big
cargo<00:01:53.900> pod<00:01:54.290> is<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.710> turn<00:01:54.860> your<00:01:54.979> aircraft

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
cargo pod is going to turn your aircraft

cargo pod is going to turn your aircraft
from<00:01:55.430> being<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.729> streamlined<00:01:56.300> as<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.510> Ferrari

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
from being a streamlined as a Ferrari

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.960 
from being a streamlined as a Ferrari
into<00:01:57.620> something<00:01:57.920> more<00:01:58.040> akin<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.520> hillbilly

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
into something more akin to a hillbilly

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.170 
into something more akin to a hillbilly
truck<00:01:59.479> surely<00:02:00.200> well<00:02:01.010> when<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.580> motorcycles

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
truck surely well when the motorcycles

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.380 
truck surely well when the motorcycles
in<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.360> pod<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.900> pot<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.320> shaped<00:02:03.710> right<00:02:04.010> and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
in the pod the pot is shaped right and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.930 
in the pod the pot is shaped right and
so<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.470> RV<00:02:06.740> 10<00:02:06.920> for<00:02:07.159> example<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:07.729> lose

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
so on the RV 10 for example we lose

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.059 
so on the RV 10 for example we lose
about<00:02:08.209> five<00:02:08.509> percent<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:09.049> our<00:02:09.170> airspeed<00:02:09.860> and

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
about five percent of our airspeed and

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.030 
about five percent of our airspeed and
cruise<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.599> looks<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.049> a<00:02:12.080> big<00:02:12.379> pot<00:02:12.680> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
cruise but it looks like a big pot and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.369 
cruise but it looks like a big pot and
it<00:02:13.670> has<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.879> lot<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.209> what<00:02:14.659> we<00:02:14.780> call<00:02:14.930> when<00:02:15.260> it

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
it has a lot of what we call when it

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.270 
it has a lot of what we call when it
area<00:02:15.709> but<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.069> also<00:02:16.250> covering<00:02:16.850> up

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
area but it's also covering up

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.400 
area but it's also covering up
very<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> bottom<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> fuselage<00:02:19.020> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
very on the bottom of the fuselage so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.980 
very on the bottom of the fuselage so
the<00:02:19.890> net<00:02:20.069> increase<00:02:20.459> if<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:21.540> it

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the net increase if you do it right it

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.080 
the net increase if you do it right it
doesn't<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.650> whole<00:02:22.800> lot<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.040> drag<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
doesn't have a whole lot of drag and the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.790 
doesn't have a whole lot of drag and the
flight<00:02:24.300> characteristics<00:02:24.780> remain<00:02:25.470> almost

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
flight characteristics remain almost

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.949 
flight characteristics remain almost
identical<00:02:26.610> as<00:02:26.730> far<00:02:26.940> as<00:02:27.090> Truman<00:02:27.450> handling<00:02:27.810> goes

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
identical as far as Truman handling goes

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.960 
identical as far as Truman handling goes
but<00:02:28.620> there<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.830> another<00:02:28.860> thing<00:02:29.459> bugging<00:02:29.730> me

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
but there is another thing bugging me

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.210 
but there is another thing bugging me
how<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> heavy<00:02:31.350> motorcycle

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
how do you get a heavy motorcycle

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.650 
how do you get a heavy motorcycle
attached<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.850> your<00:02:32.970> aircraft<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> long

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
attached to your aircraft for a long

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.510 
attached to your aircraft for a long
flight<00:02:33.900> without<00:02:34.319> finding<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.190> dropped

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
flight without finding that it dropped

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.840 
flight without finding that it dropped
off<00:02:35.700> half<00:02:36.000> way<00:02:36.030> along<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> room<00:02:36.980> well<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.760> of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
off half way along the room well one of

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.210 
off half way along the room well one of
the<00:02:38.910> keys<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.209> our<00:02:39.330> cargo<00:02:39.660> pod<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.350> has<00:02:41.190> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
the keys to our cargo pod is a has a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.760 
the keys to our cargo pod is a has a
built-in<00:02:41.640> winch<00:02:41.850> system<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.750> it's<00:02:43.380> attached

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
built-in winch system so it's attached

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.830 
built-in winch system so it's attached
to<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> airplane<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.520> just<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.880> four<00:02:45.540> pins

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
to the airplane with just a four pins

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.440 
to the airplane with just a four pins
and<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.800> pull<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> pins<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.760> winch<00:02:48.270> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and you just pull the pins and winch the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.840 
and you just pull the pins and winch the
whole<00:02:48.600> pod<00:02:48.870> down<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> ground<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.640> like

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
whole pod down to the ground and I like

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.870 
whole pod down to the ground and I like
to<00:02:51.000> cheat<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.300> use<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> cordless<00:02:52.650> drill<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.640> drag

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
to cheat I use a cordless drill to drag

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.090 
to cheat I use a cordless drill to drag
the<00:02:54.060> winch<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.500> takes<00:02:55.950> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
the winch so it's it it just takes a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.500 
the winch so it's it it just takes a
moment<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.519> then<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.820> whole<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.239> rolls

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
moment and then the whole thing rolls

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.080 
moment and then the whole thing rolls
out<00:02:57.690> from<00:02:57.900> underneath<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.500> airplane<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.160> that

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
out from underneath the airplane so that

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.050 
out from underneath the airplane so that
you<00:03:00.360> know<00:03:00.480> my<00:03:00.690> motorcycle<00:03:01.350> weighs<00:03:01.580> 220<00:03:02.580> pounds

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
you know my motorcycle weighs 220 pounds

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.420 
you know my motorcycle weighs 220 pounds
and<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:04.019> winch<00:03:04.230> system<00:03:04.410> means<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.190> don't<00:03:05.250> have

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
and the winch system means I don't have

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.870 
and the winch system means I don't have
to<00:03:05.580> lift<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.660> at<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.200> really<00:03:07.800> easy<00:03:08.100> just

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
to lift it up at all it really easy just

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.309 
to lift it up at all it really easy just
takes<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.239> couple<00:03:09.390> minutes<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.140> bike

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
takes a couple minutes to get the bike

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.320 
takes a couple minutes to get the bike
out<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.769> be<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:10.980> my<00:03:11.040> way<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:12.030> looks<00:03:12.269> like

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
out and be on my way and it looks like

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.910 
out and be on my way and it looks like
you<00:03:12.569> can<00:03:12.720> carry<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.110> about<00:03:13.230> anything<00:03:13.650> in

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
you can carry just about anything in

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.650 
you can carry just about anything in
there<00:03:14.100> too<00:03:14.250> including<00:03:15.000> children<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.480> don't

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
there too including children you don't

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.570 
there too including children you don't
want<00:03:15.810> annoying<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.319> in<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> comp<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:16.950> but

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
want annoying you in the comp it but

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.949 
want annoying you in the comp it but
today<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.819> made<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.120> last<00:03:18.269> bit<00:03:18.450> up<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:18.810> you

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
today I made that last bit up but you

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.990 
today I made that last bit up but you
get<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.200> point<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:20.430> interesting<00:03:20.610> because

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
get the point it's interesting because

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.120 
get the point it's interesting because
pilots<00:03:21.299> are<00:03:21.660> always<00:03:21.959> focused<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:22.470> air<00:03:22.769> speed

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
pilots are always focused on air speed

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
how fast their plane is but a few years

back NASA did some studies on personal
air<00:03:28.019> vehicles<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.620> they<00:03:28.709> started<00:03:29.040> looking<00:03:29.130> at

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
air vehicles and they started looking at

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.550 
air vehicles and they started looking at
the<00:03:29.880> whole<00:03:30.090> trip<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:31.019> were<00:03:31.079> looking<00:03:31.290> in

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the whole trip and they were looking in

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.410 
the whole trip and they were looking in
terms<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.980> door-to-door<00:03:32.280> trip<00:03:32.850> speed<00:03:33.150> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
terms of door-to-door trip speed and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.729 
terms of door-to-door trip speed and
that's<00:03:33.810> what<00:03:34.019> really<00:03:34.049> counts<00:03:34.320> when<00:03:34.709> you're

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
that's what really counts when you're

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.490 
that's what really counts when you're
trying<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.130> go<00:03:35.310> someplace<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.850> they<00:03:36.120> found

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
trying to go someplace and they found

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.199 
trying to go someplace and they found
the<00:03:37.500> traditional<00:03:37.980> approach<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.459> trying<00:03:39.000> to

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the traditional approach of trying to

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.900 
the traditional approach of trying to
increase<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.930> aircraft<00:03:40.560> speed<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.340> not<00:03:41.610> very

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
increase the aircraft speed is not very

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.180 
increase the aircraft speed is not very
effective<00:03:42.180> because<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.079> real<00:03:43.350> delays<00:03:43.769> take

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
effective because the real delays take

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.970 
effective because the real delays take
place<00:03:44.459> on<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.760> ground
