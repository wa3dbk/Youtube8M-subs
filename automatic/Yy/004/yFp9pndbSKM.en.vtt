Hi. Chris Hadfield here on the International Space Station inside the cupola. 

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.133
I hope people are enjoying all the pictures we've been taking. 

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.299
It's not Instagram, it's Space-a-gram. 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.500
Let me show you how we take these pictures. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.066
We orbit 400 kilometres above the Earth. 

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.199
So if you want to get a good detailed picture of something, you need a long lens. 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.000
I have one velcro-ed to the wall. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.866
This is the big one, 400mm of many pieces of glass so we can focus on what's going on in the world. 

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:48.166
Three important things when you take a picture from space: focus, frame and fire. 

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.366
Let's talk about camera settings. 

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:02.832
Typically the light from the Earth is very bright and of course, space is very black. 

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.266
The camera gets confused if you mix the two. 

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.232
So often, we'll set it to manual. 

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.733
So if you can see over my shoulder,

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:14.699
the camera is on, I'm going to set my mode to manual and then we use the sunny 16 rule. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.500
So I set my F-stop to about 16. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.100
So I've got manual 16. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.833
You can choose your ISO based on just how bright it is,

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:28.133
but typically about 200 works fine with the Sunny 16 rule and we use very high resolution pictures. 

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:31.966
So we set it in the back here, we use an F format, not jpeg. 

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.966
So each pictures is about 10 megs. 

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:38.932
It rapidly fills up the card, but that's how we set our camera to take a picture in space. 

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:48.366
One of the most striking parts of the world is the Sahara, a huge barren colourful rock, no vegetation covering it up. 

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.632
You can see all the textures and varying shades of the world. 

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:56.499
The Sahara is beautiful, we're coming up on it now. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.500
This beautiful cloud is just on the coast, the brown and blue of Africa. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
It's just around lunchtime on the Sahara right now, so the sun is coming straight down. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.400
It makes for a nice time to take pictures because the light is very strong on the surface, so it's good to get the detail. 

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:25.999
Something I really look for are edges and borders and changes

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.500
and the Sahara has those where you go from one ancient style of rock to another or where the dunes of the desert are - 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.566
have stopped in one area and started in another. So they almost make straight lines and weird textures. 

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:42.332
It looks skin or hide and I often look for those in space. 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.533
We're going around the world 8 kilometres a second. 

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.399
The sun and the Earth are sort of in a fixed geometry, 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.733
but we're moving so the angle between us and the sun and the Earth is changing, 

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.266
and therefore, the reflection of the sunlight changes. 

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:07.732
So we get a sun glint off the surface and you can see water on the surface so nicely in the sun glint  

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:10.233
and pick out rivers and lakes and ponds. 

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.899
You can follow a whole river as the sun glints along it, 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.933
something that you could barely see normally. 

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:26.499
When you catch the sun's glint and it glows like a silver worm or a vein of ore and then the angle changes 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000
and it - it's as if someone turned the lights off in the river and it wakes up. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.400

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.833
The beauty of space station is if it's not here at this time, tomorrow it might be, 

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.433
or maybe next week or maybe a month from now, 

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:44.199
but there's not a race to get a picture. 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.133
You can be patient like a hunter.
