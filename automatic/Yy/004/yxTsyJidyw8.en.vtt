00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.039 
like
you<00:02:18.640> can't<00:02:18.909> say<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.629> they're<00:02:19.780> kind<00:02:19.989> of

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
you can't say but they're kind of

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.280 
you can't say but they're kind of
getting<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.879> fuzzies<00:02:21.879> on<00:02:21.909> them<00:02:22.359> so<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.049> went

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
getting like fuzzies on them so I went

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.369 
getting like fuzzies on them so I went
back<00:02:25.530> recently<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:27.040> try<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.700> get<00:02:28.659> more<00:02:28.989> and

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
back recently to try and get more and

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.589 
back recently to try and get more and
they<00:02:29.890> did<00:02:30.219> not<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.370> up<00:02:30.730> anymore<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.329> year

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
they did not have up anymore this year

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.319 
they did not have up anymore this year
so<00:02:32.280> there's<00:02:33.280> got<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.489> be<00:02:33.519> really<00:02:33.879> careful<00:02:34.239> with

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329
