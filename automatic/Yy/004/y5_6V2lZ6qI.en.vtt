00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
look something like this then all you're

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.979 
look something like this then all you're
going<00:00:45.339> to<00:00:45.460> do<00:00:45.670> is<00:00:46.210> you're<00:00:46.360> going<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.750> start

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
going to do is you're going to start

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.670 
going to do is you're going to start
twisting<00:00:47.440> it<00:00:47.559> and<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.930> you're<00:00:50.170> twisting

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
twisting it and as you're twisting

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.299 
twisting it and as you're twisting
you're<00:00:51.580> going<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:51.879> pick<00:00:52.059> up<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.390> hairs<00:00:52.750> as

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you're going to pick up the hairs as

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.009 
you're going to pick up the hairs as
they<00:00:54.309> become<00:00:54.670> available<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.869> you<00:01:01.019> it's

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
they become available to you it's

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.530 
they become available to you it's
something<00:01:02.320> that<00:01:02.769> becomes<00:01:03.159> pretty<00:01:03.729> easy<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.390> do

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
something that becomes pretty easy to do

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.170 
something that becomes pretty easy to do
like<00:01:04.809> Karan<00:01:05.110> rowing<00:01:05.490> once<00:01:06.490> you<00:01:06.610> practice<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:07.090> a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
like Karan rowing once you practice it a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.320 
like Karan rowing once you practice it a
lot<00:01:07.770> I've<00:01:08.770> been<00:01:08.950> only<00:01:09.549> practicing<00:01:10.090> about<00:01:10.299> a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
lot I've been only practicing about a

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.969 
lot I've been only practicing about a
few<00:01:10.750> weeks<00:01:10.900> now<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:11.260> I<00:01:11.530> think<00:01:11.560> I've<00:01:11.860> improved

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
few weeks now and I think I've improved

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:27.680 
few weeks now and I think I've improved
so<00:01:13.470> yeah

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.960 

and<00:01:28.690> so<00:01:28.930> that's<00:01:29.049> basically<00:01:29.260> how<00:01:29.680> it's<00:01:30.220> done<00:01:30.460> if

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
and so that's basically how it's done if

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.850 
and so that's basically how it's done if
you<00:01:31.119> like<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.479> smell<00:01:31.750> socially<00:01:32.260> one<00:01:32.440> more<00:01:32.619> time
