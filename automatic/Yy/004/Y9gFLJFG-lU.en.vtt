00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello, Iâ€™ll make Egor crystal and 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.049
 many asked me to tell you how i am 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.240
 I do my hair because you know 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.950
 everybody wants to have his own 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.190
 some kind of individual hairstyle 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.789
 hairstyle and well, just many do not know 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.500
 when you can even feel shy somehow 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.289
 here learn how to do the same 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.109
 hairstyle like mine to need 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.630
 look like beautifully beautiful and and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.170
 today you will literally teach three 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.000
 stages how to achieve the same results 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 so that you have the same hairstyle 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.899
 I drove the first stage stage is the most 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.540
 the main thing is to wash my hair well, I already 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.200
 did so as not to not take away from 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.960
 you time you already washed your head and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120
 now you need to dry your hair well 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 that is, it can already be the second stage 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.399
 reworking the second stage we have a hair dryer 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 if we assume you have no son you can 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 ask the sphere from mom there or from grandmother 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.010
 up if the length of the hair and the grandmother well or 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.400
 dads if dad 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.220
 also likes to do it with a talgat 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.460
 should also be a hairdryer so here it is 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 the main thing in the second stage is correct 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.689
 dry your hair because so here 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.119
 just do not go well, well, so here 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.790
 you can not just do it all dry 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.159
 mindlessly need to dry in rows you now i 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.159
 trained by example you can watch 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.790
 so here as if alternating the date step 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 here are these rows and then exactly the same 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.240
 vertica 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.140
 we move to the third stage this is not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.760
 less important stage 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.100
 I would even he is the chief, and said, 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.130
 the most important bridge to them under m m then 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.780
 and today I have here by the way yet 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.370
 about drying and head can 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.530
 use just a towel if you have 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.560
 let's say no hair dryer yes how would well 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.800
 it happens that there is no hair dryer guests 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.720
 just use a regular towel 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 fit the principle of any of any 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.970
 material so here is a little bit 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:21.850
 twist here and appoint after we 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:24.250
 finish well finished drying your hair and we 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.210
 can do mean basic now 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.100
 need a moment 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.250
 I do not use fundamentally any 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.990
 helium there and yes varnishes can be simply 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.320
 re-take or so here you need 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:41.230
 spend and basically we all spent 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.900
 probably somewhere two minutes and hairstyle 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.170
