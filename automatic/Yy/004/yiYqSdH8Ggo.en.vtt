couple of weeks ago I noticed that on
the<00:00:10.170> back<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.650> neck<00:00:10.860> there<00:00:11.490> was<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> little

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the back of the neck there was a little

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.690 
the back of the neck there was a little
dent<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.590> it<00:00:13.590> didn't<00:00:13.889> bother<00:00:14.009> me<00:00:14.219> at<00:00:14.460> first

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
dent and it didn't bother me at first

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.570 
dent and it didn't bother me at first
but<00:00:15.389> when<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> started<00:00:15.990> playing<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.800> kind<00:00:17.550> of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
but when I started playing it I kind of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
but when I started playing it I kind of
felt<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.000> every<00:00:18.210> time<00:00:18.420> my<00:00:19.289> hand<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:19.680> up<00:00:19.710> around

the<00:00:37.440> wood<00:00:38.160> fibers<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:40.020> other<00:00:40.170> fortunate

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
the wood fibers the other fortunate

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
the wood fibers the other fortunate
aspect<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> tongue<00:00:44.280> oiled

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
aspect is that this is a tongue oiled

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.299 
aspect is that this is a tongue oiled
neck<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.539> means<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.050> there's<00:00:46.320> no<00:00:46.829> finish

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
neck which means that there's no finish

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
neck which means that there's no finish
on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.120> neck<00:00:48.300> other<00:00:48.600> than<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
on the neck other than it was just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.439 
on the neck other than it was just
sanded<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.680> coats<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.760> tung<00:00:51.030> oil<00:00:51.180> were

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
sanded and coats of tung oil were

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.350 
sanded and coats of tung oil were
applied<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.739> according<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> carbon

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
applied so according to carbon

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
applied so according to carbon
this<00:00:54.989> should<00:00:55.230> steam<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.860> out<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.399> before<00:00:56.910> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
this should steam right out so before I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
this should steam right out so before I
attempted<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> real<00:00:58.170> guitar<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.800> did

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
attempted this on the real guitar I did

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.529 
attempted this on the real guitar I did
some<00:00:59.370> reading<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> internet<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.420> they

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
some reading on the internet and they

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.560 
some reading on the internet and they
basically<00:01:00.750> selected<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:02.160> suggested<00:01:02.969> two

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
basically selected or suggested two

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
basically selected or suggested two
different<00:01:03.930> methods<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.670> just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
different methods one of them was just

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.539 
different methods one of them was just
to<00:01:06.030> use<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.540> soldering<00:01:07.320> iron<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
to use a soldering iron and then to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.870 
to use a soldering iron and then to
apply<00:01:08.939> heat<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> moist<00:01:10.530> rag<00:01:10.830> directly<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
apply heat with a moist rag directly to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
apply heat with a moist rag directly to
the<00:01:12.090> dent<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> other<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the dent and then the other way was a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
the dent and then the other way was a
little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.549> more<00:01:14.729> general<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.869> just

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
little bit more general it was just

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
little bit more general it was just
basically<00:01:16.439> using<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.150> standard<00:01:18.150> house<00:01:18.330> iron

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
basically using a standard house iron

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.200 
basically using a standard house iron
same<00:01:19.560> methodology<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> take<00:01:20.700> either<00:01:20.880> paper

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
same methodology you take either paper

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.030 
same methodology you take either paper
towel<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> piece<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> fabric<00:01:22.530> that's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
towel or a piece of fabric that's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520 
towel or a piece of fabric that's
moistened<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.360> apply<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
moistened and you apply it just to the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
moistened and you apply it just to the
dent<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.070> steam<00:01:26.400> goes<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.880> swells<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
dent and the steam goes out swells the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.740 
dent and the steam goes out swells the
fibers<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.640> makes<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> wood<00:01:30.150> whole<00:01:30.450> again

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
fibers and makes the wood whole again

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.690 
fibers and makes the wood whole again
where<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.680> lightly<00:01:32.189> sand<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
where you can then lightly sand it and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.760 
where you can then lightly sand it and
reel<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> here's<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:35.369> test<00:01:35.640> victims<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
reel it so here's my my test victims I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.319 
reel it so here's my my test victims I
didn't<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.890> any<00:01:38.070> mahogany<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
didn't have any mahogany that's what the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.410 
didn't have any mahogany that's what the
neck<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.659> made<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.220> found<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.060> couple<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
neck is made of so I found a couple of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.950

and<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:59.250> bent<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> nail<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:02.960> basically<00:02:03.960> just

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and I bent the nail and basically just

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.160 
and I bent the nail and basically just
took<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> hammer<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.100> whacked<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.990> put

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
took a hammer and whacked it to put

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.940 
took a hammer and whacked it to put
these<00:02:07.320> dents<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> wood<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.780> debts<00:02:10.739> that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
these dents in the wood the debts that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.910 
these dents in the wood the debts that
are<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.280> circled<00:02:11.790> here<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:13.140> before

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
are not circled here are the before

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
are not circled here are the before
it's<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> ones<00:02:15.090> I've<00:02:15.240> circled<00:02:15.510> are

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's and then the ones I've circled are

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.210 
it's and then the ones I've circled are
the<00:02:16.020> after<00:02:16.410> dents<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:18.239> had<00:02:18.930> varying<00:02:19.470> success<00:02:19.950> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the after dents I had varying success I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.809 
the after dents I had varying success I
think<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.050> most<00:02:22.980> successful<00:02:23.310> ones

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
think one of the most successful ones

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.960 
think one of the most successful ones
using<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.300> soldering<00:02:24.660> iron<00:02:25.069> was<00:02:26.069> right<00:02:26.520> here

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
using the soldering iron was right here

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.270 
using the soldering iron was right here
where<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> applied<00:02:28.349> direct<00:02:28.770> heat<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
where I applied direct heat to the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.900 
where I applied direct heat to the
cherry<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:31.260> think<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
cherry and I think you can see the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.970 
cherry and I think you can see the
before<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.360> after<00:02:33.569> there's<00:02:34.470> still<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> little

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
before and after there's still a little

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.420 
before and after there's still a little
bit<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.459> an<00:02:35.580> indentation<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.890> circled

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
bit of an indentation in the circled

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.699 
bit of an indentation in the circled
area<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> right<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.140> mean<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.440> whacked

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
area to the right but I mean I whacked

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.009 
area to the right but I mean I whacked
it<00:02:40.950> pretty<00:02:41.220> hard<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.300> dent<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> lot

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
it pretty hard so this dent is a lot

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.780 
it pretty hard so this dent is a lot
more<00:02:43.260> severe<00:02:43.709> than<00:02:44.130> what's<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
more severe than what's actually on the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.870 
more severe than what's actually on the
neck<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> guitar<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:47.100> also<00:02:47.610> thought

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
neck of the guitar and I also thought

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.699 
neck of the guitar and I also thought
very<00:02:48.090> successful<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> use<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.560> iron

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
very successful was the use of the iron

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.030 
very successful was the use of the iron
the<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.069> that's<00:02:50.250> double<00:02:50.610> circled<00:02:51.230> was<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> two

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the one that's double circled was a two

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.600 
the one that's double circled was a two
nice<00:02:53.489> deep<00:02:53.910> dents<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.980> used<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> iron

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
nice deep dents and I used the iron

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.610 
nice deep dents and I used the iron
which<00:02:56.970> applied<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.830> broader<00:02:59.660> area<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.840> heat<00:03:01.110> I'm

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
which applied a broader area of heat I'm

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.930 
which applied a broader area of heat I'm
going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.950> give<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.220> try<00:03:02.459> with<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.760> iron

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
going to give it a try with the iron

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.759 
going to give it a try with the iron
first<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:04.069> if<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.280> doesn't<00:03:06.380> get<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> dent

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
first and if that doesn't get the dent

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.160 
first and if that doesn't get the dent
out<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.100> my<00:03:08.190> satisfaction<00:03:08.670> maybe<00:03:09.120> we'll<00:03:09.420> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
out to my satisfaction maybe we'll you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.770 
out to my satisfaction maybe we'll you
know<00:03:10.260> move<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:11.100> more<00:03:11.489> drastic<00:03:11.880> measures<00:03:12.540> I

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
know move on to more drastic measures I

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.840 
know move on to more drastic measures I
have<00:03:13.049> my<00:03:13.380> iron<00:03:13.560> heating<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.580> turned

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
have my iron heating up I have it turned

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.880 
have my iron heating up I have it turned
all<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> way<00:03:15.239> up<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.690> linen<00:03:15.959> setting<00:03:17.090> and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
all the way up to the linen setting and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.849 
all the way up to the linen setting and
what<00:03:19.890> I'm<00:03:19.980> going<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> use<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.859> spray

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
what I'm going to use is I have a spray

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.690 
what I'm going to use is I have a spray
bottle<00:03:23.040> with<00:03:23.310> water<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:25.769> also<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.370> a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
bottle with water and I also have a

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.630 
bottle with water and I also have a
piece<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:28.769> kind<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.100> denim

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
piece of it's kind of like a denim

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.960 
piece of it's kind of like a denim
there's<00:03:30.239> no<00:03:30.390> dye<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:31.019> just<00:03:31.079> like<00:03:31.320> a

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
there's no dye in it's just like a

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.509 
there's no dye in it's just like a
cotton<00:03:32.970> 100%<00:03:33.480> cotton<00:03:34.049> piece<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:34.950> fabric<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
cotton 100% cotton piece of fabric and

cotton 100% cotton piece of fabric and
I'm<00:03:36.120> going<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.329> end<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.660> saturating<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.709> with

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
I'm going to end up saturating this with

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.740 
I'm going to end up saturating this with
water<00:03:38.130> from<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.489> sprayer<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.480> we'll<00:03:39.600> just

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
water from the sprayer and we'll just

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.030 
water from the sprayer and we'll just
put<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.019> right<00:03:40.109> over<00:03:40.170> there<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.709> hit<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.010> with

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
put it right over there and hit it with

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.460 
put it right over there and hit it with
the<00:03:41.250> iron<00:03:41.280> let<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.390> steam<00:03:42.630> get<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.049> there<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
the iron let the steam get in there and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.990 
the iron let the steam get in there and
then<00:03:43.799> we'll<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.130> double<00:03:44.400> check<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.880> hit

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
then we'll just double check it and hit

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.060 
then we'll just double check it and hit
it<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.180> few<00:03:45.209> times<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.840> hopefully<00:03:46.350> swell<00:03:46.920> up

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
it a few times and hopefully swell up

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.509 
it a few times and hopefully swell up
the<00:03:47.190> fibers<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.880> dent<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:50.220> will<00:03:50.340> take

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
the fibers of the dent and it will take

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.240 
the fibers of the dent and it will take
it<00:03:50.640> from<00:03:50.700> there

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
it from there

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.670 
it from there
just<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.459> get<00:03:53.579> some<00:03:53.790> water<00:03:54.470> into<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
just going to get some water into the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:04.420 
just going to get some water into the
cloth<00:03:59.090> before<00:04:00.090> we<00:04:00.299> get<00:04:00.450> started

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.490 

I<00:04:04.519> have<00:04:05.030> another<00:04:05.450> piece<00:04:05.689> of<00:04:05.750> fabric<00:04:06.019> here<00:04:06.260> I'm

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
I have another piece of fabric here I'm

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.869 
I have another piece of fabric here I'm
just<00:04:06.590> going<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.829> wipe<00:04:07.010> off<00:04:07.219> any<00:04:07.370> overspray

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
just going to wipe off any overspray

it and I loved it until I got that bump
and<00:06:29.539> then<00:06:29.750> I<00:06:29.870> started<00:06:30.259> thinking<00:06:30.620> well<00:06:30.800> if<00:06:30.979> I

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
and then I started thinking well if I

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.159 
and then I started thinking well if I
had<00:06:31.639> the<00:06:31.789> gloss<00:06:32.060> or<00:06:32.270> if<00:06:32.360> I<00:06:32.449> had<00:06:32.599> the<00:06:32.750> satin

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
had the gloss or if I had the satin

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.869 
had the gloss or if I had the satin
would<00:06:33.680> it<00:06:33.800> have<00:06:33.889> protected<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:35.120> the<00:06:35.719> neck<00:06:35.930> and

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:36.879 
would it have protected the the neck and

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.240 
would it have protected the the neck and
maybe<00:06:37.879> yes<00:06:38.240> it<00:06:38.900> may<00:06:39.469> have<00:06:39.590> protected<00:06:39.949> it<00:06:40.189> a

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
maybe yes it may have protected it a

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.939 
maybe yes it may have protected it a
little<00:06:40.400> bit<00:06:40.580> more<00:06:40.789> but<00:06:41.150> honestly<00:06:41.990> if<00:06:42.110> this<00:06:42.680> was

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
little bit more but honestly if this was

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.540 
little bit more but honestly if this was
a<00:06:43.189> either<00:06:44.120> a<00:06:44.389> glossed<00:06:44.810> or<00:06:45.500> matte<00:06:45.949> finished

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550
