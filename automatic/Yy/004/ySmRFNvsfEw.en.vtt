00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.520
 Hi friends 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.330
 back to you they have me to explain them 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.180
 steps that one takes to know sometimes the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.380
 time to buy your fabrics to make the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.339
 clothes they want to make 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.600
 you always have to take into account for 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:38.539
 buy your fabric the measurements 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.550
 because it is not the same amount of cloth 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.200
 that you are going to buy to make a 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.440
 mini skirt 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.040
 than to make a long skirt or to 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.370
 make pants then always on 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.070
 the measures we are going to base that I have 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.070
 how much fabric should I buy for example 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.440
 for good trousers then for a 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.250
 trousers once he has taken me 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.090
 the measurements assuming that I'm off the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.070
 pants is 90 centimeters I have 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.470
 to take into account there at least 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.750
 another 5 centimeters more for bastilla 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.290
 as long as the fabric has been 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.330
 cut well and I have measured it well 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.570
 always try one to buy a little 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.500
 more foreseeing those details already if 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.690
 you want 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.630
 for example 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.860
 They want to get pants because they already 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.000
 I said he takes on his pants length 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.100
 important time 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 if we are chubby or we are skinny 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.160
 because if we are chubby, they do not come out 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.050
 the two garments that is the two parts of 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.570
 the two legs we do not reach out 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.300
 then already at the time of cutting in cloth 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.760
 let's see how we are going to put a stroke 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.730
 and how are we going to put the other 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.190
 put the other so that they can remove the 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.570
 two when they do not reach us in the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.600
 same year 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.970
 well there is so that they go see the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.830
 amount of fabric that they will buy that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.800
 if they want to make the bag 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.960
 to complete the suit because they are going to 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.390
 take what is your waist the length where 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.780
 you want to drop them saquito 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.760
 if it is at the hip or is longer according to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.370
 the length that you want more the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.610
 length of the sleeve and what are the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.490
 seen the bags all that with the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.950
 record milestones there we will try to 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.320
 pull out all those dating pieces that we 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.920
 They will be necessary that we're going to do 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.430
 lack they want for example to make a 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.220
 blouse long sleeve nothing because 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.050
 they have to take their blouse length what 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.920
 that details it in the length that 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.100
 want longer sleeve longer than 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.370
 sleeve 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.520
 and do not forget also sometimes three or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.550
 five centimeters more for pill for 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.500
 so that they remain in the long garment 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.050
 that you want it, you want to leave 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.490
 and the margin that you take when you say 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.010
 that for example if they cut the grade the 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.120
 how much is the margin that much extra 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.550
 you bought 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.520
 good I for example in a to make a 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.820
 normal pants on a person who is going 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.160
 to get out of the width the two are going to come out 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.590
 the two legs 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.190
 the two legs I'm buying 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.290
 times a meter fifteen a meter are equal 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.690
 up to twenty centimeters what they cut 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.450
 thin then there to me and I 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.030
 They removed 20 centimeters long of ate 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.980
 but only after they cut the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.960
 novel after they cut the cloth 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.630
 then foreseeing that always 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.290
 buy 15 20 centimeters longer 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.360
 that if we are chubby then there is not 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.900
 buy 15 to 20 centimeters there is 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.540
 Buy up to half a meter more 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.120
 to be able to take out both legs that are not 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.890
 you get added with the same strokes 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.220
 that you can spare the pieces can be 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.800
 very many summer 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.630
 thank you for watching these 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.630
 videos I hope you serve them
