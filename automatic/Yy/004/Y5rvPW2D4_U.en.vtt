00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.480
 how about everyone in this good video this 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.740
 video is going to be something very special because 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.740
 because today the day has come 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.400
 so that it reaches silver not then 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.509
 come on I'll show it below 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.019
 is here with me and you're here is the 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.019
 presented 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 how are all my name is silver and 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.669
 this is the first time I make a video 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.220
 for reasons of study and work 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.460
 but these days it's going to be going up 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.960
 a few videos since golden 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 he always mentions me in his videos 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 always pre always says silver has 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.160
 to do this to silver do this then 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.140
 I want that I already want to start doing 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.280
 this because the idea to the channel was also 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.579
 mine and then it is already 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.410
 good you're in the first one that's going to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.320
 make a tutorial the tutorial is going to be 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.570
 how to use the cube one by one so that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.059
 it is used because it is used because 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.050
 exists 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.940
 you may 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.860
 when I'm talking I roll up a little 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.090
 because it is the lack of habit and 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 then I will start 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.460
 good the cube one by one practically 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.200
 It is a die of six colors as we can 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.690
 observe has the standard colors that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.570
 has a good normal bucket for example 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.540
 this is my cube is a cool way 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.430
 stickers is the cube that I use for 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.250
 practice the movements algorithms of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.720
 advanced method and how you can see the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:45.840
 colors match blue red green 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.420
 yellow and white orange good for what 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.980
 this q is used this good cube this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.290
 course used is practically for 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.940
 practice neutrality you are 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.680
 they will ask what good neutrality is 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.470
 neutrality the ability that we have 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.660
 the speakers to love the cube from 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.730
 any color whatever it is we can 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.010
 arm it for the yellow for the red for 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.290
 the white or by dena we in those of 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.630
 the will in what is how 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.010
 it works and how the one is used by 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.250
 one, as I said, it's a side 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.200
 we just throw the die the color 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.010
 that comes out and we started to solve the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.230
 cube that face when we finished 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 we put the cube together and we launch again 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.100
 the dice our white went green and so 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.860
 with everything that's why I wanted to use the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.750
 neutrality can also be had as 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.220
 collection if you are fans of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.380
 collect cubes can start with 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.660
 this one by one three times three 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.040
 four times four and five times five 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.950
 until you have at that 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.430
 you want less is going to give you a 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.480
 example of how the one is used by 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.480
 one pretty rich 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.970
 but I think that's fine with that 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.890
 Although the three lovers is already as 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.230
 well it is ordered while it is going to launch the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.060
 given one by one the blue face came out 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.160
 let's solve it by the blue face 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.880
 the method that I use to solve 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.020
 this cube it is as I freddy 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.640
 reduced, I was advanced 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.640
 put movements on both sides 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.459
 I practice not very often every time I do not 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.110
 I have to be like I'm unemployed with nothing 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.330
 what to do then do it 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.810
 neutrality I started practicing 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.310
 first that golden golden was not very 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.280
 accustomed neutrality still by 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.980
 whatever 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.200
 he started when he started with this he 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.760
 started with the blue face 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.270
 but then I told him to start with 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.730
 the white one is simpler 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.950
 and then he closed himself on the white 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.840
 idea and has not been able to leave although there 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.790
 Sometimes there are times when he does 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.230
 practice neutrality but it is not 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.180
 constant 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.489
 good as you can see and solve the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.920
 cube by the blue face ends in the face 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.730
 green use advanced methods and that's why 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.730
 I miss nothing 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.240
 if you liked the video you can give me 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:31.240
 like if you were surprised by the presentation 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.890
 of silver and subscribe, I do not care 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.720
 also if they have any suggestions that 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.550
 I will gladly accept it 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.530
 because I will be uploading videos a 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.020
 little more often and that would help me a lot 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.220
 to have more confidence with you many 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.220
 thank you so much later
