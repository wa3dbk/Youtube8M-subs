00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.579
 today is June 20th street 18 20 degrees 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 heat in some areas 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.550
 possible rain and thunderstorms but today is not about 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.989
 This is today in our review of the BMW 3 series 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.989
 in the back of e92 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.840
 on this car restored three 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.850
 liter gasoline engine with two 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.299
 turbines this is the most powerful 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 road version of this car 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.810
 The car began to be produced from 2006 to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.960
 2010 is a coupe in the back of e92 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.890
 car mounted motor m54 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.740
 technical characteristics of this 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.259
 motor impressive 306 horsepower and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.909
 400 newtons of torque can it 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.320
 replaced motor n55 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.990
 consider the back of this 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.140
 the car is set forked exhaust 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.210
 which is peculiar to 335 gasoline and 335 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.100
 diesel forked exhaust add 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.789
 aggression add swiftness 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.710
 I personally think that in 92 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.720
 body there is no hard need for you 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.600
 package it looks and so enough 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.819
 impetuous what can not be said about e 60 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.500
 body where the m-package is simply necessary for 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.899
 to make the car look more 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.250
 aggressive and more impetuous given 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.840
 the car sounds very interesting for 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.840
 three liter gasoline engine 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.020
 Well 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.360
 so let's talk a little bit about the cabin 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.760
 car installed light leather 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.190
 a salon that goes well with 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.900
 dark floor and dark ceiling 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.040
 the car is set to automatic 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.500
 Transmission 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.990
 what is the most interesting is the version with 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.910
 manual transmission and there are 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.700
 seat heating monitor 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.070
 mirrors with photo chrome folding and 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.710
 very interesting feature is 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.050
 paddle shifters that allow 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.550
 independently shift gears to 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.610
 automatic transmission 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.630
 but itâ€™s rather more a toy than 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.100
 need for city driving 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.890
 Now we will test this car 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.190
 on the go understand how dynamic it is 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.330
 understand how easy it will cope with it 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.590
 the city immediately felt the exhaust sound 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.209
 exhaust it is really nice and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 subtly comes right in the salon 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.379
 paddle shifters don't think that's 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.080
 anyone interested yes because the thing 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.810
 quite controversial let's see how he 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.819
 reacts to the gas pedal enough 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.569
 confidently gaining speed 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.210
 already centuries backs 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.390
 brakes brakes are really chic 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.319
 good responsiveness immediately felt 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.969
 what 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.969
 maza here his 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.950
 the box clicks is very interesting 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.410
 allows you to go intensively enough 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.190
 and sport mode which will twist 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.190
 motor above 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.920
 in general, very, very dynamic pickup 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.980
 goes immediately on their 19 wheels car 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.400
 hard enough is explained by the fact 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.760
 what is firstly a whole year 3 series 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.870
 and she as a whole is not very self 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.290
 imagine soft + 19 ranflet 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:42.060
 wheels add stiffness here but 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.060
 well affects taxiing 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.130
 the fact of payment you need to eat Valdiz 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:08.090
 la belle the words breathed into a straw 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.090
 we clicked such long ago 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.670
 she's like 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.550
 built plant manufacturer declares 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.560
 five and a half seconds to a hundred 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.050
 kilometers per hour now we will try 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.460
 measure this car let's see what 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:29.060
 we will show our not the most accurate device 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.060
 mobile application 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.260
 but just for the big picture overall 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.440
 of understanding 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.440
 besides, we compare it with 535 diesel engines 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.039
 0 that we got five thirty 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.780
 five seconds 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:05.129
 I will say this device again but not 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:09.240
 has the most accurate indicator of 400 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:12.539
 400 meters we got 400 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.030
 meters 13 52 seconds in general very much to myself 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.620
 good performance for this 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.360
 car and 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.360
 0 105 35 seconds 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.280
 let's summarize our review of 335 petrol 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.080
 92 body just wonderful 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.610
 car that will suit young 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.520
 a person who wants to get 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.980
 maximum dynamic out of the ordinary 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.880
 civilian car is the most powerful 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.470
 version in the third series if you want 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.380
 get beautiful design for relatively 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.020
 little money for this option you 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.820
 perfect service this 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.250
 the car will cost you dearly 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.850
 do not think that the service 3 series 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:02.360
 in the back of e92 cost a penny 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.060
 many elements such as brakes 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.990
 turbines and other engine parts 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.420
 cost enough impressive money if 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.870
 You want to get the maximum top 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.750
 version of a civilian car then 335 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:21.890
 diesel or 335 petrol completely 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.890
 to cope with your desires
