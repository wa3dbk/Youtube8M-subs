00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.399
 well these are from two to a new video 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.709
 well it seems that last night was the 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.660
 the stanzas one night live 'and good 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.639
 It seems that here there was a 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.179
 acting on the occasion of the presentation 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.820
 of the last of us that he has mastered and 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.640
 good a presentation with a performance 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.850
 with real actors in fact as this and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.030
 baker because he was the main actor and 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.130
 then it was also the one that doubled 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.480
 and was captured from movements for the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.620
 last of so we're going to see the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.450
 Main actors of the good game 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.610
 basically say that if you have not yes 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.780
 you have passed the game logically 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.300
 you do not see this news does not have any 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.490
 point sense that you see it because 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.540
 you are going to totally gut the end 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.860
 it seems that later when the 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.710
 action then a new one was presented 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.940
 end other than the one that we already saw is not 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.579
 asked the attendees not to 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.040
 will record and then today all the pages of 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.250
 news and others after they have detailed 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.800
 how was this ending not basically so 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.630
 in the end the end is transferred to you 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.200
 four years later 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.640
 then I will talk longer and longer about 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.289
 what you have about all this if you could 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.450
 be a second part of the beginning a 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.070
 second part or something like that and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.200
 good as I say behind it goes 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.950
 four years later and well basically 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.289
 They are already in the area of Tony and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.869
 you know in the hand of joel and others and 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.560
 well i went into eli's room and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.509
 I was listening to music and others I 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.159
 speak good that everything has me plans 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.829
 for a woman named done 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.360
 esther and others and good him and porsche him 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.490
 and he does not thank you very much you know 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.750
 It is quite protective and quite 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.610
 dry in that sense I today makes you a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.500
 gift not a gift that is a guitar 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.709
 a guitar and tells him to teach me to 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.750
 touch and so on and then again 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.819
 apart from that I tell you a joke and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.220
 the ego goes down because at the end it starts to 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.840
 try the guitar this connects 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.240
 perfectly with one of the news 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.209
 that we saw a while ago not a cartoonist 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.250
 of these art professionals and others 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.479
 well I draw nation to where he was and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.180
 playing a guitar and from there 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.540
 you transport people looking for it, not this 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.000
 could connect directly with 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.670
 second part of the game in the kind of 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.530
 this because he said it was an image of him 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.689
 staff that did not correspond to any 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.519
 type of project is nothing like that 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.859
 but it seems currently lying after 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.719
 of knowing all this so we can in 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.439
 a sequel directly and that image 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:35.409
 Well, I could connect the game with the 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:38.709
 second part is not already sought by 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.290
 people and a little older not in fact 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.639
 four years older so nothing 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.200
 we will see though what is happening this 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.840
 as I say it is an end to the secret of 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.760
 epilogue or whatever you want to call it and nothing 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.439
 we are kids we copies of this 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.700
 end might have been better than 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.739
 another I do not know 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.069
 this we do not go in the next video it 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.069
 approximate
