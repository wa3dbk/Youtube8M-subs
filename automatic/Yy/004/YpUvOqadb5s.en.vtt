00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
up this was kind of start to strengthen

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.530

because it kind of increases my balance
a<00:02:34.710> little<00:02:34.830> bit

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
a little bit

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.860

is really good sometimes for people with
plantar<00:03:02.760> fasciitis<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.810> might<00:03:03.989> help<00:03:04.110> with

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
plantar fasciitis this might help with

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.050 
plantar fasciitis this might help with
that<00:03:04.290> as<00:03:04.530> well<00:03:04.560> too<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:05.940> really

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
that as well too but it's really

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.990 
that as well too but it's really
stretching<00:03:06.450> your<00:03:06.569> Achilles<00:03:06.930> too<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.849> nice

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
stretching your Achilles too so the nice

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.460 
stretching your Achilles too so the nice
thing<00:03:09.180> about<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.480> steps<00:03:09.750> away<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.019> see<00:03:10.290> if<00:03:10.380> I

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
thing about the steps away is see if I

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.229 
thing about the steps away is see if I
can't<00:03:10.830> lose<00:03:11.069> my<00:03:11.220> balance<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.610> can<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:11.910> grab<00:03:12.060> it

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
can't lose my balance I can just grab it

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.089 
can't lose my balance I can just grab it
real<00:03:12.360> quick<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.230> was<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> sidewalk<00:03:13.830> or

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
real quick if I was on a sidewalk or

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.680 
real quick if I was on a sidewalk or
something<00:03:14.580> I'd<00:03:14.670> probably<00:03:14.849> have<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.420> step

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
something I'd probably have to like step

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.720 
something I'd probably have to like step
off<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.080> catch<00:03:16.230> myself<00:03:16.709> because<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.610> don't

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
off and catch myself because I don't

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.370 
off and catch myself because I don't
have<00:03:17.819> anything<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.090> grab<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.200> got<00:03:19.349> a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
have anything to grab on if you got a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.809 
have anything to grab on if you got a
halfway-decent<00:03:19.739> step<00:03:20.250> stool<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:20.580> kind<00:03:20.760> of

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
halfway-decent step stool it's kind of

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.699 
halfway-decent step stool it's kind of
nice<00:03:20.970> because<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.360> can<00:03:21.390> kind<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:22.680> that

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
nice because you can kind of do that

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.390 
nice because you can kind of do that
stretch<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.459> then<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> always<00:03:23.940> try<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:25.340> kind<00:03:26.340> of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
stretch and then I always try to kind of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.490 
stretch and then I always try to kind of
not<00:03:26.700> hold<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.810> step<00:03:27.989> stool<00:03:28.110> as<00:03:28.260> much

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
not hold on to the step stool as much

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.050 
not hold on to the step stool as much
because<00:03:29.250> that's<00:03:29.519> really<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.910> make<00:03:30.000> a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
because that's really going to make a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.509 
because that's really going to make a
lot<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.299> those<00:03:30.450> muscles<00:03:31.069> really<00:03:32.069> kind<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.370> work

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
lot of those muscles really kind of work

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.100 
lot of those muscles really kind of work
for<00:03:32.730> themselves<00:03:33.330> if<00:03:33.450> you're<00:03:33.569> not<00:03:33.690> holding<00:03:33.900> on

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
for themselves if you're not holding on

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.780 
for themselves if you're not holding on
but<00:03:34.769> occasionally<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.400> might<00:03:35.549> lose<00:03:35.730> your

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
but occasionally you might lose your

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.100 
but occasionally you might lose your
balance<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.330> kind<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.720> grab<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.080> like

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
balance and kind of have to grab it like

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.800 
balance and kind of have to grab it like
this<00:03:37.410> kinda<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.099> I'm<00:03:38.250> doing<00:03:38.660> if<00:03:39.660> you're

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
this kinda like I'm doing if you're

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.690 
this kinda like I'm doing if you're
going<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.989> want<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.140> go<00:03:40.260> back<00:03:40.410> up<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.860> usually<00:03:41.640> do

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
going to want to go back up I usually do

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.390 
going to want to go back up I usually do
this<00:03:41.880> three<00:03:42.150> about<00:03:43.110> three<00:03:43.319> times<00:03:43.530> pretty<00:03:44.280> much

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
this three about three times pretty much

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.880 
this three about three times pretty much
every<00:03:44.640> time<00:03:44.760> before<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.090> run<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.620> said

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
every time before I run like I said

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.140 
every time before I run like I said
because<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.130> run<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.459> more<00:03:47.549> minimalist<00:03:48.030> type

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
because I run in more minimalist type

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.400 
because I run in more minimalist type
shoes<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.599> really<00:03:48.870> want<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.110> keep<00:03:49.260> my

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
shoes so I really want to keep my

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.509 
shoes so I really want to keep my
Achilles<00:03:49.890> tendon<00:03:50.069> stretched<00:03:50.670> out<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:53.430> they're

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
Achilles tendon stretched out so they're

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.370 
Achilles tendon stretched out so they're
going<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.820> up<00:03:54.060> you're<00:03:54.959> basically<00:03:55.290> just

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
going to go up you're basically just

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.069 
going to go up you're basically just
going<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.650> go<00:03:55.769> down<00:03:56.600> I'm<00:03:57.600> not<00:03:57.780> going<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.959> hold

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
going to go down I'm not going to hold

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.660 
going to go down I'm not going to hold
it<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.380> whole<00:03:58.530> 15<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.920> 20<00:03:59.160> seconds<00:03:59.519> but

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
it for the whole 15 to 20 seconds but

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.860 
it for the whole 15 to 20 seconds but
you<00:03:59.760> can<00:03:59.880> kind<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.090> get<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.299> idea<00:04:00.329> that

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
you can kind of get the idea that

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.900 
you can kind of get the idea that
sometimes<00:04:01.620> I'll<00:04:01.829> alternate<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.579> try<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.760> get

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
sometimes I'll alternate and try to get

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.360 
sometimes I'll alternate and try to get
a<00:04:02.940> deeper<00:04:03.239> stretch<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.630> each<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.959> them<00:04:04.370> and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
a deeper stretch in each of them and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.949 
a deeper stretch in each of them and
this<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.670> where<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.910> steps<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.329> also<00:04:06.660> helps<00:04:06.900> a

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
this is where the steps to also helps a

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.520 
this is where the steps to also helps a
lot<00:04:07.079> too<00:04:09.200> okay<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:11.130> that's<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> first<00:04:11.459> stress

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
lot too okay so that's the first stress

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.630 
lot too okay so that's the first stress
you're<00:04:13.530> also<00:04:13.680> going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.980> want<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.310> kind<00:04:14.609> of

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
you're also going to want to kind of

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.000 
you're also going to want to kind of
loosen<00:04:14.790> up<00:04:15.000> your<00:04:15.150> soleus<00:04:15.359> muscle<00:04:15.900> I've<00:04:16.829> been
