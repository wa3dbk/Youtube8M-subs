my<00:02:09.020> brother<00:02:09.260> will<00:02:09.470> probably<00:02:09.979> end<00:02:10.100> up<00:02:10.220> taking

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
my brother will probably end up taking

my brother will probably end up taking
it<00:02:10.580> back<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.060> 50s<00:02:11.420> again<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.810> year<00:02:12.050> he

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it back to the 50s again this year he

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.690 
it back to the 50s again this year he
went<00:02:13.070> last<00:02:13.250> year<00:02:13.460> so<00:02:15.160> maybe<00:02:16.160> if<00:02:16.400> you're<00:02:16.580> up

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700

weekend or next whenever he comes to get
it<00:02:26.950> we'll<00:02:27.069> probably<00:02:27.220> get<00:02:27.430> some<00:02:27.580> more<00:02:27.730> video

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
it we'll probably get some more video

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000 
it we'll probably get some more video
but<00:02:29.520> until<00:02:30.520> then
