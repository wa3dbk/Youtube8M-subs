that<00:00:37.699> I've<00:00:37.850> got<00:00:37.879> all<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.079> Homa<00:00:39.260> sewed<00:00:39.559> down<00:00:40.870> so

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
that I've got all the Homa sewed down so

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.680 
that I've got all the Homa sewed down so
far<00:00:42.399> I've<00:00:43.399> got<00:00:43.579> this<00:00:43.699> little<00:00:43.909> island<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.539> this

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
far I've got this little island to this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.029 
far I've got this little island to this
to<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.050> right<00:00:45.229> of<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.409> door<00:00:45.589> when<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.920> walk

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
to the right of the door when you walk

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.489 
to the right of the door when you walk
in<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.729> don't<00:00:47.120> really<00:00:47.420> have<00:00:47.659> a<00:00:47.690> specific<00:00:47.870> plan<00:00:48.440> I

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
in I don't really have a specific plan I

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
think I had mentioned before that I was

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.139 
think I had mentioned before that I was
planning<00:00:50.629> on<00:00:50.870> possibly<00:00:51.319> putting<00:00:51.649> a<00:00:51.979> field<00:00:52.699> or

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
planning on possibly putting a field or

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.189 
planning on possibly putting a field or
some<00:00:53.839> type<00:00:54.079> of<00:00:54.699> ditch<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.030> irrigation<00:00:56.600> system

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
some type of ditch and irrigation system

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.680 
some type of ditch and irrigation system
on<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.039> very<00:00:58.219> end<00:00:58.429> of<00:00:58.579> this<00:00:58.760> with<00:00:59.510> some

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
on the very end of this with some

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.570 
on the very end of this with some
workers<00:01:00.969> got<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.620> elevations<00:01:03.620> in<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.280> the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
workers got the elevations in and the

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.660 
workers got the elevations in and the
two<00:01:04.760> loops<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.420> will<00:01:05.690> be<00:01:05.840> enclosed<00:01:06.670> pretty

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
two loops that will be enclosed pretty

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.529 
two loops that will be enclosed pretty
much<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.119> mountain<00:01:10.000> where<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.119> see<00:01:11.360> the

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
much in a mountain where you see the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.420 
much in a mountain where you see the
blue<00:01:12.670> unit<00:01:13.670> track<00:01:13.909> joyner<00:01:14.390> remover<00:01:15.079> that<00:01:15.430> will

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.819 
blue unit track joyner remover that will
be<00:01:16.579> about<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.240> place<00:01:17.750> where<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.619> mountain

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
be about the place where a mountain

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.340 
be about the place where a mountain
starts<00:01:19.369> up<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.850> covers<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:20.450> inner<00:01:20.750> loop<00:01:21.079> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
starts up and covers that inner loop and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.029 
starts up and covers that inner loop and
the<00:01:21.560> mountain<00:01:21.890> will<00:01:23.049> go<00:01:24.049> up<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.409> cover<00:01:24.740> both

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
the mountain will go up and cover both

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.330 
the mountain will go up and cover both
of<00:01:25.219> those<00:01:25.549> loops<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:27.229> can<00:01:27.289> see<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.649> turnout<00:01:28.189> in

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
of those loops you can see a turnout in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.270 
of those loops you can see a turnout in
the<00:01:28.460> picture<00:01:28.820> here<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.469> the<00:01:30.680> right-hand

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the picture here just on the right-hand

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.770 
the picture here just on the right-hand
side<00:01:31.399> of<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.789> turnout<00:01:32.299> there'll<00:01:32.600> be<00:01:32.630> a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
side of that turnout there'll be a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.450 
side of that turnout there'll be a
tunnel<00:01:33.079> portal<00:01:33.500> there<00:01:33.679> that<00:01:33.859> comes<00:01:34.039> out<00:01:34.310> of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
tunnel portal there that comes out of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.959 
tunnel portal there that comes out of
the<00:01:34.520> mountain<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:36.200> will<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:37.609> mountain<00:01:37.909> that

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
the mountain it will the mountain that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.380 
the mountain it will the mountain that
will<00:01:38.090> cover<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:38.600> whole<00:01:38.840> section<00:01:39.320> here<00:01:39.350> and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
will cover this whole section here and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.849 
will cover this whole section here and
just<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.600> front<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.929> those<00:01:41.990> locomotives<00:01:42.710> but

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
just in front of those locomotives but

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.380 
just in front of those locomotives but
on<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.070> inside<00:01:43.219> loop<00:01:43.759> there<00:01:44.060> will<00:01:44.210> be<00:01:44.240> a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
on the inside loop there will be a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.480 
on the inside loop there will be a
tunnel<00:01:44.689> portal<00:01:45.140> there<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.710> comes<00:01:45.920> out<00:01:46.159> and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
tunnel portal there that comes out and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.310 
tunnel portal there that comes out and
then<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.700> traffic<00:01:47.390> will<00:01:47.509> proceed<00:01:47.869> underneath

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
then the traffic will proceed underneath

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.709 
then the traffic will proceed underneath
the<00:01:48.560> bridge<00:01:48.799> here<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.420> basically<00:01:50.420> that

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
the bridge here and basically that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.480 
the bridge here and basically that
portion<00:01:51.499> there<00:01:51.679> will<00:01:51.829> be<00:01:51.859> the<00:01:52.070> only<00:01:52.189> part

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
portion there will be the only part

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.719 
portion there will be the only part
exposed<00:01:52.880> outside<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.600> mountain<00:01:54.729> where

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
exposed outside of the mountain where

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.459 
exposed outside of the mountain where
the<00:01:55.969> locomotives<00:01:56.600> are<00:01:56.749> actually<00:01:57.229> sitting

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
the locomotives are actually sitting

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.219 
the locomotives are actually sitting
right<00:01:57.740> now<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.310> back<00:01:58.549> loop<00:01:59.079> they<00:02:00.079> will

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
right now on the back loop they will

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.749 
right now on the back loop they will
come<00:02:00.439> out<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.770> hortal<00:02:01.189> right<00:02:01.429> in<00:02:01.579> that<00:02:01.700> area

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
come out of a hortal right in that area

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.410

to<00:02:24.090> actually<00:02:24.330> add<00:02:25.100> side<00:02:26.100> plates<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> side

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
to actually add side plates to the side

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.500 
to actually add side plates to the side
of<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.960> unit<00:02:28.650> track<00:02:28.890> piece<00:02:29.220> itself<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.090> form<00:02:30.390> a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
of the unit track piece itself to form a

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.980 
of the unit track piece itself to form a
bridge<00:02:31.850> behind<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.120> if<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.450> remember<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
bridge behind that if you remember the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.900 
bridge behind that if you remember the
old<00:02:34.140> layout<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:34.830> was<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> Mesa<00:02:35.340> back<00:02:35.670> there

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
old layout there was a Mesa back there

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.730 
old layout there was a Mesa back there
I'm<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.270> build<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.660> up<00:02:36.720> by<00:02:37.050> two<00:02:37.110> inches

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
I'm going to build that up by two inches

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.320 
I'm going to build that up by two inches
and<00:02:38.010> put<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.250> Mesa<00:02:38.490> back<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:39.060> its<00:02:39.210> original

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
and put the Mesa back in its original

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.870 
and put the Mesa back in its original
location<00:02:39.900> back<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.400> little

plan to include two 28 inch radiuses to
make<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.959> s<00:03:28.290> sweep<00:03:29.100> here<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.850> looks<00:03:30.060> much

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
make this s sweep here it looks much

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.060 
make this s sweep here it looks much
better<00:03:30.510> than<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.080> sharper<00:03:31.530> curves<00:03:31.800> and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
better than the sharper curves and

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.370 
better than the sharper curves and
straights<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.700> had<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.120> there<00:03:33.270> before

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.229 
straights that I had in there before
that<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.590> last-minute<00:03:35.150> modification<00:03:38.239> I'm

where it's going to go that will also be
in<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.000> cut<00:03:48.330> there<00:03:49.260> will<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.410> some<00:03:49.650> elevated

in a cut there will be some elevated
ground<00:03:50.820> work<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.390> front<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.840> there<00:03:52.050> will

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
ground work in front of that there will

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.800 
ground work in front of that there will
be<00:03:52.170> homes<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:53.190> my<00:03:53.700> mobile<00:03:54.030> home<00:03:54.120> park<00:03:54.450> will<00:03:54.630> go

in<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.140> area<00:03:55.200> there<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.950> am<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.090> see<00:03:57.239> if

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
in that area there I am that see if

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.630 
in that area there I am that see if
that's<00:03:57.480> what<00:03:57.570> I'm<00:03:57.660> thinking<00:03:58.020> now<00:03:58.400> pretty<00:03:59.400> much

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
that's what I'm thinking now pretty much

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.420 
that's what I'm thinking now pretty much
what<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.030> see<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.690> shot<00:04:01.050> is<00:04:01.410> what<00:04:02.250> was

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
what you see in this shot is what was

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.930 
what you see in this shot is what was
already<00:04:02.670> there<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.420> last<00:04:03.630> video<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.940> box

thinking of putting the Roundhouse and
turntable<00:04:15.030> back<00:04:15.239> in<00:04:15.599> that<00:04:15.780> area<00:04:16.549> again<00:04:17.549> and

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.320 

you<00:04:22.169> can<00:04:22.320> see<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:22.919> have<00:04:23.550> one<00:04:23.790> power<00:04:24.030> pack

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
you can see I just have one power pack

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.840 
you can see I just have one power pack
of<00:04:24.540> stuff<00:04:24.720> right<00:04:24.930> now<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:26.400> Amtrak<00:04:26.820> train

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
of stuff right now and the Amtrak train

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.920 
of stuff right now and the Amtrak train
is<00:04:27.389> on<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.750> inner<00:04:27.930> loop<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:29.870> BNSF<00:04:30.870> train

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
is on the inner loop and the BNSF train

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.379 
is on the inner loop and the BNSF train
is<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.650> outer<00:04:31.800> loop<00:04:32.160> but<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.880> am<00:04:33.060> able<00:04:33.270> to

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
is on the outer loop but I am able to

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.170 
is on the outer loop but I am able to
run<00:04:33.630> them<00:04:33.810> all<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.050> way<00:04:34.169> around<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.650> layout

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
run them all the way around the layout

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.150 
run them all the way around the layout
and<00:04:36.180> that's<00:04:36.930> pretty<00:04:37.169> much<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.680> for<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:38.010> update

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
and that's pretty much it for the update

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.780 
and that's pretty much it for the update
for<00:04:38.970> today<00:04:39.620> I'll<00:04:40.620> keep<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:41.010> posted<00:04:41.040> as<00:04:41.760> the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
for today I'll keep you posted as the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.180 
for today I'll keep you posted as the
progress<00:04:42.479> goes<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.290> yard<00:04:43.500> area<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.100> the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
progress goes on the yard area and the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.710 
progress goes on the yard area and the
more<00:04:44.400> tracks<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.270> get<00:04:45.479> nailed<00:04:45.750> down<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:47.720> I

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
more tracks that I get nailed down and I

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.620 
more tracks that I get nailed down and I
might<00:04:49.169> post<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.710> video<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.430> how<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.030> knew<00:04:51.419> my

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
might post a video on how I knew my

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.960 
might post a video on how I knew my
grades<00:04:53.330> later<00:04:54.330> on<00:04:54.540> today<00:04:54.810> if<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.080> get<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.290> chance

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
grades later on today if I get a chance

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.250 
grades later on today if I get a chance
it's<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.060> pretty<00:04:57.240> simple<00:04:57.510> method<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.169> I'll

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
it's a pretty simple method and I'll

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.409 
it's a pretty simple method and I'll
explain<00:04:58.650> how<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:59.100> done<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.370> anybody<00:05:00.030> can

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
explain how it's done and anybody can

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.780 
explain how it's done and anybody can
anybody<00:05:01.169> can<00:05:01.410> manage<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.070> for<00:05:02.580> right<00:05:02.760> now

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
anybody can manage it and for right now

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.629 
anybody can manage it and for right now
I'll<00:05:03.300> just<00:05:03.530> run<00:05:04.530> around<00:05:04.650> with<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.130> two<00:05:05.280> trains

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
I'll just run around with the two trains

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.210 
I'll just run around with the two trains
there<00:05:06.419> obviously<00:05:07.380> I'm<00:05:07.500> prototypically

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
there obviously I'm prototypically

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.400 
there obviously I'm prototypically
running<00:05:09.000> side<00:05:09.240> by<00:05:09.270> side<00:05:09.690> but<00:05:09.990> it's<00:05:10.139> just<00:05:10.200> to

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
running side by side but it's just to

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.909 
running side by side but it's just to
prove<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:10.860> they<00:05:11.100> do<00:05:11.880> run<00:05:12.060> on<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.389> loops<00:05:12.919> the

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
prove that they do run on the loops the

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.180 
prove that they do run on the loops the
sharp<00:05:14.250> curves<00:05:14.639> down<00:05:15.240> here<00:05:15.570> at<00:05:15.660> this<00:05:15.810> end

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
sharp curves down here at this end

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.730 
sharp curves down here at this end
relatively<00:05:17.190> sharp<00:05:17.430> curves<00:05:18.260> will<00:05:19.260> be<00:05:19.410> inside

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
relatively sharp curves will be inside

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.230 
relatively sharp curves will be inside
the<00:05:19.889> mountain<00:05:20.220> so<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.460> won't<00:05:20.789> see<00:05:21.030> the

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
the mountain so you won't see the

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.150 
the mountain so you won't see the
overlap<00:05:21.539> of<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.900> cars<00:05:22.200> you<00:05:22.680> know<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.979> cars

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
overlap of the cars you know the cars

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.090 
overlap of the cars you know the cars
overhanging<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:24.710> curves<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:25.950> they

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
overhanging the the curves that they

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.740 
overhanging the the curves that they
will<00:05:26.250> be<00:05:26.430> they'll<00:05:26.850> be<00:05:26.910> hidden<00:05:27.150> from<00:05:27.300> sight<00:05:27.570> and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
will be they'll be hidden from sight and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.930 
will be they'll be hidden from sight and
then<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.560> hole<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.070> center<00:05:29.430> there<00:05:29.639> gives

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
then the hole in the center there gives

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.290 
then the hole in the center there gives
me<00:05:30.120> access<00:05:31.310> in<00:05:32.310> case<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:32.669> have<00:05:32.820> trouble<00:05:33.150> with

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
me access in case I have trouble with

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.709 
me access in case I have trouble with
the<00:05:33.419> Train

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.129 

that's<00:05:38.379> pretty<00:05:38.619> much<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:39.069> for<00:05:39.249> today<00:05:39.309> I<00:05:40.139> sure

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
that's pretty much it for today I sure

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.139 
that's pretty much it for today I sure
