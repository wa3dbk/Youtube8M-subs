00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello all the people who follow me on 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.740
 youtube channel know my passion 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.690
 for final fantasy but most likely 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.890
 they do not know that I am also a great man 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.039
 car enthusiast and therefore 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 since I can't afford supercars 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.330
 the only way was to create me 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.150
 a specially designed driving position 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.780
 to fulfill this wish for a while 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 speed as much as one can for 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.670
 how much fun you can have 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:45.750
 I show you now what I 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 created is a post I made 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 completely from scratch it was made in 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.010
 wood and then coated with an adhesive i 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.010
 like carbon fiber 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.689
 the fulcrum of the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:11.400
 driving is the is the body of the steering wheel 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:16.340
 thrustmaster t300 rs this we see 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.590
 mounted instead is the steering wheel of the t500 rs 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 here instead we see the original steering wheel 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.259
 than 300 rs instead this is the woman 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 of the version for formula 1 then 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:35.009
 I will be able to drive in modern car mode 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.880
 with compact from the Formula 1 steering wheel and car 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.110
 instead classic without fathers on the steering wheel 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.250
 or even rally then I also took a 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.250
 other add on that the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.420
 the th8 always has thrustmaster with 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.630
 manual transmission and the possibility of 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.899
 apply this part here to have a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:07.890
 sequential change then again I have 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:10.049
 combined with the p3p pedals, I open one 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.750
 pedals completely in metal with 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:16.019
 clutch and a brake enough 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.049
 realistic then I put also various 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.030
 some aluminum almond rugs 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.660
 monster energy stickers for 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 take back the car color a little and 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.099
 which inspired me then there is the bath 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 kicker mounted under the seat 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:41.730
 of the simone racing and the bar kicker not 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.410
 I know if I can see it and this 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.840
 red and black part is practically a 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.870
 great vibrator that gives a little idea of 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.859
 machine movement when yes 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.560
 take the curbs or holes or when 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.410
 you hit some other cars 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.519
 then I paired a keyboard for 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.620
 increase or a little bit the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:11.900
 functionality therefore to have more keys 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:15.060
 available and what else I think everything here 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.609
 I'll show you the location too 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.910
 this is a 40 inch screen now 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.920
 inside is inserted project cars 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.650
 play with playstation 4 this is 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.829
 the amplifier of the kicker buck these 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.790
 branched audio re and a game like this 5.1 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.620
 it works works pretty well for 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.360
 some races must even be put on 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.110
 the gloves why 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.840
 it becomes quite tiring as far as 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:51.990
 t3 100 rs has a force feedback 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.960
 quite adjustable but some races 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.910
 they are hard and could come too 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.910
 chic and therefore use gloves 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.600
 in short this is another great one of mine 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.600
 passion 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.570
 thanks for viewing 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.570
