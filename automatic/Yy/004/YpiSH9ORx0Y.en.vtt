00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.370
 generally talk in this video tutorial 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.370
 a bit about macro photography 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 many of you wanted to come too 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800
 Looking into macro photography a bit 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.470
 the problem is marco lenses like that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.599
 rp pour very very expensive over 1000 euro 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 and what is what and not with one 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.380
 language macro cuts certain 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.360
 shots and that's why I thought there 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.980
 it and what cheap alternatives there 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.320
 these things come into play here 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.060
 These hot extension tubes are her 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.520
 bring new lens farther away from 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.680
 sensor which makes them closer 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.780
 you can focus the more you have 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 the more could focus 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.379
 but the only disadvantage is her 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.609
 does not lose like that all 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.649
 works and how well it works 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.690
 for only 20 euros 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.969
 look at the recordings now 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 we with the tripod 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 because it is already a bit 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.129
 dark and there must be with the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 Shut down like mine 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.920
 still sharp pictures 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.719
 I would like to push this list up 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.300
 picture does not rustle will therefore watch 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.880
 us around here so in the dirt or 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.150
 something where you can make beautiful marco pictures 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.630
 can 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 maybe you can find a spider 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.630
 problematic now with the things with 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.500
 the sn shove is you see it here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.440
 are three things 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 we can take some with you then 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.630
 you can not focus so close anymore 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.430
 which is also not so bad 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 partly because it comes with three things 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 you really ran extremely close 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.540
 I go here I do not take any pictures 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.990
 I'm filming for you so that you better 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.660
 you can see that and how I see it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.060
 everything completely just go green 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.050
 we extremely it can can be new items, 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.050
 zoom in and out 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.250
 we see how close we serve up some leaves 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.250
 must now let's start to slowly 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.100
 aha there is what you already know 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.920
 it works very well 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.430
 everything is sharp we really get it 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.710
 a very good marco picture on the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.970
 can see me but collected correctly 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.800
 cool location found here there 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.450
 important lot of garbage properly many as 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.130
 small stuff what the photographs can 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.670
 and keep getting what they sing 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.200
 to be able to 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.130
 here it goes to this time part 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.890
 here and just filmed but now 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.360
 come opponents quiet times in the photo mode 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.640
 so i am in the liveview you can see 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.010
 as they have practically everywhere only 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.860
 burke and here for people with macro 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.350
 photography is a high walls 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.770
 perfectly normal if you are on macro 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 18 is practically nothing left 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.950
 focus as impossible anything sharp 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.570
 So to get us going on 8 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.370
 or something he will be recommended 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.820
 then you also manage to make it 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.820
 hinzubekommen 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.380
 I already noticed 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.870
 you have to be relatively close with his 15 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.870
 mm objectively but has already mentioned that 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.540
 so on 11 8 against small secret tip 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.540
 you can use fd lenses 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.890
 what I'll get out for a second 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.910
 Now we have such a part here 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.709
 here is a canon 135 f28 fd lens 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.300
 ever have a video about this effective 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.170
 made the thing has only 50 euros 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.850
 tasted 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.230
 here is a link to the video 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.370
 Weakness from these objective things 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.410
 then probably see you later 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.620
 This is relatively soft on the lighter 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.410
 so end up at 284 but here at the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.150
 macro photography anyway on 11 8 and 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.040
 higher photographs are just as well 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.840
 good as the modern glasses that 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.130
 Let's try times out because 135 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.530
 we do not have to go that close anymore 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.110
 the good is we have now on the 135 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.820
 can already see we are extremely involved 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.050
 two of the object away so not even 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.090
 the problem with the five millimeters 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.709
 objectively have so strict is with this 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.720
 Camera synonymous not a photo but piece 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.820
 records you can see that, too, of course 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.890
 synonymous for videos use no problem 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.540
 you can can you see it nice to 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.090
 Here again from the focus on the focus 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.650
 how close came up to me was so 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.680
 far away we can just enter 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.410
 a little bit around 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.690
 can explore and other areas 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.190
 you see the picture also super sharp 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.110
 There's nothing to complain about 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.760
 Great look for all that practically only 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.790
 for 70 euros 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.379
 that's why it's just awesome so now 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.250
 To sum up what 's up to these things 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.670
 to say here 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.440
 contra light loss that is called man 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.180
 usually needs a low shutter 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.870
 So moving objects are mostly 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.820
 hard to get 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.460
 It is then the day is bright 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.669
 Of course this is the high point it is 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.220
 totally cheap 20 euro are no reason 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.990
 not to buy for 20 euro 30 euro whole 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.190
 filled in 50 euros only difference 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.450
 is they are better then installed 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.220
 installed a bit worse 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.540
 but that's just like what you are 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.610
 usually needs when this small 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.139
 Differences depending on your purse 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.030
 So really differentiate 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.130
 all because it is so fascinating is now 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.450
 renovates really better than you think like 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.229
 So you can see it's great 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.610
 macro pictures 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.200
 there is virtually no difference to 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.720
 a memorial competitive except of course 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.350
 that she has good autofocus then too 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.570
 Conclusion 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.460
 if not, get it if it too 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.380
 only for a certain schott need 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.430
 once a shot of the eye or something 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.320
 then you do not need one 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.970
 lent macro lens or something else 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.830
 Just buy this thing that is 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.660
 end effect cheaper and you still have 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.120
 what what could reintun in your gadget 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.530
 yes on fresh video fallen guys 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.060
 to look the same lab 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.860
 here are some rest videos you 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.270
 could find one interesting 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.979
 thumb up since I got up 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.770
 facebook is he can he almost does 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.460
 live daily from high was seen 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.460
 is next time
