cardboard put mixed it together

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.330 
cardboard put mixed it together
real<00:00:56.730> fine<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:57.989> mixed<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.649> some

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
real fine and I also mixed in some

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.180 
real fine and I also mixed in some
shredded<00:00:59.969> tar<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.649> say<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.010> some

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
shredded tar or would say like some

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.759 
shredded tar or would say like some
shredded<00:01:02.670> tire<00:01:03.180> material<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.439> was<00:01:04.589> some

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
shredded tire material there was some

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.270 
shredded tire material there was some
black<00:01:05.070> rubber<00:01:05.640> molding<00:01:06.380> really<00:01:07.380> thick<00:01:07.770> heavy

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
black rubber molding really thick heavy

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.890 
black rubber molding really thick heavy
hard<00:01:09.210> bendable<00:01:10.610> rubber<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
hard bendable rubber that it would be I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.740 
hard bendable rubber that it would be I
guess<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.229> closest<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:14.570> relate<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
guess the closest you would relate it to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.070 
guess the closest you would relate it to
would<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> rubber<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> car<00:01:17.520> tire<00:01:18.080> since

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
would be a rubber on a car tire since

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.890 
would be a rubber on a car tire since
it's<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> petroleum-based<00:01:20.009> product<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:21.780> if

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it's a petroleum-based product like if

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.649 
it's a petroleum-based product like if
you<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.200> tire<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.369> fire<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> gonna<00:01:24.299> burn

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you little tire on fire it is gonna burn

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870 
you little tire on fire it is gonna burn
and<00:01:24.900> burn<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> burn<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.799> won't<00:01:26.100> stop<00:01:26.400> burning

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and burn and burn and won't stop burning

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
and burn and burn and won't stop burning
so<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> figured<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.229> shredded<00:01:28.970> tire

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so I figured if I put some shredded tire

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
so I figured if I put some shredded tire
material<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:31.530> shredded<00:01:31.979> tar<00:01:32.250> or<00:01:32.549> I

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
material in there or shredded tar or I

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.200 
material in there or shredded tar or I
guess<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> would<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.720> tar<00:01:34.939> it's<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
guess that would be tar it's going to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.120 
guess that would be tar it's going to
just<00:01:36.360> help<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.869> burn<00:01:37.110> process<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.860> keep<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
just help the burn process and keep it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
just help the burn process and keep it
burning<00:01:38.280> longer<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.000> made<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.869> mixture

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
burning longer I made this mixture

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.950 
burning longer I made this mixture
shredded<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.430> laid<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> big

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
shredded it all up laid it out on a big

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.389 
shredded it all up laid it out on a big
piece<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.140> cardboard<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.340> of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
piece of cardboard and then on top of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.899 
piece of cardboard and then on top of
that<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.880> poured<00:01:45.299> charcoal<00:01:46.130> lighting<00:01:47.130> fluid<00:01:47.729> on

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that I poured charcoal lighting fluid on

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.510 
that I poured charcoal lighting fluid on
there<00:01:48.210> let<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.200> sit<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> couple<00:01:50.310> days

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
there let that sit out for a couple days

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.480 
there let that sit out for a couple days
in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> Sun<00:01:51.119> let<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> dry<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.799> poured<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
in the Sun let it dry then poured it in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.870 
in the Sun let it dry then poured it in
this<00:01:53.670> bottle<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> did<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.579> put<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
this bottle what I did was I put it in a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.819 
this bottle what I did was I put it in a
vitamin<00:01:57.270> bottle<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.469> all<00:01:58.680> the

fire<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:53.610> obviously<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.940> leaves<00:03:55.120> are<00:03:55.210> on

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
fire and obviously the leaves are on

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.720 
fire and obviously the leaves are on
fire<00:03:55.450> but<00:03:56.200> as<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.560> can<00:03:56.650> see<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:57.280> stuff<00:03:57.490> works

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
fire but as you can see the stuff works

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.060 
fire but as you can see the stuff works
great<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.240> it's<00:03:58.420> gonna<00:03:58.510> continue<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:59.470> burn<00:03:59.770> I

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
great and it's gonna continue to burn I

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.660 
great and it's gonna continue to burn I
believe<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.060> tar<00:04:01.450> in<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.110> is<00:04:03.070> also<00:04:03.340> going<00:04:03.580> to

believe the tar in it is also going to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.070 
believe the tar in it is also going to
help<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:04.060> burn<00:04:04.210> as<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> petroleum-based

the<00:04:32.490> tar<00:04:32.729> in<00:04:32.879> there<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.090> mean<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.569> don't<00:04:33.930> think<00:04:34.080> it

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
the tar in there I mean I don't think it

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.330 
the tar in there I mean I don't think it
really<00:04:34.379> matters<00:04:34.530> because<00:04:34.889> once<00:04:35.069> I<00:04:35.129> have<00:04:35.219> that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
really matters because once I have that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.529 
really matters because once I have that
lighter<00:04:35.520> fluid<00:04:35.639> stuff<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.270> there<00:04:36.389> I<00:04:36.419> think

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
lighter fluid stuff in there I think

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.689 
lighter fluid stuff in there I think
it's<00:04:36.810> fine<00:04:37.050> but<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.979> tar<00:04:38.219> is<00:04:38.400> just<00:04:38.520> going<00:04:38.639> to

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
it's fine but the tar is just going to

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.640 
it's fine but the tar is just going to
give<00:04:38.819> it<00:04:38.909> that<00:04:38.939> little<00:04:39.210> little<00:04:39.990> boost<00:04:40.229> almost

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
give it that little little boost almost

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.260 
give it that little little boost almost
like<00:04:40.830> when<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.580> dip<00:04:41.819> a<00:04:41.969> cotton<00:04:42.449> ball<00:04:42.810> in

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
like when you dip a cotton ball in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.469

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
it's a petroleum product it's going to

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.709

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
there just to give it that little oomph

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.869 
there just to give it that little oomph
to<00:04:50.219> keep<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.550> going<00:04:50.699> and<00:04:51.090> as<00:04:51.479> you<00:04:51.659> can<00:04:51.810> see<00:04:52.879> it's
