 car air conditioning is no longer hit 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.099
 this Sunday 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.099
 fortune and even security 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.630
 but as everything in life this equipment also evolves is becoming object of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.199
 desire now is to keep the air conditioning 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.560
 the most digital 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.960

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.239
 each can control the air-conditioning the preferred 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.760
 in terms of cost of preventive maintenance the automatic air-conditioning 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.580
 digital is the same as 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.810
 only that an eventual repair can be up to 60% more expensive 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.390

 The first tip is to turn the air conditioner on for five 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.110
 least once a week 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.900
 but not to appear employees of other guests 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.110

 the spain that an eventual loss you will resort to 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.029
 It's worth to say that this is difficult to happen. 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:33.349
