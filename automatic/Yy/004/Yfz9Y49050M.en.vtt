00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello to you all hk and today we will 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.940
 consider mod with which you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.069
 you can improve absolutely any 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.690
 tools and even to improve with 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.969
 using enchant so much 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.040
 and how is it done let's see 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.880
 first we need obsidian and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160
 idle time 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 or do absolutely any fuel and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.810
 after we fry obsidian here 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.480
 I get a ruby I do not understand how 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.279
 way it happens ask the author 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.230
 if you find it and after we 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 obsidian fried you get a ruby 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.809
 what we do next we just go 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.730
 workbench we put any not enchanted because 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.950
 the main thing that it was not used 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 for example, if we use all of it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.629
 we will not improve like this 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.399
 way and we need to be full 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.440
 thing of course you can almost not just 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.010
 having shoved two identical spades but it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.260
 never mind 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.980
 let's shove one shovel in now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.629
 workbench and one ruby and we get 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.480
 daimon sat plus i mean we have red 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.219
 diamond improved spade 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.690
 how does she act but is effective in 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.330
 Overall very well that is 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.000
 digs up the ground she pretty quickly let's 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.710
 right now I'll go to the game mod to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 show you this here in my little bit 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.619
 earth if it is infinite but it is no longer 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.960
 important 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.869
 next we cut down our game geek and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.970
 see how it drips as you see drips 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.890
 she is really very fast but so 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.220
 how do we have some more land we 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 we can also enchant this shovel yes yes 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.450
 enchant enchanted shovel and in general 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.460
 let us have her spellbound efficiency 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.350
 2 experience and how lucky we are naturally not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.979
 for the first time so lucky and look like she 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.659
 dripping drips she's just super fast me 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.259
 Of course I understand that many can 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.680
 count 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.200
 This mod is very cheating but for this 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.780
 to get obsidian we need 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 first get diamonds then make 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.909
 diamond pickaxe so don't forget about 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.549
 well and so say a small bonus from 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.439
 the author now we can paint the diamonds 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.810
 no no no no don't you think what 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.680
 somehow we do one workbench 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 the ground 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.910
 we somehow make stack 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 diamonds are actually very, very 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.540
 difficult process to start us 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.870
 you will need to mine 81 coal 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.860
 imagine 81 coal is coal not 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.180
 some woody next we have him 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.660
 put in this way the workbench 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.340
 and we get a mini daimon we don't 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.280
 we can use in craft some 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.200
 stove tools and so on we have it 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.550
 can only be used in craft 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.510
 diamond itself 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.820
 that 's the way he crafts and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.430
 Diamond is our favorite Daimi which we are all 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.650
 x train and so on, but in general we have 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.709
 was today so small but i 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.500
 I think a very good mod which 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.080
 quite creative not that all others 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.000
 ore mods and especially with such a bun and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.320
 in general, that is, whether it is here 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.270
 subscribe to channel like 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.000
 call your friends and leave your 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.700
 comment or rather speculation about that 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.489
 how rubies appeared from obsidian and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.030
 Generally with you there was a spoon all good luck and 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.030
 bye everyone
