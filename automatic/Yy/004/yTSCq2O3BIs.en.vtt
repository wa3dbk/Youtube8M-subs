00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
want me to test for this and I will try

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.749 
want me to test for this and I will try
to<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.030> those<00:01:54.720> are<00:01:54.869> two<00:01:54.899> particular

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
to do so so those are two particular

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.819
