00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
beautiful I love the graphics I'm

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.630 
beautiful I love the graphics I'm
surprised<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.630> computer<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.140> handle<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
surprised my computer can handle this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
surprised my computer can handle this
now<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.850> let's<00:01:21.299> actually<00:01:21.720> read<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
now this let's actually read what it is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
now this let's actually read what it is
it's<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.979> grey<00:01:23.130> cat<00:01:23.369> industrial<00:01:23.970> sure<00:01:24.240> grip

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it's a grey cat industrial sure grip

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's a grey cat industrial sure grip
tracker<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> I'm<00:01:26.549> assuming<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
tracker so I'm assuming this is going to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.770 
tracker so I'm assuming this is going to
help<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.619> find<00:01:28.799> jump<00:01:29.070> points<00:01:29.540> jump<00:01:30.540> points

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
help you find jump points jump points

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260 
help you find jump points jump points

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
help you go to different galaxies you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960 
help you go to different galaxies you
need<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> these<00:01:34.189> 25<00:01:35.189> those<00:01:35.400> jump<00:01:35.640> points

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
need one of these 25 those jump points

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.100 
need one of these 25 those jump points
and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.619> weaponry<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:39.110> laser

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and then for weaponry we have laser

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
and then for weaponry we have laser
cannons<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.460> called<00:01:41.640> on

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
cannons these are actually called on

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.960 
cannons these are actually called on
this<00:01:42.060> ski<00:01:42.299> six<00:01:42.960> laser<00:01:43.229> cannons<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.880> one<00:01:44.880> on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
this ski six laser cannons as one on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.640 
this ski six laser cannons as one on
each<00:01:45.180> wing<00:01:45.420> let's<00:01:45.960> go<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> other<00:01:46.350> side

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
each wing let's go to the other side

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.520 
each wing let's go to the other side
this<00:01:48.340> one<00:01:48.550> here<00:01:48.880> now<00:01:49.510> I'm<00:01:49.690> assuming<00:01:50.260> now<00:01:50.380> this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
this one here now I'm assuming now this

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.310 
this one here now I'm assuming now this
is<00:01:50.680> totally<00:01:51.460> an<00:01:51.520> assumption<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.600> this<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.170> not

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
is totally an assumption so this is not

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.010 
is totally an assumption so this is not
fact<00:01:53.650> but<00:01:54.460> there's<00:01:55.060> two<00:01:55.240> types<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.630> weapons

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
fact but there's two types of weapons

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.360 
fact but there's two types of weapons
there's<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.470> lasers<00:01:56.940> which<00:01:57.940> use<00:01:58.120> energy<00:01:58.390> and

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
there's the lasers which use energy and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.710 
there's the lasers which use energy and
other<00:02:00.370> things<00:02:00.640> use<00:02:00.790> energy<00:02:00.940> like<00:02:01.300> shields<00:02:01.630> on

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
other things use energy like shields on

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.170 
other things use energy like shields on
your<00:02:01.870> ship<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.770> my<00:02:03.070> assumption<00:02:03.430> would<00:02:03.790> be<00:02:03.850> if

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
your ship so my assumption would be if

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.440 
your ship so my assumption would be if
you're<00:02:04.750> getting<00:02:04.930> attacked<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.650> your<00:02:06.490> shield

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
you're getting attacked and your shield

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.050 
you're getting attacked and your shield
is<00:02:07.660> getting<00:02:07.930> layered<00:02:08.290> with<00:02:08.530> with<00:02:09.520> with

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
is getting layered with with with

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.680 
is getting layered with with with
ammunition<00:02:10.960> and<00:02:11.440> lasers<00:02:12.340> hitting<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.820> it's

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
ammunition and lasers hitting it it's

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.090 
ammunition and lasers hitting it it's
going<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.840> be<00:02:13.930> depleting<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> need<00:02:14.830> energy

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
going to be depleting it you need energy

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.270 
going to be depleting it you need energy
to<00:02:15.630> rejuvenate<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.870> shield<00:02:17.260> now<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.130> you're

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
to rejuvenate that shield now if you're

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.040 
to rejuvenate that shield now if you're
shooting<00:02:18.490> back<00:02:18.820> with<00:02:19.000> lasers<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.720> probably

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
shooting back with lasers it's probably

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.120 
shooting back with lasers it's probably
going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:21.060> hamper<00:02:22.060> your<00:02:22.290> your<00:02:23.290> quickness<00:02:23.560> so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
going to hamper your your quickness so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.500 
going to hamper your your quickness so
you're<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.370> gonna<00:02:24.490> be<00:02:24.580> able<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:25.000> regenerate

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
you're not gonna be able to regenerate

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.410 
you're not gonna be able to regenerate
that<00:02:25.810> shield<00:02:26.050> as<00:02:26.170> quick<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:28.120> there's<00:02:28.330> a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
that shield as quick now there's a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.790 
that shield as quick now there's a
second<00:02:28.900> type<00:02:29.080> which<00:02:29.320> actually<00:02:29.530> use

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
second type which actually use

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.290 
second type which actually use
ammunition<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.940> be<00:02:31.000> good<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
ammunition so it's going to be good that

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.920 
ammunition so it's going to be good that
are<00:02:31.390> going<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.540> use<00:02:31.690> hard<00:02:31.990> ammunition<00:02:32.610> now

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
are going to use hard ammunition now

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.960 
are going to use hard ammunition now
that's<00:02:34.930> cool<00:02:35.170> because<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.160> won't<00:02:36.400> hamper<00:02:36.580> your

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
that's cool because it won't hamper your

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.940 
that's cool because it won't hamper your
ability<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.750> regenerate<00:02:38.140> your<00:02:38.350> shield<00:02:38.709> where

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
ability to regenerate your shield where

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.430 
ability to regenerate your shield where
you're<00:02:39.040> getting<00:02:39.160> attacked<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.050> have<00:02:41.260> to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
you're getting attacked but you have to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.250 
you're getting attacked but you have to
hold<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.800> ammunition<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.240> think<00:02:43.360> those

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
hold the ammunition so I think those

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.930 
hold the ammunition so I think those
will<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.890> negatives<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.370> positives<00:02:45.459> of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
will be the negatives and positives of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.240 
will be the negatives and positives of
those<00:02:46.150> different<00:02:46.630> types<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.800> lot<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:47.980> bigger

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
those different types so a lot of bigger

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.680 
those different types so a lot of bigger
ships<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.790> are<00:02:48.850> for<00:02:49.209> fighting<00:02:49.570> will

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
ships that are for fighting will

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.400 
ships that are for fighting will
probably<00:02:49.959> have<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> combination<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.680> both

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
probably have a combination of both

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
probably have a combination of both
there's<00:02:53.410> going<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.650> two<00:02:53.890> others<00:02:54.160> thoughts

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
there's going to be two others thoughts

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.740 
there's going to be two others thoughts
so<00:02:54.700> these<00:02:55.269> are<00:02:55.480> level<00:02:55.870> ones<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:57.610> level<00:02:58.390> one<00:02:58.510> hard

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
so these are level ones I level one hard

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.620 
so these are level ones I level one hard
point<00:02:59.880> which<00:03:00.880> means<00:03:01.090> they're<00:03:01.300> not<00:03:01.420> very

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
point which means they're not very

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.070 
point which means they're not very
maneuverable<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> level<00:03:03.670> 2<00:03:04.080> power

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
maneuverable this is a level 2 power

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.750 
maneuverable this is a level 2 power
point<00:03:05.410> which<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:06.040> believe<00:03:06.310> means<00:03:06.580> it's

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
point which I believe means it's

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.090 
point which I believe means it's
slightly<00:03:07.239> maneuverable<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.110> then<00:03:08.860> right

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
slightly maneuverable and then right

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.040 
slightly maneuverable and then right
under<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.489> wings<00:03:09.670> here<00:03:10.030> I'll<00:03:10.180> be<00:03:10.239> able<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.690> fit

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
under the wings here I'll be able to fit

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.210 
under the wings here I'll be able to fit
level<00:03:11.620> threes<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.690> fit<00:03:13.959> either<00:03:14.590> some

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
level threes so I can fit either some

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.120 
level threes so I can fit either some
more<00:03:15.400> weapons<00:03:15.790> up<00:03:15.940> there<00:03:16.320> of<00:03:17.320> two<00:03:17.620> spots<00:03:17.920> one

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
more weapons up there of two spots one

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.670 
more weapons up there of two spots one
on<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.370> side<00:03:18.600> or<00:03:19.600> I'll<00:03:19.750> be<00:03:19.870> able<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.050> fit<00:03:20.320> they

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
on this side or I'll be able to fit they

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.199 
on this side or I'll be able to fit they
might<00:03:20.860> have<00:03:21.010> some<00:03:21.280> other<00:03:21.459> stuff<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:22.060> might

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
might have some other stuff that might

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.900 
might have some other stuff that might
help<00:03:22.360> my<00:03:22.510> exploration<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.459> I'll<00:03:24.550> probably<00:03:24.640> go

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
help my exploration so I'll probably go

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.130 
help my exploration so I'll probably go
with<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.180> since<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.810> one<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:25.989> an

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
with that since this is one of an

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.770 
with that since this is one of an
exploration<00:03:26.440> ship<00:03:27.180> they<00:03:28.180> will<00:03:28.330> be<00:03:28.480> coming<00:03:28.630> out

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
exploration ship they will be coming out

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.180 
exploration ship they will be coming out
with<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.930> dogfighting<00:03:29.350> module<00:03:29.590> i'll<00:03:29.890> probably

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
with a dogfighting module i'll probably

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.430 
with a dogfighting module i'll probably
pick<00:03:30.400> up<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.670> ship<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.910> do<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.330> i<00:03:31.540> won't<00:03:32.260> use

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
pick up a ship to do that i won't use

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.070 
pick up a ship to do that i won't use
this<00:03:32.590> one<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:34.390> let's<00:03:34.540> take<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.690> look<00:03:34.900> at<00:03:34.959> the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
this one so let's take a look at the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.270 
this one so let's take a look at the
inside<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:36.090> love<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.269> no<00:03:38.049> cutscenes<00:03:38.650> come<00:03:39.160> on

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
inside I love this no cutscenes come on

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.640 
inside I love this no cutscenes come on
open<00:03:39.400> up

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.260 

now<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.710> not<00:03:42.890> have<00:03:43.070> cut<00:03:43.250> scenes<00:03:43.550> I<00:03:43.820> mean<00:03:44.120> you're

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
now to not have cut scenes I mean you're

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.580 
now to not have cut scenes I mean you're
used<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.630> like<00:03:44.780> clicking<00:03:45.050> a<00:03:45.170> button<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.500> you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
used to like clicking a button and you

so this is going to be the controls
looks<00:05:40.280> like<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.640> left<00:05:40.850> and<00:05:41.030> right<00:05:41.090> are

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
looks like the left and right are

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.320 
looks like the left and right are
identical<00:05:41.810> but<00:05:42.669> boy<00:05:43.669> do<00:05:43.730> they<00:05:43.970> look<00:05:44.090> great

identical but boy do they look great
ng<00:05:46.199> 202<00:05:46.800> so<00:05:46.979> none<00:05:47.189> of<00:05:47.220> these<00:05:47.310> work<00:05:47.580> but<00:05:47.849> they're

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
ng 202 so none of these work but they're

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.460 
ng 202 so none of these work but they're
going<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.479> work<00:05:48.599> on<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.930> sending<00:05:49.229> at<00:05:49.289> some

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
going to work on the sending at some

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.100 
going to work on the sending at some
time<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:51.060> can<00:05:51.180> kind<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.419> see<00:05:51.569> it's<00:05:51.900> cool

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
time and you can kind of see it's cool

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.070 
time and you can kind of see it's cool
you<00:05:52.470> have<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:52.770> ship<00:05:52.979> here<00:05:53.159> so<00:05:53.340> i'm<00:05:53.430> assuming

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
you have the ship here so i'm assuming

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.480 
you have the ship here so i'm assuming
kind<00:05:55.080> of<00:05:55.139> like<00:05:55.229> anything<00:05:55.560> you<00:05:55.979> know<00:05:56.099> old

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
kind of like anything you know old

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.369 
kind of like anything you know old
racing<00:05:57.180> games<00:05:57.419> used<00:05:57.780> to<00:05:57.900> have<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.229> were<00:05:58.349> you

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:58.379 
racing games used to have it were you

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.279 
racing games used to have it were you
could<00:05:58.800> see<00:05:58.949> your<00:05:59.099> tires<00:05:59.430> were<00:06:00.139> running<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:01.229> out

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
could see your tires were running it out

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.570 
could see your tires were running it out
so<00:06:01.500> i'm<00:06:01.590> assuming<00:06:01.680> if<00:06:02.099> you<00:06:02.189> take<00:06:02.370> damage

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
so i'm assuming if you take damage

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.550 
so i'm assuming if you take damage
you'll<00:06:02.939> see<00:06:03.150> that<00:06:03.330> or<00:06:03.569> if<00:06:03.719> your<00:06:03.900> weapons<00:06:04.349> or

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
you'll see that or if your weapons or

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.010 
you'll see that or if your weapons or
running<00:06:04.800> low<00:06:04.949> you<00:06:05.310> might<00:06:05.490> see<00:06:05.840> part<00:06:06.840> of<00:06:06.900> your

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
running low you might see part of your

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.379 
running low you might see part of your
ship<00:06:07.259> turn<00:06:07.500> red<00:06:07.770> or<00:06:07.800> something<00:06:08.340> like<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.490> now

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
ship turn red or something like that now

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.290 
ship turn red or something like that now
up<00:06:09.569> top<00:06:09.780> you<00:06:09.960> can<00:06:10.050> see<00:06:10.849> engine<00:06:11.849> so<00:06:12.060> you<00:06:12.120> can<00:06:12.210> see

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
up top you can see engine so you can see

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.290 
up top you can see engine so you can see
the<00:06:12.389> status<00:06:12.629> of<00:06:12.750> your<00:06:12.810> engines<00:06:13.199> of<00:06:13.409> assuming

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
the status of your engines of assuming

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.999 
the status of your engines of assuming
front<00:06:15.300> row<00:06:15.509> I<00:06:16.020> don't<00:06:16.319> know<00:06:16.379> could<00:06:16.650> be<00:06:16.770> fuel

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
front row I don't know could be fuel

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.339 
front row I don't know could be fuel
there<00:06:17.270> there's<00:06:18.270> a<00:06:18.389> star<00:06:18.629> map<00:06:18.840> so<00:06:19.050> maybe<00:06:19.199> that's

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
there there's a star map so maybe that's

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.860 
there there's a star map so maybe that's
why<00:06:19.469> you<00:06:19.530> plot<00:06:19.800> to<00:06:19.949> jump<00:06:20.190> points<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:21.509> could<00:06:21.690> go

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
why you plot to jump points you could go

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.980 
why you plot to jump points you could go
down<00:06:22.139> up<00:06:22.590> bake<00:06:23.520> right<00:06:23.819> or<00:06:24.180> bake<00:06:24.479> left<00:06:24.719> bank

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
down up bake right or bake left bank

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.369 
down up bake right or bake left bank
right<00:06:26.449> that<00:06:27.449> is<00:06:27.629> maybe<00:06:27.810> that's<00:06:28.020> fuel<00:06:28.259> right

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:28.379 
right that is maybe that's fuel right

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.890 
right that is maybe that's fuel right
there<00:06:29.090> and<00:06:30.090> then<00:06:30.210> the<00:06:30.300> great<00:06:30.479> thing<00:06:30.599> about<00:06:30.659> the

to climb back up there so you can't

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.320 
to climb back up there so you can't
close<00:07:11.099> the<00:07:11.250> door<00:07:11.430> at<00:07:11.520> the<00:07:11.580> moment<00:07:11.909> you<00:07:12.150> have<00:07:12.270> to

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
close the door at the moment you have to

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.790 
close the door at the moment you have to
actually<00:07:12.479> shut<00:07:12.990> down<00:07:13.139> the<00:07:13.259> program<00:07:13.469> and

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
actually shut down the program and

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.939 
actually shut down the program and
launch<00:07:14.610> back<00:07:14.909> up<00:07:15.259> but<00:07:16.259> i<00:07:16.469> think<00:07:16.680> this<00:07:16.770> looks

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:16.949 
launch back up but i think this looks

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.079 
launch back up but i think this looks
pretty<00:07:17.129> good<00:07:17.250> no<00:07:17.400> so<00:07:17.550> let's<00:07:17.699> take<00:07:17.819> a<00:07:17.849> look<00:07:18.000> at

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:18.089 
pretty good no so let's take a look at

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:21.409 
pretty good no so let's take a look at
the<00:07:18.150> engine<00:07:18.300> on<00:07:18.479> the<00:07:18.569> back<00:07:20.060> did<00:07:21.060> write<00:07:21.270> down

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
the engine on the back did write down

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:23.119 
the engine on the back did write down
what<00:07:21.539> the<00:07:21.629> internet<00:07:21.960> she<00:07:22.080> was<00:07:22.169> called<00:07:22.440> did<00:07:22.770> I<00:07:22.860> a

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:23.129 
what the internet she was called did I a

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:27.050 
what the internet she was called did I a
dragon<00:07:24.029> stellar<00:07:24.740> STC<00:07:25.740> silver<00:07:26.190> so<00:07:26.909> it's

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
dragon stellar STC silver so it's

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.550 
dragon stellar STC silver so it's
actually<00:07:27.150> different<00:07:27.599> than<00:07:27.779> the<00:07:27.839> 300<00:07:28.349> of<00:07:28.469> the

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 
actually different than the 300 of the

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.790 
actually different than the 300 of the
325<00:07:29.509> so<00:07:30.509> it<00:07:30.569> has<00:07:30.659> a<00:07:30.690> different<00:07:30.990> engine<00:07:31.110> I'm

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 
325 so it has a different engine I'm

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.909 
325 so it has a different engine I'm
assuming<00:07:32.219> it's<00:07:32.279> because<00:07:33.150> as<00:07:33.300> jump<00:07:33.599> capability

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 
assuming it's because as jump capability

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.119 
assuming it's because as jump capability
looks<00:07:34.919> pretty<00:07:35.069> cool<00:07:36.770> we're<00:07:37.770> gonna<00:07:37.860> be<00:07:37.949> under

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:38.129 
looks pretty cool we're gonna be under

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:40.420 
looks pretty cool we're gonna be under

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.430
