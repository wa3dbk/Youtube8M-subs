00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.809
 hello I'm felipe betancourt manager of the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.759
 sky branding company and I will tell you 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.050
 a little about my experience with the 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:27.430
 wapa inkling 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:30.170
 [Music] 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.170
 It is a very good tool for 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.670
 download handmade sketches in 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.890
 any notebook to 1,009 sketches and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.720
 pass them to the computer near him 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.920
 they squared the tips of how they can 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.670
 be good line who has a receiver 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.470
 a receiver that works like a 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.320
 ideal or what I do is that he in 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.150
 true plus or minus a minimum number of 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.269
 five or six sheets so I can stay 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.539
 well adjusted and do not move and 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.820
 do not upset me or anything will happen to me 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.940
 the good sketch then turn on 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.640
 Delicate and dorado like a little light 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.070
 a blinking social you take the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.020
 pen in this way so that it does not cover 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.479
 the sensor and then do not go to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.800
 interrupt communication and then for 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.500
 so there will be no problems 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.010
 when you are drawing 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.830
 and keep in mind then that clearly 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.470
 but it will not be left without any 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.650
 complication and I say now no lag 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.420
 nothing 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.510
 then I use my right hand to 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.880
 draw I put the limit on the part 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.670
 superior and also used it in the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.190
 right part to hurry without a note to 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.170
 the sensor and that is also very much 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.580
 more comfort to draw at 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.410
 people who use their left hand 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.960
 He also recommended placing it next 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.330
 left to make it more comfortable 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.920
 work of at the moment structure of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.290
 all the information will not be 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.690
 no problem do not plug the sensor 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.690
 with your hand with this button you can create 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.180
 fields every time you need to make a 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.530
 new layer that you just put the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.470
 button you draw and the layer will go to 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.120
 sensor and it will obviously be much easier 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.780
 when when you are going to make a drawing 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.090
 where you need to make the background some 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 independent elements like you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.970
 to receive force administrator as layers 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.350
 different as different laws then 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.730
 It will be much easier to be able to 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.590
 to draw 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.440
 [Music] 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.880
 well keep in mind as more or less 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.670
 a measure d 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.920
 or 2 centimeters down from where 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.990
 or upwards simulates where you put the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.060
 sensor so that that part of the drawing 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.680
 also go to pass this pass 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.700
 clearly the whole drawing 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.510
 good when you have finished your sketches 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.489
 then remove the sheets and connect the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.819
 linkin or I will put the tilt in the box 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.159
 where the good and connect the usb to your 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.359
 computer he is going to open a program that 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.549
 it's called inclines cage manager this this 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.609
 program what it does is that it's going to 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.469
 allow you to visualize all your sketches and 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.980
 to know about the program you want 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.400
 export them 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.890
 and when you have the cs6 version that is 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.540
 more modern than what you get 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.090
 I recommend you go to the page 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.860
 web set home and travel in the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.290
 update delinquen so you can 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.970
 working with your voice is much easier 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.670
 of the same version with the sketch manager 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.099
 you can visualize all the layers that 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.860
 have your live can you select which ones 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.720
 you want to use and which ones do not and 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.299
 simply with July around a 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.299
 click on each of the elements that 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.549
 you want to export if you have to shop 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.650
 station 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.290
 or illustrator then of one for it in the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.849
 list of problems to export according to 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.470
 for each program that is because this one 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.379
 Then they export thousands of different 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.599
 ways that you can not behave like 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.599
 vector with these three and in pixels 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.670
 good as animator tell me by that line 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.250
 has an interesting tool 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.350
 because put it is going to be your sketches 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.740
 of animation your voice is very initial is of 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.950
 animations on a sheet simply 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.620
 creating laws two brands each time block 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.720
 picture and it can take you to photoshop or to 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.720
 perfect and arm with and basic motion 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.870
 line the capacity you intend 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.300
 2 GB after working many tickets 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.490
 and then obviously make your road 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.710
 initials and it 's a very practical way 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.710
 without having to provide them with coves and 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.240
 gratify it anywhere I play 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.409
 I can do very is an idea of 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.569
 initial movements feelings 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.180
 pass them in a very easy way and they remain 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.860
 all engraved in layers and it's a very 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:14.779
 good tool 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.779
