 some parts of Latin America with 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.430
 these ingredients we proceed to do the

 good to make our spicy puca 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.030
 first of all let's cook our 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.399
 pig that we are going to add inside 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.180
 a pot with a virtual classic onion 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.240
 carrot and celery and let's add the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.400
 pieces of pork and let's add the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.630
 broth only until it covers 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.940
 surface of the pig and this we are going to 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.470
 reserve the liquid when we finish 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.750
 of cooking the pig then you 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.440
 add a little salt and a little bit of 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.610
 pepper and a bay leaf for 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.610
 start cooking 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.230
 the hichas of the laurel and we continue with 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.310
 the next step when this has 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.890
 finished cooking 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.870
 as we can already see our 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.840
 elaboration is 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.970
 taking it together started to boil let's 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.230
 add our potatoes inside 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.320
 our short broth that we have so that 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.260
 they finish cooking the potatoes and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 we can reserve the broth we continue 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.799
 with the next step 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.439
 once we have had the development 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.720
 already fully cooked both the pig 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.630
 like the potatoes we are going to proceed to 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.480
 remove only the broth and we will 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.140
 leaving residues by removing the mir or 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.520
 be removing the onion from the celery and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.170
 carrot to be able to have a product and 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.120
 only get the broth that we have 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.239
 Elaborated 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.549
 on the other hand we use the beetraga 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:39.010
 we are going to add the inside of a container 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:42.250
 so that we can process it with our 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.000
 peanut roasted peanuts that we have we are going to 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.760
 add it there and we will use a little 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.300
 of the broth that we have used to 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.160
 boil our 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.030
 pig and with this we proceed to 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.040
 and process it 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.650
 always be very careful remember that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.530
 the broth is hot we can start 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.200
 process our development 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.990
 practically done in October and start 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.310
 to process with the second part of 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.310
 our development 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.670
 remember that the tárraga bird calls 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.980
 also beet is already cooked 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.830
 previously then we have here for 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.430
 make a mash with the peanuts that we are 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.250
 using once finished we started 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.930
 with the next step continuing with 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.390
 this elaboration we add a little 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.790
 of oil to our preparation to 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.540
 our pot we're going to add later 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.870
 scallion for us to start 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.569
 to process it 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.140
 let's do a watering at this point 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.090
 we also add a little garlic garlic 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.430
 chopped that we had previously and 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.430
 we also add the ají panca 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.100
 indispensable for this elaboration with 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.740
 these ingredients when also the 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.760
 small onion color we add the rest 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.520
 of our ingredients 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.920
 at this point we are going to add 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.850
 again our pork and 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:30.560
 the potatoes that we had previously 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.000
 cooked and we will start to turn 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.980
 remember that the potato is not 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.830
 completely known but it's missing 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:41.480
 a little bit then when we finish 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.080
 with this we are going to add our 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.030
 beterraga with the peanuts that we had 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.190
 previously cooked and too thick 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.750
 gentlemen add a little more of the 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.080
 broth that we had before 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.050
 and we proceed to 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.440
 cook this for some space 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.800
 7 to 8 minutes to finish the potato and 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.699
 we would be serving continue with the 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.699
 next step 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.330
 perfect and we have finished our puca 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.140
 spicy and the only thing that would be missing would be 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:21.500
 add peppermint to the end to 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:25.230
 give it the last touch and be able to stir and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.770
 serve perfect with this we proceed to 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.240
 present the dish 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.240
 this guy ready to kill 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.380
 the preparation is a marine preparation 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.520
 Very easy to serve is not required 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.820
 too much drilling or elements that 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.170
 accompany this dish extreme of 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.840
 classic and traditional accompaniment are 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.620
 some pickled onions then 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.290
 we are simply going to use rice 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.510
 eye that if you are diabetic super 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.690

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.660
 dad has dad in the stew and he has 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.630
 rice can use for example a 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.060
 Quinoa does not lack anything to serve this 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.410
