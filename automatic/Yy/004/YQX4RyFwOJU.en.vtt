00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.420 

that's<00:00:36.480> everything<00:00:36.980> whether<00:00:37.980> he's<00:00:38.219> going

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that's everything whether he's going

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
that's everything whether he's going
forwards<00:00:39.059> whether<00:00:39.930> he's<00:00:40.109> going<00:00:40.410> backwards<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
forwards whether he's going backwards I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.500 
forwards whether he's going backwards I
see<00:00:42.440> that's<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.829> been<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> important<00:00:44.760> it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.980 
no it's through straight yeah you need
to<00:03:11.400> grow<00:03:11.730> through<00:03:12.090> straight<00:03:12.420> that's<00:03:12.780> where

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
to grow through straight that's where

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.410 
to grow through straight that's where
you<00:03:13.140> guys<00:03:13.260> are<00:03:13.470> missing<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.890> okay<00:03:14.850> think<00:03:15.330> about

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
you guys are missing it okay think about

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.120 
you guys are missing it okay think about
it<00:03:15.660> if<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.870> just<00:03:16.110> put<00:03:16.350> something<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:16.980> like

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it if I just put something on this like

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.860 
it if I just put something on this like
a<00:03:17.160> catapult<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:18.030> push<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.360> forward

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
a catapult and I just push this forward

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.680 
a catapult and I just push this forward
it's<00:03:19.500> gonna<00:03:19.650> go<00:03:19.860> down<00:03:20.100> with<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:21.210> if<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.390> try<00:03:21.630> to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
it's gonna go down with but if I try to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.150 
it's gonna go down with but if I try to
stretch<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.290> backwards<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.980> moves

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
stretch it backwards and it moves

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.010 
stretch it backwards and it moves
through<00:03:23.370> straight<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.180> okay<00:03:24.720> now<00:03:24.750> it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
through straight and then okay now it

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.800 
through straight and then okay now it
goes<00:03:25.140> forward<00:03:25.730> that's<00:03:26.730> key<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.300> need<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.480> move

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
goes forward that's key you need to move

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.690 
goes forward that's key you need to move
through<00:03:28.140> straight<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.190> some<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.460> you<00:03:29.550> were

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
through straight so some of you were

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.040 
through straight so some of you were
standing<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.510> you're<00:03:30.630> doing<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:32.000> no<00:03:33.050> move

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
standing and you're doing this no move

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.760 
standing and you're doing this no move
through<00:03:34.380> straight<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.130> then<00:03:35.520> that's<00:03:36.270> key

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
through straight and then that's key

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.570 
through straight and then that's key
it's<00:03:37.770> never<00:03:38.100> hollow

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
it's never hollow

it's never hollow
are<00:03:38.730> chalo<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.480> hollow<00:03:39.870> straight<00:03:40.470> arch

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
are chalo it's hollow straight arch

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.890 
are chalo it's hollow straight arch

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
straight hollows straight

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.070 
straight hollows straight
yeah<00:03:43.080> that's<00:03:43.500> key<00:03:43.820> very<00:03:44.820> very<00:03:45.030> important<00:03:45.510> play
