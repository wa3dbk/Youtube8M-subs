00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
rise to be intense - I think all the

girl of the differences

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.080 
girl of the differences
I<00:00:44.770> think<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:47.110> harder<00:00:47.440> than<00:00:47.469> you<00:00:47.620> see<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:48.489> think

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
I think it's harder than you see I think

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.750 
I think it's harder than you see I think
she's<00:00:49.480> very<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:51.489> her<00:00:51.850> class<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.220> she<00:00:54.220> was

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
she's very in her class and she was

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.250 
she's very in her class and she was
beside<00:00:54.910> but<00:00:55.390> she'll<00:00:55.540> find<00:00:55.989> that<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.230> be

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
beside but she'll find that to be

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.600 
beside but she'll find that to be
adventurous<00:00:56.949> take<00:00:57.850> risks<00:00:58.420> and<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:03.040> slam<00:01:03.309> is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
adventurous take risks and the slam is

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.160 
adventurous take risks and the slam is
trapped<00:01:03.909> inside<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.570> ring

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
trapped inside the ring

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.649 
trapped inside the ring
so<00:01:05.680> she's<00:01:06.070> cried<00:01:06.369> she's<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> very<00:01:07.210> emotional

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
how you can use that as a dancer you

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.080 
how you can use that as a dancer you
know<00:01:25.420> it's<00:01:26.080> you<00:01:26.920> can<00:01:27.100> try<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.340> lot<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.610> things<00:01:27.729> in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
know it's you can try a lot of things in

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.330 
know it's you can try a lot of things in
the<00:01:28.179> studio<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.170> women<00:01:29.800> s<00:01:30.009> is<00:01:30.160> how<00:01:30.280> you

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
the studio that you women s is how you

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.109 
the studio that you women s is how you
try<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.759> respond<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.450> them

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
try and respond to them

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.550

but<00:01:34.119> you<00:01:34.330> can<00:01:34.479> really<00:01:34.720> push<00:01:34.929> your<00:01:35.110> limits

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
but you can really push your limits

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.690 
but you can really push your limits
it's<00:01:36.369> quite<00:01:36.640> up<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:38.560> in<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.220> way<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.520> keeps

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
it's quite up I think in a way it keeps

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.630 
it's quite up I think in a way it keeps
it<00:01:40.030> alive<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:41.170> Frenchmen<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:42.220> sort<00:01:42.429> of<00:01:42.460> lose

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
it alive in Frenchmen you sort of lose

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.900 
it alive in Frenchmen you sort of lose
once<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.240> doesn't<00:01:43.539> get

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
once it doesn't get

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.150 
once it doesn't get
staying<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:46.540> when<00:01:46.810> we<00:01:46.900> go<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.140> road<00:01:47.350> it's

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
staying so when we go on the road it's

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.090 
staying so when we go on the road it's
not<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.730> that's<00:01:49.270> when<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.630> eventually<00:01:50.100> simple

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
not so that's when it eventually simple

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.460 
not so that's when it eventually simple
as<00:01:52.090> we<00:01:52.330> go<00:01:52.450> along<00:01:52.570> with<00:01:52.870> your<00:01:53.020> stories

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
as we go along with your stories

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.340 
as we go along with your stories
configure<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.790> character<00:01:55.360> gets<00:01:55.900> even<00:01:56.230> bigger

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
configure the character gets even bigger

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
configure the character gets even bigger
so<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:57.160> think<00:01:57.580> we<00:01:57.790> start<00:01:58.090> with<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.860> an<00:02:00.010> idea

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
so I think we start with a like an idea

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:10.020 
so I think we start with a like an idea
and<00:02:00.730> then<00:02:01.390> by<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.870> end<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:08.820> when<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:09.880> come

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
and then by the end of the when you come

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.150 
and then by the end of the when you come
to<00:02:10.119> Disney<00:02:10.510> in<00:02:10.869> some<00:02:11.230> ways<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.560> similarities

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
to Disney in some ways the similarities

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.460 
to Disney in some ways the similarities
are<00:02:12.400> greater<00:02:13.030> than<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.390> differences<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.110> think

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
are greater than the differences I think

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.810 
are greater than the differences I think
when<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.860> comes<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.190> translating<00:02:15.430> something

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
when it comes to translating something

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.900 
when it comes to translating something
to<00:02:16.060> ballet<00:02:16.270> wealth<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.810> seeing<00:02:17.050> or<00:02:17.320> adding

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
to ballet wealth and seeing or adding

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.190 
to ballet wealth and seeing or adding
you<00:02:18.910> need<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.390> find<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.750> truth<00:02:19.990> behind

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
you need to just find the truth behind

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.310 
you need to just find the truth behind
every<00:02:20.650> step<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.160> do<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:22.320> every

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
every step that you do and we every

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.770 
every step that you do and we every
dance<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:24.070> every<00:02:24.550> bit<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.120> choreography

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
dance that every bit of choreography

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.780 
dance that every bit of choreography

that's time and obviously she's taking

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.810 
that's time and obviously she's taking
the<00:02:38.380> risk<00:02:38.560> she<00:02:38.800> knows<00:02:38.950> she<00:02:39.340> shouldn't<00:02:39.700> be

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
the risk she knows she shouldn't be

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.570 
the risk she knows she shouldn't be
really<00:02:41.550> going<00:02:42.550> out

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
she gets totally the best she should not

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.820 
she gets totally the best she should not
hit<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:50.810> where<00:02:51.020> it's<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.620> take

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
hit but where it's just going to take

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.960 
hit but where it's just going to take
your<00:02:51.950> risk<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.370> see<00:02:52.520> what<00:02:52.700> he's<00:02:52.880> like

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
your risk and see what he's like

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.520 
your risk and see what he's like

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.309 
I think that fascist the opposition
light<00:03:01.760> has<00:03:01.910> taken<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.750> risk

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
light has taken that risk

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.400 
light has taken that risk
EBU<00:03:03.890> three<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.060> princess<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:05.900> normally

way into the world that he's been
dreaming<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.890> there's<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.950> part<00:03:59.160> where

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730
