00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.820
 in motor sports it's not 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.840
 something that I practiced before the 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.599
 perch already because the earth I 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.879
 started I did not even I did not even 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.560
 the age of driving a bike because I 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.120
 doing so after the pair is 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.130
 something that came a little bit on the 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.270
 late because even though it's a tax 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.140
 is a passion will practice this 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.360
 is not given to everyone 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.190
 I had the opportunity to discover with 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.169
 with my friend stÃ©phane mazars who rolls 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.750
 for 24 hours 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.900
 to discover the universe of 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.940
 the motorcycle seen from the inside breaks in 2010 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.830
 and since that's true it did not 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.290
 that increase the passion that I weighed 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.970
 for the bike with strangers the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.760
 first steps on a motorcycle on circuit 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.650
 a few weeks ago at vigeant we are 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.739
 not without knowing that the store micani 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.590
 it's an activity that is a bit more 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.489
 risk that normal but here after 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.260
 it's really something where I 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.250
 take pleasure you i'm going to be 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.339
 able to overtake me 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.870
 and really having something that 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.760
 I search that is to say the sensations 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.020
 strong is indignant aline I am always 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.090
 looking to please me and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.450
 also pilot them to try new ones 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.630
 things 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.800
 that's it all that loses 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.380
 usually settings that was 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.360
 unable to master perfection for 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.220
 to be able to cross a very high bar 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.740

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.380
 photo is the tire who is who and the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.240
 handle one of the main reasons for the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.850
 performance of funds that if we 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.320
 trust in it and that we can go to 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.320
 90% of its limits 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.380
