00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:11.440
 By Hello there a Ohori with 123 this time after a long time of beach that his recommended 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.300
 It seems like you 've gone, but the other day you got a new one at Soundhouse 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.360
 Though it is booth up 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:21.460
 It is here 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.530
 This is a combo It's 10 holes harmonica, but it's a fork 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.880
 It is a guy in blues mark 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.630
 It is that it is the thing of the only wooden body in the blues harp of dragonfly 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 But 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.350
 Originally it was said that there was something called folk blues in the 70's 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.100
 Well that with the improved version 2nd generation 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:45.260
 I thing overall instep smaller in but you are made to say 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:49.640
 Like this, the length is different from that of the major boy I 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.379
 It feels like it's easy to get addicted because it fits perfectly in the palm of your hand 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.340
 The point I should pay attention to is the part of the body I think that it is domestic maple 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.300
 Who have been introduced to what 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 I there is a gloss whiff does not feel called Naa's wooden Compared with the wish 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.610
 There is a feeling that either the house and plastic are not good Good old 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.470
 It is a feeling called blues harp , but it is a fork blues sideways and it is stamped firmly 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.720
 Don't keep anything down 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.360
 It is different from the Horner 's marine band at the end but the sculpture of the feeling of nostalgic is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.780
 There is 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.820
 If you look at the mark of the dragonfly, etc. 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.170
 There is a design of a maple leaf and the meaning of making it with maple is written here 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.940
 To I'd containing the side holes 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:35.650
 It is a big feature that I decide the sound when the hole is opened and the playability is enhanced 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.900
 I try for the first time Don your blues of illegal body but because the say or become what feeling 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.950
 I think I want to do a little bit 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.950
 The key is a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 amaran 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 ana 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.269
 From the say or rather put the sound to do with the warm compared to the major Boy 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.140
 It's really a blind square dealer and I 've exceeded major 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.800
 It's going to be ad, but it's still a mellow sound 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.269
 I found a wooden body, but the star is still alive. 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.580
 It is necessary to put some effort into the definition of slow and something that requires considerable power 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.020
 June 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.020
 It easy to know just over Yappa convenient packaging Suge' Toka high frequency of vibrato be delicious 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.140
 I get a single note properly 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.760
 Okutsu is in close contact as well because it has a sense of hold and it fits perfectly well into the hand 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.140
 There is something that you can do well 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.770
 Only in very such assembly bluesy there was a do something blowing how to use the number Society 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.770
 I have suits 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
 ana 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.000
 na na na na 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.220
 ana 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.660
 nare 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.980
 Major Boy additive-free, which is also the collectively try and You're warm sound out also changing sound 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:26.720
 The sound of sharp performance is still great despite the wood water body 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.440
 The wooden body is resistant, and some people have broken lips. 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.420
 Because 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.210
 However, there is no such thing, and the holes are wide one by one so I can play well 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.240
 I think there is 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.190
 There is a single note something per area vibrato and also bending 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.940
 Well particularly in Tsu easily over Yappa it's attacks of that is another natural dragonfly goodness 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.440
 Vibrato Toka 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:51.360
 It 's easy to put on bending right away, but it's just like regular low-pitched sounds 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.320
 O and smoked it that's a major boy that may be pretty or tight when the stomach does not put forces in and try 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.230
 I'd go 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.700
 A word on how to blow 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:02.080
 If you know if there is , I commented on this a little quick but this is the first time in wooden 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.730
 If you want to choose something that is easy to wipe, this Pong Pong folks 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.750
 I think mark ii is highly recommended 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.250
 The size is quite small, so I ca n't say anything if I get used to it 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.220
 I was familiar with me, though 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:18.680
 I think that it is something of a good feeling Everyone is this folk blues Well 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.720
 2 I will try again to see you next time 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.940

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.780

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.529
 Ah ah ah ah
