example if something is big you're

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.050 
example if something is big you're
probably<00:01:41.909> thinking<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.600> something<00:01:42.960> big<00:01:43.909> if<00:01:44.909> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
probably thinking of something big if we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.350 
probably thinking of something big if we
say<00:01:45.240> something<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.689> giant<00:01:46.549> giant<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.759> big<00:01:48.119> are

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
say something is giant giant and big are

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
say something is giant giant and big are
synonyms<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.290> similar<00:01:49.740> meanings<00:01:49.920> but

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
synonyms they have similar meanings but

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.109 
synonyms they have similar meanings but
giant<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> little<00:01:51.869> bit<00:01:52.020> stronger<00:01:52.439> and

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
giant is just a little bit stronger and

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.399 
giant is just a little bit stronger and
then<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.420> say<00:01:54.600> something<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:55.170> enormous

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
then if we say something is enormous

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.209 
then if we say something is enormous
that's<00:01:58.409> even<00:01:59.100> stronger<00:02:00.259> that's<00:02:01.259> even<00:02:01.979> bigger

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that's even stronger that's even bigger

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's even stronger that's even bigger
