00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
bowl cut face ok let's get straight to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.230 
bowl cut face ok let's get straight to
it<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.320> first<00:00:28.320> thing<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.590> bought<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.429> big<00:00:29.849> box

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it so first thing I bought was a big box

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.319 
it so first thing I bought was a big box
set<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.920> instant<00:00:31.920> porridge<00:00:32.250> oats<00:00:32.460> from<00:00:32.910> my

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
set of instant porridge oats from my

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.420 
set of instant porridge oats from my
protein<00:00:33.809> calm<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> reason<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.219> bought

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
protein calm now the reason I bought

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
protein calm now the reason I bought
this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.969> because<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.660> instant<00:00:37.230> hire<00:00:37.440> so

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
this is because it's instant hire so

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.549 
this is because it's instant hire so
it's<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.250> pale<00:00:38.579> during<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.180> fine<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it's really pale during really fine so I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's really pale during really fine so I
usually<00:00:40.860> put<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.640> breakfast<00:00:42.239> shake

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
usually put this in my breakfast shake

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.630 
usually put this in my breakfast shake
so<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> usually<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.739> scoop<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.579> whey

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
so I usually have a scoop of whey

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.119 
so I usually have a scoop of whey
protein<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.870> I'll<00:00:46.079> put<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> oats<00:00:46.920> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
protein and I'll put into the oats in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
protein and I'll put into the oats in
there<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.399> well<00:00:47.430> obviously<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> ones

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750

from<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> supermarket<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.700> difficult

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
from the supermarket but it's difficult

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.689 
from the supermarket but it's difficult
to<00:00:51.270> find<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.170> sort<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.129> fire<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.270 
to find it really sort of fire and
powdered<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> goes<00:00:55.559> down<00:00:55.829> smooth

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
powdered so that it goes down smooth

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
powdered so that it goes down smooth
with<00:00:56.579> your<00:00:56.760> shake<00:00:57.320> alright<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.500> that's<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with your shake alright so that's the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
with your shake alright so that's the
part<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> jokes<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.629> next<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.020> I'll<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
part of jokes the next one I'll go on to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.380 
part of jokes the next one I'll go on to
is<00:01:01.920> I'd<00:01:02.309> say<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.520> different<00:01:03.030> types<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
is I'd say two different types of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.670 
is I'd say two different types of
protein<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:05.270> I've<00:01:06.270> got

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.030 

I've<00:01:09.100> got<00:01:09.310> whey<00:01:09.520> protein<00:01:10.180> which<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.410> good<00:01:12.010> for

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
I've got whey protein which is good for

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.670 
I've got whey protein which is good for
I<00:01:12.670> had<00:01:12.970> this<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.630> morning<00:01:13.810> because<00:01:14.470> it

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
nutrients screaming for protein so i'll

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.480 
nutrients screaming for protein so i'll
have<00:01:27.940> some<00:01:28.270> whey<00:01:28.630> protein<00:01:29.200> immediately<00:01:30.100> after

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490

my workout and what I normally do is I
mix<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:33.070> with<00:01:33.400> some<00:01:34.360> dextrose<00:01:34.780> powder<00:01:35.229> as

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
mix that with some dextrose powder as

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.060 
mix that with some dextrose powder as
well<00:01:36.360> run<00:01:37.360> out<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.570> dextrose<00:01:38.020> caliber<00:01:38.470> but<00:01:38.800> you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
well run out of dextrose caliber but you

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.100 
well run out of dextrose caliber but you
can<00:01:39.250> buy<00:01:39.400> dextrose<00:01:39.820> powder<00:01:40.090> for<00:01:40.360> cheap<00:01:40.600> anyway

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
can buy dextrose powder for cheap anyway

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.010 
can buy dextrose powder for cheap anyway
like<00:01:41.380> superdrug<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.479> think<00:01:43.479> they<00:01:43.540> said<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.899> for

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
like superdrug I think they said it for

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.950 
like superdrug I think they said it for
like<00:01:44.140> three<00:01:44.410> pounds<00:01:44.649> four<00:01:45.160> pounds<00:01:45.640> for<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:46.390> box

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
like three pounds four pounds for a box

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.950 
like three pounds four pounds for a box
so<00:01:47.649> is<00:01:47.860> really<00:01:48.100> cheap<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.729> that'll<00:01:49.390> help<00:01:49.509> you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
to recover as well help recover energy

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.139 
to recover as well help recover energy
back<00:01:52.630> into<00:01:52.660> your<00:01:52.990> glycogen<00:01:53.229> schools<00:01:54.149> so

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
back into your glycogen schools so

back into your glycogen schools so
that's<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.140> whey<00:01:56.290> protein

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.750 

the<00:01:59.840> second<00:02:00.260> type<00:02:00.410> of<00:02:00.440> protein<00:02:01.070> my<00:02:01.220> take<00:02:01.550> is

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
the second type of protein my take is

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.270 
the second type of protein my take is
called<00:02:02.210> caffeine<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.230> I<00:02:03.620> call<00:02:04.160> this

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
called caffeine so this is I call this

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.270 
called caffeine so this is I call this
bedtime<00:02:04.760> protein<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.930> releases<00:02:06.110> energy<00:02:06.650> or

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
bedtime protein so it releases energy or

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.550 
bedtime protein so it releases energy or
releases<00:02:07.760> protein<00:02:08.270> /<00:02:08.720> about<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.080> six-hour

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
releases protein / about the six-hour

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.490 
releases protein / about the six-hour
period<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.700> just<00:02:11.390> before<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.660> go<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.840> bed<00:02:11.990> I

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
period so just before I go to bed I

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.160 
period so just before I go to bed I
usually<00:02:13.100> have<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.460> caffeine<00:02:14.120> shake<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
usually have a caffeine shake so that

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
usually have a caffeine shake so that
while<00:02:15.410> asleep<00:02:15.680> our<00:02:16.220> muscles<00:02:16.670> are<00:02:16.760> still

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
while asleep our muscles are still

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.130 
while asleep our muscles are still
getting<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.450> steady<00:02:18.100> stream<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.220> protein

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.990 

before<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.680> around<00:02:24.980> my<00:02:25.160> work<00:02:25.340> out<00:02:25.700> what<00:02:25.970> I

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
before and around my work out what I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.320 
before and around my work out what I
would<00:02:26.150> normally<00:02:26.270> have<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:28.180> I'll<00:02:29.180> have<00:02:29.209> a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
would normally have is I'll have a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.760 
would normally have is I'll have a
creatine<00:02:29.750> drink<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:32.260> 45<00:02:33.260> grams<00:02:33.560> of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
creatine drink so this is 45 grams of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.699 
creatine drink so this is 45 grams of
creatine<00:02:34.010> per<00:02:34.520> serving<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.180> also<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.560> has

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
creatine per serving and also it has

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.350 
creatine per serving and also it has
other<00:02:36.860> things<00:02:37.160> in<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.459> help<00:02:37.610> shuttle<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
other things in it that help shuttle the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.729 
other things in it that help shuttle the
creatine<00:02:38.900> into<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.470> muscles<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.280> things<00:02:41.090> like

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
creatine into the muscles so things like

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.780 
creatine into the muscles so things like
dextrose<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:43.010> was<00:02:43.160> talking<00:02:43.550> about<00:02:43.610> earlier

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
dextrose I was talking about earlier

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.229 
dextrose I was talking about earlier
this<00:02:44.239> comes<00:02:44.540> pre<00:02:44.840> mixed<00:02:45.080> with<00:02:45.380> dextrose<00:02:46.239> it

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
this comes pre mixed with dextrose it

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.890 
this comes pre mixed with dextrose it
has<00:02:47.450> alpha<00:02:48.410> lipoic<00:02:48.590> acid<00:02:48.920> taurine<00:02:49.820> wire<00:02:50.570> boast

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
has alpha lipoic acid taurine wire boast

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.170 
has alpha lipoic acid taurine wire boast
all<00:02:51.440> these<00:02:51.680> things<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.190> help<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.670> shuttle

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
all these things that help to shuttle

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.660 
all these things that help to shuttle
the<00:02:53.270> creatine<00:02:53.750> into<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.290> muscles<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.459> what

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the creatine into the muscles so what

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.330 
the creatine into the muscles so what
creating<00:02:56.209> does<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.750> helps<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.320> makes<00:02:58.220> you

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
creating does is it helps you makes you

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.479 
creating does is it helps you makes you
stronger<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:59.360> will<00:02:59.750> make<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.680> bigger<00:03:01.160> through

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
stronger it will make you bigger through

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.400 
stronger it will make you bigger through
retaining<00:03:02.060> more<00:03:02.180> water<00:03:02.450> within<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.020> muscles

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
retaining more water within the muscles

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.990 
retaining more water within the muscles
that's<00:03:04.160> not<00:03:04.310> necessarily<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.760> bad<00:03:04.940> thing

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
that's not necessarily a bad thing

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.229 
that's not necessarily a bad thing
because<00:03:05.420> water<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:06.610> makes<00:03:07.610> up<00:03:07.820> seventy

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
because water is makes up seventy

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.320 
because water is makes up seventy
percent<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> muscles<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.030> that's<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.180> good

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
percent of the muscles so that's a good

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.810 
percent of the muscles so that's a good
thing<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.690> also<00:03:11.989> gives<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:13.190> energy<00:03:13.489> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
thing it also gives you the energy to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.949 
thing it also gives you the energy to
perform<00:03:14.390> an<00:03:14.780> extra<00:03:15.290> one<00:03:15.500> or<00:03:15.620> two<00:03:15.799> grips<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.959> it

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
perform an extra one or two grips so it

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.440 
perform an extra one or two grips so it
produces<00:03:18.170> ATP<00:03:18.980> which<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.910> energy<00:03:19.970> source

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
produces ATP which is the energy source

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.090 
produces ATP which is the energy source
will<00:03:20.690> be<00:03:20.840> using<00:03:21.230> when<00:03:21.350> we're<00:03:21.500> lifting<00:03:21.650> heavy

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
will be using when we're lifting heavy

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.199 
will be using when we're lifting heavy
weights<00:03:22.600> okay<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:23.660> that's<00:03:23.900> creating<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:25.209> also

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
weights okay so that's creating I also

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.150 
weights okay so that's creating I also
add<00:03:26.540> some<00:03:26.750> extra<00:03:26.959> creatine<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:27.920> this<00:03:28.040> is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
add some extra creatine to that this is

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.630 
add some extra creatine to that this is
just<00:03:28.310> plain<00:03:28.580> creatine<00:03:29.239> powder<00:03:30.640> playing

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
just plain creatine powder playing

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640 
just plain creatine powder playing
creatine<00:03:32.060> powder<00:03:32.299> doesn't<00:03:32.690> absorb<00:03:33.080> as<00:03:33.290> well

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
creatine powder doesn't absorb as well

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.789 
creatine powder doesn't absorb as well
as<00:03:34.510> when<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.540> spike<00:03:36.049> your<00:03:36.260> insulin<00:03:36.410> levels

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
as when you spike your insulin levels

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.990 
as when you spike your insulin levels
with<00:03:38.140> dextrose<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:39.530> dextrose<00:03:40.489> gives<00:03:40.880> your

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
with dextrose so dextrose gives your

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.300 
with dextrose so dextrose gives your
body<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.420> incidence<00:03:41.959> flag<00:03:42.320> and

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
body and incidence flag and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.949 
body and incidence flag and
that<00:03:43.550> will<00:03:43.670> help<00:03:43.819> shuttle<00:03:44.209> with<00:03:44.480> creating

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
that will help shuttle with creating

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.940 
that will help shuttle with creating
into<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.440> muscles<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:47.080> add<00:03:48.080> this<00:03:48.560> extra

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
into the muscles I add this extra

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.610 
into the muscles I add this extra
creating<00:03:49.670> into<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.450> shape<00:03:50.690> as<00:03:50.900> well<00:03:51.110> without

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
creating into the shape as well without

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.449 
creating into the shape as well without
adding<00:03:51.920> any<00:03:52.130> extra<00:03:52.250> sugars<00:03:52.760> or<00:03:52.849> calories

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
adding any extra sugars or calories

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.250 
adding any extra sugars or calories
finally<00:03:55.459> what<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.640> take<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:56.209> some<00:03:56.720> branch<00:03:56.989> chain

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
finally what I take is some branch chain

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.030 
finally what I take is some branch chain
amino<00:03:57.290> acids<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:59.170> branch<00:04:00.170> chain<00:04:00.410> amino<00:04:00.440> acids

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
amino acids so branch chain amino acids

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.770 
amino acids so branch chain amino acids
make<00:04:01.250> up<00:04:01.430> about<00:04:01.550> thirty<00:04:01.940> five<00:04:02.209> percent<00:04:02.239> of

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
make up about thirty five percent of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.350 
make up about thirty five percent of
your<00:04:02.900> muscles<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:04.489> do<00:04:04.610> get<00:04:04.790> branched

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
your muscles so you do get branched

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.930 
your muscles so you do get branched
chain<00:04:05.540> amino<00:04:05.569> acids<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.440> whey<00:04:07.010> protein<00:04:07.610> shakes

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
chain amino acids in whey protein shakes

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.839 
chain amino acids in whey protein shakes
as<00:04:08.209> well<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:09.650> these<00:04:09.950> are<00:04:10.160> much<00:04:10.340> more<00:04:10.580> readily

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
as well but these are much more readily

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.750 
as well but these are much more readily
available<00:04:11.360> so<00:04:11.989> during<00:04:12.980> your<00:04:13.099> workout<00:04:13.580> what

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
available so during your workout what

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.580 
available so during your workout what
your<00:04:13.910> body's<00:04:14.180> going<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.630> do<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:15.019> going<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.380> try

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
your body's going to do is going to try

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.650 
your body's going to do is going to try
and<00:04:15.620> pull<00:04:15.950> branched<00:04:16.459> chain<00:04:16.639> amino<00:04:16.669> acids<00:04:17.299> from

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
and pull branched chain amino acids from

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.990 
and pull branched chain amino acids from
your<00:04:17.900> muscles<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:19.250> want<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.519> avoid<00:04:19.760> that

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
your muscles and you want to avoid that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.099 
your muscles and you want to avoid that
because<00:04:20.090> that's<00:04:20.359> going<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.660> put<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:20.959> in<00:04:20.989> a

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
because that's going to put you in a
