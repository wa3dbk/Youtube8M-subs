00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 sonic free riders is a decent game 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 but he has a big problem that almost 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.250
 almost ruins the entire experience of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.730
 game what is that problem questions is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.369
 a game of kinect yes what irony but 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.369
 This is the more and more I played the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.859
 game more I thought oh god what a pity 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.869
 that this is a game of kinect 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.300
 been so great that it was a game for 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.800
 the classic control 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 come with me and I'll tell you why 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.040
 whether you love her or hate her I think 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.980
 Every sonic fan has played a sonic 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.140
 riders at some time this last 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.720
 delivery of the saga of riders is the one 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.930
 more is coming and at the same time the one that 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.600
 more away from the original formula the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.400
 graphics of this game are very good not 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.850
 they are quality and with law or sonic 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.590
 but they are very colorful 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.260
 detailed and beautiful in their own style 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.229
 the music of the game is also very good 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.610
 they are sticky melodies that go according 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.440
 with each level and the theme of the game free 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.619
 it's also very good there are two versions 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.020
 of free the original of chris martin that 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.400
 is the one that comes out in the game and the version 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.450
 of the 40 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.450
 choose your favorite 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.870
 now that we talk about the goodness of the game 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.040
 let's talk about the bad controls 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.400
 yourself in theory is simple you move 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.200
 so to go to the left and so to go 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.259
 on the right 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.020
 the problem is that 40 percent of 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.049
 sometimes the kinect will not recognize 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.950
 your movements but with practice and 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:54.180
 a lot of patience you can reach 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.800
 master the movement quite well 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.260
 now the jump that's a different subject 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.220
 to jump you have to do so if you 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.550
 do you do this or that way the kinect is not going to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.330
 recognize it the only way is by doing it 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.470
 and almost touching the floor but although 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.670
 do so 70% of the time the jump 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.459
 it's going to go wrong what injustice also 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.320
 is this other movement that consists 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.940
 in reaching out and grabbing a 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.270
 pole sounds simple it is and the truth 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.380
 I do not understand why 80% of the time 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.790
 the kinect does not recognize your stretched arm 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.489
 I think the kindle has a problem 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.080
 to recognize the extremities and the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.420
 best example of this is the motorcycle 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.520
 what a pity because one would think that it is 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.640
 easier to ride a motorcycle than a board 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.240
 flying to drive the motorcycle you have 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.570
 that put your hands like that and move like that 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.240
 see simple you should do it even today in 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.850
 I do not understand why it is so 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.370
 difficult to try to move with the motorbike 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.680
 every time I try to turn the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.650
 left or right the motorbike 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.920
 it just stops is crazy 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.500
 let's talk about the story I remember that 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.689
 during my fly free of sonic riders I 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.140
 I complained about the story of the game saying 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:27.390
 that was too simple good that 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.299
 History is a compared masterpiece 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.970
 with the sonic free riders or god 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.560
 mine and I thought that sony colors and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.439
 sony generation had stories 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.019
 simple at least in those games you 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.269
 I noticed that they were trying in the spin zone 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.329
 riders the story reaches a few levels 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.940
 so great in simplicity that for the first 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.280
 once in a game of sonic I feel that the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.519
 story is just an excuse to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.639
 unite the levels the story is that 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.069
 sonic tails and noos entered the former 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.030
 world grand prix to win the jet already 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.930
 his friends 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.750
 and if that's basically all there is one that 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.840
 another surprise if we can call 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.060
 surprise that during the game but 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.060
 nothing that no sonic fan would have 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.609
 could have imagined at the beginning 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.039
 of the game 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.949
 maybe the story of this game does not 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.770
 would bother me so much if at least we 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:31.530
 they taught with videos what I mean 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:35.719
 with this I looked I'm going to die by 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.719
 cinemas before being quarrelsome 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:45.000
 And if that's what I mean, what is this? 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.569
 they look like videos from a game of ds or 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.270
 psp this is a 360 team for the love of 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.310
 god the sones previous riders all 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.560
 they had had videos to tell the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.830
 history and those games were in 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.039
 much much less powerful consoles that 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.189
 the emo 360 so why this game 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.669
 he had videos I do not know but they do not have 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:11.219
 excuse for not having used videos 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:14.099
 there is simply no justification is 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.110
 simply unacceptable is worth noting 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.409
 also that the voices of this game 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.860
 all and absolutely all are 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:25.620
 simply ordered and no fault 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.719
 absolutely with the character but this 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.270
 game is not to blame since that is 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:33.210
 something that has emerged from sonic colors 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.610
 until now it is a pity god 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.490
 my long life to jason griffin friends 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.400
 Long life to Jason Griffith One thing 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.759
 silly of the game is the style 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.229
 I do not want to go into much detail but 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.180
 supposedly refers to which side is 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.940
 better to play with each character 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.620
 the regular style means that it is 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.590
 better play with your chest towards the 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.389
 right and the goofy style means 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.840
 that it is better to play with the chest towards the 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.960
 left 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.240
 bufÃ­ means silly in English and that 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.380
 perfect name they gave him because it's what 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.810
 that this is silly knows is silly and 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.070
 I mean, he already gave that goofy style in 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.980
 Look, look, it's true 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:20.030
 and now I will talk about the worst the worst 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.690
 that this game has the menu or my god 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.160
 it's a nightmare and it's something inexplicable 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.880
 you have to live it to know how 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.490
 tedious is I do not know why but this fails 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.500
 one hundred percent of the time the menu 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.840
 it should be that the options are in 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.030
 screen and you simply select 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.600
 what you want but instead 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.190
 we have this stupid tree is this 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.830
 it's the worst part of the game because you're going to 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.190
 suffer it all the time at every moment and 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.650
 in all the games you have as is 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.650
 possible is to be able to do something so simple so 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:59.090
 essential as the menu of a game the 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:01.700
 answer with a kinect in conclusion 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.590
 sonic free riders is a decent game to 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.900
 Despite his pile of problems, 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.910
 we can blame the game for all the 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.520
 most of your problems have to do 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.190
 with the kinect and the kinect is a device 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.690
 that comes badly from factory has its 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.350
 good times but many 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.850
 opportunities fails and to be honest 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.830
 all the sonic games that I've played 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.560
 in my life this is the one that has least 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.240
 liked although I must admit that it is 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.550
 quite exciting when you're 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.510
 streak and you win three or four races 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.370
 followed is a good feeling and the 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.200
 tracings of the levels I also 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.030
 they seemed pretty good to say 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.770
 true that's something that you have to 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.110
 acknowledge it 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.629
 and the multiplayer of this game is not 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.389
 bad is entertaining to play with your 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:50.000
 friends if you're a sonic fan and you have a 

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:51.260
 kinect this is an indispensable game 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.500
 for you 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.060
 but if you do not have a kinect this is a 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.610
 game that you can predict in your 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:02.540
 collection the note that I give to this 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:05.570
 game is 6.5 and I feel like I'm being 

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.070
 very gentle with him thank you for watching my 

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:10.180
 review 

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.180
 I am marco, I say goodbye
