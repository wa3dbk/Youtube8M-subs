00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.500 

okay<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:48.650> all<00:01:48.770> mounted<00:01:49.160> at<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.300> back<00:01:50.480> of

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
okay and we all mounted at the back of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.360 
okay and we all mounted at the back of
the<00:01:52.210> fuselage<00:01:54.760> now<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.820> 433<00:01:56.650> mhz<00:01:57.650> controller

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
the fuselage now the 433 mhz controller

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.570 
the fuselage now the 433 mhz controller
will<00:01:58.970> actually<00:01:59.630> installed<00:02:00.430> inside<00:02:01.430> the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
will actually installed inside the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.580 
will actually installed inside the
fuselage<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.330> it's<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.930> like<00:02:03.020> it's

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
fuselage and it's just like it's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.420 
fuselage and it's just like it's
replacing<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.560> radio<00:02:06.560> receiver<00:02:06.980> your<00:02:07.250> own

replacing the radio receiver your own

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.210 
replacing the radio receiver your own
original<00:02:08.170> normal<00:02:09.170> radio<00:02:09.440> receiver<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.040> will

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
original normal radio receiver it will

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.240 
original normal radio receiver it will
replace<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.150> because<00:02:11.780> your<00:02:12.650> original

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
replace it because your original

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.060 
replace it because your original
receiver<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:14.180> actually<00:02:14.780> down<00:02:15.530> here<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
receiver is actually down here on the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.760 
receiver is actually down here on the

actually receiver and you can mount it
on<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.220> plane<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:48.020> here's<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.229> current

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
on the plane and here's the current

00:04:49.590 --> 00:05:00.790 
on the plane and here's the current
sensor

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800
