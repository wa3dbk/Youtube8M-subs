00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.731
Leon: We're 3 votes
down again, sir.

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:05.733
Mr. President,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.235
As of this morning,

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:08.737
Sydney only needed
one more vote.

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:11.106
Now, the motown 3 have
gotta be scared blind.

00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:13.741
I don't think they will
be a better opportunity.

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:14.776
The press expects
an announcement

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:15.809
On the crime bill

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:17.745
By the state
of the union.

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:19.413
And if you agree
to stick 455 in a drawer

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:20.681
Till after elections,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.250
They'll give you
the 3 votes.

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:24.418
Robin:
And we declare victory.

00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:28.422
We said as a last resort.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.723
We're there, sir.

00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.676
State of the union
is 48 hours away.

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:33.177
Come on, leon!

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:34.712
There's gotta be
3 votes someplace.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.780
Leon:
There isn't.

00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:37.298
Bullshit! There's gotta
be somebody. Storch.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:38.299
I beg your pardon?

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.366
What about storch?

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:40.534
No. Storch is a no.

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:42.253
Mr. President...

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:43.254
Wagner?

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:44.255
No.

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:45.256
Sople?
No.

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:46.290
No.
Clark?

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.126
Not that clark.
The one from indiana.

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:49.944
That one, too, sir.

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:51.279
Mr. President,

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:52.780
I think
we have to do this.

00:00:52.847 --> 00:00:55.383
A.J., she is one vote away.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.885
It's important legislation

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:59.220
That for the first time
has a legitimate chance.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:00.721
She deserves
every opportunity...

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.623
Lewis: She?

00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:05.259
You meant it,
didn't you, sir?

00:01:05.327 --> 00:01:06.728
You meant
the important legislation

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.129
Deserves every opportunity.

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:09.230
Lewis, shut up.

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:11.165
You have something
to say to me, lewis?

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.734
Respectfully, sir,

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.736
I think we should examine
the new poll

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.537
For something more than--

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:18.273
Examine what? They don't
like my dating sydney?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.141
It's not that simple.

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.243
I think that this poll
brings a murky problem

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.811
Into specific relief.

00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:25.813
Who's problem are
we talking about, lewis?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.316
Yours? You worried
about losing your job?

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:29.834
Because this poll

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:31.836
Isn't talking
about my presidency!

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:34.255
This poll is talking
about my life!

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.290
264 million people--

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:37.842
264 million people

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.344
Don't give a damn
about your life!

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:40.945
They give a damn
about their own!

00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:42.446
All right!
That's enough.

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:43.514
[sighs]

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:44.715
Mr. President,

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:46.768
You've raised
a daughter...

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.604
Almost entirely
on your own.

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:51.372
And she's terrific.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.340
So what does
it say to you

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:54.842
That in the past
7 weeks

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.043
59% of this country

00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:58.463
Has begun to question
your family values?

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.431
The president doesn't
answer to you, lewis.

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.266
Oh, yes, he does, a.J.
I'm a citizen.

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:03.768
This is &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; president.

00:02:03.836 --> 00:02:05.269
And in this country,

00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:07.104
It is not only permissible
to question our leaders,

00:02:07.172 --> 00:02:08.673
It's our responsibility.

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:11.358
But you already know that,
don't you, mr. President?

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:13.861
Because you have a deeper
love of this country

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.297
Than any man
I've ever known.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.366
And I wanna know
what it says to you

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:19.867
That in the past 7 weeks

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:23.037
59% of americans have begun
to question your patriotism.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:24.906
Look, if people
wanna listen to--

00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:26.407
They don't have
a choice!

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:29.277
Bob rumson is the only
one doing the talking!

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:30.894
People want leadership,
mr. President.

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:32.896
And in the absence
of genuine leadership,

00:02:32.964 --> 00:02:34.131
They'll listen to anyone

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.800
Who steps up
to the microphone.

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:38.402
They want leadership.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.904
They're so thirsty
for it,

00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:41.805
They'll crawl through
the desert toward a mirage,

00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:43.307
And when they discover
there's no water,

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:44.709
They'll drink the sand.

00:02:46.578 --> 00:02:49.914
Lewis, we've have presidents
who were beloved

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.899
Who couldn't find
a coherent sentence

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:53.984
With 2 hands
and a flashlight.

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:58.323
People don't drink the sand
because they're thirsty.
