the<00:00:21.390> base<00:00:21.510> now<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.410> I'm<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> use<00:00:22.710> here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the base now what I'm going to use here

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.429 
the base now what I'm going to use here
is<00:00:23.279> multi-purpose<00:00:23.850> compost<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.350> also

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
is multi-purpose compost and I also

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.160 
is multi-purpose compost and I also
going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> add<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:25.949> moisture<00:00:26.430> control<00:00:26.820> gel<00:00:27.170> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
going to add in moisture control gel the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
going to add in moisture control gel the
moisture<00:00:28.470> control<00:00:28.680> gel<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.279> great<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
moisture control gel is great because it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.669 
moisture control gel is great because it
just<00:00:30.449> means<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> water<00:00:31.470> as

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
just means you don't have to water as

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.410 
just means you don't have to water as
much<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.399> also<00:00:32.730> there's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> slow<00:00:33.149> release

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
much and also there's a slow release

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.450 
much and also there's a slow release
fertilizer<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> slow<00:00:35.190> release

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
fertilizer in it so the slow release

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
fertilizer in it so the slow release
fertilizer<00:00:35.960> will<00:00:36.960> feed<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> plants<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.800> over

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
fertilizer will feed the plants for over

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
fertilizer will feed the plants for over
six<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> eight<00:00:38.430> months<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.450> still<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.899> to
