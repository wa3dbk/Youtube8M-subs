is your range a typical day it depends
i'd<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.340> how<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> wind<00:01:59.790> is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
i'd go out there and see how the wind is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.359 
i'd go out there and see how the wind is
so<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:01.110> how<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.290> conditions<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.340> uh

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
so you see how the conditions are but uh

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.620 
so you see how the conditions are but uh
usually<00:02:03.500> i'd<00:02:04.500> say<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> 35<00:02:05.570> get<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
usually i'd say get it to the 35 get the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.460 
usually i'd say get it to the 35 get the
ball<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> 35<00:02:07.380> coach<00:02:07.799> that's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:09.470> 53-yarder

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
ball to the 35 coach that's a 53-yarder

53<00:02:11.190> 54<00:02:11.849> yarder<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.480> um<00:02:12.629> if

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
53 54 yarder but um if

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.710 
53 54 yarder but um if
we<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.660> go<00:02:13.780> back<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.440> needed<00:02:14.940> 55<00:02:15.940> 60

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
we have to go back and it's needed 55 60

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.110 
we have to go back and it's needed 55 60
60<00:02:17.230> that's<00:02:18.070> probably<00:02:18.430> my<00:02:18.520> range<00:02:18.760> right<00:02:18.970> there

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
60 that's probably my range right there

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.020 
60 that's probably my range right there
and<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.490> half<00:02:21.670> time<00:02:21.880> in
