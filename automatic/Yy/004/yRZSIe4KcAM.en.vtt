00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
changes the first thing and probably

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.250 
changes the first thing and probably
most<00:00:15.179> important<00:00:15.599> thing<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.750> my<00:00:15.780> opinion<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
most important thing in my opinion is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.779 
most important thing in my opinion is
that<00:00:16.289> now<00:00:16.560> when<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.920> play<00:00:17.070> co-op<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
that now when you play co-op and be a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.400 
that now when you play co-op and be a
defeat<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> area<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.990> actually<00:00:19.199> get

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
as well um you know as long as you had

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.760 
as well um you know as long as you had
to<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:21.630> off<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> convent<00:01:22.229> wings<00:01:22.439> when<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to take off the convent wings when you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649 
to take off the convent wings when you
in<00:01:22.860> someone<00:01:23.159> else's<00:01:23.460> world<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> fan<00:01:24.090> mmm<00:01:24.479> not

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
in someone else's world as a fan mmm not

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
in someone else's world as a fan mmm not
sure<00:01:24.689> why<00:01:24.990> ever<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.259> would<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> thing<00:01:25.770> but

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
sure why ever this would be a thing but

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.289 
sure why ever this would be a thing but
I'm<00:01:26.100> guessing<00:01:26.250> those<00:01:26.460> some<00:01:26.759> major<00:01:26.939> reasons

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
I'm guessing those some major reasons

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.399 
I'm guessing those some major reasons
whether<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.020> yeah<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
whether to do this but yeah that's the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
whether to do this but yeah that's the
thing<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.619> well<00:01:29.060> apparent<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> bug

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
thing as well apparent there's a bug

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.550 
thing as well apparent there's a bug
that<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> dropped<00:01:31.049> an<00:01:31.170> item<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.500> then

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that when you dropped an item and then

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
that when you dropped an item and then
you<00:01:31.680> try<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> pick<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.340> again<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you try to pick it back up again it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.219 
you try to pick it back up again it
would<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.420> allow<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.110> would

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
would not allow you to do and it would

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
would not allow you to do and it would
stay<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.409> venture<00:01:34.680> useful<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.130> no<00:01:35.250> reason<00:01:35.670> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
stay in venture useful for no reason so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.539 
stay in venture useful for no reason so
that's<00:01:36.299> been<00:01:36.450> fixed<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.840> well<00:01:37.049> um<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that's been fixed as well um in the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
that's been fixed as well um in the
things<00:01:39.479> betwixt<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> tutorial<00:01:40.590> level

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
things betwixt when the tutorial level

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.990 
things betwixt when the tutorial level
you<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> coffin<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.909> if

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
you all know there's a coffin that if

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.190 
you all know there's a coffin that if
you<00:01:42.090> gain<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> start<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> game<00:01:42.869> any<00:01:43.020> other

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you gain and start the game any other

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
you gain and start the game any other
point<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> game<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.860> near<00:01:44.579> those<00:01:44.670> two

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
point in the game really near those two

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.460 
point in the game really near those two
hip<00:01:45.119> hold<00:01:45.299> things<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.110> change<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
hip hold things it would change the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.630 
hip hold things it would change the
gender<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:46.829> character<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.549> you

another bug that apparent in certain

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.100 
another bug that apparent in certain
locations<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.540> would<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:00.780> display<00:02:01.049> the

bloodstains delusions and the messages

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.069 
bloodstains delusions and the messages
in<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.180> no<00:02:03.390> apparent<00:02:03.689> reason<00:02:03.719> I'm<00:02:04.049> not

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
in that for no apparent reason I'm not

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.719 
in that for no apparent reason I'm not
sure<00:02:04.320> why<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.740> anyway<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.009> fix<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.579> well

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
sure why but anyway the fix that as well

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.059 
sure why but anyway the fix that as well
so<00:02:05.759> that's<00:02:06.149> good<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.619> there's<00:02:07.799> also<00:02:07.950> another

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
so that's good and there's also another

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
so that's good and there's also another
bug<00:02:08.340> were<00:02:08.520> certain<00:02:09.000> locations<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.569> some

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
bug were certain locations of some

that's<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.350> thing<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:17.830> fix<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.250> as

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
that's the thing so that fix that as

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.640 
that's the thing so that fix that as
well<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.510> display<00:02:19.780> response<00:02:20.200> time<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
well the display response time but the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.440 
well the display response time but the
character<00:02:20.980> meeting<00:02:21.280> has<00:02:21.430> been<00:02:21.550> improved<00:02:22.000> so
