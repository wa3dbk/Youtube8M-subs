00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I'm hoping it's a correction I hope this

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.520 
I'm hoping it's a correction I hope this
isn't<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.799> chart<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.840> starting<00:01:13.259> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
isn't a chart that that is starting to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.460 
isn't a chart that that is starting to
look<00:01:13.649> similar<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.570> 1929<00:01:15.570> chart<00:01:16.049> where<00:01:16.320> we

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
look similar to the 1929 chart where we

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.219 
look similar to the 1929 chart where we
had<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.829> run<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
had the run and then there and then a

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.230 
had the run and then there and then a
retracement<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:20.100> 33<00:01:20.729> which<00:01:20.969> was<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
retracement back into 33 which was a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
retracement back into 33 which was a
seventy<00:01:22.079> percent<00:01:22.229> drop<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> equity

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
seventy percent drop in the equity

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
seventy percent drop in the equity
market<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.509> we're<00:01:24.899> there<00:01:24.930> i'm<00:01:25.380> not

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
market I don't think we're there i'm not

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
market I don't think we're there i'm not
i'm<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.250> calling<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.240> Newsday<00:01:27.540> drop<00:01:28.079> in

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
i'm not calling for a Newsday drop in

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.179 
i'm not calling for a Newsday drop in
the<00:01:28.380> equity<00:01:28.710> market<00:01:29.070> we've<00:01:30.060> been<00:01:31.189> relatively

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the equity market we've been relatively

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.899 
the equity market we've been relatively
neutral<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.869> stand<00:01:34.829> offish<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> equity

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
neutral to to stand offish on the equity

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.160 
neutral to to stand offish on the equity
market<00:01:36.329> since<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.719> end<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> year

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
market since the end of the year

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.609 
market since the end of the year
thinking<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.189> ahead<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.460> itself<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
thinking it was well ahead of itself and

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.679 
thinking it was well ahead of itself and
so<00:01:40.619> we're<00:01:41.130> assuming<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
so we're assuming here that this is a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.880 
so we're assuming here that this is a
correction<00:01:43.469> it<00:01:43.860> could<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:45.539> further

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
correction it could go a little further

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.770 
correction it could go a little further
it's<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.130> some<00:01:47.430> momentum<00:01:47.820> behind<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.659> because

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's got some momentum behind it because

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.170 
it's got some momentum behind it because
of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> emerging<00:01:49.649> market<00:01:50.070> issues<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:51.060> have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
of the emerging market issues that have

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.289 
of the emerging market issues that have
developed<00:01:51.329> since<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> Fed<00:01:52.140> has<00:01:53.119> begun<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
developed since the Fed has begun to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.319 
developed since the Fed has begun to
tighten<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.460> may<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.670> some<00:01:57.090> more

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
tighten and so there may be some more

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
tighten and so there may be some more
pain<00:01:57.630> ahead<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:59.310> think<00:01:59.520> we're<00:01:59.789> far

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
pain ahead but I don't think we're far

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.929 
pain ahead but I don't think we're far
away<00:02:00.479> from<00:02:00.770> from<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.859> buying<00:02:02.100> opportunity<00:02:02.250> in

think draggy has made it very clear that
he's<00:04:08.579> concerned<00:04:09.000> about<00:04:09.299> deflation<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.170> again

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
he's concerned about deflation and again

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.289 
he's concerned about deflation and again
within<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.730> context<00:04:12.620> if<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:14.489> buy<00:04:14.760> into<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
within that context if you buy into the

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.539 
within that context if you buy into the
argument<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.519> simply<00:04:17.519> a

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
argument that this is a simply a

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.670 
argument that this is a simply a
correction<00:04:18.090> in<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.209> US<00:04:18.540> equity<00:04:19.019> market<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
correction in the US equity market and

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.390 
correction in the US equity market and
the<00:04:20.040> US<00:04:20.400> economy<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:22.470> know<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.710> not<00:04:22.860> robust

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
the US economy is you know is not robust

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.750 
the US economy is you know is not robust
but<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.940> certainly<00:04:24.300> growing

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
but is certainly growing

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.390 
but is certainly growing
which<00:04:26.180> seems<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:27.020> be<00:04:27.140> confirmed<00:04:27.710> from<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.160> Fed

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
which seems to be confirmed from the Fed

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.250 
which seems to be confirmed from the Fed
I<00:04:28.430> mean<00:04:28.730> why<00:04:28.910> would<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.240> Fed<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:30.140> know

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
I mean why would the Fed you know

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.470 
I mean why would the Fed you know
increase<00:04:30.890> or<00:04:31.250> decrease<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.760> tapering<00:04:32.270> by

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
increase or decrease the tapering by

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.290 
increase or decrease the tapering by
another<00:04:32.840> ten<00:04:33.170> billion<00:04:33.440> dollars<00:04:34.030> unless<00:04:35.030> it

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
another ten billion dollars unless it

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.150 
another ten billion dollars unless it
had<00:04:35.450> some<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.200> comfort<00:04:36.590> level<00:04:36.890> that<00:04:36.920> the

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
had some kind of comfort level that the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.430 
had some kind of comfort level that the
economy<00:04:37.460> at<00:04:37.730> least<00:04:37.940> could<00:04:38.090> handle<00:04:38.480> it<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.840> if

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
economy at least could handle it and if

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.380 
economy at least could handle it and if
that's<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.860> case<00:04:40.220> in<00:04:40.640> Europe<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.150> still

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
that's the case in Europe is still

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.590 
that's the case in Europe is still
fighting<00:04:41.810> deflation<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.270> make<00:04:44.450> the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
fighting deflation you have to make the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.240 
fighting deflation you have to make the
assumption<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:45.110> money<00:04:45.440> is<00:04:45.620> going<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.040> flow

capital flows are going to continue into
the<00:04:48.290> US<00:04:48.710> dollar<00:04:49.040> which<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.240> think<00:04:50.660> at<00:04:51.260> least<00:04:51.530> in

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
the US dollar which I think at least in

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.260 
the US dollar which I think at least in
the<00:04:51.920> short<00:04:52.160> term<00:04:52.370> is<00:04:52.550> going<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:52.850> be<00:04:52.970> negative

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
the short term is going to be negative

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.180 
the short term is going to be negative
or<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.720> going<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.990> be<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.140> serious<00:04:54.560> head<00:04:54.770> win<00:04:54.950> for

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
or is going to be a serious head win for

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.950 
or is going to be a serious head win for
the<00:04:55.280> metals<00:04:55.640> finally<00:04:56.360> Peter<00:04:56.600> let's<00:04:56.810> talk

the metals finally Peter let's talk

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.020 
the metals finally Peter let's talk
about<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.260> platinum<00:04:57.770> gold<00:04:58.010> spread<00:04:58.550> which<00:04:58.820> you

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
about the platinum gold spread which you

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.750 
about the platinum gold spread which you
said<00:04:59.360> was<00:04:59.390> way<00:04:59.990> ahead<00:05:00.170> of<00:05:00.410> itself<00:05:00.860> others<00:05:01.730> I

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
said was way ahead of itself others I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.550 
said was way ahead of itself others I
had<00:05:02.150> taken<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.570> different<00:05:02.750> stance<00:05:03.230> but<00:05:03.410> you

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
had taken a different stance but you

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.890 
had taken a different stance but you
were<00:05:03.680> right<00:05:03.950> on<00:05:04.220> comments<00:05:05.000> yeah<00:05:05.480> I<00:05:05.510> mean<00:05:05.750> I'm

again<00:05:06.470> I'm<00:05:06.620> very<00:05:06.650> concerned<00:05:07.160> I'm<00:05:07.670> in<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.120> camp

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
again I'm very concerned I'm in the camp

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.430 
again I'm very concerned I'm in the camp
that<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.720> do<00:05:08.840> believe<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.800> US<00:05:10.100> economy<00:05:11.440> will

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
that I do believe the US economy will

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.590 
that I do believe the US economy will
somewhere<00:05:13.310> down<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.760> road<00:05:13.790> start<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.450> gather

somewhere down the road start to gather

somewhere down the road start to gather
some<00:05:14.780> legs<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:16.370> based<00:05:16.760> on<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.030> i<00:05:17.480> am<00:05:17.600> very

a two hundred twenty dollar differential

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.630 
a two hundred twenty dollar differential
to<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.450> price<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.870> gold<00:05:33.020> in<00:05:33.290> my<00:05:33.470> opinion<00:05:33.830> was

to the price of gold in my opinion was

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.390 
to the price of gold in my opinion was
was<00:05:35.470> exaggerated<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:36.560> i<00:05:36.680> was<00:05:36.830> looking<00:05:37.160> for<00:05:37.190> a

was exaggerated and i was looking for a
retracement<00:05:37.790> back<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.360> about<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.630> hundred<00:05:38.690> and

retracement back to about a hundred and
forty<00:05:39.470> dollar<00:05:39.680> premium<00:05:40.390> which<00:05:41.390> we<00:05:41.600> got

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
forty dollar premium which we got

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.470 
forty dollar premium which we got
yesterday<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:43.340> we<00:05:43.490> exited<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:43.970> trade

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
yesterday and we exited the trade

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.470 
yesterday and we exited the trade
yesterday<00:05:45.080> at<00:05:45.200> 140<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.100> again<00:05:46.790> based<00:05:47.120> on<00:05:47.330> the

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
yesterday at 140 and again based on the

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.720 
yesterday at 140 and again based on the
premise<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.620> equity<00:05:48.770> markets<00:05:49.370> having<00:05:49.640> a

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
premise of the equity markets having a

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.930 
premise of the equity markets having a
small<00:05:49.970> rebound<00:05:50.420> yesterday<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.770> but<00:05:52.640> again<00:05:52.910> i

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
small rebound yesterday and but again i

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.880 
small rebound yesterday and but again i
put<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.330> caveat<00:05:53.750> in<00:05:53.900> that<00:05:54.080> we<00:05:54.230> might<00:05:54.440> see<00:05:54.710> this

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
put the caveat in that we might see this

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.540 
put the caveat in that we might see this
even<00:05:55.490> narrow<00:05:55.700> more<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.180> 120<00:05:56.860> if<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:58.130> emerging

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
even narrow more to 120 if the emerging

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.480 
even narrow more to 120 if the emerging
market<00:05:58.880> issues<00:05:59.000> continue<00:05:59.930> to<00:06:00.380> be<00:06:00.590> on<00:06:01.220> the

market issues continue to be on the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.420 
market issues continue to be on the
forefront<00:06:01.730> which<00:06:02.210> they<00:06:02.750> again<00:06:03.280> came<00:06:04.280> out

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
forefront which they again came out

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.090 
forefront which they again came out
overnight<00:06:04.760> and<00:06:05.200> this<00:06:06.200> morning<00:06:06.260> we<00:06:06.650> see<00:06:06.830> the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
overnight and this morning we see the

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.340 
overnight and this morning we see the
platinum<00:06:07.580> gold<00:06:07.760> ratio<00:06:08.120> closer<00:06:08.390> to<00:06:08.600> 125
