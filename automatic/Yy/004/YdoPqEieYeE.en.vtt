shells and then we can start now I'm

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:35.900 
shells and then we can start now I'm
cutting<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.590> chains<00:00:33.770> double<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.250> cutting

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
cutting my chains double it up cutting

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.410 
cutting my chains double it up cutting
it<00:00:36.270> again<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.430> two<00:00:38.760> very<00:00:39.090> long

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
pieces now I take my superglue apply to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
pieces now I take my superglue apply to
the<00:00:48.539> lower<00:00:49.200> part<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.250> puck<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.379> apply<00:00:52.379> the

you're<00:01:05.610> gonna<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:06.390> after

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you're gonna see it right now after

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
you're gonna see it right now after
every<00:01:07.530> step<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.070> glue<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.090> let<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
every step with glue you have to let it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.490 
every step with glue you have to let it
dry<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.720> about<00:01:10.080> ten<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> fifty<00:01:11.070> minutes<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
dry for about ten to fifty minutes I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
dry for about ten to fifty minutes I
decided<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:14.010> make<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> chains<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
decided to make one of the chains a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.100 
decided to make one of the chains a
little<00:01:15.509> smaller<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:22.049> my

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
little smaller now and now I take my

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320 
little smaller now and now I take my
little<00:01:22.439> shell<00:01:22.920> I'll<00:01:23.250> play<00:01:23.520> some<00:01:23.549> super<00:01:24.119> glue

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
little shell I'll play some super glue

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
little shell I'll play some super glue
into<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> chain<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.380> lay<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.650> into

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
into it take the chain and lay it into

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.700 
into it take the chain and lay it into
the<00:01:29.520> shell<00:01:30.710> hold<00:01:31.710> everything<00:01:32.460> good<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.270> place

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
the shell hold everything good in place

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.899 
the shell hold everything good in place
take<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.950> tweezers<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.829> press<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.130> chain<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
take my tweezers and press the chain to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.410 
take my tweezers and press the chain to
the<00:01:38.939> shell<00:01:42.530> also<00:01:43.530> let<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> dry<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.579> about<00:01:44.700> 15

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the shell also let this dry for about 15

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
the shell also let this dry for about 15
minutes<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:48.710> then<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.979> something<00:01:50.250> like

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
minutes and then you have something like

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.149 
minutes and then you have something like
this<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:52.520> i<00:01:53.810> apply<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.869> super<00:01:55.409> glue<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:56.100> over

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
this now i apply the super glue all over

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.870 
this now i apply the super glue all over
my<00:01:56.939> plug<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> very<00:01:57.750> good<00:01:58.049> amount<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.530> glue<00:01:58.880> then

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
my plug a very good amount of glue then

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.540 
my plug a very good amount of glue then
I<00:02:00.030> take<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.270> clean<00:02:00.780> shell<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.159> big<00:02:02.430> one

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
I take my clean shell the big one

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.390 
I take my clean shell the big one
and<00:02:03.670> apply<00:02:04.480> it<00:02:04.540> directly<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.860> clock<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
and apply it directly to the clock and

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.120 
and apply it directly to the clock and
hold<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.270> for<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.540> minute<00:02:07.660> or<00:02:07.900> two<00:02:11.070> then<00:02:12.070> I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
hold it for a minute or two then I

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.540 
hold it for a minute or two then I
applied<00:02:12.640> some<00:02:12.670> rhinestones<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.810> yeah<00:02:14.550> this

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
applied some rhinestones and yeah this

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.000 
applied some rhinestones and yeah this
is<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.030> got<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:18.330> hope<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:20.800> is
