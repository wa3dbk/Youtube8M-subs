00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 so all sorts of today so to speak 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.500
 a little problem think every 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.830
 encountered or face early or 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.769
 late by car 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 cable breaks what to do of course 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.630
 go for disassembly buy another if 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.850
 but if there is no disassembly 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.130
 do accordingly among me open 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.859
 car but I would advise you like me 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 removed this program because the casing itself 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.040
 boy social or here is this part cane 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.630
 who goes to the castle 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.719
 or so which goes on the handle open 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.829
 her on the map of the cabin on the map of the door more precisely 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:46.940
 so you can sharpen I took this one 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.800
 cork she's so she is soft and besides 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.199
 elastic soft and 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.449
 as you say against and will be erased 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.610
 get rid of and where you need and with him you can 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 do see something this part goes 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.129
 someone has a hand on this part 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.939
 loop we make leave this lock 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.710
 here so goes at the door is part of 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.970
 participation need to hook it open 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.890
 up because you cling here and then he 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.020
 will open but need to do such 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 be patient so that it is small 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
 rather big ok how do you do and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 big she will pop up here 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.820
 when will it open and if with 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.520
 small on will cling and will not 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.790
 okay job five 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.369
 I think about a centimeter is not 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.460
 more further the second part which goes 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.600
 card door to the very tower someone 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.490
 opened the answer to that pen 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.509
 makes this top five and references to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.110
 but how to cork wrap no more but 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.479
 while this part is done so it is not necessary 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.550
 I pull hard so I do not have 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.850
 constantly open well and this part should 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.860
 in the free position only pull 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.340
 so that she just opened and everything is so 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.230
 like thats just a standard stain was 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.450
 along its length here this bunch goes to 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.200
 door and instead you can put 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.090
 here it is petya layout it is simple and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.010
 small made to show you on 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 his example is square by floor pretty 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.270
 effective thing I drove on the same 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.620
 his car did such things for a long time he 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.480
 did not serve i will say that he is entering something 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.300
 factory cables of course you to this 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.860
 factory well such a thing can also be 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 will help you who liked to put 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.550
 like my comments 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.360
 we see asking everyone for an answer for now 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.360
