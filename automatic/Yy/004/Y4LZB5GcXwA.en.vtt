temperature<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.560> jelly<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.790> feels

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
temperature of the jelly so it feels

in<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.860> frying<00:04:48.070> pan<00:04:48.220> because<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.560> sort

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
in a frying pan because this is a sort

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.370 
in a frying pan because this is a sort
of<00:04:50.890> magic<00:04:51.310> potion<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:52.180> I'm<00:04:52.300> going<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.600> put<00:04:52.750> this

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
of magic potion so I'm going to put this

of magic potion so I'm going to put this
in<00:04:53.590> here

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
in here

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.310 
in here
leave<00:04:56.620> this<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:57.040> set<00:04:57.340> for<00:04:57.670> about<00:04:58.320> thirty

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
leave this to set for about thirty

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.940 
leave this to set for about thirty
minutes<00:04:59.550> right<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:01.360> as<00:05:01.840> in<00:05:02.230> all<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.680> best

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
minutes right but as in all the best

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.300 
minutes right but as in all the best
shows<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:04.060> have<00:05:04.470> one<00:05:05.470> that<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.710> prepared<00:05:06.160> earlier

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
shows I have one that I prepared earlier

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.850 
shows I have one that I prepared earlier
well<00:05:07.150> that's<00:05:07.330> my<00:05:07.540> guess<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.410> is<00:05:08.650> the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
well that's my guess so this is the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.690 
well that's my guess so this is the
bacon<00:05:09.370> gel<00:05:10.270> which<00:05:11.170> I'm<00:05:11.320> going<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.710> cut<00:05:12.100> with

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
bacon gel which I'm going to cut with

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.450 
bacon gel which I'm going to cut with
actual<00:05:13.180> sort<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.600> lozenge<00:05:14.410> so<00:05:15.250> it's<00:05:15.370> not

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
actual sort of lozenge so it's not

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.920 
actual sort of lozenge so it's not
actual<00:05:15.850> bacon<00:05:16.060> shape<00:05:16.630> no<00:05:17.140> but<00:05:17.290> it<00:05:17.650> is<00:05:18.040> bacon

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
actual bacon shape no but it is bacon

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.070 
actual bacon shape no but it is bacon
stock<00:05:20.040> so<00:05:21.040> it'll<00:05:21.640> taste<00:05:21.850> of<00:05:22.180> bacon<00:05:22.450> taste<00:05:22.960> of
