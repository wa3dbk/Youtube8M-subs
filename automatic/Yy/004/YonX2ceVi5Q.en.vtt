moving the freight train maybe we could

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.399 
moving the freight train maybe we could

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that's gonna mean taking my freight

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
that's gonna mean taking my freight
train<00:01:15.060> through<00:01:15.659> an<00:01:15.810> s-curve<00:01:16.289> well<00:01:16.530> what's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
train through an s-curve well what's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
train through an s-curve well what's
wrong<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.130> an<00:01:17.310> s-curve<00:01:17.759> freight<00:01:18.329> trains<00:01:18.659> are

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
wrong with an s-curve freight trains are

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
wrong with an s-curve freight trains are
big<00:01:19.139> huge<00:01:19.829> and<00:01:20.249> heavy<00:01:20.579> and<00:01:20.969> running<00:01:21.389> them

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
big huge and heavy and running them

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.389 
big huge and heavy and running them
through<00:01:21.539> an<00:01:21.869> s-curve<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.189> tricky

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
through an s-curve can be pretty tricky

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.969 
through an s-curve can be pretty tricky
ah<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.479> running<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.869> big<00:01:25.049> heavy<00:01:25.259> freight<00:01:25.619> train

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
ah so running a big heavy freight train

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.879 
ah so running a big heavy freight train
through<00:01:26.280> an<00:01:26.429> s-curve<00:01:27.090> means<00:01:27.619> potential<00:01:28.619> risk

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889 
through an s-curve means potential risk

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.099 
through an s-curve means potential risk
of<00:01:29.159> derailment<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.119> there's<00:01:30.270> no<00:01:30.539> way<00:01:30.810> I'm

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
of derailment and there's no way I'm

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.099 
of derailment and there's no way I'm
signing<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.359> Greg

move the freight trains and we can't
move<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.549> bike<00:01:44.729> trail<00:01:45.119> we'll<00:01:45.599> move<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.139> light

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
move the bike trail we'll move the light

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.679 
move the bike trail we'll move the light
rail<00:01:47.240> underground<00:01:48.240> yeah<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:50.670> being<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.420> deep

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
rail underground yeah but being a deep

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
rail underground yeah but being a deep
tunnel<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.319> they<00:01:52.499> have<00:01:52.679> in<00:01:52.859> Subway's<00:01:53.429> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
tunnel like they have in Subway's is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.330 
tunnel like they have in Subway's is
pretty<00:01:54.029> expensive<00:01:54.659> oh<00:01:55.139> okay<00:01:55.799> well<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.219> I'm

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
pretty expensive oh okay well now I'm

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.399 
pretty expensive oh okay well now I'm
just<00:01:56.549> spitballing<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.090> Graham<00:01:57.779> what<00:01:58.169> if<00:01:58.259> we

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just spitballing here Graham what if we

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.159 
just spitballing here Graham what if we
made<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> opposite<00:01:59.669> of<00:01:59.819> deep<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:00.929> we

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.169 
made it the opposite of deep what if we

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:04.639 
made it the opposite of deep what if we
made<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:02.459> really<00:02:03.109> shallow<00:02:04.109> well

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
made it like really really shallow well

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.949 
made it like really really shallow well
you<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.189> problem<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.029> if<00:02:06.599> we<00:02:06.749> don't

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
you see the problem there is if we don't

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.169 
you see the problem there is if we don't
go<00:02:07.169> deep<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.250> light<00:02:08.429> rail<00:02:08.640> train<00:02:08.970> will

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
go deep then the light rail train will

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.750 
go deep then the light rail train will
have<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.479> resurface<00:02:10.079> and<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.890> over<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> bridge

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
have to resurface and go over a bridge

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580 
have to resurface and go over a bridge
that<00:02:11.790> crosses<00:02:12.329> the<00:02:12.750> channel<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.319> water

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that crosses the channel of water

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.300 
that crosses the channel of water
between

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
between

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.920 
between
the<00:02:14.459> two<00:02:14.640> lakes<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the two lakes and that's going to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.930 
the two lakes and that's going to
disturb<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.560> peaceful<00:02:16.860> scenery<00:02:17.550> when<00:02:17.910> I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
disturb the peaceful scenery when I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.690 
disturb the peaceful scenery when I
kayak<00:02:18.630> yeah<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.650> that's<00:02:19.860> why<00:02:20.099> Minneapolis

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
kayak yeah and that's why Minneapolis

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.400 
kayak yeah and that's why Minneapolis
doesn't<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.360> idea<00:02:21.599> either

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
doesn't like that idea either

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.979 
doesn't like that idea either
hmm<00:02:23.160> could<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.849> make<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> tunnel<00:02:24.480> deeper<00:02:24.810> for

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
hmm could we make the tunnel deeper for

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.320 
hmm could we make the tunnel deeper for
just<00:02:25.170> pot<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.709> away<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.400> way<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.880> Light<00:02:27.090> Rail

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
just pot it away that way the Light Rail

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.960 
just pot it away that way the Light Rail
trains<00:02:27.360> won't<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.319> go<00:02:28.470> over<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> channel

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
trains won't have to go over the channel

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.500 
trains won't have to go over the channel
they<00:02:30.599> can<00:02:30.810> go<00:02:31.099> under<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.280> channel<00:02:32.610> well<00:02:33.269> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
they can go under the channel well is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.559 
they can go under the channel well is
that<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> deep<00:02:34.170> tunnel<00:02:34.709> or<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.160> shallow<00:02:35.880> tunnel

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
that a deep tunnel or a shallow tunnel

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.790 
that a deep tunnel or a shallow tunnel
ah<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.620> big<00:02:37.950> shallow<00:02:38.640> tunnel<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:40.769> know

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
ah it's a big shallow tunnel you know

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.400 
ah it's a big shallow tunnel you know
it'll<00:02:41.250> cost<00:02:41.519> more<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.300> it'll<00:02:42.930> take<00:02:43.110> about<00:02:43.260> a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
it'll cost more and it'll take about a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.470 
it'll cost more and it'll take about a
year<00:02:43.530> longer<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> build<00:02:44.489> but<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.819> think<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.300> is

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
year longer to build but I think this is

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.240 
year longer to build but I think this is
the<00:02:45.630> solution<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.170> could<00:02:46.500> make<00:02:46.709> everybody

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the solution that could make everybody

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.759 
the solution that could make everybody
happy<00:02:47.519> well<00:02:47.970> somehow<00:02:48.330> Bob<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.930> doubt<00:02:49.200> anything

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
happy well somehow Bob I doubt anything

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.840 
happy well somehow Bob I doubt anything
we<00:02:49.950> try<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.340> gonna<00:02:50.640> make<00:02:50.819> everybody<00:02:51.569> happy
