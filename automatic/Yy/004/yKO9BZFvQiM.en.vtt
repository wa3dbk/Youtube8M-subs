a<00:01:10.080> template<00:01:11.080> here<00:01:12.870> out<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.340> unit<00:01:15.340> itself

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
a template here out of the unit itself

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.470 
a template here out of the unit itself
and<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:17.230> saw<00:01:17.530> this<00:01:17.740> masking<00:01:18.280> tape<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:22.180> came

and I saw this masking tape so you came
out<00:01:22.690> pretty<00:01:22.960> good

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
out pretty good

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.900 
out pretty good
the<00:01:24.070> only<00:01:24.220> only<00:01:25.000> problem<00:01:25.390> I<00:01:25.510> had<00:01:25.750> was<00:01:26.680> the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
the only only problem I had was the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.860 
the only only problem I had was the
factory<00:01:27.910> screws

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
factory screws

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.160 
factory screws
you<00:01:29.560> see<00:01:29.710> those<00:01:29.920> coverage<00:01:30.760> here<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.720> factory

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
you see those coverage here the factory

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.320 
you see those coverage here the factory
screw<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.740> table<00:01:33.130> it's<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.760> full<00:01:33.940> millimeter

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
screw the table it's a full millimeter

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.500 
screw the table it's a full millimeter
symmetric<00:01:37.500> machine<00:01:38.500> screws<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.340> had<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.330> get<00:01:40.480> a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
symmetric machine screws I had to get a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.730 
symmetric machine screws I had to get a
longer<00:01:40.990> one

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 

because<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.580> bracket<00:01:45.060> actually<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.720> somewhat

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
because the bracket actually is somewhat

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.250 
because the bracket actually is somewhat
recessed<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.120> bracket<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.720> actually

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
recessed and the bracket is actually

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.740 
recessed and the bracket is actually
inside<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> headliner<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.330> only<00:01:51.570> thing

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
inside the headliner the only thing

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.570 
inside the headliner the only thing
that's<00:01:51.960> exposed<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.430> mounting<00:01:53.850> holes<00:01:55.580> as

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
that's exposed the the mounting holes as

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.290 
that's exposed the the mounting holes as
far<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.630> picture<00:01:57.960> quality<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.880> know<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
far as a the picture quality I know that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.740 
far as a the picture quality I know that
the<00:02:01.290> sitcom<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:02.010> not<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:02.790> good<00:02:03.150> example

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the sitcom is not really a good example

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.900 
the sitcom is not really a good example
of<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.860> show<00:02:05.070> off<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> picture<00:02:05.730> quality

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
could have got a cheaper from there

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.260 
could have got a cheaper from there
Amazon<00:02:27.510> or<00:02:27.750> Sonic<00:02:28.200> Electronix<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:29.100> from<00:02:29.940> what

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
Amazon or Sonic Electronix but from what

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.790
