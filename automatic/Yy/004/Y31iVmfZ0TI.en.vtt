00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
from my starting mean measurement and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
from my starting mean measurement and
then<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.809> waist<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.500> eighty<00:00:55.710> four<00:00:56.100> point

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
then on my waist I was eighty four point

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.599 
then on my waist I was eighty four point
five<00:00:56.960> centimeters<00:00:57.960> giving<00:00:58.230> me<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> mean<00:00:58.770> for

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
five centimeters giving me a mean for

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.119 
five centimeters giving me a mean for
Damon<00:01:00.030> were<00:01:00.180> six<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.660> eighty<00:01:00.960> four<00:01:01.440> point<00:01:01.800> two

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
Damon were six of eighty four point two

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.660 
Damon were six of eighty four point two
five<00:01:02.930> centimeters<00:01:03.930> taking<00:01:04.379> four<00:01:04.799> centimeters

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
five centimeters taking four centimeters

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.630 
five centimeters taking four centimeters
down<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.780> down<00:01:06.990> four<00:01:07.500> kilos<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.250> four

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
down so I'm down four kilos and four

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.590 
down so I'm down four kilos and four
centimeters<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:10.070> six<00:01:11.070> days<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:12.720> six<00:01:13.080> days<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
centimeters in six days in six days and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
centimeters in six days in six days and
so<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.780> about<00:01:15.869> two-thirds<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> kilo<00:01:17.159> every

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
so it's about two-thirds of kilo every

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.780 
so it's about two-thirds of kilo every
day<00:01:17.490> two-thirds<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.420> am<00:01:19.520> centimeter<00:01:20.520> every

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
day two-thirds of am centimeter every

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.890 
day two-thirds of am centimeter every
day<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> pup<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.710> blog<00:01:23.460> post<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.450> day<00:01:24.869> number

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
day now I pup a blog post for day number

six yesterday because I didn't manage to
do<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> video<00:01:28.770> diary<00:01:29.130> SI<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.030> wave<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
do a video diary SI so I was a wave that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
do a video diary SI so I was a wave that
weekend<00:01:30.960> being<00:01:31.439> busy<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> visiting<00:01:32.790> family

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
weekend being busy and visiting family

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.230 
weekend being busy and visiting family
and<00:01:33.479> things<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.640> crunched<00:01:36.000> some

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and things like that so I crunched some

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.410 
and things like that so I crunched some
numbers<00:01:36.299> last<00:01:36.869> night<00:01:37.250> when<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> got<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.820> from

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
numbers last night when I got in from

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
numbers last night when I got in from
one<00:01:39.600> trip<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.159> worked<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.780> my<00:01:43.079> four

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
one trip and worked out that my four

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.770 
one trip and worked out that my four
kilos<00:01:44.430> works<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.810> calorie<00:01:46.590> deficit

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
kilos works out to be a calorie deficit

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.180 
kilos works out to be a calorie deficit
of<00:01:47.869> thirty<00:01:48.290> thousand<00:01:49.220> eight<00:01:50.180> hundred

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
of thirty thousand eight hundred

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.780 
of thirty thousand eight hundred
calories<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:53.440> over<00:01:54.440> those<00:01:54.590> six<00:01:54.860> days<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.369> should

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
calories so over those six days I should

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.149 
calories so over those six days I should
have<00:01:55.909> been<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.960> thirty<00:01:57.229> thousand<00:01:57.979> eight

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
have been in the thirty thousand eight

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.060 
have been in the thirty thousand eight
hundred<00:01:58.190> calorie<00:01:58.970> deficit<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.020> that's<00:02:00.920> quite

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
hundred calorie deficit and that's quite

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.960 
hundred calorie deficit and that's quite
enough<00:02:01.430> but<00:02:02.259> let's<00:02:03.259> minus<00:02:03.860> glycogen<00:02:04.700> my

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
enough but let's minus glycogen my

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.730 
enough but let's minus glycogen my
carbohydrates<00:02:05.750> those<00:02:05.990> alone<00:02:06.320> with<00:02:06.560> some

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
carbohydrates those alone with some

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.120 
carbohydrates those alone with some
water<00:02:06.950> attention<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.149> that's<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.479> kilo<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.530> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
water attention so that's a kilo and the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.940 
water attention so that's a kilo and the
half<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.880> takes<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.450> down<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:12.260> two<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.860> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
half so that takes it down to two and a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.949 
half so that takes it down to two and a
half<00:02:13.239> kilos<00:02:14.239> which<00:02:14.870> still<00:02:15.290> equates<00:02:16.069> to

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
half kilos which still equates to

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.690 
half kilos which still equates to
nineteen<00:02:17.959> thousand<00:02:18.530> two<00:02:18.770> hundred<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.280> fifty

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
nineteen thousand two hundred and fifty

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.040 
nineteen thousand two hundred and fifty
calorie<00:02:20.769> deficit<00:02:21.769> which<00:02:22.760> equals<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.720> should

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
calorie deficit which equals I should
