that these particular woods were chosen

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.280 
that these particular woods were chosen
is<00:01:22.790> because<00:01:23.120> they're<00:01:23.270> Native<00:01:23.600> American<00:01:24.080> woods

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290

the<00:02:40.920> weight<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.100> this<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.610> really<00:02:43.570> kind<00:02:43.780> of

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
the weight of this is really kind of

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.120 
the weight of this is really kind of
coming<00:02:44.110> from<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.320> Redwood<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.800> Redwood<00:02:45.100> is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
coming from the Redwood the Redwood is

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.860 
coming from the Redwood the Redwood is
actually<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.580> really<00:02:45.790> lightweight<00:02:46.120> wood<00:02:46.570> it's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
actually a really lightweight wood it's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.780 
actually a really lightweight wood it's
lighter<00:02:47.200> than<00:02:47.410> you'd<00:02:47.560> find<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.100> maple<00:02:48.280> or<00:02:48.670> an

ash<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.630> really<00:02:50.170> by<00:02:51.130> looking<00:02:51.160> at<00:02:51.460> this<00:02:51.580> you'd

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
ash it's really by looking at this you'd

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.130 
ash it's really by looking at this you'd
think<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.150> big<00:02:52.390> old<00:02:52.540> chunk<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.020> it

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
think it's this big old chunk but it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.210 
think it's this big old chunk but it
really<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> very<00:02:53.920> light<00:02:54.190> weight

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
really is a very light weight

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.000 
really is a very light weight
