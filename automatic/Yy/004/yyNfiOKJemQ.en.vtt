00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790 

my<00:00:00.240> interest<00:00:00.599> in<00:00:00.719> 3d<00:00:01.020> printing<00:00:01.380> how<00:00:01.530> did<00:00:01.680> it

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
my interest in 3d printing how did it

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.370 
my interest in 3d printing how did it
start<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.250> about<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:02.939> year<00:00:02.970> 2000<00:00:03.899> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
start in about the year 2000 the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.840 
start in about the year 2000 the
University<00:00:04.859> where<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.009> was<00:00:05.220> working<00:00:05.370> got<00:00:05.819> a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
University where I was working got a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.330 
University where I was working got a
very<00:00:06.210> big<00:00:06.390> grant<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:07.170> equipment<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.890> i

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
very big grant for equipment and i

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.640 
very big grant for equipment and i
bought<00:00:08.550> some<00:00:08.580> 3d<00:00:09.030> printers<00:00:09.360> with<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.840> so

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
bought some 3d printers with it and so

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.190 
bought some 3d printers with it and so
suddenly<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.700> found<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.389> complete<00:00:12.780> liberation

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
suddenly I found a complete liberation

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.930 
suddenly I found a complete liberation
to<00:00:13.590> me<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:13.830> an<00:00:13.950> engineer<00:00:14.340> because<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.700> could

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
to me as an engineer because I could

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
to me as an engineer because I could
design<00:00:15.540> things<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.900> my<00:00:16.020> computer<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.560> have

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
design things on my computer and have

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.109 
design things on my computer and have
them<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:16.949> my<00:00:17.100> hand<00:00:17.340> hours<00:00:17.550> later<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.029> was

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
them in my hand hours later it was

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.630 
them in my hand hours later it was
wonderful<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.340> my<00:00:20.490> initial

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
wonderful and that that was my initial

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.970 
wonderful and that that was my initial
discovery<00:00:21.090> 3d<00:00:21.539> printing<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.529> links<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.890> my

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
discovery 3d printing the links to my

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.429 
discovery 3d printing the links to my
scientific<00:00:23.400> career<00:00:23.810> date<00:00:24.810> back<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
scientific career date back to when I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.759 
scientific career date back to when I
was<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.650> child<00:00:26.599> I'd<00:00:27.599> been<00:00:27.869> interested<00:00:28.529> ever

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
was a child I'd been interested ever

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.919 
was a child I'd been interested ever
since<00:00:29.010> then<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.609> making<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> machine<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
since then in making a machine that

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.479 
since then in making a machine that
could<00:00:31.050> copy<00:00:31.320> itself<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.040> self-replicating

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
could copy itself a self-replicating

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
could copy itself a self-replicating
machine<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.550> when<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.850> acquired<00:00:36.300> 3d<00:00:36.780> printers

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
machine and when I acquired 3d printers

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.250 
machine and when I acquired 3d printers
for<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> first<00:00:37.649> time<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.190> 15<00:00:38.760> years<00:00:38.940> ago

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
for the first time about 15 years ago

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.900 
for the first time about 15 years ago
suddenly<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.320> realized<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.980> had<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> technology

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
suddenly I realized we had a technology

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.840 
suddenly I realized we had a technology
that<00:00:41.940> was<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.629> powerful<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.320> manufacturing

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
that was so powerful at manufacturing

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.459 
that was so powerful at manufacturing
that<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> stood<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.329> chance<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:46.020> being<00:00:46.200> able<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that it stood a chance of being able to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.340 
that it stood a chance of being able to
copy<00:00:46.710> itself<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.420> I<00:00:48.420> realized<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> could

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
copy itself and I realized that I could

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
copy itself and I realized that I could
set<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> project<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.399> exactly<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
set up a project to do exactly that to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.560 
set up a project to do exactly that to
make<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> 3d<00:00:52.140> printer<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:53.010> printed<00:00:53.399> itself<00:00:53.789> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
make a 3d printer that printed itself so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
make a 3d printer that printed itself so
that<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.930> where<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> link<00:00:55.350> came<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that was where the link came in the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.569 
that was where the link came in the
reason<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.780> made<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.500> reprap<00:00:58.890> 3d<00:00:59.250> printer

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
reason that I made the reprap 3d printer

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.720 
reason that I made the reprap 3d printer
open<00:00:59.850> source<00:01:00.260> was<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
open source was not actually because I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
open source was not actually because I
think<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.420> open<00:01:03.870> source<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
think that open source is a good thing I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
think that open source is a good thing I
do<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.820> open<00:01:06.180> source<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> good

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
do think that open source is a good

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
do think that open source is a good
thing<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.100> irrelevant<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
thing but that was irrelevant to the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.060 
thing but that was irrelevant to the
decision<00:01:09.229> remember<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.560> I'm<00:01:10.680> trying<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
decision remember that I'm trying to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.120 
decision remember that I'm trying to
make<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> machine<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.909> copies<00:01:12.299> itself<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.130> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
make a machine that copies itself and so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.480 
make a machine that copies itself and so
if<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.850> closed<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.080> wouldn't<00:01:16.830> copy<00:01:17.100> itself

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
if I closed it it wouldn't copy itself

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
if I closed it it wouldn't copy itself
so<00:01:17.759> successfully<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.229> opened<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so successfully as if I opened it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
so successfully as if I opened it
because<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.670> people<00:01:20.850> would<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.299> able

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
because then more people would be able

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.170 
because then more people would be able
to<00:01:21.630> copy<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> made<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> open<00:01:23.939> source

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to copy it and so I made it open source

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.530 
to copy it and so I made it open source
for<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> same<00:01:25.290> reason<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.820> example<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
for the same reason that for example a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
for the same reason that for example a
plant<00:01:27.960> doesn't<00:01:28.380> charge<00:01:28.799> insects<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.460> its

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
plant doesn't charge insects for its

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.520 
plant doesn't charge insects for its
pollen<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.119> pays<00:01:30.450> insects<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.200> take<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pollen it pays insects to take the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
pollen it pays insects to take the
pollen<00:01:31.829> away<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.310> didn't<00:01:33.090> pay<00:01:33.240> people<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> take

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
pollen away I didn't pay people to take

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
pollen away I didn't pay people to take
the<00:01:34.110> reprap<00:01:34.500> machine<00:01:34.829> away<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.640> nonetheless

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the reprap machine away but nonetheless

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.390 
the reprap machine away but nonetheless
i<00:01:36.299> made<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> free<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.409> anybody<00:01:37.680> could

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
i made it free so that anybody could

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.920 
i made it free so that anybody could
make<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.180> i<00:01:39.210> thought<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.900> be

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
make one because i thought that would be

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.170 
make one because i thought that would be
the<00:01:40.049> most<00:01:40.320> successful<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.790> people

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the most successful way to have people

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.450 
the most successful way to have people
copy<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.600> make<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.840> copy<00:01:43.170> itself<00:01:43.500> yes

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
copy it and make it copy itself yes

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.840 
copy it and make it copy itself yes
we've<00:01:44.670> had<00:01:44.820> lots<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> feedback<00:01:45.329> from<00:01:45.630> users

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
we've had lots of feedback from users

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
of people have made machines that we

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.729 
of people have made machines that we
never<00:02:45.610> heard<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:46.900> think<00:02:47.200> there<00:02:47.349> must<00:02:47.500> be

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
never heard of we think there must be

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.039 
never heard of we think there must be
between<00:02:47.950> fifty<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:49.120> hundred<00:02:49.150> thousand<00:02:49.930> of

these machines in the world and so in

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.960 
these machines in the world and so in
terms<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.500> pay<00:02:53.709> off<00:02:53.890> that's<00:02:54.220> really<00:02:54.549> going

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
terms of pay off that's really going

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.059 
terms of pay off that's really going
quite<00:02:55.209> well<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.989> next<00:02:56.200> things<00:02:56.560> we're<00:02:56.860> going

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
quite well the next things we're going

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.280 
quite well the next things we're going
to<00:02:57.160> be<00:02:57.280> doing<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.180> make<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.660> multi-material

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
to be doing is to make a multi-material

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.470 
to be doing is to make a multi-material
version<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.280> Ormerod<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.239> print

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
version of the Ormerod so it can print

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.319 
version of the Ormerod so it can print
well<00:03:02.079> it<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.349> print<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.739> several<00:03:03.069> colors

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
well it can print in several colors

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.300 
well it can print in several colors
that's<00:03:04.329> quite<00:03:04.599> interesting<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.890> even<00:03:06.040> more

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
that's quite interesting but even more

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.160 
that's quite interesting but even more
interesting<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:07.060> being<00:03:07.329> able<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.690> print<00:03:07.930> in

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
interesting is being able to print in

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.140 
interesting is being able to print in
materials<00:03:08.739> with<00:03:09.099> different<00:03:09.150> physical

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
materials with different physical

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.569 
materials with different physical
properties<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.380> can<00:03:11.709> print<00:03:11.950> an<00:03:12.160> object

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
properties so you can print an object

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.210 
properties so you can print an object
which<00:03:12.730> consists<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.900> rigid<00:03:14.260> material<00:03:15.010> and

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
which consists of a rigid material and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.400 
which consists of a rigid material and
elsewhere<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.209> has<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> flexible<00:03:17.019> rubber-like

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
elsewhere it has a flexible rubber-like

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.199 
elsewhere it has a flexible rubber-like
material<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.250> can<00:03:18.519> make<00:03:18.670> things<00:03:18.970> with

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
material so you can make things with

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.449 
material so you can make things with
hinges<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.260> forth<00:03:20.350> we're<00:03:21.340> also

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
hinges and so on and so forth we're also

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.949 
hinges and so on and so forth we're also
looking<00:03:21.760> at<00:03:22.030> printing<00:03:22.450> electrical

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
looking at printing electrical

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.470 
looking at printing electrical
conductors<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.310> then<00:03:24.819> we'll<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.209> able<00:03:25.329> to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
conductors so then we'll be able to

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.240 
conductors so then we'll be able to
print<00:03:25.840> three-dimensional<00:03:26.739> electrical

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
print three-dimensional electrical

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.460 
print three-dimensional electrical
circuitry<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.540> will<00:03:28.720> be<00:03:28.870> extremely

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
circuitry and that will be extremely

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.379 
circuitry and that will be extremely
useful<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:30.130> people<00:03:30.250> i<00:03:30.519> think<00:03:30.549> because<00:03:30.970> they

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
useful for people i think because they

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.170 
useful for people i think because they
can<00:03:31.600> design<00:03:31.989> their<00:03:32.200> electronics<00:03:32.799> in<00:03:33.040> with<00:03:33.579> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
can design their electronics in with the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.270 
can design their electronics in with the
mechanical<00:03:34.510> parts<00:03:35.170> their<00:03:35.380> design<00:03:35.709> as<00:03:35.980> opposed

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
mechanical parts their design as opposed

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.220 
mechanical parts their design as opposed
to<00:03:36.430> needing<00:03:36.760> separate<00:03:37.420> printed<00:03:37.750> circuits<00:03:38.109> for

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
to needing separate printed circuits for

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.050 
to needing separate printed circuits for
it<00:03:38.350> those<00:03:39.100> are<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.310> couple<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.730> things<00:03:39.760> that

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
it those are a couple of the things that

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.150 
it those are a couple of the things that
we're<00:03:40.299> working<00:03:40.420> on<00:03:40.690> right<00:03:40.720> now<00:03:40.870> well<00:03:41.829> the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
we're working on right now well the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.910 
we're working on right now well the
latest<00:03:42.310> innovations<00:03:43.090> in<00:03:43.239> 3d<00:03:43.630> printing<00:03:44.200> are

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
latest innovations in 3d printing are

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.740 
latest innovations in 3d printing are
actually<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.930> collapse<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.530> something<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.750> lot

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
actually the collapse of something a lot

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.720 
actually the collapse of something a lot
of<00:03:49.930> these<00:03:50.079> technologies<00:03:50.829> were<00:03:51.130> patented

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
of these technologies were patented

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.259 
of these technologies were patented
about<00:03:52.120> 20<00:03:52.720> years<00:03:52.900> ago<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.220> almost<00:03:54.579> all<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
about 20 years ago and so almost all the

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.270 
about 20 years ago and so almost all the
patents<00:03:55.720> are<00:03:55.930> running<00:03:56.260> out<00:03:56.410> at<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.739> same<00:03:56.950> time

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
patents are running out at the same time

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.099 
patents are running out at the same time
and<00:03:57.670> that's<00:03:58.359> having<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.870> very<00:03:59.079> interesting

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
and that's having a very interesting

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.740 
and that's having a very interesting
effect<00:03:59.859> on<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.130> industry<00:04:00.579> because<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.359> means

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
effect on the industry because it means

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.640 
effect on the industry because it means
that<00:04:01.930> anyone<00:04:02.290> can<00:04:02.680> now<00:04:02.859> enter<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.280> industry

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
that anyone can now enter the industry

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.100 
that anyone can now enter the industry
infringing<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.250> patents<00:04:05.730> because<00:04:06.110> virtually

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
infringing the patents because virtually

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.319 
infringing the patents because virtually
every<00:04:07.590> way<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.860> doing<00:04:08.189> this<00:04:08.220> trick<00:04:08.730> was

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
every way of doing this trick was

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.259 
every way of doing this trick was
patented<00:04:09.870> at<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.379> time<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.069> now<00:04:11.670> lots<00:04:12.120> of

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
patented at that time and now lots of

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.030 
patented at that time and now lots of
people<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.689> set<00:04:12.900> up<00:04:13.019> companies<00:04:13.439> based<00:04:13.650> on<00:04:13.890> it

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
people can set up companies based on it

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.129 
people can set up companies based on it
so<00:04:14.220> it's<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.489> very<00:04:14.519> exciting<00:04:14.760> time<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:15.840> it's

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
so it's a very exciting time so it's

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.749 
so it's a very exciting time so it's
actually<00:04:16.259> the<00:04:16.500> removal<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.100> something<00:04:17.579> that

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
actually the removal of something that

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.610 
actually the removal of something that
is<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.389> most<00:04:18.539> interesting<00:04:18.959> thing<00:04:19.440> that's

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
is the most interesting thing that's

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.520 
is the most interesting thing that's
come<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.940> future<00:04:21.120> trends<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.780> 3d<00:04:22.109> printing

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
come in the future trends in 3d printing

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.590 
come in the future trends in 3d printing
I<00:04:22.650> think<00:04:23.039> are<00:04:23.280> machines<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:23.970> will<00:04:24.180> work<00:04:24.360> with

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
I think are machines that will work with

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.950 
I think are machines that will work with
lots<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:25.080> different<00:04:25.470> materials<00:04:26.690> at<00:04:27.690> the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
lots of different materials at the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.900 
lots of different materials at the
moment<00:04:28.380> we're<00:04:28.650> constrained<00:04:29.100> largely<00:04:29.610> to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
moment we're constrained largely to

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.550 
moment we're constrained largely to
press<00:04:30.150> plastics<00:04:30.810> though<00:04:31.050> there<00:04:31.229> are<00:04:31.380> machines

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
press plastics though there are machines

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.490 
press plastics though there are machines
that<00:04:31.889> will<00:04:32.130> work<00:04:32.310> with<00:04:32.550> ceramics<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:34.110> with

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
that will work with ceramics and with

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.379 
that will work with ceramics and with
rubbers<00:04:34.889> and<00:04:35.160> other<00:04:35.400> materials<00:04:35.940> like<00:04:36.150> that

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
rubbers and other materials like that

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.409 
rubbers and other materials like that
but<00:04:37.050> once<00:04:37.260> we've<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:37.770> machines<00:04:38.400> which<00:04:39.210> will

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
but once we've got machines which will

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.360 
but once we've got machines which will
work<00:04:39.570> with<00:04:39.750> five<00:04:40.020> or<00:04:40.199> six<00:04:40.470> radically

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
work with five or six radically

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.980 
work with five or six radically
different<00:04:41.729> materials<00:04:42.180> radically<00:04:42.660> different

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
different materials radically different

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.750 
different materials radically different
from<00:04:43.139> their<00:04:43.289> physical<00:04:43.410> properties<00:04:44.100> the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
from their physical properties the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.250 
from their physical properties the
number<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.120> things<00:04:45.300> will<00:04:45.510> be<00:04:45.630> able<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.990> print

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
number of things will be able to print

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.439 
number of things will be able to print
will<00:04:46.500> grow<00:04:46.710> enormously<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.669> we'll<00:04:48.240> be<00:04:48.360> able

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
will grow enormously and we'll be able

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.990 
will grow enormously and we'll be able
to<00:04:48.690> print<00:04:48.930> whole<00:04:49.229> machines<00:04:49.650> as<00:04:50.130> opposed<00:04:50.820> to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
to print whole machines as opposed to

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.570 
to print whole machines as opposed to
printing<00:04:51.419> parts<00:04:51.900> for<00:04:52.110> machines<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.340> think

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
printing parts for machines and I think

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.460 
printing parts for machines and I think
that<00:04:53.729> that<00:04:53.760> will<00:04:54.060> be<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.389> next<00:04:54.690> big<00:04:54.960> thing<00:04:54.990> I

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
that that will be the next big thing I

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.740 
that that will be the next big thing I
think<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.370> 3d<00:04:56.699> market<00:04:57.120> will<00:04:57.270> develop

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
think the 3d market will develop

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.839 
think the 3d market will develop
extremely<00:04:58.590> rapidly<00:04:58.949> it<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.250> developing

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
extremely rapidly it is developing

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.390 
extremely rapidly it is developing
extremely<00:05:00.630> rapidly<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.620> growth<00:05:01.830> in<00:05:02.039> 3d

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
extremely rapidly the growth in 3d

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.810 
extremely rapidly the growth in 3d
printers<00:05:02.820> has<00:05:03.060> been<00:05:03.270> exponential<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:05.039> we've

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
printers has been exponential and we've

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.939 
printers has been exponential and we've
now<00:05:06.030> seen<00:05:06.389> machines<00:05:07.139> including<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.919> course

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
now seen machines including of course

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.980 
now seen machines including of course
the<00:05:08.130> reprap<00:05:08.550> machine<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:09.389> are<00:05:09.539> affordable

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
the reprap machine that are affordable

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.400 
the reprap machine that are affordable
by<00:05:10.260> private<00:05:10.650> individuals<00:05:11.030> now<00:05:12.410> companies

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
by private individuals now companies

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.100 
by private individuals now companies
like<00:05:13.560> Samsung<00:05:13.970> didn't<00:05:14.970> get<00:05:15.120> rich<00:05:15.360> by<00:05:16.080> selling

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
like Samsung didn't get rich by selling

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.430 
like Samsung didn't get rich by selling
mobile<00:05:16.919> phones<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.820> companies<00:05:18.300> they<00:05:19.020> got<00:05:19.229> rich

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
mobile phones to companies they got rich

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.980 
mobile phones to companies they got rich
by<00:05:19.470> selling<00:05:19.680> mobile<00:05:20.130> phones<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.760> people<00:05:21.120> there

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
by selling mobile phones to people there

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.409 
by selling mobile phones to people there
are<00:05:22.139> more<00:05:22.229> people<00:05:22.620> than<00:05:22.770> companies<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.520> so

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
are more people than companies and so

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.899 
are more people than companies and so
