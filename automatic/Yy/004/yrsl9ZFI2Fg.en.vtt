00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
basically what it does is that it allows

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.330 
basically what it does is that it allows

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
wines to be I have extended shelf-life

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.569 
wines to be I have extended shelf-life
from<00:00:38.340> normal<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.149> OD<00:00:39.420> 8<00:00:39.660> hours<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.469> 2<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> 3

from normal to OD 8 hours to 2 to 3

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.000 
from normal to OD 8 hours to 2 to 3
weeks<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> does<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.620> allows
