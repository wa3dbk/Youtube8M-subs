00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
Samsung even more but that's that the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.040 
Samsung even more but that's that the
more<00:02:54.500> important<00:02:54.980> question<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:56.390> how<00:02:56.720> does

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
more important question is that how does

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.920 
more important question is that how does
it<00:02:57.200> affect<00:02:57.620> now<00:02:57.920> future<00:02:58.610> devices<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.810> what

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it affect now future devices and what

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.110 
it affect now future devices and what
about<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.260> other<00:03:00.440> vendors<00:03:00.770> if<00:03:01.250> Apple's<00:03:01.970> been

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
about the other vendors if Apple's been

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.210 
about the other vendors if Apple's been
so<00:03:02.270> successful<00:03:02.450> taking<00:03:03.200> Samson<00:03:03.710> to<00:03:03.860> account

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
so successful taking Samson to account

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.280 
so successful taking Samson to account
will<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.210> mean<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.480> Apple<00:03:05.810> will<00:03:06.080> start

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
will that mean that Apple will start

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.230 
will that mean that Apple will start
focusing<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.980> other<00:03:07.310> vendors<00:03:08.060> as<00:03:08.210> well
