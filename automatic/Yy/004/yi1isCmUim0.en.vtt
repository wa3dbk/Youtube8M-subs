00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.540
 and then folks you should know that 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 after the end of a war the bonus of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.380
 war will be available on your 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 clan castle and you can collect it 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.590
 any moment but it will be worth 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.630
 sorry to leave in there 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.609
 sells expensive I'm going to respond to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 answer is positive is worth leaving 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.750
 in there and I'll give you three reasons that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 supports my argument first 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 by simply observing how much I 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.279
 held resort after debuted at 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.950
 clan castle is I realized that it varied 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.820
 more than 9 to 10 percent of what was there 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.000
 within and compared to their 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.480
 gold and driving warehouses that can be 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.480
 stolen 20% bahia is worth leave there 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 inside because it steals independent moment 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.809
 of the amount well another very good reason is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.550
 the goblins patients they do not focus 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.449
 in your clan couple when it comes to stealing 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.530
 resource 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.899
 so if you have 700 thousand gold 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 inside the clan reached and the guy put 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.659
 a lot of patients 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 No one is going to stay there, will try 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 to attack it goes directly I do not know there can be one 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.670
 another feature that is less empty 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900
 so this is cool especially if you 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.330
 is attacked by someone who is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.600
 looking for a resource partner and now 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.720
 third and last reason is that 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.400
 usually your your clubhouse 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.479
 will be more centralized in your village 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 and if you do not do it if you really 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.790
 should be because the defense troops of the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.009
 Married to her, they are very good even in 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.560
 What time are you being attacked this too? 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 helps you to better distribute your 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.750
 resources for his life so well 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.119
 with you when you are a burden you 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.490
 leaves its its warehouses the most 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.530
 prepared when you pick up the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.540
 your castle with the centering your village 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.670
 you are practically leaving the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.369
 curricula that was in the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.399
 impenetrable possible more difficult to 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.790
 stealing and that's why I recommend you 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.229
 only extract the resource to collect the resource 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.930
 from your clan 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.800
 when you 're urgent like you 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.750
 You're trying to get 7 million and 500 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.390
 upgrade your career to the 6 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.280
 and you do not want to leave the team and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.080
 leave the resource exposed to someone 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.140
 to attack then you pick up fast from 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.150
 update and go to sleep happy or when 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.060
 you are very close to another 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.920
 war is not to overload your 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.740
 castle is you lose your good in 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.620
 future and then this 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.920
 choose this question is that I go 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.050
 leave a tip is if now that's when 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.810
 Your warehouse is very close to it. 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.750
 full and you collect the resources 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.940
 You will not miss what went beyond 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.700
 your ability and will simply stay 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.750
 inside the castle of the clan and why 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.370
 the clan couple 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.590
 after the war update he 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.290
 much better because in addition to 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.150
 serve as a defense attack he is also 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.820
 a warehouse literally for you can 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.860
 use it to wait for resource and arrives 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.530
 until enough appeal when you start 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.239
 to reach a higher level of clan couple 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.280
 So this was the video today. 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.140
 I think it was very useful for the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.600
 Less is helped me and I think I went 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.160
 enough is your work time 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.930
 have to figure out how much to steal 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.299
 you of your case the field is not 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.549
 cool but then the people now do 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.140
