00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.040
 Hello 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.889
 in this video will be showing that a 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:22.450
 tip of how to curve styrofoam parties 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:26.200
 Yeah, this can go into any kit or 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:31.900
 any crafts you are going to do 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.250
 says to make a curved piece can not 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.290
 I'm using this tip that I'm going 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:43.600
 give me now with an example of a kit 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.970
 the one who does his part of the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.829
 belly here and curve 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:54.460
 There, this bass part here has to 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.149
 accompany this curvature 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'll show you how to do this. 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:06.719
 this kit whats interesting you 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.060
 mark here where you will start necklace 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:12.749
 but this to the death with the manual owner 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.749
 the kit 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.200
 I 'm just going to score, I'll know the part of 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.319
 low 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.009
 only here is the sergio kit manual that 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:28.329
 you receive by email when against 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:33.369
 my kit our page from below she goes 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:35.499
 beginning to be glued right here was not 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.599
 end is here 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:44.679
 so if you are prolonged so will have 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:49.119
 that the underside that has this part 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:54.609
 curved shape I 'm going to have to do then 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:59.529
 The first thing that is I'm going to mark where 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:02.459
 start the curve here go up 0 marquinhos 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:02.459
 of pen 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 so from now on I 'll curve you 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 opened in this soup 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.760
 this card lah 15mm 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.830
 and one centimeter thick middle giving 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.700
 to be done already for you to do 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.300
 the dodo depends on the density of distress 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.050
 straight in with that thickness 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.100
 only the Styrofoam that was very hard can 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.400
 run the risk of breaking then 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.040
 I recommend you decrease by half that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.100
 people and went to the sun 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.000
 using a stylet preferably 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.000
 new blade 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.000
 I'm going to start cutting here. 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.580
 does not have to be exactly half to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.190
 leave a little thicker than 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.580
 I 'm not going to lean here at a table 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.640
 taking care not to hurt in the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.640
 I'll start here 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.120
 a position that all its powers 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.530
 I am very careful not to break 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.900
 this option then you want to make the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.530
 few take off a little bit then take off 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.910
 one more layer is still good 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.190
 ran explode 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.800
 suddenly cut beyond what has to 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.630
 cut and lose, it's just that I'm 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.970
 cutting straight because I already have one 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.030
 more or less how to stick with the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.500
 let me tell you straight you can 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.500
 be cutting by stages 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.920
 so I found the mark 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.280
 continuous mug nequinha'll pass 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.770
 Another two centimeters I 'm going up. 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.750
 with the mud to finish only this cut 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.680
 not here I take care with the hand here 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.489
 which was already advancing year with the blade 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:29.580
 leave with the lamy that I 'll stay fee 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:32.850
 father was less thicker than the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.070
 remaining plate of the photo will 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.750
 It's no problem, because that 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.230
 Part is going to stay inside the plane. 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:51.390
 so now the tip for you to bow 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:54.830
 break you go with your thumb squeezing 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.590
 the medium kneading styrofoam and will 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.040
 lifting it notes that the back 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.390
 They get up and here in front I go 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:10.140
 love sandro how to foster can do 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.080
 this without fear of course will double 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:21.460
 not once 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:24.180
 brown is the part that 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.180
 you affirm 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.210
 Ilsinho is the end that more then works 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:35.740
 you may notice that he's already been a 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.449
 little curved and I have one more piece 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.590
 flexible 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:44.800
 ok I was trying to do it here in 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.099
 half would break with her then 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.190
 half of the people and you see them 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:55.650
 tight kneading styrofoam 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.650
 You get a nice bend in peace. 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:04.090
 I just want more crooked attacked more 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:09.310
 there is proportional to the curve you want 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:12.729
 to do of course will get higher 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.800
 it is less resistant but is a 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:19.180
 part of the plane and then you go 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.960
 be on the screen and it will end 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.960
 becoming more resistant 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.699
 if you notice hours 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.719
 I can not support my position 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.879
 command where I'm going to start necklace 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:37.569
 this part of the viola belly has a 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:42.099
 It's the slightest curvature you can do here without 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:45.250
 need to do this and 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:50.830
 then here in front 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:58.420
 I can already follow the piece here 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:07:02.410
 the curvature of the side party rock 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:06.100
 just do the gluing by following the tips 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:11.400
 then in my case the manual of the kit of 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:17.880
 How to make the glue fix this party? 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:24.250
 on tip that we are starting as a curve ' 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:31.720
 let it bend here without breaking the 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:36.550
 Styrofoam said they liked this tip 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:40.900
 worth for any kind of kit maybe 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:44.590
 that is a similar assembly and some 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:48.310
 craft work with Styrofoam that 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:54.490
 Do you want to make a party a format? 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:57.090
 round round yes that's it 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.090
 the next
