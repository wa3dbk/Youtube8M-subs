00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
two days later and i have the back in a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.370 
two days later and i have the back in a
banana<00:01:49.140> clip<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.399> by<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> third<00:01:51.090> day<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.899> was

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
banana clip and by the third day I was

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.310

just<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.740> um<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.540> took<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.899> twist<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
just like um so I took the twist out of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.280 
just like um so I took the twist out of
my<00:01:55.619> hair<00:01:55.799> was

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
my hair was

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.310 
my hair was
right<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:56.950> like<00:01:57.100> how<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.430> looks<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:59.200> know

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
right and like how it looks so you know

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.750 
right and like how it looks so you know
that's<00:01:59.620> how<00:01:59.710> look<00:01:59.950> look<00:01:59.980> nice<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.550> front

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
that's how look look nice in the front

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.820 
that's how look look nice in the front
not<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.000> back<00:02:01.120> so<00:02:01.540> I<00:02:01.600> was<00:02:01.660> not<00:02:02.200> happy<00:02:02.440> at<00:02:02.710> all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
not the back so I was not happy at all

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.010 
not the back so I was not happy at all
second<00:02:03.730> styles<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.180> think<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.840> need<00:02:04.960> to

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
second styles I think that you need to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.450 
second styles I think that you need to
take<00:02:05.200> time<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.590> figure<00:02:05.740> out<00:02:05.860> what<00:02:06.010> works<00:02:06.160> for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
take time to figure out what works for

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.580 
take time to figure out what works for
you<00:02:06.610> now<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.120> brains<00:02:07.450> for<00:02:07.570> me<00:02:07.810> for<00:02:08.350> going<00:02:08.470> to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
you now the brains for me for going to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.889 
you now the brains for me for going to
work<00:02:08.820> well<00:02:09.820> I'll<00:02:09.970> probably<00:02:10.119> start<00:02:10.509> once<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
work well I'll probably start once and

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.140 
work well I'll probably start once and
twistys<00:02:11.170> in<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.320> front<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.830> may<00:02:12.130> even<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:12.880> flat

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
twistys in the front I may even do flat

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.360 
twistys in the front I may even do flat
twist<00:02:13.570> but<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.320> tell<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.650> when<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.040> put<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> two
