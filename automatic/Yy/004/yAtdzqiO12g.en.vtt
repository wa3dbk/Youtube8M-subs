more moisture to this you can add in a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.030 
more moisture to this you can add in a
little<00:02:25.450> bit<00:02:25.780> more<00:02:25.930> water<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.440> you'd<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.770> or

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
maybe some other type of condiment it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.260 
maybe some other type of condiment it
came<00:02:29.140> out<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.350> be<00:02:29.620> somewhere<00:02:30.130> between<00:02:30.310> savory

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
came out to be somewhere between savory

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.050 
came out to be somewhere between savory
and<00:02:31.510> sweet<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.740> sun-dried<00:02:33.310> tomatoes<00:02:33.700> added<00:02:34.000> a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and sweet the sun-dried tomatoes added a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.550 
and sweet the sun-dried tomatoes added a
little<00:02:34.270> bit<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.540> sweetness<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.290> if<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.410> don't

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
little bit of sweetness so if you don't

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.400 
little bit of sweetness so if you don't
use<00:02:35.770> those<00:02:36.010> who<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.460> more<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.880> savory

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
use those who can have more of a savory

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.980 
use those who can have more of a savory
garlicky<00:02:38.410> flavor<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.270> but<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.300> really<00:02:40.810> like

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990
