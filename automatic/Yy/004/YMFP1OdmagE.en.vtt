00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.210 
it and what's going to be different is
you're<00:02:02.780> gonna<00:02:02.899> put<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.289> like<00:02:03.470> this<00:02:03.950> put<00:02:04.189> it

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
you're gonna put it like this put it

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.070 
you're gonna put it like this put it
like<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:06.200> way<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.269> like<00:02:08.269> this<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.989> you

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
like this this way and like this and you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.600 
like this this way and like this and you
probably<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.680> hold<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:12.950> down<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.400> this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
probably have to hold it down like this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.840 
probably have to hold it down like this
for<00:02:13.880> about<00:02:14.060> ten<00:02:14.480> seconds<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:16.489> so<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.819> stays

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
for about ten seconds just so it stays

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.870 
for about ten seconds just so it stays
strong<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.019> could<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.500> next<00:02:18.709> step<00:02:19.100> so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
strong and you could do the next step so

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880 
strong and you could do the next step so
this<00:02:20.060> glue<00:02:20.299> tends<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:20.810> dry<00:02:21.019> very<00:02:21.049> fast<00:02:21.350> and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
this glue tends to dry very fast and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.630 
this glue tends to dry very fast and
make<00:02:22.010> sure<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.280> press<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.790> against<00:02:23.420> here

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
make sure you press it against here

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.949 
make sure you press it against here
making<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.790> as<00:02:26.000> even<00:02:26.540> as<00:02:26.690> possible<00:02:28.630> apply<00:02:29.630> some

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
making it as even as possible apply some

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.920 
making it as even as possible apply some
pressure<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.540> actually

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
pressure to it and then so you actually

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.229 
pressure to it and then so you actually
have<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.680> little<00:02:34.310> window<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:34.940> kind<00:02:35.180> of

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
have like a little window it's kind of

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.870 
have like a little window it's kind of
cool<00:02:35.530> right<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.160> then<00:02:37.340> what<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.580> could<00:02:37.730> do

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
cool right so then what you could do

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.780 
cool right so then what you could do
next<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.959> next<00:02:39.260> step<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.220> go<00:02:40.430> online

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
next is the next step is to go online

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.420 
next is the next step is to go online
and<00:02:41.510> look<00:02:41.870> for<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.170> picture<00:02:42.319> of<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.739> window<00:02:43.190> a

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
right so you're gonna measure to see

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.230 
right so you're gonna measure to see
where<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.100> want<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:14.790> what<00:04:15.030> you're<00:04:15.150> gonna

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
do is you're gonna flip it over like

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.759 
do is you're gonna flip it over like
this<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.670> what's<00:04:18.209> important<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:18.900> when

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
this and what's important is that when

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.850 
this and what's important is that when
you<00:04:20.010> you're<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.580> tape<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:21.060> because<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:22.590> you

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
you you're on a tape it because if you

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.010 
you you're on a tape it because if you
tape<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.370> like<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.760> let's<00:04:24.150> say<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.720> it's

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
tape it like this let's say and it's

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.410 
tape it like this let's say and it's
right<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.470> line<00:04:25.770> here<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.460> see<00:04:26.850> with<00:04:27.240> the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
right in line here you see with the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.240 
right in line here you see with the
popsicle<00:04:27.840> stick<00:04:28.020> your<00:04:28.230> tape<00:04:28.530> will<00:04:28.770> overlap

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
popsicle stick your tape will overlap

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.770 
popsicle stick your tape will overlap
and<00:04:29.550> go<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.880> side<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.330> when<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.510> flip<00:04:30.690> it

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
and go to the side so when you flip it

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.650 
and go to the side so when you flip it
over<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.590> will<00:04:31.740> see<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.820> tape<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.240> here<00:04:33.420> so

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
over you will see the tape on here so

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.500 
over you will see the tape on here so
what<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.990> want<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.230> do<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:34.920> kind<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.580> measure

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
what you want to do is kind of measure

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.080 
what you want to do is kind of measure
it<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.960> half<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:37.980> that<00:04:38.490> when<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.730> put<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
it in half here so that when you put the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.880 
it in half here so that when you put the
tape<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:39.960> not<00:04:40.230> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.590> be<00:04:40.830> on<00:04:42.740> hanging<00:04:43.740> off

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
tape it's not going to be on hanging off

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.850 
tape it's not going to be on hanging off
the<00:04:44.100> edge<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.550> then<00:04:44.790> we're<00:04:44.910> gonna<00:04:45.060> do<00:04:45.360> I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
the edge and then we're gonna do I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.240 
the edge and then we're gonna do I
review<00:04:46.860> pre-done<00:04:47.340> it's<00:04:47.670> flip<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.390> over<00:04:49.250> like

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
review pre-done it's flip it over like

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.700 
review pre-done it's flip it over like
so<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.880> you're<00:04:51.570> gonna<00:04:51.660> measure<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.080> line<00:04:52.410> in

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
so and you're gonna measure a line in

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.780 
so and you're gonna measure a line in
the<00:04:52.919> middle<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.960> do<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.140> want<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:56.010> cut<00:04:56.490> the
