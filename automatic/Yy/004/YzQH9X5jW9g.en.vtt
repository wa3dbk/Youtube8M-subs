00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
and 104 degrees and it germinates the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.280 
and 104 degrees and it germinates the
rice<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:53.239> this<00:02:54.239> has<00:02:54.510> been<00:02:54.690> sitting<00:02:54.930> because<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
rice and this has been sitting because I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.569

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
went to a movie this has been sitting

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.430 
went to a movie this has been sitting
for<00:03:01.290> 20<00:03:01.650> hours<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:03.570> on<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> next<00:03:04.109> you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
for 20 hours and so it's on a next you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.550 
for 20 hours and so it's on a next you
know<00:03:04.620> extended<00:03:05.310> warming<00:03:05.700> cycle<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.320> is

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
know extended warming cycle and this is

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.780 
know extended warming cycle and this is
the<00:03:07.890> rice<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.390> looks<00:03:09.900> great<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.579> what<00:03:11.700> I'm

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the rice and it looks great so what I'm

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.030 
the rice and it looks great so what I'm
going<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.140> it's<00:03:13.350> still<00:03:13.620> warm

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
going to do is and it's still warm

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.120 
going to do is and it's still warm
perfect<00:03:14.840> texture<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.170> that's<00:03:16.560> sitting<00:03:16.980> for

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
perfect texture and that's sitting for

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.670 
perfect texture and that's sitting for
20<00:03:17.519> hours<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:19.049> knew<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.230> would<00:03:19.470> make

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
20 hours and I knew I would make

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.380 
20 hours and I knew I would make
something<00:03:19.980> with<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.970> think<00:03:21.030> I'm<00:03:21.269> gonna

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
something with it and I think I'm gonna

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.860 
something with it and I think I'm gonna
add<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:22.170> cup<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.459> my<00:03:23.609> mixture<00:03:24.000> after

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
add a cup of this to my mixture after

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.199 
add a cup of this to my mixture after
it's<00:03:25.019> heated<00:03:25.200> through<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.920> then<00:03:26.790> I'm<00:03:27.060> gonna

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
it's heated through and then I'm gonna

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.630 
it's heated through and then I'm gonna
save<00:03:27.600> what's<00:03:28.530> left<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.010> I'll<00:03:29.100> put<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.489> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
refrigerator and I'll probably make a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.949 
refrigerator and I'll probably make a
soup<00:03:31.890> with<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.280> um<00:03:32.870> tomorrow<00:03:33.870> or<00:03:34.380> something<00:03:34.829> so

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
actually add quite a bit of rice because

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.699 
actually add quite a bit of rice because
this<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.209> kind<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> soupy<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.170> want<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> to

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.970 
this is kind of soupy and I want it to
be<00:04:04.920> thick<00:04:05.610> raisin<00:04:06.150> beans<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:06.990> think<00:04:07.800> I'm

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
be thick raisin beans so I think I'm

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.670 
be thick raisin beans so I think I'm
gonna<00:04:08.070> do<00:04:08.390> which<00:04:09.390> this<00:04:09.690> scoop<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.260> probably

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
gonna do which this scoop is probably

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.410 
gonna do which this scoop is probably
about<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.070> cup<00:04:11.930> okay<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.320> I'm<00:04:13.530> gonna<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.950> two

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
cups and see what I think of a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:35.000 
cups and see what I think of a
consistency<00:04:31.520> yeah<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:33.000> think<00:04:33.600> I'm<00:04:34.169> gonna<00:04:34.290> put<00:04:34.740> a

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
consistency yeah I think I'm gonna put a

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.860 
consistency yeah I think I'm gonna put a
little<00:04:35.250> bit<00:04:35.460> more<00:04:35.520> rice<00:04:35.880> in<00:04:36.180> there<00:04:36.360> one<00:04:36.840> more

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
little bit more rice in there one more

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
little bit more rice in there one more
scoop<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.210> will<00:04:39.450> be<00:04:39.630> perfect<00:04:40.200> cause

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
scoop and that will be perfect cause

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:51.650 
scoop and that will be perfect cause
it's<00:04:41.100> still<00:04:41.370> kind<00:04:41.669> of<00:04:41.790> soupy<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:50.450> this<00:04:51.450> is

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
it's still kind of soupy and this is

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.780 
it's still kind of soupy and this is
really<00:04:51.870> healthy<00:04:52.380> because<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:53.280> GABAA<00:04:53.490> rice

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
really healthy because the GABAA rice

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.540 
really healthy because the GABAA rice
releases<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:54.780> amino<00:04:55.380> acid<00:04:55.830> called

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
releases this amino acid called

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.040 
releases this amino acid called
GABA<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:59.120> actually<00:05:00.120> used<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.630> treat

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
GABA and it is actually used to treat

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.240 
GABA and it is actually used to treat
anxiety<00:05:02.510> naturally<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:04.470> can<00:05:04.620> also<00:05:04.770> find<00:05:05.100> it

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
anxiety naturally you can also find it

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.719 
anxiety naturally you can also find it
as<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.520> supplement<00:05:06.120> but<00:05:07.110> this<00:05:08.040> is<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.430> way<00:05:08.520> they

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
as a supplement but this is the way they

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.830 
as a supplement but this is the way they
do<00:05:08.790> it<00:05:09.060> with<00:05:09.360> germinating<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.350> rice<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:12.120> that

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
do it with germinating the rice and that

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.630 
do it with germinating the rice and that
looks<00:05:13.050> wonderful<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:16.500> think<00:05:16.860> I'm<00:05:17.460> gonna

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
looks wonderful so I think I'm gonna

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.790 
looks wonderful so I think I'm gonna
just<00:05:17.970> let<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.300> set<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.870> little<00:05:19.050> bit<00:05:19.200> and<00:05:19.500> warm

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
just let that set a little bit and warm

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.140 
just let that set a little bit and warm
all<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.040> way<00:05:20.310> through<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:21.200> then<00:05:22.200> I<00:05:22.860> will

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
all the way through and then I will

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.760 
all the way through and then I will
finish<00:05:24.150> it<00:05:24.450> off<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.870> show<00:05:25.229> you<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.440> finished
