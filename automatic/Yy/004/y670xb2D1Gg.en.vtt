00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the world see cats as the kings of the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:12.030
 youtube videos but cats like them 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.860
 see the world men thought that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.179
 had domesticated cats like him 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 kept a jet from afar 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.160
 We deal with rations after nursing homes. 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.859
 names toys 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.410
 it is estimated that today there are 600 million 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.449
 of cats living with humans against 800 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.580
 millions of dogs but the distance from the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.369
 champion province has been decreasing since 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.710
 1985 the felines are the most 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 in the United States and Brazil 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 follow the same course 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.270
 with both financial investment 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.590
 and emotional 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 many see their pussies 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.579
 human characteristics 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.230
 but if you cheat differently from the dogs 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.390
 who want to be people 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.610
 cats do not want to be anything else and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.489
 They think we 're cat-eyes. 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.629
 cats their owners are kind giants 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 of the same species 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.969
 responsible for sustaining them and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 them and protect them than for the cat. 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.610
 each room is a jungle that he sees only 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 in shades of yellow and blue behind 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.990
 every enjoying fairy canon behind can 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.939
 there is a threat 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 because he is a territorial feline 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.350
 and lonely tent is learning to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 to live with cats and to live as 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 pet yes science 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.080
 confirms the domestic cat is still 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.600
 wild and this is a discovery 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.180
 fundamental for us to start 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 understand the personality of the cat and only 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.049
 complex relationship with man a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.079
 relationship started out of interest 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.090
 millennia ago that was 10,000 years ago. 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.189
 the first harvests brought together 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 the first mice and for the luck of the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.780
 first farmers together with the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.920
 rodents turn your ophelia predator 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 wild 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 the wild cat was a better beast 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.040
 but kept jets away 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.659
 so I gradually got to 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.509
 relationship is no longer professional and 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.729
 9,500 before Christ'm a man cat 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.740
 were buried together on the chip and after 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.680
 millenniums, we have created a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.990
 sub-species ophÃ©lie silvestris catus o 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.969
 domestic cat that is not so domestic 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.340
 so that to be effective against 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.530
 rats cats will need to keep many 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.300
 of your wild instincts to spend still 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.930
 is a fundamental part of the life of any 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.540
 cat 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.760
 same as apartment when puppies 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.650
 his jokes plus funny guys 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.569
 are linked in the development of 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.790
 your hunting skills a speed 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.099
 and the precision of the blow is the five 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.650
 have evolved to make them into a 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.290
 by the killing machine 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.909
 Yes the cats are wild but this does not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.450
 means I have no attachment to your 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.180
 owners 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.920
 in 2007 a group of veterinarians showed 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.200
 that in the company of strangers 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.510
 cats become more alert near the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.269
 doors and ready for an escape near 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.280
 their owners become more relaxed 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.530
 walkers and playful cats learn 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.400
 until you synchronize your habits with the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.379
 of humans 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.930
 a study of the university of medicine in 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.810
 Italy showed that over time the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.480
 activity and sleep patterns 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.459
 and appear with the owners even to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.299
 time to go to the bathroom became the same 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.280
 for both 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.409
 This is clear without ever understanding how it is 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 called the curious is that it recognizes the 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.169
 owner's voice 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.719
 even when mixed with other people 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.760
 but few obey cats 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.709
 unlike dogs were not 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.269
 domesticated to obey orders 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.010
 they prefer to take the initiative in 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.209
 relationship with humans they 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.040
 earn with it 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.169
 we do not know how this relationship with 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.090
 man between them is that 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.409
 It gets complicated and it can be said that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.150
 between cats there is no 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.220
 rigid hierarchy or defined roles 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.769
 cats that are dominant in a context 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.689
 are submissive in another while a cat 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.400
 has privileges over the other food 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.949
 may have preference on the corner of the sofa 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.659
 that can change owners depending on the 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.370
 other times do not win 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.269
 preference to those who arrive first or 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.609
 who wins the fight 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.859
 this negotiated interaction usually leaves 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.349
 the stressed and ill owners usually 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.879
 find that the more cats but better 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.799
 not when a large number of cats 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.199
 live together everyone becomes more 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.060
 aggression and the absence of 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.159
 means absence of group 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.829
 the owner may find that there are ten cats as 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.049
 the truth has made of one faction and four 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.209
 of others because it is despite the discoveries 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.720
 what is not lacking is something to 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.129
 learn 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.049
 In the future, this relationship will be 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.879
 closer they are currently able to 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.250
 to live with today in the next 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.370
 decades are likely to reach friendship 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.489
 It's important that news is not true. 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.620
 What happened to the world? 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.699
 time saying that the cat does not like 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.770
 physical contact 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:31.169
 most like the owner's affection yes 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.330
 hug your to celebrate but with care 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.430
 and your cat how he behaves 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.770
