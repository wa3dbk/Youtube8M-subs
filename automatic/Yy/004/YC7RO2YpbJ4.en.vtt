quite<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> bit<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.320> not<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.619> much<00:00:20.960> but<00:00:21.960> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
quite a bit but not that much but I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
quite a bit but not that much but I
eventually<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.279> didn't<00:00:23.609> realize<00:00:23.939> this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
eventually like I didn't realize this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.880 
eventually like I didn't realize this
and<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.650> attack

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
and then I was like I have to attack

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
and then I was like I have to attack
these<00:00:26.039> base<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.619> notice<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
these base so if you notice they have to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.470 
these base so if you notice they have to
cross<00:00:31.500> bows<00:00:31.800> out<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.189> action<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> left

Inferno tower on the right-hand side
also<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.059> construction<00:00:43.070> with<00:00:44.070> quite<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> rush

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
also in construction with quite a rush

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.510 
also in construction with quite a rush
base<00:00:45.600> generally<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> crappy<00:00:46.770> walls<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.399> was

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
base generally and crappy walls so I was

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.690 
base generally and crappy walls so I was
like<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.210> steal<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> lot<00:00:48.870> something<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.700> so

like I can steal a lot something up so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.510 
like I can steal a lot something up so
basically<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.210> throw<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.570> Giants<00:00:51.930> down

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
in my clinic cast which was hogs and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.510 
in my clinic cast which was hogs and
minions<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:58.770> reason<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.309> no<00:00:59.430> idea

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
minions for some reason I have no idea

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
minions for some reason I have no idea
why<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.969> were<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.780> they<00:01:00.870> did<00:01:01.050> ok

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
why they were in there but they did ok

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
why they were in there but they did ok
anyway<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.300> put<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> freeze<00:01:03.629> down<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.939> just<00:01:05.939> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
anyway I put a freeze down I just I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
anyway I put a freeze down I just I
think<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.299> got<00:01:06.450> carried<00:01:06.600> away<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.260> too

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
think I got carried away and got too

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.480 
think I got carried away and got too
excited<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> basically<00:01:10.830> spammed<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.369> my

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
excited so basically spammed all my

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.740 
excited so basically spammed all my
troops<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.030> penetrate<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> base

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
troops and I penetrate the base

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
troops and I penetrate the base
perfectly<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:14.580> heroes<00:01:14.909> don't<00:01:15.030> wander

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
perfectly like my heroes don't wander

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.230 
perfectly like my heroes don't wander
around<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> sides<00:01:16.220> yeah<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> planned<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> quite

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
around the sides yeah I planned it quite

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.609 
around the sides yeah I planned it quite
well<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> started<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> panic<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.590> bit

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
well and I started to panic a bit

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.160 
well and I started to panic a bit
because<00:01:20.330> my<00:01:21.330> arch<00:01:21.479> cream<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.840> getting<00:01:22.049> low

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
because my arch cream was getting low

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.370 
because my arch cream was getting low
health<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.520> still<00:01:23.729> hike<00:01:24.380> 450,000

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
health and there was still hike 450,000

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.950 
health and there was still hike 450,000
go<00:01:25.500> left<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> table<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.570> barbarian

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
go left on the table but my barbarian

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.539 
go left on the table but my barbarian
King<00:01:28.229> likely<00:01:28.590> goes<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> gold<00:01:29.100> storage

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
King likely goes for the gold storage

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.740 
King likely goes for the gold storage
and<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> Archer<00:01:30.090> Queen<00:01:30.210> goes<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.600> other

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and I Archer Queen goes for other

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
and I Archer Queen goes for other
storage<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.579> slap<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> power<00:01:33.180> left<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.220> don't

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
storage and I slap a power left I don't

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
storage and I slap a power left I don't
really<00:01:35.430> care<00:01:35.820> about<00:01:36.170> elixir<00:01:37.170> too<00:01:37.290> much

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
really care about elixir too much

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.670 
really care about elixir too much
because<00:01:37.799> i'm<00:01:38.720> basically<00:01:39.720> maxed<00:01:40.200> everything

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
because i'm basically maxed everything

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.649 
because i'm basically maxed everything
except<00:01:41.130> my<00:01:41.220> defenses

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
except my defenses

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.809 
except my defenses
so<00:01:43.140> Gold's<00:01:43.499> a<00:01:43.560> priority<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.219> I've<00:01:44.399> got<00:01:44.609> all

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
so Gold's a priority and I've got all

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.700 
so Gold's a priority and I've got all
I've<00:01:45.119> got<00:01:45.390> mostly<00:01:45.719> gold<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> rest<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.499> in<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I've got mostly gold the rest is in the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.880 
I've got mostly gold the rest is in the
collectors<00:01:47.539> but<00:01:48.539> this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> period<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.649> two

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
collectors but this is the period of two

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.730 
collectors but this is the period of two
weeks<00:01:49.920> where<00:01:51.289> you<00:01:52.289> can<00:01:52.439> boost<00:01:52.619> your

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
weeks where you can boost your

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.279 
weeks where you can boost your
collectors<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.429> gem<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.539> think<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:55.049> could

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
collectors one gem so I think that could

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.120 
collectors one gem so I think that could
be<00:01:55.799> attributed<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:57.000> him<00:01:57.560> but<00:01:58.560> other<00:01:58.859> than<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
be attributed to him but other than that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.699 
be attributed to him but other than that
