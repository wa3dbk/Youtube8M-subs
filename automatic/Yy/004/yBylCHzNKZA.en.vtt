00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello shingles I thought I went up video 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.040
 every day talking about me 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.810
 purpose and that you watch the breakthrough but it 's 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.220
 that really does not move so fast 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.870
 therefore a daily video would be 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.280
 quite boring because neither that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.080
 do anything special only thing I 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.370
 I dedicate is to draw to draw and more 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.900
 draw and until you put that the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.880
 machines because the truth is that I could not 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.710
 can dream or more than drawings first 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 what I'm going to teach is a drawing that I've 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.070
 done more for something of mine not because it's 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
 nice or because it looks good for a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.960
 tattoo but I wanted to make a kind of 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 homage to logical kikillo that sins 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 because it's about a series that I've been 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 hooked on the end that I did not want 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 hooked me that the doctor and I wanted to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.450
 draw the afternoon and well this was the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.070
 first one that says it did not stay very 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.070
 well at all so I said well we passed 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 to the plan of afternoons 2 and I changed it for this 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 where you can appreciate inside all 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 its details and good is not that it has been 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.570
 very well at all but this is going to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 you ccoo that if you catch sohail 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.070
 obvious from something else that draws then 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.110
 to me but michael jackson maybe not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.789
 It seems very much but good now 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 I am also using the piece to see 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.660
 if I am able to do something more 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.120
 retracted or some of this good you know 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 that I told you that I want to dedicate myself 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 everything to make capo rolls and the theme 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.509
 and I love all this, so I 'm going to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.220
 keep drawing lots of tents until 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.659
 let me keep the roll and be able to do 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.850
 my own designs this is copy or 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.220
 copy does not mean that it is decal or not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.909
 is traced is copied and looked at the drawing 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.890
 I have made some modifications 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 first I did the api and then what 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 review and erase all the pencil and it was like this 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.200
 of wilde the truth that is quite 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 happy with this guy to the last today 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 well I was bored and I say I'm going to car 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.460
 portrays and that has made self portray me 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.950
 I have chosen a photo of me that I had 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.770
 there and I said then I'm going to draw 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.539
 and I've done it in pencil like that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 with the mouth is not very well at all and 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.970
 the face is a little good let's say that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.979
 to have done it is not bad, because nothing 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.299
 tried to improve bit by bit try 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.440
 keep doing lots of drawings 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.850
 because the truth is that nothing more than me 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.950
 come the machines I would like to get 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.569
 already practiced dead I think it's going to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.700
 be easier with the machine does the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.380
 shaded how do I do it with the pen 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.690
 for example I think that from what I 've seen 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.130
 it's a lot cooler simpler once 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.720
 that comes with the trick I guess when 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.310
 go making more drawings that go 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.690
 leaving it so cool, well, just go 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.549
 teaching so that I will go see the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.810
 evolution and see how the thing ends 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.070
 until the machines reach me so 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.790
 less once the machines arrive 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.439
 to start 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.420
 tattooed as much as you can and more we have 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.010
 some true tattoo managers 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.450
 I mean really because good to put 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560
 twiter and the comments from youtube 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.689
 you are telling me I want to act 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.189
 with you, I do not know what but it really is 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.140
 like most people say it 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.030
 so we support you on this but 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.500
 really not get tattooed or they are not 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.879
 thinking about tattooing at this moment to 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.709
 Maybe if the wanted and tomorrow 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.540
 tattoo or maybe trust and in my thing 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.430
 that I would love, I would like very much 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.140
 and it would be a pleasure but there are 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.400
 people who have already confirmed that in 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.560
 the moment that begins with the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.150
 tattoos they and they are offered to 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.069
 tattooing in principle so it 's great 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.420
 because this is going to move faster than 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.579
 what I thought and I'm pretty 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.459
 excited I have nothing more to say for 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.989
 Today I'm only culebrilla still there in 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.639
 the fight I hope it ends up coming out 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.680
 all very well and that you can act inside 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.989
 from very little so we see each other inside 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.340
 of that very little and always with form 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.340
 of snake until then
