00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
seeing a see if they can get that last

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.930 
seeing a see if they can get that last
ounce<00:00:06.859> of<00:00:07.149> efficiency<00:00:08.149> out<00:00:08.180> of<00:00:08.300> it<00:00:08.540> of<00:00:08.870> course

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
ounce of efficiency out of it of course

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.860 
ounce of efficiency out of it of course
why<00:00:10.940> yeah<00:00:13.299> so<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:15.740> three<00:00:16.100> teams<00:00:16.430> are<00:00:16.870> coming

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:17.870 
why yeah so the three teams are coming

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.810 
why yeah so the three teams are coming
to<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:17.990> fit<00:00:18.230> they<00:00:18.620> come<00:00:18.800> to<00:00:18.920> starline<00:00:19.280> aepi<00:00:19.670> in

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
to the fit they come to starline aepi in

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.150 
to the fit they come to starline aepi in
pioneers<00:00:20.240> have<00:00:20.420> been<00:00:20.540> standing<00:00:21.110> there<00:00:21.140> for<00:00:21.470> a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
pioneers have been standing there for a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.770 
pioneers have been standing there for a
good<00:00:22.430> minute<00:00:22.700> at<00:00:22.880> this<00:00:23.000> point<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:23.420> finally

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
good minute at this point and finally

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.510 
good minute at this point and finally
sig<00:00:24.170> nu<00:00:24.430> gets<00:00:25.430> set<00:00:25.760> on<00:00:25.940> the<00:00:26.120> start<00:00:26.390> line<00:00:27.520> so

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
sig nu gets set on the start line so

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.430 
sig nu gets set on the start line so
we'll<00:00:28.670> get<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.000> king<00:00:29.390> of<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.540> hill<00:00:29.720> number

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
we'll get the king of the hill number

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.740 
we'll get the king of the hill number
here<00:00:30.680> hopefully<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.469> the<00:00:33.469> teams<00:00:33.739> are<00:00:33.890> off

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
here hopefully and the teams are off

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.729 
here hopefully and the teams are off
it's<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.780> little<00:00:35.870> hard<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.170> call<00:00:36.320> but<00:00:36.500> I'd<00:00:36.589> say

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
it's a little hard to call but I'd say

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.680 
it's a little hard to call but I'd say
sig<00:00:36.980> nu<00:00:37.129> a<00:00:37.190> is<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:37.760> picking<00:00:38.089> up<00:00:38.179> the<00:00:38.210> pace<00:00:38.420> as

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
sig nu a is is picking up the pace as

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.319 
sig nu a is is picking up the pace as
pioneers<00:00:39.649> a<00:00:41.859> so<00:00:42.859> it<00:00:43.579> looks<00:00:43.730> like<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.999> pie<00:00:44.269> is

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
pioneers a so it looks like a pie is

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.520 
pioneers a so it looks like a pie is
falling<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.749> little<00:00:44.839> bit<00:00:45.019> behind<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.350> other

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
falling a little bit behind the other

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.399 
falling a little bit behind the other
two<00:00:45.769> sig<00:00:46.370> nu<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.820> pioneers<00:00:47.210> are<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.170> dead

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
two sig nu and pioneers are in a dead

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.130 
two sig nu and pioneers are in a dead
heat<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:50.059> looks<00:00:50.239> like<00:00:50.300> sig<00:00:50.659> nu<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:50.839> has

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
heat and it looks like sig nu a has

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.259 
heat and it looks like sig nu a has
taken<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.530> advantage<00:00:51.949> of<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.640> top<00:00:52.819> Hill<00:00:53.059> one

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
taken the advantage of the top Hill one

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.660 
taken the advantage of the top Hill one
yeah<00:00:54.140> there<00:00:54.289> may<00:00:54.409> be<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.530> second<00:00:54.949> faster<00:00:55.129> on<00:00:55.429> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
yeah there may be a second faster on the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.939 
yeah there may be a second faster on the
vault<00:00:56.120> on<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.719> switch<00:00:56.899> followed<00:00:57.260> by<00:00:57.379> pioneers

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
vault on the switch followed by pioneers

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.969

and<00:00:58.010> finally<00:00:58.429> a<00:00:58.550> pie<00:00:58.850> in<00:00:58.999> the<00:00:59.030> third<00:00:59.269> place<00:00:59.479> as

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
and finally a pie in the third place as

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.020 
and finally a pie in the third place as
we<00:01:00.979> move<00:01:01.129> into<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.339> freeroll<00:01:03.250> sig<00:01:04.250> nu<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> with
