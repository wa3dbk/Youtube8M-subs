impressive<00:01:35.880> flat<00:01:36.060> bench<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.750> get

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
impressive flat bench but then you get

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.210 
impressive flat bench but then you get
them<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> incline<00:01:37.500> bench<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
them on the incline bench and all of a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
them on the incline bench and all of a
sudden<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.210> kids<00:01:39.360> can't<00:01:39.600> even<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
sudden a lot of kids can't even get the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
sudden a lot of kids can't even get the
40,000<00:01:40.560> incline<00:01:40.890> bench<00:01:41.070> while<00:01:41.549> they're<00:01:41.759> bench

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
40,000 incline bench while they're bench

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.600 
40,000 incline bench while they're bench
pressing<00:01:42.390> 275<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.380> flat<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
pressing 275 on flat it's because the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
pressing 275 on flat it's because the
incline<00:01:45.090> bench<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> much<00:01:45.869> harder<00:01:46.170> exercise

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
incline bench is a much harder exercise

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
incline bench is a much harder exercise
you<00:01:46.979> can't<00:01:47.280> usually<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.090> much<00:01:48.270> way<00:01:48.479> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you can't usually do as much way to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
you can't usually do as much way to
usually<00:01:48.780> weaker<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.189> think<00:01:50.340> it's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
usually weaker on it so I think it's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910 
usually weaker on it so I think it's
more<00:01:50.939> impressive<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.899> ultimately<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.619> fun

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
more impressive and ultimately more fun

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.370 
more impressive and ultimately more fun
to<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> strong<00:01:53.790> incline<00:01:54.390> bench<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.259> we're

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to have a strong incline bench so we're

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.719 
to have a strong incline bench so we're
gonna<00:01:55.470> work<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.890> strength<00:01:56.219> training<00:01:56.310> here

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
gonna work on strength training here

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.160 
gonna work on strength training here
with<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> incline<00:01:57.210> bench<00:01:57.450> build<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
with the incline bench build up that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.480 
with the incline bench build up that
overall<00:01:58.500> strength<00:01:58.770> build<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.159> my<00:01:59.219> upper<00:01:59.460> chest

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
overall strength build up my upper chest

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.770 
overall strength build up my upper chest
and<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:00.600> doing<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> heavy<00:02:01.170> comp

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
and by doing a heavy comp

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.690 
and by doing a heavy comp
in<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.140> beginning<00:02:02.470> like<00:02:02.590> this<00:02:02.890> I'm<00:02:03.460> also

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
in the beginning like this I'm also

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.210 
in the beginning like this I'm also
gonna<00:02:03.910> pre-exhaust<00:02:04.810> my<00:02:05.050> Delta<00:02:05.470> my<00:02:05.620> triceps

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
gonna pre-exhaust my Delta my triceps

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.460 
gonna pre-exhaust my Delta my triceps
because<00:02:06.670> I'm<00:02:06.730> very<00:02:06.850> arm<00:02:07.120> dominant<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.320> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
because I'm very arm dominant so the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.169 
because I'm very arm dominant so the
following<00:02:08.979> exercises<00:02:09.429> which<00:02:09.759> you'll<00:02:09.910> see<00:02:10.060> are

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
following exercises which you'll see are

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.760 
following exercises which you'll see are
much<00:02:10.330> lighter<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.899> much<00:02:11.140> more<00:02:11.290> focus<00:02:11.680> on

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
much lighter and much more focus on

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.290 
much lighter and much more focus on
muscle<00:02:12.130> hypertrophy<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:12.910> slave<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.240> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
muscle hypertrophy and I slave in the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.050 
muscle hypertrophy and I slave in the
chest<00:02:13.570> my<00:02:14.350> chest<00:02:14.770> will<00:02:15.220> come<00:02:15.550> through<00:02:15.790> and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
chest my chest will come through and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.060 
chest my chest will come through and
shine<00:02:16.090> all<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.750> way<00:02:17.080> because<00:02:17.320> my<00:02:17.530> delts<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:17.950> my

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
shine all the way because my delts in my

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.920 
shine all the way because my delts in my
tries<00:02:18.310> will<00:02:18.820> be<00:02:18.910> totally<00:02:19.270> exhausted<00:02:19.420> after

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
tries will be totally exhausted after

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.960 
tries will be totally exhausted after
this<00:02:20.080> first<00:02:20.260> movement<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.250> let's<00:02:21.430> kill<00:02:21.610> it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
this first movement so let's kill it

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.600 
this first movement so let's kill it
so<00:02:22.900> warming<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.560> vital<00:02:23.950> but<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.310> want<00:02:24.520> to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
so warming up is vital but you want to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.449 
so warming up is vital but you want to
warm<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.850> correctly<00:02:25.480> with<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> 5x5<00:02:26.459> basically

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
warm up correctly with a 5x5 basically

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.860 
warm up correctly with a 5x5 basically
you<00:02:27.580> want<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.940> make<00:02:28.060> sure<00:02:28.090> you're<00:02:28.330> nice<00:02:28.600> and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
you want to make sure you're nice and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.080 
you want to make sure you're nice and
loose<00:02:29.170> cuz<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.709> heavy<00:02:29.980> movement<00:02:30.580> however

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
loose cuz it's a heavy movement however

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.750 
loose cuz it's a heavy movement however
you<00:02:31.420> want<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.840> conserve<00:02:32.410> as<00:02:32.680> much<00:02:32.740> energy<00:02:33.340> as

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
you want to conserve as much energy as

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.670 
you want to conserve as much energy as
possible<00:02:34.390> because<00:02:34.510> these<00:02:34.840> five<00:02:35.170> sets<00:02:35.440> ahead

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
possible because these five sets ahead

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.260 
possible because these five sets ahead
of<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.400> hardest<00:02:36.790> heaviest<00:02:37.120> five

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
of you are the hardest heaviest five

only about 10 reps numbers working on my
quick<00:02:46.630> explosive<00:02:47.050> launch<00:02:47.550> then<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.640> do<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
quick explosive launch then I do a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.080 
quick explosive launch then I do a
Segway<00:02:49.209> set<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.900> 185<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.370> only<00:02:51.550> do<00:02:51.670> about<00:02:51.700> 2

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
Segway set of 185 but I only do about 2

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.620 
Segway set of 185 but I only do about 2
or<00:02:52.120> 3<00:02:52.270> reps<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:53.709> weight<00:02:54.100> helps<00:02:54.820> me<00:02:55.000> acclimate

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
or 3 reps this weight helps me acclimate

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.630 
or 3 reps this weight helps me acclimate
my<00:02:55.840> muscles<00:02:56.230> into<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.500> heavier<00:02:56.920> weight<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.520> I'm

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
my muscles into a heavier weight so I'm

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.340 
my muscles into a heavier weight so I'm
ready<00:02:57.910> for<00:02:58.120> 225<00:02:58.660> there<00:02:58.870> won't<00:02:59.050> be<00:02:59.080> such<00:02:59.260> a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
ready for 225 there won't be such a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.520 
ready for 225 there won't be such a
shock<00:02:59.650> for<00:02:59.920> me<00:02:59.980> yet<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.420> two<00:03:01.660> reps<00:03:01.959> makes<00:03:02.440> it

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
shock for me yet the two reps makes it

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.720 
shock for me yet the two reps makes it
so<00:03:02.650> I'm<00:03:02.739> not<00:03:02.800> using<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.190> whole<00:03:03.310> lot<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.580> energy

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.480 

so<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.850> 5x5<00:03:10.090> begins<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.260> today<00:03:11.710> my<00:03:12.040> weight<00:03:12.250> is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
so the 5x5 begins and today my weight is

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.260 
so the 5x5 begins and today my weight is
225<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.810> actually<00:03:14.740> was<00:03:15.130> just<00:03:15.160> fairly<00:03:15.670> Maximus

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
when I got back into incline pressing so

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.930 
when I got back into incline pressing so
my<00:03:20.260> progress<00:03:20.530> has<00:03:20.770> been<00:03:20.800> pretty<00:03:21.160> good<00:03:21.400> however

a<00:03:22.090> lot<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.390> that's<00:03:22.540> muscle<00:03:22.900> memory<00:03:23.230> for<00:03:23.500> me<00:03:23.620> so

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
a lot of that's muscle memory for me so

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.910 
a lot of that's muscle memory for me so
don't<00:03:24.040> expect<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.580> improve<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.120> fast<00:03:25.920> this

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
power lifters this that's actually

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.550 
power lifters this that's actually
really<00:03:45.760> funny<00:03:46.000> because<00:03:46.290> well<00:03:47.290> long<00:03:47.530> story

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
really funny because well long story

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.500 
really funny because well long story
short<00:03:47.860> there's<00:03:48.310> an<00:03:48.460> issue<00:03:48.550> with<00:03:48.700> liftoff<00:03:49.240> and

short there's an issue with liftoff and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.440 
short there's an issue with liftoff and
my<00:03:49.690> grip<00:03:50.020> was<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:50.770> uneven<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.850> was<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.270> most

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
my grip was so uneven it was the most

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.240 
my grip was so uneven it was the most
awkward<00:03:52.630> feeling<00:03:53.350> set<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.800> world<00:03:54.040> I

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
awkward feeling set in the world I

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.590 
awkward feeling set in the world I
probably<00:03:54.520> should<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:54.790> rack<00:03:55.210> it<00:03:55.450> and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
probably should just rack it and

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.390 
probably should just rack it and
regripped<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.170> but<00:03:56.680> I'm<00:03:56.770> stubborn<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.250> just

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
regripped it but I'm stubborn so I just

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.610 
regripped it but I'm stubborn so I just
kept<00:03:57.580> going<00:03:57.760> with<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.200> which<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.290> probably<00:03:59.560> not

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
kept going with it which is probably not

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.380 
kept going with it which is probably not
the<00:03:59.740> safest<00:03:59.950> thing<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.250> do<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.910> felt<00:04:01.150> fine

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
the safest thing to do but it felt fine

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.120 
the safest thing to do but it felt fine
I<00:04:01.420> was<00:04:01.690> able<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.900> still<00:04:02.110> blast<00:04:02.440> my<00:04:02.650> chest<00:04:02.980> as

I was able to still blast my chest as
awkward<00:04:03.430> as<00:04:03.550> it<00:04:03.670> felt<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.630> can<00:04:04.780> even<00:04:04.930> hear<00:04:05.170> my

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
awkward as it felt you can even hear my

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
I know to breathe so one thing you'll

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.820 
I know to breathe so one thing you'll
notice<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.330> as<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.780> get<00:04:21.959> deeper<00:04:22.350> into<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.620> sets

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
notice is as I get deeper into the sets

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.520 
notice is as I get deeper into the sets
and<00:04:22.980> I<00:04:23.010> become<00:04:23.310> more<00:04:23.520> fatigue<00:04:23.970> fatigue<00:04:24.780> can

and I become more fatigue fatigue can

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.010 
and I become more fatigue fatigue can
obviously<00:04:25.950> lead<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.550> poor<00:04:26.850> form<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.660> form<00:04:27.900> can

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
obviously lead to poor form the form can

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.710 
obviously lead to poor form the form can

after<00:07:44.770> this<00:07:44.950> I'm<00:07:45.880> currently<00:07:46.210> weighing<00:07:46.570> about

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780 
after this I'm currently weighing about

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.210 
a hundred and seventy pounds I set them

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.660 
a hundred and seventy pounds I set them
to<00:07:49.300> scale<00:07:49.540> tonight<00:07:50.010> fully<00:07:51.010> clothed<00:07:51.310> and<00:07:51.520> what

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:51.670 
to scale tonight fully clothed and what

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.630 
to scale tonight fully clothed and what
you<00:07:51.760> see<00:07:51.910> me<00:07:52.030> wearing<00:07:52.240> and<00:07:53.370> after<00:07:54.370> a<00:07:54.400> full

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:54.640 
you see me wearing and after a full

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.780 
you see me wearing and after a full
night<00:07:54.850> of<00:07:55.000> eating<00:07:55.330> and<00:07:55.570> I<00:07:56.110> was<00:07:56.230> about<00:07:56.410> 175<00:07:56.980> even

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:57.790 
night of eating and I was about 175 even

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.700 
night of eating and I was about 175 even
so<00:07:58.060> I'm<00:07:58.300> probably<00:07:58.480> about<00:07:58.630> 170<00:07:59.290> first<00:07:59.500> thing<00:07:59.620> in

00:07:59.700 --> 00:07:59.710 
so I'm probably about 170 first thing in

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.590 
so I'm probably about 170 first thing in
the<00:07:59.800> morning<00:08:00.190> and<00:08:00.850> that's<00:08:01.000> at<00:08:01.150> about<00:08:01.360> five

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:01.600 
the morning and that's at about five

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.090 
the morning and that's at about five
foot<00:08:01.810> seven<00:08:01.960> maybe<00:08:02.260> five<00:08:02.560> foot<00:08:02.740> eight<00:08:02.770> if<00:08:02.980> I'm

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:03.100 
foot seven maybe five foot eight if I'm

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.600 
foot seven maybe five foot eight if I'm
lucky

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:03.610 
lucky

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.790 
lucky
so<00:08:03.700> the<00:08:03.790> plan<00:08:04.060> is<00:08:04.330> to<00:08:04.360> continue<00:08:04.810> hardening<00:08:05.680> up

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 
so the plan is to continue hardening up

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.440 
so the plan is to continue hardening up
a<00:08:05.890> little<00:08:06.070> bit<00:08:06.220> and<00:08:06.340> do<00:08:06.430> a<00:08:06.460> nice<00:08:06.670> lean<00:08:07.090> vault

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:07.450 
a little bit and do a nice lean vault

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.260 
a little bit and do a nice lean vault
for<00:08:07.750> the<00:08:07.810> rest<00:08:07.990> of<00:08:08.080> the<00:08:08.170> year<00:08:08.880> I'll<00:08:09.880> be<00:08:09.970> sure<00:08:10.150> to

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.270 
for the rest of the year I'll be sure to
