way to get into the two adjacent

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
way to get into the two adjacent
patterns<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.440> we'll<00:00:46.530> start<00:00:46.890> by<00:00:47.190> taking<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
patterns and we'll start by taking a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
patterns and we'll start by taking a
look<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.910> pattern<00:00:48.750> two<00:00:49.020> which<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.860> start

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
look at pattern two which you can start

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.060 
look at pattern two which you can start
up<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> sixth<00:00:51.270> fret<00:00:57.829> alright

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
up here on the sixth fret alright

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.689 
up here on the sixth fret alright
so<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> way<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.120> normally<00:01:00.930> move<00:01:01.699> between

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so the way that I normally move between

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.939 
so the way that I normally move between
these<00:01:03.059> two<00:01:03.329> patterns<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.989> connect<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.619> in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
these two patterns and connect them in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.550 
these two patterns and connect them in
my<00:01:05.309> playing<00:01:05.549> whether<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:06.060> sewing<00:01:06.659> or<00:01:06.960> you

is right here it's a natural way at

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.460 
is right here it's a natural way at
least<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.310> my<00:01:17.430> fingers<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.630> move<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
least for my fingers to move up and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.950 
least for my fingers to move up and
shift<00:01:19.770> position<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.600> guitarists<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.720> love

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560 
shift position as guitarists we love
going<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.130> skipping<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> fret<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.150> playing<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
going and skipping a fret and playing a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.190 
going and skipping a fret and playing a
to<00:01:24.780> fret<00:01:25.140> interval<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.240> easy<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
to fret interval it's just easy and and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.539 
to fret interval it's just easy and and
we<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.130> any<00:01:32.340> adjustments

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.690 
we don't have to make any adjustments
and<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.740> know<00:01:34.829> grab<00:01:35.040> many<00:01:35.250> different

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and and you know grab many different

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
and and you know grab many different
notes<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> great<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
notes so this is a great way to do that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.390 
notes so this is a great way to do that
to<00:01:38.400> fret<00:01:38.820> interval

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.170 

sort<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.730> position<00:01:44.240> right<00:01:44.480> here

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.700 

meaning<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.109> were<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> skipper<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
meaning you know were you skipper for it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.440 
meaning you know were you skipper for it
but<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.100> continue<00:01:53.700> pattern<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
but then you can continue pattern to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.350 
but then you can continue pattern to
from<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.579> when<00:01:56.579> you're<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.969> position

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
favorite way to get into box five there

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.300 
favorite way to get into box five there
are<00:02:21.329> five<00:02:21.540> pentatonic<00:02:22.319> patterns<00:02:22.709> they<00:02:22.950> get<00:02:23.099> up

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
are five pentatonic patterns they get up

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.979 
are five pentatonic patterns they get up
the<00:02:23.430> next<00:02:23.610> morning<00:02:23.819> we<00:02:24.480> already<00:02:24.720> looked<00:02:24.900> at

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the next morning we already looked at

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.949 
the next morning we already looked at
two<00:02:25.230> three<00:02:26.010> four<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.849> five<00:02:26.880> would<00:02:27.599> actually

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
two three four and five would actually

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.180 
two three four and five would actually
come<00:02:28.200> around<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.920> connect<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.269> one<00:02:31.040> if<00:02:32.040> we

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
come around and connect to one if we

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.339 
come around and connect to one if we
keep<00:02:32.640> going<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.090> could<00:02:33.150> show<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.660> but

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
keep going I could show you that but

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.490 
keep going I could show you that but
know<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.819> always<00:02:36.030> go<00:02:36.750> from<00:02:37.079> one

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
know this you can always go from one

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.490 
know this you can always go from one
down<00:02:38.280> into<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> pattern<00:02:39.510> five<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.230> that's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
down into the pattern five and that's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500 
down into the pattern five and that's
what<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.709> really<00:02:41.250> find<00:02:41.459> pattern<00:02:41.970> five<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.360> be

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
what I really find pattern five to be

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.380 
what I really find pattern five to be
the<00:02:42.630> most<00:02:42.900> useful<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.560> my<00:02:44.010> claim<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:45.239> way

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
the most useful in my claim and the way

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.869 
the most useful in my claim and the way
we're<00:02:45.569> gonna<00:02:45.629> get<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:47.549> know<00:02:47.610> so

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
we're gonna get there is you know so

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.920 
we're gonna get there is you know so
we're<00:02:48.030> up<00:02:48.180> here<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.690> pattern<00:02:49.410> two<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:54.600> here's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
we're up here in pattern two and here's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.069 
we're up here in pattern two and here's
a<00:02:55.019> great<00:02:55.380> spot<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:56.040> go<00:02:56.370> down<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.540> catch<00:02:57.810> some

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
a great spot to go down and catch some

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.800 
a great spot to go down and catch some
lower<00:02:58.410> notes<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:59.180> pattern

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.750 

so<00:03:03.810> there's<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.050> little<00:03:04.319> little<00:03:05.010> box<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.730> you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
so there's a little little box here you

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.500 
so there's a little little box here you
know<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> full<00:03:06.420> pattern<00:03:06.870> looks<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.320 

but<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.780> love<00:03:16.110> using<00:03:16.410> these<00:03:16.739> lower<00:03:17.069> pitch<00:03:17.970> notes

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
but I love using these lower pitch notes

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:31.930 
but I love using these lower pitch notes
to<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.680> fill<00:03:20.099> out<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.430> scale

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.690 

all<00:03:32.940> right<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.270> let's<00:03:33.510> move<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.920> sort<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.489> view

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
all right so let's move and sort of view

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.370 
all right so let's move and sort of view
pattern<00:03:36.060> five<00:03:36.330> there's<00:03:36.660> our<00:03:36.780> starting<00:03:37.170> point

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
pattern five there's our starting point

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:50.240 
pattern five there's our starting point
we<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.620> get<00:03:37.770> five<00:03:38.040> one<00:03:38.760> two<00:03:49.010> all<00:03:50.010> right<00:03:50.040> so

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
we can get five one two all right so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.640 
we can get five one two all right so
that's<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.489> real<00:03:50.640> scalar<00:03:51.209> type<00:03:51.840> sound<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.530> it

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
that's a real scalar type sound to it

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.130 
that's a real scalar type sound to it
but<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.040> know<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.580> all<00:03:53.880> applies<00:03:54.720> to

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
but you know this this all applies to

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:04.250 
but you know this this all applies to
legs<00:04:02.510> it's<00:04:03.510> something<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.019> just

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
legs it's something like that just

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.380 
legs it's something like that just
noodling<00:04:04.769> around<00:04:04.890> but<00:04:05.400> knowing<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.299> I've

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
noodling around but knowing that I've

00:04:06.390 --> 00:05:02.020 
noodling around but knowing that I've
always<00:04:06.840> got<00:04:07.110> this<00:04:07.350> way<00:04:07.590> up<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.849> this<00:04:12.720> way<00:04:12.959> down

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.090 

you
