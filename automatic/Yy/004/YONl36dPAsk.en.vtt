we<00:05:43.199> haven't<00:05:43.409> even<00:05:43.469> used<00:05:43.680> combat<00:05:44.009> readiness

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
we haven't even used combat readiness

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.110 
we haven't even used combat readiness
let's<00:05:44.490> do<00:05:44.610> for<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:44.849> hell<00:05:44.969> of<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:48.860> there<00:05:49.860> we<00:05:49.949> go

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
let's do for the hell of it there we go

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.980 
let's do for the hell of it there we go
he's<00:05:51.120> down<00:05:51.949> so<00:05:52.949> I<00:05:52.979> think<00:05:53.339> maybe<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.990> circle

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
he's down so I think maybe the circle

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.649 
he's down so I think maybe the circle
strafing<00:05:55.669> wasn't<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:56.789> best<00:05:56.939> idea<00:05:57.120> i<00:05:57.389> think<00:05:57.599> i

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
strafing wasn't the best idea i think i

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.839 
strafing wasn't the best idea i think i
was<00:05:57.779> losing<00:05:57.930> some<00:05:58.229> dps<00:05:58.560> doing<00:05:59.009> that<00:05:59.189> instead

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
was losing some dps doing that instead

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.399 
was losing some dps doing that instead
of<00:05:59.999> just<00:06:00.180> they'll<00:06:00.479> fight<00:06:00.870> him<00:06:00.990> head<00:06:01.139> to<00:06:01.259> head

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
of just they'll fight him head to head

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.469 
of just they'll fight him head to head
because<00:06:02.129> i<00:06:02.249> really<00:06:02.460> need<00:06:02.759> didn't<00:06:03.210> even<00:06:03.360> eat

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
because i really need didn't even eat

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.890 
because i really need didn't even eat
combat<00:06:03.900> readiness<00:06:04.169> that<00:06:04.349> time<00:06:04.919> so<00:06:05.699> i<00:06:06.210> also<00:06:06.599> did

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
combat readiness that time so i also did

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.719 
combat readiness that time so i also did
I<00:06:06.930> didn't<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:07.409> know<00:06:07.469> two<00:06:07.830> extra<00:06:08.069> cloak<00:06:08.279> cloak

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
I didn't you know two extra cloak cloak

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.059 
I didn't you know two extra cloak cloak
of<00:06:08.849> shadows<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:10.050> take<00:06:10.229> forty<00:06:10.560> percent<00:06:10.830> less

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
of shadows to take forty percent less

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.429 
of shadows to take forty percent less
physical<00:06:11.490> damage<00:06:11.789> so<00:06:12.479> I<00:06:12.509> think<00:06:12.629> that<00:06:12.810> helps<00:06:13.259> so

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
physical damage so I think that helps so

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.709 
physical damage so I think that helps so
I<00:06:13.650> know<00:06:14.069> the<00:06:14.250> more<00:06:14.370> technical<00:06:14.639> to<00:06:14.969> my<00:06:15.089> usual
