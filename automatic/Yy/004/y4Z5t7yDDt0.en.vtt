and<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.090> easy<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.509> look<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.689> them<00:01:48.840> together

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and it's easy to look at them together

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
and it's easy to look at them together
in<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> group<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> lot

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
in a kind of group and we can get a lot

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.160 
in a kind of group and we can get a lot
of<00:01:50.909> information<00:01:51.390> when<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.780> put<00:01:52.020> them

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
of information when you kind of put them

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
of information when you kind of put them
together<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.770> talking<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
together so talking about them in a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.370 
together so talking about them in a
general<00:01:54.299> sense<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.140> he's<00:01:55.290> doing

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
general sense we can see that he's doing

general sense we can see that he's doing
a<00:01:55.590> lot<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> very<00:01:56.130> very<00:01:56.189> strange<00:01:56.579> things<00:01:56.909> you

doing<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.130> these<00:02:20.280> experiments<00:02:20.880> we<00:02:20.970> get<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
doing with these experiments we get a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.460 
doing with these experiments we get a
lot<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.330> information<00:02:21.810> about<00:02:21.930> he's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
lot of information about he's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470 
lot of information about he's
experimenting<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.640> he<00:02:23.760> named<00:02:23.940> subjects

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
experimenting on the he named subjects

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.750 
experimenting on the he named subjects
such<00:02:24.600> as<00:02:24.630> d<00:02:24.930> 2<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.170> d<00:02:25.410> 5<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.400> sounds<00:02:26.640> like

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
such as d 2 and d 5 and that sounds like

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.190 
such as d 2 and d 5 and that sounds like
quite<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.090> lot<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.390> groups<00:02:27.600> there's<00:02:27.840> possibly

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
quite a lot of groups there's possibly

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.030 
quite a lot of groups there's possibly
an<00:02:28.380> ABCD<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:30.270> fez<00:02:30.510> d<00:02:30.720> 2<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.020> d<00:02:31.290> 5<00:02:31.680> there's<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
an ABCD and a fez d 2 and d 5 there's a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.920 
an ABCD and a fez d 2 and d 5 there's a
lot<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.340> groups<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> very<00:02:33.360> very<00:02:33.630> big

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
lot of groups this is a very very big

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.780 
lot of groups this is a very very big
scale<00:02:34.290> experiment<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.310> seems<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.640> he

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
scale experiment and it seems that he

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.220 
scale experiment and it seems that he
would<00:02:35.910> probably<00:02:36.120> working<00:02:36.420> for<00:02:36.810> some<00:02:37.020> kind<00:02:37.200> of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
would probably working for some kind of

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.570 
would probably working for some kind of
great<00:02:37.530> company<00:02:37.920> possibly<00:02:38.340> even<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
great company possibly even the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.370 
great company possibly even the
government<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.600> very<00:02:39.810> large<00:02:39.990> company

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
government but a very large company

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.810 
government but a very large company
indeed<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:40.830> he's<00:02:40.980> experimenting<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.610> this

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
indeed if he's experimenting on this

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.090 
indeed if he's experimenting on this
many<00:02:42.150> people<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.780> he<00:02:43.290> did<00:02:43.440> say<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.770> d<00:02:43.890> 2

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
many people and he did say that d 2

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.070 
many people and he did say that d 2
reported<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> brief<00:02:44.820> sense<00:02:45.210> of<00:02:45.420> impaired

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
reported a brief sense of impaired

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.110 
reported a brief sense of impaired
hearing<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.710> d5<00:02:47.160> complained<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.940> deep

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
hearing and d5 complained of a deep

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.790 
hearing and d5 complained of a deep
sense<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.540> taste<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.200> these<00:02:49.410> are<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:49.770> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
sense of taste so these are like the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.890 
sense of taste so these are like the
basic<00:02:50.250> human<00:02:50.640> senses<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.360> they<00:02:51.480> seem<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.750> be

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
basic human senses and they seem to be

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.450 
basic human senses and they seem to be
kind<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.230> losing<00:02:52.710> them<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.010> whatever<00:02:53.250> he's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
kind of losing them so whatever he's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.070 
kind of losing them so whatever he's
doing<00:02:53.640> some<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.240> seems<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.690> he's<00:02:54.810> possibly

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
doing some it seems like he's possibly

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.110 
doing some it seems like he's possibly
like<00:02:55.500> turn<00:02:55.710> them<00:02:55.890> into<00:02:56.130> cyborgs<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.880> he's

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
like turn them into cyborgs and he's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.310 
like turn them into cyborgs and he's
definitely<00:02:57.300> messing<00:02:57.630> with<00:02:57.840> their<00:02:57.960> brains<00:02:58.110> we

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
definitely messing with their brains we

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.480 
definitely messing with their brains we
can<00:02:58.410> get<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.680> from<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.980> lot<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> brain

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
can get that from a lot of the brain

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.130 
can get that from a lot of the brain
scans<00:02:59.820> that's<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.390> there's<00:03:00.780> definitely

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
scans that's going on there's definitely

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.450 
scans that's going on there's definitely
some<00:03:01.320> kind<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.560> psychological<00:03:01.950> work<00:03:02.280> that's

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
some kind of psychological work that's

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.890 
some kind of psychological work that's
going<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.910> addition<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.540> think<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
going on in addition to that I think the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.030 
going on in addition to that I think the
most<00:03:03.990> interesting<00:03:04.260> thing<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> most

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
most interesting thing is the most

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.070 
most interesting thing is the most
recent<00:03:05.400> one<00:03:05.580> he<00:03:05.790> said<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.360> duration<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.900> these

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
recent one he said the duration of these

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.840 
recent one he said the duration of these
episodes<00:03:07.320> can<00:03:07.620> range<00:03:07.860> from<00:03:07.980> several<00:03:08.430> seconds

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
episodes can range from several seconds

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.120 
episodes can range from several seconds

implanted<00:03:11.910> memories<00:03:12.270> from<00:03:12.600> their<00:03:12.930> own<00:03:13.140> so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
implanted memories from their own so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.380 
implanted memories from their own so
that<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.740> very<00:03:13.830> very<00:03:14.160> telling<00:03:14.760> dr.<00:03:15.030> Salim<00:03:15.210> is

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that is very very telling dr. Salim is

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.570 
that is very very telling dr. Salim is
somehow<00:03:15.930> implanting<00:03:16.770> memories<00:03:17.100> into<00:03:17.460> these

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
somehow implanting memories into these

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.100 
somehow implanting memories into these
patients<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.450> links<00:03:18.690> all<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.900> way<00:03:18.959> back

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
patients and that links all the way back

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.750 
patients and that links all the way back
to<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.320> very<00:03:19.350> first<00:03:19.590> tease<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.220> got<00:03:20.430> wait<00:03:20.580> and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
to the very first tease we got wait and

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.280 
to the very first tease we got wait and
listen<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.120> sound<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.360> my<00:03:21.420> voice<00:03:21.510> imagine

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
listen to the sound of my voice imagine

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.750 
listen to the sound of my voice imagine
yourself<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.800> frozen<00:03:23.040> forest<00:03:23.490> he<00:03:23.670> was

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
yourself in a frozen forest he was

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.370 
yourself in a frozen forest he was
saying<00:03:23.940> imagine<00:03:24.330> yourself<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.810> these<00:03:25.140> places

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
saying imagine yourself in these places

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.480 
saying imagine yourself in these places
and<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.800> thought<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.040> was<00:03:26.100> some<00:03:26.280> kind<00:03:26.459> of

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
and we thought it was some kind of

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.760 
and we thought it was some kind of
therapy<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.090> seems<00:03:27.300> these<00:03:27.690> actually<00:03:28.320> what

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
therapy but it seems these actually what

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.990 
therapy but it seems these actually what
these<00:03:28.890> experiments<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.400> dr.<00:03:29.670> Salim<00:03:29.850> is

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
these experiments that dr. Salim is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.880 
these experiments that dr. Salim is
undertaking<00:03:30.660> or<00:03:30.930> actually<00:03:31.230> implanting

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
undertaking or actually implanting

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.010 
undertaking or actually implanting
memories<00:03:32.220> into<00:03:32.640> these<00:03:32.760> people<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.810> may<00:03:33.959> be

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
memories into these people and it may be

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.750 
memories into these people and it may be
their<00:03:34.320> soldiers<00:03:35.100> they've<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.430> come<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.730> of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
their soldiers they've just come out of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.280 
their soldiers they've just come out of
war<00:03:36.030> maybe<00:03:36.240> they're<00:03:36.390> trying<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.690> help<00:03:37.020> them<00:03:37.170> in

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
war maybe they're trying to help them in

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.540 
war maybe they're trying to help them in
some<00:03:37.470> way<00:03:37.590> kind<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.860> get<00:03:37.980> them<00:03:38.130> back<00:03:38.280> into<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
some way kind of get them back into the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.920 
some way kind of get them back into the
fight<00:03:38.700> or<00:03:38.940> maybe<00:03:39.270> they're<00:03:39.390> just<00:03:39.510> about<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.840> go

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
fight or maybe they're just about to go

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.060 
fight or maybe they're just about to go
into<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.350> maybe<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.770> some<00:03:40.890> kind<00:03:41.040> of

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
into it maybe this is some kind of

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.410 
into it maybe this is some kind of
procedure<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.850> all<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> black<00:03:42.270> ops

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
procedure that all the black ops

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.880 
procedure that all the black ops
soldiers<00:03:42.600> have<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.080> undergo<00:03:43.350> before<00:03:43.800> they

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
soldiers have to undergo before they

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.710 
soldiers have to undergo before they
become<00:03:44.190> actual<00:03:44.790> black<00:03:45.000> ops<00:03:45.180> soldiers<00:03:45.390> these

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
become actual black ops soldiers these

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.300 
become actual black ops soldiers these
next<00:03:46.050> generation<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.650> description<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.130> game

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
next generation the description the game

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.560 
next generation the description the game
was<00:03:47.670> actually<00:03:47.940> talking<00:03:48.060> about<00:03:48.360> but<00:03:48.510> it

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
was actually talking about but it

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.060 
was actually talking about but it
definitely<00:03:48.750> seems<00:03:49.110> there's<00:03:49.560> some<00:03:49.770> kind<00:03:50.010> of

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
definitely seems there's some kind of

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.860 
definitely seems there's some kind of
implanting<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.850> links<00:03:51.090> back<00:03:51.209> also<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.660> what

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
implanting and a links back also to what

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.330 
implanting and a links back also to what

recent<00:03:55.020> video<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.650> edit<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.100> implanting

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
recent video and this edit of implanting

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.850 
recent video and this edit of implanting
microchips<00:03:57.300> into<00:03:57.630> them<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.170> enhancing

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
microchips into them and like enhancing

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.770 
microchips into them and like enhancing
them<00:03:58.980> with<00:03:59.010> technology<00:03:59.670> like<00:04:00.390> injecting

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
them with technology like injecting

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.600 
them with technology like injecting
people's<00:04:01.260> eyes<00:04:01.470> with<00:04:01.800> night<00:04:02.040> vision<00:04:02.070> there's

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
people's eyes with night vision there's

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.280 
people's eyes with night vision there's
definitely<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.970> lot<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.270> messing<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.110> seems

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
definitely a lot of messing and it seems

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.900 
definitely a lot of messing and it seems
that<00:04:04.350> what<00:04:04.560> dr.<00:04:04.709> Salim<00:04:05.010> might<00:04:05.250> be<00:04:05.370> doing<00:04:05.700> could

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
that what dr. Salim might be doing could

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.580 
that what dr. Salim might be doing could
cause<00:04:06.180> more<00:04:06.450> harm<00:04:06.720> than<00:04:07.020> good<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.350> these

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
cause more harm than good to these

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.260 
cause more harm than good to these
patients<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.370> they<00:04:08.490> seem<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:08.910> becoming

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
patients and they seem to be becoming

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.240 
patients and they seem to be becoming
almost<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:10.050> robots<00:04:10.560> when<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.830> lose<00:04:11.040> your

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
almost like robots when you lose your

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.040 
almost like robots when you lose your
senses<00:04:11.610> you're<00:04:11.970> losing<00:04:12.330> basie<00:04:12.540> what<00:04:12.870> makes

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
senses you're losing basie what makes

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.510 
senses you're losing basie what makes
you<00:04:13.200> human<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.739> dead<00:04:14.220> when<00:04:14.430> they're

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
you human and dead when they're

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.099 
you human and dead when they're
injecting<00:04:15.000> people<00:04:15.150> with<00:04:15.360> these<00:04:15.540> crazy<00:04:15.840> things

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
injecting people with these crazy things

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.659 
injecting people with these crazy things
and<00:04:16.260> putting<00:04:16.470> microchips<00:04:17.070> into<00:04:17.310> their<00:04:17.430> brain

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
and putting microchips into their brain

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.729 
and putting microchips into their brain
he's<00:04:18.090> like<00:04:18.299> implanting<00:04:18.870> memories<00:04:19.320> into<00:04:19.620> them

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
he's like implanting memories into them

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.960 
he's like implanting memories into them
there's<00:04:19.890> definitely<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.280> lot<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.609> very<00:04:20.790> strange

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
there's definitely a lot of very strange

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.670 
there's definitely a lot of very strange
things<00:04:21.270> going<00:04:21.480> on<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:22.200> seems<00:04:22.410> like<00:04:22.560> this

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
things going on and it seems like this

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.380 
things going on and it seems like this
is<00:04:22.800> also<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.370> way<00:04:23.700> for<00:04:23.729> them<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.120> kind<00:04:24.300> of

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
is also a way for them to kind of

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.300 
is also a way for them to kind of
explain<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.870> zombies<00:04:25.320> storyline<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.280> a

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
explain the zombies storyline this is a

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.629 
explain the zombies storyline this is a
very<00:04:26.580> very<00:04:26.790> likely<00:04:27.060> way

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
very very likely way

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.980 
very very likely way
but<00:04:27.789> I<00:04:27.819> think<00:04:28.150> black<00:04:28.330> ops<00:04:28.479> 3<00:04:28.629> will<00:04:28.749> introduce

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
but I think black ops 3 will introduce

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.140 
but I think black ops 3 will introduce
zombies<00:04:29.530> some<00:04:30.039> kind<00:04:30.249> of<00:04:30.280> way<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:30.879> dr.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
zombies some kind of way that dr.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.339 
zombies some kind of way that dr.
singh's<00:04:31.330> experiments<00:04:31.840> were<00:04:31.930> going<00:04:32.169> Ron<00:04:32.319> I

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
singh's experiments were going Ron I

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.570 
singh's experiments were going Ron I
think<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.680> course<00:04:32.889> there's<00:04:33.219> going<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.430> be<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
think of course there's going to be the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.189 
think of course there's going to be the
basic<00:04:33.939> black<00:04:34.150> ops<00:04:34.389> storyline<00:04:34.840> like<00:04:35.020> we've

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
basic black ops storyline like we've

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.929 
basic black ops storyline like we've
always<00:04:35.319> seen<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.590> black<00:04:35.800> ops<00:04:35.979> 3<00:04:36.189> there's<00:04:36.550> also<00:04:36.789> I

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
always seen a black ops 3 there's also I

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:37.920 
always seen a black ops 3 there's also I
think<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.240> way<00:04:37.389> they're<00:04:37.539> going<00:04:37.659> to<00:04:37.719> explain

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
think a way they're going to explain

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.540 
think a way they're going to explain
zombies<00:04:38.379> is<00:04:38.560> some<00:04:38.800> sort<00:04:39.009> of<00:04:39.039> experiment<00:04:39.490> the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
zombies is some sort of experiment the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.159 
zombies is some sort of experiment the
dots<00:04:39.699> team<00:04:39.879> was<00:04:40.029> doing<00:04:40.270> they<00:04:40.569> was<00:04:40.749> doing<00:04:40.990> wrong

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
dots team was doing they was doing wrong

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.209 
dots team was doing they was doing wrong
maybe<00:04:41.409> there's<00:04:41.620> good<00:04:41.770> made<00:04:41.979> this<00:04:42.069> give<00:04:42.189> me

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
maybe there's good made this give me

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.649 
maybe there's good made this give me

some kind of link between him and ripped

or ripped off and maybe I'll link in

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.659 
or ripped off and maybe I'll link in
that<00:04:47.499> way<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:47.800> we<00:04:48.069> can<00:04:48.189> definitely<00:04:48.370> see<00:04:48.639> the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
that way but we can definitely see the

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.399 
that way but we can definitely see the
way<00:04:48.939> like<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.270> camera<00:04:49.629> flashes<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.259> the<00:04:50.319> way

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
way like the camera flashes and the way

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.320 
way like the camera flashes and the way
they<00:04:50.590> become<00:04:50.830> almost<00:04:51.189> less<00:04:51.520> human<00:04:51.939> it<00:04:52.029> seems

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
they become almost less human it seems

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.149 
they become almost less human it seems
like<00:04:52.509> this<00:04:52.599> is<00:04:52.659> an<00:04:52.810> underlying<00:04:53.110> story<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.979> how

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
like this is an underlying story of how

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.679 
like this is an underlying story of how
they<00:04:54.279> might<00:04:54.370> introduce<00:04:54.639> zombies<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.479> kind<00:04:55.659> of

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
they might introduce zombies and kind of

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.779 
they might introduce zombies and kind of
bring<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:55.990> law<00:04:56.289> of<00:04:56.439> zombies<00:04:57.099> into<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.580> game

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
bring the law of zombies into the game

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.580 
bring the law of zombies into the game
and<00:04:57.969> another<00:04:58.629> thing<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.080> mentioned<00:04:59.259> in

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
and another thing that I mentioned in

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.320 
and another thing that I mentioned in
some<00:04:59.770> other<00:04:59.860> snapchats<00:05:00.400> were<00:05:00.580> about<00:05:00.849> mental

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
some other snapchats were about mental

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.700 
some other snapchats were about mental
conditioning<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.139> how<00:05:02.229> he's<00:05:02.379> optimistic

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
conditioning and how he's optimistic

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.649 
conditioning and how he's optimistic
about<00:05:03.370> this<00:05:03.610> project's<00:05:04.090> potential<00:05:04.539> it

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
about this project's potential it

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.209 
about this project's potential it
definitely<00:05:05.020> seems<00:05:05.259> the<00:05:05.590> what<00:05:05.740> doctors<00:05:06.069> theme

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
definitely seems the what doctors theme

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:07.339 
definitely seems the what doctors theme
is<00:05:06.400> doing<00:05:06.639> is<00:05:06.759> actually<00:05:07.029> going<00:05:07.180> pretty

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
is doing is actually going pretty

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.879 
is doing is actually going pretty
successfully<00:05:08.349> and<00:05:08.439> it's<00:05:08.529> going<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
successfully and it's going in the

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.439 
successfully and it's going in the
direction<00:05:08.979> that<00:05:09.370> he<00:05:09.759> wants<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.029> go<00:05:10.180> he<00:05:10.210> says

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
direction that he wants to go he says

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.059 
direction that he wants to go he says
he's<00:05:10.599> optimistic<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.379> we<00:05:11.860> don't<00:05:11.949> know

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
he's optimistic and we don't know

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.830 
he's optimistic and we don't know
exactly<00:05:12.189> whether<00:05:12.610> this<00:05:12.759> be<00:05:12.819> good<00:05:13.150> or<00:05:13.330> bad<00:05:13.509> for

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
exactly whether this be good or bad for

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.749 
exactly whether this be good or bad for
the<00:05:13.960> human-like<00:05:14.349> population<00:05:15.159> whether<00:05:15.580> he's

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
the human-like population whether he's

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.219 
the human-like population whether he's
actually<00:05:15.879> doing<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.270> good<00:05:16.419> or<00:05:16.569> evil<00:05:16.900> thing<00:05:17.080> but

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
actually doing a good or evil thing but

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.749 
actually doing a good or evil thing but
it<00:05:17.319> seems<00:05:17.500> like<00:05:17.650> his<00:05:17.770> experience<00:05:18.159> are<00:05:18.310> going

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
it seems like his experience are going

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.339 
it seems like his experience are going
to<00:05:18.909> plan<00:05:19.120> on<00:05:19.240> whatever<00:05:19.389> he's<00:05:19.629> trying<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.139> do<00:05:20.229> is

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
to plan on whatever he's trying to do is

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.260 
to plan on whatever he's trying to do is
actually<00:05:20.560> succeeding<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.520> this<00:05:22.120> whole

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
actually succeeding and this whole

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.969 
actually succeeding and this whole
implanting<00:05:22.900> memories<00:05:23.259> into<00:05:23.560> people<00:05:23.919> and

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
implanting memories into people and

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.800 
implanting memories into people and
trying<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.430> essentially<00:05:25.000> brainwash<00:05:25.599> and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
trying to essentially brainwash and

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.149 
trying to essentially brainwash and
maybe<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:26.139> still<00:05:26.379> people<00:05:26.499> with<00:05:26.800> propaganda

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
maybe and still people with propaganda

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.339 
maybe and still people with propaganda
is<00:05:27.669> actually<00:05:28.120> going<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.479> plan<00:05:28.659> a<00:05:28.689> maybe<00:05:29.169> he's

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
is actually going to plan a maybe he's

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.719 
is actually going to plan a maybe he's
going<00:05:29.499> to<00:05:29.560> get<00:05:29.680> we<00:05:29.800> once<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.159> I<00:05:30.189> think<00:05:30.430> this<00:05:30.520> is

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
going to get we once and I think this is

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.100 
going to get we once and I think this is
there<00:05:31.150> definitely<00:05:31.360> something<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:31.900> do<00:05:31.990> with

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
there definitely something to do with

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.719 
there definitely something to do with
how<00:05:32.259> black<00:05:32.529> ops<00:05:32.710> soldiers<00:05:32.889> are<00:05:33.250> crates<00:05:33.550> that's

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
how black ops soldiers are crates that's

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.550 
how black ops soldiers are crates that's
a<00:05:33.849> very<00:05:34.000> distinct<00:05:34.389> thing<00:05:34.569> that<00:05:34.930> right<00:05:35.139> did<00:05:35.349> put

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
a very distinct thing that right did put

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.899 
a very distinct thing that right did put
in<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.770> description<00:05:35.860> of<00:05:36.339> their<00:05:36.520> game<00:05:36.729> and<00:05:36.849> I

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
in the description of their game and I

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.640 
in the description of their game and I
think<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.210> is<00:05:37.360> possibly<00:05:37.719> an<00:05:37.930> earlier<00:05:38.500> on

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
think this is possibly an earlier on

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.230 
think this is possibly an earlier on
procedure<00:05:39.009> and<00:05:39.219> we<00:05:39.310> don't<00:05:39.490> know<00:05:39.580> exactly<00:05:39.699> why

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
procedure and we don't know exactly why

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.730 
procedure and we don't know exactly why
all<00:05:40.689> the<00:05:40.779> imagery<00:05:41.139> we're<00:05:41.289> seeing<00:05:41.500> in<00:05:41.620> these

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
all the imagery we're seeing in these

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.619 
all the imagery we're seeing in these
snapchat<00:05:42.189> appears<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.759> be<00:05:42.879> from<00:05:43.180> a<00:05:43.330> very<00:05:43.569> old

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
snapchat appears to be from a very old

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.200 
snapchat appears to be from a very old
era<00:05:44.199> appears<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.770> be<00:05:44.860> from<00:05:44.979> like<00:05:45.189> the<00:05:45.339> 1950s

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
era appears to be from like the 1950s

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.209 
era appears to be from like the 1950s
40s<00:05:46.719> around<00:05:47.050> that<00:05:47.379> general<00:05:47.860> kind<00:05:48.039> of<00:05:48.099> like<00:05:48.189> a

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
40s around that general kind of like a

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:49.679 
40s around that general kind of like a
few<00:05:48.580> decades<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.300> we<00:05:49.360> don't<00:05:49.539> know<00:05:49.629> exactly

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 
few decades and we don't know exactly

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.659 
few decades and we don't know exactly
why<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.139> imagery<00:05:50.529> is<00:05:50.589> like<00:05:50.740> that<00:05:50.949> we<00:05:51.310> know<00:05:51.490> the

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
why the imagery is like that we know the

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:52.950 
why the imagery is like that we know the
game<00:05:51.849> is<00:05:51.879> set<00:05:52.210> in<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.389> future<00:05:52.569> I<00:05:52.779> think

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
game is set in the future I think

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.269 
game is set in the future I think
there's<00:05:53.110> definitely<00:05:53.139> some<00:05:53.589> flashbacks<00:05:53.889> and

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279 
there's definitely some flashbacks and

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.219 
there's definitely some flashbacks and
maybe<00:05:54.490> this<00:05:54.969> an<00:05:55.149> earlier<00:05:55.509> on<00:05:55.719> kind<00:05:55.960> of<00:05:56.050> version

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
maybe this an earlier on kind of version

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.360 
maybe this an earlier on kind of version
of<00:05:56.500> these<00:05:56.649> experience<00:05:57.039> maybe<00:05:57.159> or<00:05:57.279> something

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
of these experience maybe or something

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.490 
of these experience maybe or something
that<00:05:58.000> was<00:05:58.120> taken<00:05:58.449> from<00:05:58.479> the<00:05:58.689> Nazis<00:05:59.169> often

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
that was taken from the Nazis often

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.929 
that was taken from the Nazis often
Americans<00:05:59.889> beat<00:06:00.069> the<00:06:00.159> Nazis<00:06:00.279> maybe<00:06:00.729> there's<00:06:00.909> a

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:00.939 
Americans beat the Nazis maybe there's a

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:02.369 
Americans beat the Nazis maybe there's a
kind<00:06:01.120> of<00:06:01.180> experiment<00:06:01.629> that<00:06:01.899> the<00:06:01.990> Americans

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
kind of experiment that the Americans

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:03.869 
kind of experiment that the Americans
took<00:06:02.620> from<00:06:02.800> them<00:06:02.949> and<00:06:03.099> kind<00:06:03.159> of<00:06:03.250> developed<00:06:03.699> on

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
took from them and kind of developed on

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.309 
took from them and kind of developed on
it<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.120> kind<00:06:04.270> of<00:06:04.330> maybe<00:06:04.479> something<00:06:04.990> that

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
it and kind of maybe something that

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.079 
it and kind of maybe something that
originated<00:06:05.800> from<00:06:05.919> a<00:06:06.069> Nazi<00:06:06.399> idea<00:06:06.729> after<00:06:07.029> the

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
originated from a Nazi idea after the

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.760 
originated from a Nazi idea after the
Americans<00:06:07.479> defeated<00:06:07.899> them<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.229> that<00:06:08.620> maybe

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
Americans defeated them and that maybe

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.469 
Americans defeated them and that maybe
dr.<00:06:09.009> steam<00:06:09.279> is<00:06:09.430> actually<00:06:09.789> dead<00:06:09.969> and<00:06:10.180> maybe<00:06:10.300> he

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
dr. steam is actually dead and maybe he

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.540 
dr. steam is actually dead and maybe he
was<00:06:10.599> only<00:06:10.719> alive<00:06:11.020> during<00:06:11.289> those<00:06:11.500> 1940s<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.430> he

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
was only alive during those 1940s and he

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.279 
was only alive during those 1940s and he
began<00:06:12.849> the<00:06:13.060> experience<00:06:13.719> maybe<00:06:13.870> there's<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.110> new

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
began the experience maybe there's a new

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.689 
began the experience maybe there's a new
doctor<00:06:14.680> is<00:06:14.800> actually<00:06:15.129> alive<00:06:15.310> in<00:06:15.580> this

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
doctor is actually alive in this

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.339 
doctor is actually alive in this
futuristic<00:06:16.120> setting<00:06:16.449> the<00:06:16.719> current<00:06:17.020> day<00:06:17.169> of

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
futuristic setting the current day of

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.990 
futuristic setting the current day of
black<00:06:17.830> ops<00:06:18.009> 3<00:06:18.159> and<00:06:18.250> he's<00:06:18.339> like<00:06:18.490> looking<00:06:18.849> back

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
black ops 3 and he's like looking back

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.059 
black ops 3 and he's like looking back
on<00:06:19.149> the<00:06:19.300> old<00:06:19.330> recordings<00:06:20.020> and<00:06:20.199> the<00:06:20.319> old<00:06:20.469> like

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
on the old recordings and the old like

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:22.889 
on the old recordings and the old like
audio<00:06:21.430> logs<00:06:21.699> that<00:06:21.819> don't<00:06:22.029> seem<00:06:22.240> was<00:06:22.389> recording

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:22.899 
audio logs that don't seem was recording

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:24.600 
audio logs that don't seem was recording
and<00:06:23.050> perhaps<00:06:23.169> that's<00:06:23.529> the<00:06:23.620> case<00:06:23.800> or<00:06:24.069> maybe<00:06:24.370> dr.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
and perhaps that's the case or maybe dr.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.369 
and perhaps that's the case or maybe dr.
steam<00:06:24.879> is<00:06:25.060> alive<00:06:25.360> now<00:06:25.629> in<00:06:25.839> his<00:06:25.960> current<00:06:26.199> day

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
steam is alive now in his current day

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:27.719 
steam is alive now in his current day
and<00:06:26.500> he's<00:06:26.589> looking<00:06:26.740> back<00:06:27.159> I'm<00:06:27.339> not<00:06:27.430> sure<00:06:27.610> how

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
and he's looking back I'm not sure how

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.010 
and he's looking back I'm not sure how
his<00:06:27.879> voice<00:06:27.909> kind<00:06:28.360> of<00:06:28.389> comes<00:06:28.569> into<00:06:28.779> play<00:06:28.960> so

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
his voice kind of comes into play so

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.929 
his voice kind of comes into play so
I'll<00:06:29.199> see<00:06:29.349> his<00:06:29.500> talking<00:06:29.770> and<00:06:30.099> ever<00:06:30.639> made<00:06:30.759> he's

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:30.939 
I'll see his talking and ever made he's

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:32.490 
I'll see his talking and ever made he's
talking<00:06:31.270> over<00:06:31.569> it<00:06:31.659> or<00:06:31.870> maybe<00:06:32.110> doctor's<00:06:32.469> theme

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
talking over it or maybe doctor's theme

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.990 
talking over it or maybe doctor's theme
is<00:06:32.770> actually<00:06:33.039> still<00:06:33.219> alive<00:06:33.580> maybe<00:06:33.819> he's

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
is actually still alive maybe he's

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.519 
is actually still alive maybe he's
managed<00:06:34.300> to<00:06:34.360> found<00:06:34.750> because<00:06:34.930> he's<00:06:35.110> a<00:06:35.139> doctor

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:35.529 
managed to found because he's a doctor

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.050 
managed to found because he's a doctor
after<00:06:35.620> all<00:06:35.800> maybe<00:06:35.919> it's<00:06:36.159> found<00:06:36.310> a<00:06:36.399> way<00:06:36.519> to<00:06:36.909> live

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
after all maybe it's found a way to live

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.550 
after all maybe it's found a way to live
more<00:06:37.240> than<00:06:37.300> a<00:06:37.449> hundred<00:06:37.750> years<00:06:38.169> because<00:06:38.440> it's

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
more than a hundred years because it's

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.139 
more than a hundred years because it's
definitely<00:06:38.649> a<00:06:38.949> huge<00:06:39.219> time<00:06:39.459> shift<00:06:39.759> in<00:06:39.879> the

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:40.149 
definitely a huge time shift in the

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.180 
definitely a huge time shift in the
settings<00:06:40.509> in<00:06:40.719> when<00:06:40.870> these

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
settings in when these

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.770 
settings in when these
according<00:06:41.520> to<00:06:41.550> taking<00:06:42.180> place<00:06:42.330> and<00:06:42.570> the

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
according to taking place and the

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.120 
according to taking place and the
current<00:06:43.080> day<00:06:43.200> which<00:06:43.380> is<00:06:43.500> black<00:06:43.680> ops<00:06:43.860> which<00:06:44.040> is

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
current day which is black ops which is

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.410 
current day which is black ops which is
probably<00:06:44.370> like<00:06:44.670> like<00:06:44.700> I<00:06:44.880> said<00:06:45.060> in<00:06:45.120> my<00:06:45.150> past

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
probably like like I said in my past

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.050 
probably like like I said in my past
video<00:06:45.660> probably<00:06:46.170> around<00:06:46.260> 20<00:06:46.770> 70<00:06:47.250> or<00:06:47.400> 80<00:06:47.610> around

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
video probably around 20 70 or 80 around

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.490
