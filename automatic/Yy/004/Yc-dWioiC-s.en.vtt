once it's a tough bike the suspensions
great<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:05.570> engines<00:02:05.960> are<00:02:06.110> absolute<00:02:06.590> gem<00:02:06.950> and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
too was the rider modes now you have

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.870 
too was the rider modes now you have
RAID<00:02:12.380> mode<00:02:12.520> dirt<00:02:13.520> mode<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:14.180> rider<00:02:15.020> mode<00:02:15.350> and

RAID mode dirt mode and rider mode and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.270 
RAID mode dirt mode and rider mode and
RAID<00:02:16.880> mode<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:18.560> great<00:02:18.830> for<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.040> lot<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
RAID mode it's great for a lot of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.640 
RAID mode it's great for a lot of
conditions<00:02:19.760> dirt<00:02:20.239> road<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:20.870> makes<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
conditions dirt road just makes it a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.060 
conditions dirt road just makes it a
little<00:02:21.769> bit<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.300> guess<00:02:23.300> are<00:02:23.800> friendlier<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
little bit I guess are friendlier in the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.729 
little bit I guess are friendlier in the
bush<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:25.700> Grider<00:02:26.000> mode<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.510> where<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.739> nearly

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
bush but Grider mode is where I nearly

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.500 
bush but Grider mode is where I nearly
put<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.070> off<00:02:28.250> basically<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.730> was<00:02:29.239> able<00:02:29.360> to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
put this off basically I was able to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.479 
put this off basically I was able to
tailor<00:02:29.810> what<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.110> want<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.500> turn<00:02:30.980> off<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.459> I

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
tailor what I want to turn off what I

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.789 
tailor what I want to turn off what I
want<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.940> increase<00:02:32.870> what<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.140> wanted<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.680> it

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
want to increase what I wanted and it

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.800 
want to increase what I wanted and it
made<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.070> biker<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.640> overall<00:02:35.090> better

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
made the biker and overall better

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.870 
made the biker and overall better
package<00:02:36.200> for<00:02:36.380> me

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.650 

a<00:02:43.730> couple<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.820> other<00:02:44.940> things<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.330> think<00:02:45.360> are

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
pretty important to the prospective

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.770 
pretty important to the prospective
adventure<00:02:49.260> bike<00:02:49.440> owner<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.600> that

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
adventure bike owner and that is that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.600 
adventure bike owner and that is that
this<00:02:51.930> bikes<00:02:52.230> got<00:02:52.380> cruise<00:02:52.650> control<00:02:52.680> standard

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
this bikes got cruise control standard
