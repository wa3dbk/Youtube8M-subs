00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.490
 save money using coupons 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.010
 there are many companies right now that 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.389
 They dedicate to send you coupons for you 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.520
 You can save on purchases in different 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.050
 establishments and there are also many 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.419
 companies that send coupons for their 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.740
 own products that you can use 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.450
 Today I'm going to give you five tips so that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.220
 after using all and saving money 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.349
 do not overspend 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.759
 the first time to subscribe to everything 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.590
 although it is annoying to be receiving 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.329
 post it is very important that you are 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.550
 informed of the offers they have for 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.829
 you then subscribe whenever you 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.960
 always ask someone to tell you so 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.059
 your customers to receive offers in your 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.769
 mail subscribe at the end you can ignore 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.540
 the mails if you see that it is not reaching 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.610
 nothing useful can you block or 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.260
 subscribe is very important that you 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.210
 get to your mail what you want 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.420
 know today or what you want now 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.460
 the second type is to use the coupons only 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.350
 when you need what I mean by 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.000
 this to that many times you receive mails 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.309
 of very interesting things but that you do not 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.949
 you had thought to buy such 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.930
 better you get an email from an offer 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.729
 in a restaurant but you did not think 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.950
 go out to dinner then if you buy it if 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.960
 you use it you will end up spending 200 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.330
 or 300 pesos more than I did not think to take 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.549
 then it is only for what it does not 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.080
 you really need that is for example 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.570
 if you are going to plan if you have already planned 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.710
 a trip you can enter a site like 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.470
 groupon 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.730
 the travel offers have nothing 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.460
 more to find the hotel 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.140
 the third type is to use them only 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.510
 when they cost you less than you already 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 you thought to spend that afternoon this you had 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.710
 thought to take your girlfriend to dinner and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.380
 you thought to spend 200 pesos and you 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 you find a coupon of 350 pesos for one 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 dinner that is much more elaborate is a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.410
 Saving is an offer because that dinner 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.480
 had cost at one for 600 pesos 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.880
 but they are 150 pesos more than you 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.190
 you had budgeted if the purchases did not 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.410
 you are going to save you are going to be 150 pesos 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.720
 more it is very important that only what 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.510
 use when the cost is less than 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.250
 that you already thought to accept the fourth goal 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.620
 is always read terms and conditions 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 because many times these coupons have 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.480
 an expiration date or you can not 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.280
 use certain dates for example if 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.100
 you want to go on a trip to the source 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.010
 of the September isi and you plan to use 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.690
 a group for a hotel that is better in 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.070
 playa del carmen is very important that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.930
 you can see that it can be used in those 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.840
 dates because a lot of the coupons do not 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.430
 can be used on bridges if you buy it 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.990
 and you do not notice then you will have done 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.670
 an expense that is not going to serve you and you're going to 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.130
 having to go and spend again 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 or buying another hotel is very important 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.450
 that you read terms and conditions and the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.730
 fifth and last tip is always print 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.740
 all coupons and always carries 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.140
 with you a trip copy many times not 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.430
 they ask you many times it seems that it is 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.410
 nothing more electronic and you will use it 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.970
 and you do not need anything but there are also 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.140
 places where when you arrive and what 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 they are valid if you do not bring a 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.800
 identification or a copy of your 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.390
 identification and coupon company is very 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.739
 important to wear it is always better 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.030
 make a folder with all your 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.819
 coupons for these to be 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.440
