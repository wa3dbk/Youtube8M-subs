00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.960 
together and as you can see Jess at
things<00:00:43.720> perfectly<00:00:44.720> centered<00:00:45.080> we<00:00:45.890> put<00:00:46.820> some

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
things perfectly centered we put some

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.540 
things perfectly centered we put some
cleanser<00:00:47.510> oil<00:00:48.070> lubricant<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.310> pivot<00:00:49.810> and

lets you see the lock up on it now as
you<00:00:55.850> can<00:00:56.000> see<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.510> lock<00:00:56.750> up<00:00:57.050> is<00:00:57.290> way<00:00:57.710> earlier

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
you can see the lock up is way earlier

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.830 
you can see the lock up is way earlier
than<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.969> was<00:00:59.329> before<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.200> carbonized<00:01:00.680> it

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
than it was before we carbonized it

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.870 
than it was before we carbonized it
before<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:02.870> carbonized<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.950> lock<00:01:04.160> bar<00:01:04.520> was

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
before I carbonized it the lock bar was

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.870 
before I carbonized it the lock bar was
well<00:01:05.660> at<00:01:06.170> fifty<00:01:06.649> percent<00:01:07.009> just<00:01:07.369> actually<00:01:07.820> a

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
well at fifty percent just actually a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.840 
well at fifty percent just actually a
little<00:01:08.060> bit<00:01:08.300> over<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:08.840> fifty<00:01:09.440> percent<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:10.130> so

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
little bit over the fifty percent and so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.960 
little bit over the fifty percent and so
we<00:01:11.030> carbonized<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.770> laid<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.340> good<00:01:13.700> layer

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
we carbonized it and laid a good layer

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.260 
we carbonized it and laid a good layer
of<00:01:14.860> those<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.070> carbide<00:01:16.520> on<00:01:16.700> there<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.000> as<00:01:17.149> you

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
of those the carbide on there and as you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
of those the carbide on there and as you
can<00:01:17.450> see<00:01:17.479> now<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.170> lock<00:01:18.440> bars<00:01:18.799> way<00:01:19.250> earlier

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
can see now the lock bars way earlier

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.530 
can see now the lock bars way earlier
super<00:01:21.290> smooth<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.909> is<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.270> 0550<00:01:24.700> from<00:01:25.700> zero

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
super smooth this is the 0550 from zero

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.020 
super smooth this is the 0550 from zero
tolerance<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:28.040> know<00:01:28.159> I'd<00:01:28.490> never<00:01:28.820> really

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
tolerance and you know I'd never really

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.330 
tolerance and you know I'd never really
handled<00:01:29.630> one<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.900> these<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:30.320> this<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.650> a<00:01:30.680> real

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
handled one of these but this is a real

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.460 
handled one of these but this is a real
