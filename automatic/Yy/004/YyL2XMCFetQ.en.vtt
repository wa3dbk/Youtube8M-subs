00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 greetings to everyone today I do not bring 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 none of my bullshit but one 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 how to download a good game tutorial 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.590
 of the mario franchise that should be 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.530
 played with the dolphin emulator which 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.020
 it's mario party 6 as you can see I have more 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 games although they are few and if they want 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.750
 make a tutorial of some just because 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.750
 ask for melo 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.690
 down in the description he left them some 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.290
 links to download these 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:36.489
 four files mario party 6 part 1 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.280
 part 2 part 3 and part 4 these 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.440
 four files weigh around 570 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.590
 you get little more than half of the game in 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.590
 yes 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.420
 only the last part weighs just 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.420
 almost 2 megabytes and I do not know why that happened xd 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.070
 good to decompress the me 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.809
 I recommend that you create a new folder 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.309
 will move to that folder and there 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.309
 will decompress the files 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.020
 well here are the files and also 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.520
 I recommend decompressing only part 1 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.270
 so that there are no errors 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.430
 decompression the decompression them 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.380
 it will take depending on your computer I 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.800
 I'll cut here so that the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.720
 video well already decompressed them 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.470
 this image remained, it will weigh an 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.470
 giga y medio 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.090
 if they want to in the rare files or 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.090
 if they want conservatives 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.780
 they open the dolphin 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.890
 and they give him in search or as they have it 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 you and there look where they kept the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.920
 image in my case is on the desk 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.200
 in the mp6 folder and there it will appear 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.099
 the game ready to play and spend hours 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.099
 playing xd 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.590
 well that would be the tutorial now a 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.590
 short show that the game works 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.900
 yes i know it is in english but it is not 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.900
 difficult to understand what you should do xd 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.709
 Y 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.230
 one as already got the game goes well 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.230
 I walk without a hint of the xc 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.780
 I repeat if you want me to do tutorials 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.780
 about these games 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.879
 or these games only ask for less than 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.270
 Hare with good taste that's all up 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.170
 next and luck 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.170
