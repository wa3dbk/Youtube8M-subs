00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
gets of exchange activesync so there's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.769 
gets of exchange activesync so there's
lots<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.369> devices<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.750> are

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
lots of devices out there that are

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
lots of devices out there that are
connecting<00:00:28.369> that<00:00:29.369> means<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.730> you're

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
connecting that means if you're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.609 
connecting that means if you're
administering<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.449> exchange<00:00:30.810> server<00:00:31.080> you've

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
administering an exchange server you've

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.020 
administering an exchange server you've
got<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:32.219> concerned<00:00:32.550> about<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.910> these

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
got to be concerned about all these

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.280 
got to be concerned about all these
different<00:00:33.239> things<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.630> connect<00:00:33.960> what

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
different things that connect what

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
different things that connect what
security<00:00:34.680> policies<00:00:35.190> they<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.610> how

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
security policies they have how

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.430 
security policies they have how
protected<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.230> we're<00:00:37.380> adding

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
protected they are and so we're adding

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.670 
protected they are and so we're adding
an<00:00:37.770> allow<00:00:38.160> block<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> quarantine<00:00:39.410> list<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
an allow block and quarantine list and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680 
an allow block and quarantine list and
so<00:00:41.219> you'll<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> able<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> go<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> server

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so you'll be able to go in in the server

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.970 
so you'll be able to go in in the server
and<00:00:42.989> you'll<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.290> able<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.950> way

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
and you'll be able to go all the way

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.590 
and you'll be able to go all the way
from<00:00:44.070> say<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.670> most<00:00:44.910> permissive<00:00:45.270> where

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.699 
how did that all play that so exchange
is<00:02:20.540> really<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.930> first<00:02:21.109> place<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.590> people

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
is really the first place that people

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.289 
is really the first place that people
look<00:02:22.069> when<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.370> think<00:02:22.579> about<00:02:22.640> mobilizing

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
look when they think about mobilizing

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.420 
look when they think about mobilizing
the<00:02:23.569> enterprise<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.439> when<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:24.890> people<00:02:25.219> think

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
the enterprise so when when people think

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.000 
the enterprise so when when people think
about<00:02:25.549> mobilizing<00:02:26.269> critical<00:02:26.900> data<00:02:27.349> with

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
about mobilizing critical data with

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.160 
about mobilizing critical data with
their<00:02:28.129> organization<00:02:28.670> emails<00:02:29.359> number<00:02:29.719> one<00:02:29.900> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
their organization emails number one and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.110 
their organization emails number one and
so<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:30.889> where<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.189> starts<00:02:31.489> because<00:02:31.849> people

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
so that's where it starts because people

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.399 
so that's where it starts because people
will<00:02:32.209> start<00:02:32.480> with<00:02:32.569> exchange<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.260> when<00:02:33.349> you

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
will start with exchange and when you

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.140 
will start with exchange and when you
think<00:02:33.590> about<00:02:33.650> system<00:02:34.400> centers<00:02:34.670> mobile<00:02:34.939> device

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150
