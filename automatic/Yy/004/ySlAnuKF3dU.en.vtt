is I think one of the best programs in
the<00:01:03.430> country<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:04.629> have<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.809> robust<00:01:05.470> laser

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
have for most surgeons stellar clinical

so<00:01:19.690> I<00:01:19.720> think<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:20.770> any<00:01:21.159> high<00:01:21.370> school<00:01:21.430> student

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
so I think that any high school student

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.200 
so I think that any high school student
thinking<00:01:22.390> about<00:01:22.630> doing<00:01:22.930> Navy<00:01:23.290> a<00:01:23.650> navy

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210

graduate medical education program

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.590 
graduate medical education program
should<00:01:26.890> seriously<00:01:27.369> talk<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.880> people<00:01:28.270> who<00:01:28.480> are

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
should seriously talk to people who are

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.940 
should seriously talk to people who are
in<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.870> already

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
in it already

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.710 
in it already
I<00:01:30.010> think<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:31.060> will<00:01:31.180> give<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.540> best

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
I think that that will give you the best

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.690 
I think that that will give you the best
perspective<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.860> looks<00:01:33.160> like<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.400> you're

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
perspective it looks like that you're

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.640 
perspective it looks like that you're
right<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:34.000> looks<00:01:34.150> like<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.420> lymphoma<00:01:34.780> but<00:01:35.140> it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
right it looks like the lymphoma but it

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.680 
right it looks like the lymphoma but it
feels<00:01:35.920> much<00:01:36.190> different<00:01:36.220> it's<00:01:36.640> much<00:01:36.760> softer<00:01:37.090> it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
feels much different it's much softer it

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.440 
feels much different it's much softer it
feels<00:01:37.870> like<00:01:38.020> normal<00:01:38.440> fat<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.970> know<00:01:40.060> are<00:01:40.210> there
