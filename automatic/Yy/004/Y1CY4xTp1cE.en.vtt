 4 and about the rumors and all that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.010
 speculation that is flying to see 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.610
 create a little doubt about the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.890
 respect also 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.560
 favorite are many doubts are on the air 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.970
 that there are many rumors in the rumors 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.460
 that what is most important is that 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.790
 they say it's not called art station 4 that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.740
 it will probably be named 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.970
 playstation orbis you who can not 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.820
 say about this tube starts 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.280
 yeah well for some time now they have been 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.960
 been rumored some things with 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.540
 regarding playstation 4 and with respect 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.660
 to some changes because if we do not come 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.210
 seeing from the beginning of the time of 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.500
 playstation with the prestige or 1 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.420
 we have always had as is uniformity 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.420
 in what has been the control in what 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.610
 It has been the brand and overall everything 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.040
 that has to do with the products 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.460
 playstation as the ayto 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.420
 and other peripherals then also in 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.580
 this generation we saw a change that did not 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.190
 A lot was aware of that but it was 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.910
 the change already called playstation3 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.920
 to be called ps3 the brand and it was and so it 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.050
 he referred are and also to what is the ps 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.390
 vita 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.480
 the site that has 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.980
 reported that today they were revealed 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.840
 many names too that are like 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.210
 key products of the new consoles 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.190
 homemade microsy sony as you know 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.130
 Long Island is not named as an orbital 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.960
 4 says to name a good game a 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.880
 console already with a man 4 is bad 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.280
 I do not know why and in the case of 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.690
 microsoft is durango I explain why 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.540
 They put in not profile 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.690
 has said that playstation 4 will be released 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.220
 the month of November of this year 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.840
 it's still not very good this we are not very 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.370
 ok with ports with the source but sony 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.010
 will release two versions of the console that 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.880
 it's in november 2013 with is having 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.800
 a price of $ 429 or $ 529 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.990
 although it seems the impression has not been 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.210
 confirmed the playstation element of 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.820
 marketing but hopefully tomorrow we 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.240
 clarify all these doubts and good what 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.070
 can you tell me about it disaster 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.690
 Well I do not know the truth is that November 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.340
 it's usually a date it seems to me that we 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.780
 has also taken out in November and 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.250
 obviously for Christmas it would be the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.260
 smarter date to take the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.700
 console and they usually take it out by 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.230
 Christmas not because it's where you shop most 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.300
 they are done and because that is where it ends 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.370
 well let's say let's say in the year nobody 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.410
 it's simpler they also told me 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.670
 it seems they are and said that the console 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.190
 I would be here before the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.500
 microsoft once thing I do not know if 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.210
 believe but yes it is true that now in the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.560
 in the e3 of this summer that we will see 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.390
 I'm sure they're going until two 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.650
 consoles and if they are in the e3 well no 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.330
 It would be unreasonable to think that for 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.610
 Christmas we have them for sale 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.530
 surely it 's pretty sure we're going 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.620
 to make a great this year is going to be 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.850
 what are we going to do at the end of the year 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.380
 they're probably going to launch it as the 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.670
 November of December so that 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.650
 are the little Christmas girls and you 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.870
 they know that children want a gift if 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.320
 they want these fucking kids is good 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.330
 read lesson 4 and in addition to all the 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.370
 rumors we already know waiting for console and 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.110
 his new control redesigned that this is 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.550
 as if it were a tablet this source 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.500
 suggests that we can control the 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.220
 4 provision remotely from 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.989
 our tablet or smartphone 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.000
 use a mobile device to grow 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.400
 with our friends and buy games that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.540
 they have downloaded automatically they are 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.370
 many things and there are innovations that 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.500
 they have the pressure 41 we can know 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.360
 which ones are correct but good 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.250
 leave a little that I talked there was about 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.770
 playstation before ending with this 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.140
 video yes something a news has been 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.750
 a lot of turmoil in recent days has 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.640
 been that supposedly are a source of 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.310
 sound of it are and anonymous 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.430
 obviously it says that the console does not 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.310
 would have re compatibility then that 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.930
 for example in play 3 if I had re 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.730
 compatibility with playstation 2 with 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.280
 playstation 2 game at the beginning to 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.660
 principle but also still what 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 we keep getting on what is the 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.800
 station network to download 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.930
 so I think that 's a bit to 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.820
 lower the price of the console so 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.480
 they do raise the cost of production and 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.280
 all that though it can also be with 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.580
 all this hundred percent of the cloud and all that 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.880
 that they can look for a way to climb 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.919
 those playstation 3 games to the cloud and 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.990
 as to download them from there to 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.280
 have some re compatibility for not 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.520
 have to have that 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.860
 that bluray drive to read 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.720
 the retrocompatibility of games and 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.310
 all that matter 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.050
 if there is a reason in fact they are and had 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.000
 I bought a patent it seems similar 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.010
 stimulates a page of video games 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.150
 online where the bars are distant 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.640
 downloads or any 100 would be a 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.770
 system very similar yes but let's go this 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.170
 as we all know neither microsoft anymore 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.390
 will be left behind 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.920
 microsoft said a very comment 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.780
 funny I do not remember how it goes well 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.090
 torrico that the console that is going to cause 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.280
 more more noise is not the one that causes more 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.900
 noise but causes more impact 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.840
 this saying like we're going to the 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.910
 mother press station but good and 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.800
 we'll see what three gods bring 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.540
 I study everything for today band x is 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.790
 On-screen control as you can see is 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.590
 as if it were tactile and is very curious 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.330
 we have it and it's the final design we're going to 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.950
 multiply things and their products 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.420
 of marketing to make it more 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.920
 accessible to people or 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.170
 people who have therefore look 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.820
 but nothing that's all for today so 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.260
 I'll let you say goodbye to the lords 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.009
