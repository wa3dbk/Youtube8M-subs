playing in second position which is the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.590 
playing in second position which is the
key<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.980> E<00:03:01.130> again<00:03:02.030> we'll<00:03:02.150> be<00:03:02.270> using<00:03:02.420> a

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
key of E again we'll be using a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.320 
key of E again we'll be using a
harmonica<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.770> key<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:05.060> way<00:03:05.150> I've

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
harmonica in the key of a the way I've

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.510 
harmonica in the key of a the way I've
designed<00:03:05.540> these<00:03:05.870> licks<00:03:06.140> first<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.709> will<00:03:07.340> play

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
slowly you're going to be using whole 5

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.710 
slowly you're going to be using whole 5
/<00:04:21.400> blow<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.790> hold<00:04:21.940> for<00:04:22.120> over<00:04:22.300> blow<00:04:22.570> on<00:04:22.690> it

which<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.560> little<00:04:23.800> tricky<00:04:24.100> especially

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
which is a little tricky especially

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.280 
which is a little tricky especially
going<00:04:24.640> down<00:04:24.970> especially<00:04:25.720> when<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.080> get<00:04:26.170> to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
going down especially when you get to

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.770 
going down especially when you get to
the<00:04:26.380> for<00:04:26.590> overflow<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.640> go<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.300> prac<00:04:28.540> sent

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
the for overflow so go and prac sent

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:44.960 
the for overflow so go and prac sent
let's<00:04:28.960> try<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.230> with<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.530> metronome<00:04:31.770> 23<00:04:33.060> for

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:05:28.860 

23<00:05:00.540> 23<00:05:13.740> 23<00:05:16.080> and

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.749 

alright<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.199> now<00:05:30.289> let's<00:05:30.560> listen<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.919> it<00:05:30.949> with

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
alright and now let's listen to it with

00:05:31.759 --> 00:06:04.500 
alright and now let's listen to it with
the<00:05:31.819> music<00:05:34.180> like<00:05:35.180> number<00:05:35.449> nine

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.629 

you

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:17.590 

you

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.660 

you
