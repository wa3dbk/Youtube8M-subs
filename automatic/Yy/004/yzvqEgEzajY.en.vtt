 look as well as it is very well I liked the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.950
 tonight's presentation towards a 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:12.340
 presentation with attitude with ease 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.710
 with the present of life in the song 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.690
 what is your achilles heel you know that 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.390
 that vocal resistance that has to 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.210
 have to keep working because 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.550
 are the falsettes is where the 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.880
 weakness we must continue talking 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.200
 I'm going to give you many thanks 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.380

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.900
 opinion please and thank you adolfo 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.260
 I remember your first presentation and 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:43.270
 see you now the scenario a growth 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:45.280
 incredible that's super good the beginning 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.800
 of the verses were excellent in 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.570
 the perfect nuances but as you already 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.120
 said fernando we have had problems in 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.430
 the falsettos again that makes us 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.660
 back you are very good and I am 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.310
 sure you're going to check the video and you 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.710
 you will find out when they have 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.230
 been the failed ones to improve them hey 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.240
 mari carmen thank you very much now 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.640
 we went to the opinion of Mr. surcharge 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.530
 by Juan Carlos when I saw the reference 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.230
 of this song I thought the problem 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.580
 I was going to do the grades, I'm sincere 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.650
 I thought it was going to be a little bit lower than 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.490
 I was not going to do it but curiously 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.710
 serious idols 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.710
 you had better today actually 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.319
 is where there is where I listen most 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.120
 similar to the voice 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:26.590
 the first falsetto was a little bit wrong 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.569
 from there on from there they were better 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.460
 but already all the last ones are also us 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.539
 have begun to disarm is where the 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.949
 achilles pain takes into account a 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.259
 very important thing they are staying 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.509
 only the best and you have to polish 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.610
 all because we are going to look for any 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.860
 little thing to send them to trend because 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.690
 the others are very good then no 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.580
 let a detail demand 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.039
 sentence very well 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.639
 thank you very much gentleman to 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.639
 take a seat
