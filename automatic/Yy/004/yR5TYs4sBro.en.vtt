00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.230
 if you run through the list of releases on 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.450
 you can easily find the current year right away 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.180
 several projects anyway 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.869
 space-related colonization 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.500
 exploration adventure all things but here 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.250
 the ancestor of all cosmic 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.759
 simulators 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.009
 It is considered to be the elite that has already been released 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.020
 back or dangerous happened 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.660
 really scale so we 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.880
 spent a whole month in it and now 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.120
 ready to say with certainty whether 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.460
 she needs her money right away 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.289
 clarify that though or dangerous 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.480
 and you can assign the status by 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.219
 most characteristic of this genre 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.949
 things look like here 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.679
 are played completely different when first 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.199
 start up just losing your head with and 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.510
 at the request of an incredible amount 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.280
 information and no one for your handle under the sword 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.379
 And we do not drive a marker on the map 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.070
 However, even if you are your life series 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.870
 elites and friends were not in a hurry to inform 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.430
 At first, the apparent complexity is 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.010
 almost the main reason 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.620
 stay in the game for a long time as before 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.230
 global goal alone she is pretty 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.140
 simple and directly derived from the name 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.220
 reach rank and whether you make it possible 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 different ways 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.970
 depends on the choice of profession 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.940
 preferred type of spacecraft 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.860
 and install its improvements right there 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.040
 It should be noted that the chosen profession 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.500
 not assigned once and for all tired 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.690
 be a courier for pennies go to 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 searching for hardcore criminals or 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.080
 straight into the use of steroids to mine 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.850
 minerals 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.400
 and if you want more action 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.800
 become a pirate or smuggler 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.960
 but and if you can not stand congestion 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.180
 people or from childhood dreamed of conquering 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.550
 unexplored departure is a profession 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.200
 Researcher allows you to sell 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.810
 valuable cartographic data for 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.480
 a lot of money you can finally plunge 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.580
 in the wilds of the economic market earning 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.710
 on the difference of supply and demand in different 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.260
 systems anyway thats fully 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.940
 there are classes for every taste and 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.700
 any time you can switch to 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.800
 another kind of activity is really higher 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.470
 Listed things are not uncommon a or 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.760
 touches completely different at least 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.930
 this is an indescribable scale 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.510
 where is the player representing 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.879
 really inconspicuous speck of dust on the background 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.530
 maps of the milky way you can quickly 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.840
 get used to gigantic size 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.209
 space stations but already the first jump 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.489
 in hyperspace is breathtaking 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.010
 what to say about when you start 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.650
 study the galactic map shock 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.549
 guaranteed even powerful enough 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.500
 gaming system 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.110
 barely copes with the smooth 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.120
 scaling we are sure you all 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.859
 heard of frontier endeavors 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.720
 display as much as possible 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.329
 believable map of the milky way 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.519
 confess honestly we tried to find 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.109
 the most little known star of ours 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.959
 galaxy to catch 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.489
 or jerus vain truth diligence 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.709
 developers the same time they play 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.230
 bad service something in the game for sure 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.720
 may not like those who never 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.579
 dealt with the famous series the thing is 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.739
 that despite the obvious conventions in 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.109
 game hyperspace and excess 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.810
 the speed of light the distance between 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.000
 systems the greatest and by virtue of some 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.489
 laws impossible flew near 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.480
 a massive star, and then slow down at 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.639
 the first planet 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.709
 you must either move in orbit or 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.540
 circle around the destination in any 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.780
 case each interstellar flight takes 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.579
 at best from 3 5 minutes but if you 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.430
 will be able to penetrate with relationships 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.980
 the size of your spacecraft and those around 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.079
 astronomical objects then 100 times 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.209
 flights will give pleasure to 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.430
 the same with in- game music 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.199
 and the ability to roll my head in 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.440
 interactive cockpit you start 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.150
 feel like a hero 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.980
 science fiction books 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.959
 indescribable feeling besides your 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.150
 space control motor skills 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.459
 apparatus valued much higher than her 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.799
 the characteristics of the actual tutorial 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.810
 departure sharpened purely for training 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.489
 ability to maneuver and outwit 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.099
 enemy strongly resemble 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.120
 numerous flight simulators and beginners 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.889
 at first it will be really 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.989
 uncomfortable in fights with artificial 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.319
 intelligence is not something that a living person 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.329
 dash tosh there even landing at the station 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.269
 will at first happen very 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.069
 jerky 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.989
 several evenings worth it 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.270
 learn at full speed go on 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.490
 landing or masterfully out 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.620
 enemy fire however in case of fire 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.930
 there is always a contact person 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.419
 more experienced in this regard can be developed 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.550
 almost infinite or d &amp; g rose 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.009
 you can blame maybe not friendliness 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.770
 to an inexperienced player and having several 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.720
 very rare stuff for example in 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.069
 missing any cut-scenes or 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.349
 voice messages 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.300
 sometimes important information is very easy 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.770
 skip the plot as well 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.960
 in portions 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.870
 and how it is supposed to be immense 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.810
 space affects its development you will 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.370
 by the entire galactic community but as 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.909
 for most multiplayer 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.190
 of projects 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.680
 release is no reason to concentrate on 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.810
 other things and 2 getting rid of 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.580
 critical bugs frontier going 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.009
 add more interaction with 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.219
 planets allowing you to collect valuable gas 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.979
 from their atmosphere or d &amp; g rose this by with 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.900
 huge emphasis on the word array for 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.240
 lovers of science fiction and in 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.219
 particular space travel is difficult 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.469
 come up with something more exciting and 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:27.139
 impressively at least until the release 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:31.360
 know man skye and star citizen on it all 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.360
 Good luck and see you on the playground.ru
