skills and star trek online essentially
the<00:00:22.330> way<00:00:22.420> you<00:00:22.480> level<00:00:22.840> up<00:00:22.930> is<00:00:23.110> you<00:00:23.680> start<00:00:23.950> out<00:00:24.160> as

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
the way you level up is you start out as

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.429 
the way you level up is you start out as
a<00:00:24.939> enson<00:00:25.660> and<00:00:27.240> that's<00:00:28.240> just<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.660> tutorial<00:00:29.169> but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
a enson and that's just the tutorial but

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.810 
a enson and that's just the tutorial but
right<00:00:29.890> when<00:00:30.009> you<00:00:30.130> get<00:00:30.279> out<00:00:30.369> of<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.490> tour<00:00:30.669> you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
right when you get out of the tour you

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.210 
right when you get out of the tour you
become<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.119> lieutenant<00:00:31.630> there<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:32.560> essentially

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
become a lieutenant there is essentially

200<00:06:24.619> bridge<00:06:25.219> officers<00:06:25.579> actually<00:06:25.909> have<00:06:26.029> two

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:26.239 
200 bridge officers actually have two

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:28.179 
200 bridge officers actually have two
slots<00:06:26.509> they<00:06:26.689> have<00:06:26.779> a<00:06:26.869> ground<00:06:27.139> and<00:06:27.469> they<00:06:28.039> have<00:06:28.129> a

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:28.189 
slots they have a ground and they have a

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.179 
slots they have a ground and they have a
space<00:06:28.519> so<00:06:29.300> each<00:06:29.629> thing<00:06:29.899> you<00:06:30.619> control<00:06:31.069> the

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
space so each thing you control the

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.459 
space so each thing you control the
space<00:06:31.459> when<00:06:31.669> they<00:06:31.729> get<00:06:31.879> used<00:06:32.119> you<00:06:32.899> can<00:06:33.110> kind<00:06:33.409> of

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:33.469 
space when they get used you can kind of

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:34.569 
space when they get used you can kind of
control<00:06:33.589> them<00:06:33.889> on<00:06:33.979> the<00:06:34.039> ground<00:06:34.249> if<00:06:34.339> you<00:06:34.429> want

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:34.579 
control them on the ground if you want

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:35.859 
control them on the ground if you want
to<00:06:34.639> set<00:06:34.729> that<00:06:34.879> way<00:06:34.999> always<00:06:35.179> they<00:06:35.479> just<00:06:35.719> usually

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:35.869 
to set that way always they just usually

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.589 
to set that way always they just usually
use<00:06:36.199> it<00:06:36.349> whenever<00:06:36.499> as<00:06:36.860> you<00:06:37.550> go<00:06:37.759> on<00:06:37.939> you<00:06:38.389> get

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
use it whenever as you go on you get

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.989 
use it whenever as you go on you get
points<00:06:38.779> for<00:06:39.199> your<00:06:39.949> bridge<00:06:40.339> officers<00:06:40.699> you<00:06:40.789> put

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:40.999 
points for your bridge officers you put

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:42.909 
points for your bridge officers you put
points<00:06:41.149> and<00:06:41.389> stuff<00:06:41.599> all<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.409> space<00:06:42.680> stuff

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
points and stuff all the space stuff

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.249 
points and stuff all the space stuff
usually<00:06:43.159> just<00:06:43.519> reduce<00:06:44.329> the<00:06:44.539> cooldown<00:06:44.719> or

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
usually just reduce the cooldown or

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.020 
usually just reduce the cooldown or
improve<00:06:45.889> the<00:06:46.069> efficiency<00:06:46.339> of<00:06:46.519> it

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
improve the efficiency of it

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.510 
improve the efficiency of it
so<00:06:47.690> it's<00:06:47.870> not<00:06:47.930> too<00:06:48.050> much<00:06:48.770> of<00:06:48.830> a<00:06:48.980> focus<00:06:49.160> in<00:06:49.370> your

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
so it's not too much of a focus in your

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.710 
so it's not too much of a focus in your
bridge<00:06:49.640> officers<00:06:50.030> it's<00:06:50.330> more<00:06:50.540> of<00:06:50.630> a<00:06:50.750> cool<00:06:51.170> down

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
bridge officers it's more of a cool down

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.520 
bridge officers it's more of a cool down
you<00:06:53.720> can<00:06:53.810> also<00:06:53.930> train<00:06:54.290> new<00:06:54.470> abilities<00:06:54.920> are

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530 
you can also train new abilities are

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.320 
you can also train new abilities are
essentially<00:06:57.530> that<00:06:58.130> is<00:06:58.190> how<00:06:58.580> character

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
essentially that is how character

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
essentially that is how character
progression<00:06:59.480> goes<00:07:00.050> and<00:07:00.550> star<00:07:01.550> trek<00:07:01.580> online<00:07:02.350> so

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
progression goes and star trek online so

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.810 
progression goes and star trek online so
for<00:07:03.530> skill<00:07:03.770> points<00:07:04.160> you<00:07:04.310> always<00:07:04.520> be<00:07:04.610> able<00:07:04.760> get

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
for skill points you always be able get

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.400 
for skill points you always be able get
single<00:07:05.060> points<00:07:05.420> bridge<00:07:05.630> jumps<00:07:05.840> points<00:07:06.170> to<00:07:06.290> get

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
single points bridge jumps points to get

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.040 
single points bridge jumps points to get
to<00:07:06.530> 45<00:07:06.940> so<00:07:07.940> essentially<00:07:08.570> that's<00:07:08.630> how<00:07:08.810> it<00:07:08.900> goes

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
to 45 so essentially that's how it goes

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.530 
to 45 so essentially that's how it goes
