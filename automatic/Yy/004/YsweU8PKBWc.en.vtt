00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
actually learned a new move this time

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.570 
actually learned a new move this time
around<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.479> crouch<00:01:12.900> roll<00:01:13.680> attack<00:01:14.100> sort<00:01:14.490> of

but now the backflip has to be charged
and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.490> I've<00:01:17.580> ever<00:01:17.759> seen<00:01:17.970> him<00:01:18.119> do

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and I don't think I've ever seen him do

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.210 
and I don't think I've ever seen him do
the<00:01:18.360> triple<00:01:18.600> jump<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.020> game<00:01:19.080> though<00:01:19.890> most

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the triple jump in this game though most

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
the triple jump in this game though most
of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> resident<00:01:20.729> moves<00:01:20.820> still<00:01:21.240> remain<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
of the resident moves still remain the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
of the resident moves still remain the
goal<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.619> each<00:01:22.770> level<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> flagpole<00:01:23.490> much

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
goal at each level is a flagpole much

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.190 
goal at each level is a flagpole much
like<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> longer<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> Super<00:01:24.720> Mario<00:01:24.900> Brothers

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
completely brand new then you should

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.680 
completely brand new then you should
hold<00:02:45.840> off<00:02:46.050> for<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.860> little<00:02:46.980> while<00:02:47.130> longer

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
hold off for just a little while longer

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.230 
hold off for just a little while longer
but<00:02:48.690> gameplay<00:02:48.900> lets<00:02:49.260> me<00:02:49.440> about<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:50.030> little<00:02:51.030> over

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
but gameplay lets me about a little over
