I think the prescribes like watching
about<00:00:52.220> to<00:00:52.400> Raven<00:00:52.850> like<00:00:53.420> watching<00:00:53.600> about

about to Raven like watching about

but at 13 allegedly he was ready to play
test<00:01:15.020> cricket<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.560> Indian<00:01:15.950> selectors

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
test cricket but the Indian selectors

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.740 
test cricket but the Indian selectors
wouldn't<00:01:16.550> let<00:01:16.640> him<00:01:16.729> do<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:16.850> at<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.119> age<00:01:17.240> of<00:01:17.360> 13

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
wouldn't let him do it at the age of 13

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.980 
wouldn't let him do it at the age of 13
when<00:01:18.229> he<00:01:18.920> first<00:01:19.130> came<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.430> Australia<00:01:19.550> in<00:01:20.030> 1991

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
when he first came to Australia in 1991

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.260 
when he first came to Australia in 1991
he<00:01:25.060> scored<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.149> hundred<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.310> series<00:01:28.759> at

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
he scored a hundred in that series at

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.350 
he scored a hundred in that series at
the<00:01:29.360> age<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.509> about<00:01:29.690> 16<00:01:30.259> or<00:01:30.380> 17<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:31.100> think<00:01:31.940> right

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
the age of about 16 or 17 I think right

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.820 
the age of about 16 or 17 I think right
from<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:32.600> moment<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:33.080> think<00:01:33.140> Australia<00:01:33.470> used

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
from that moment I think Australia used

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.350 
from that moment I think Australia used
in<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.009> v-neck<00:01:34.280> supplier<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:35.060> generally

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
in a v-neck supplier because generally

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.570 
in a v-neck supplier because generally
when<00:01:35.450> Indian<00:01:35.780> players<00:01:36.050> come<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.580> Australia

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
when Indian players come to Australia

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.790 
when Indian players come to Australia
they<00:01:37.700> don't<00:01:37.940> expect<00:01:38.330> Indian<00:01:38.990> pliers<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.560> make

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
they don't expect Indian pliers to make

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.770 
they don't expect Indian pliers to make
hundreds<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.700> Perth<00:01:40.910> they<00:01:41.149> may<00:01:41.300> make<00:01:41.509> them<00:01:41.690> at

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
hundreds of Perth they may make them at

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.749 
hundreds of Perth they may make them at
Sydney<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.590> may<00:01:42.770> make<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.130> madellaine<00:01:43.550> but

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
Sydney and may make the madellaine but

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.100 
Sydney and may make the madellaine but
the<00:01:43.820> wickets<00:01:44.060> are<00:01:44.149> much<00:01:44.300> lower<00:01:44.540> but<00:01:44.750> at<00:01:44.869> Perth

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
the wickets are much lower but at Perth

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.080 
the wickets are much lower but at Perth
where<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.920> ball<00:01:46.100> bounces<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.700> comes<00:01:46.910> on<00:01:47.060> a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
17 to make hammers and he made a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.789 
17 to make hammers and he made a
brilliant<00:01:52.550> over<00:01:52.850> there<00:01:53.530> well<00:01:54.530> here<00:01:54.680> we<00:01:54.770> go

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799

again<00:01:55.040> they<00:01:55.250> say<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.520> wicked<00:01:55.729> I<00:01:55.790> think

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
again they say the wicked I think

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.800 
again they say the wicked I think
they're<00:01:56.150> quite<00:01:56.210> different<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
they're quite different to the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.540 
they're quite different to the
subcontinent<00:01:57.440> in<00:01:57.680> Australia

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.370 

I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:03.460> when<00:02:03.550> he<00:02:03.610> played<00:02:03.760> for<00:02:03.910> Yorkshire<00:02:04.380> six

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
I think when he played for Yorkshire six

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.960 
I think when he played for Yorkshire six
or<00:02:05.470> eight<00:02:05.560> years<00:02:05.590> six<00:02:06.130> or<00:02:06.250> seven<00:02:06.460> years<00:02:06.580> ago<00:02:06.700> he

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
or eight years six or seven years ago he

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.430 
or eight years six or seven years ago he
made<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.270> thousand<00:02:07.630> runs<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:07.960> season<00:02:08.350> and

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
made a thousand runs in that season and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.070 
made a thousand runs in that season and
I<00:02:08.860> think<00:02:09.310> last<00:02:09.640> year<00:02:09.880> as<00:02:09.970> well<00:02:10.090> Ian<00:02:10.720> Healy<00:02:10.840> was

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
I think last year as well Ian Healy was

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.420 
I think last year as well Ian Healy was
saying<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.380> us<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.650> he<00:02:11.770> thought<00:02:11.950> he<00:02:12.160> was<00:02:12.280> just

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
saying to us that he thought he was just

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.220 
saying to us that he thought he was just
a<00:02:12.610> much<00:02:13.120> better<00:02:13.270> on<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.450> sub<00:02:13.690> cop<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.140> he

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
a much better on the sub cop and that he

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
a much better on the sub cop and that he
went<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.440> England<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.770> played<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:15.940> day

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
went to England and played a a one day

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.110 
went to England and played a a one day
there<00:02:16.360> under<00:02:16.630> got<00:02:16.840> 200<00:02:17.170> runs<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:18.640> ball<00:02:18.910> just

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
there under got 200 runs this ball just

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.490 
there under got 200 runs this ball just
shows<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.600> slight<00:02:19.840> difference<00:02:20.170> between<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
shows the slight difference between the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.470 
shows the slight difference between the
two<00:02:20.620> wickets<00:02:21.040> we're<00:02:21.220> talking<00:02:21.490> about<00:02:21.670> some
