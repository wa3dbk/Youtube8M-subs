so<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.609> eb<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.690> mapping<00:00:06.960> tool<00:00:07.379> used<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:07.980> 2d

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
so the eb is a mapping tool used for 2d

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.230 
so the eb is a mapping tool used for 2d
and<00:00:09.090> 3d<00:00:09.120> mapping<00:00:10.160> what<00:00:11.160> we've<00:00:11.370> improved<00:00:11.790> with

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
and 3d mapping what we've improved with

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.509 
and 3d mapping what we've improved with
a<00:00:12.269> platform<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.080> here<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
a platform this here is that we have the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.240 
a platform this here is that we have the
thermal<00:00:15.179> camera<00:00:15.949> compatible<00:00:16.949> with<00:00:17.100> the

meaning<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.779> get<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.019> reflections

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
meaning that we can get the reflections

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
meaning that we can get the reflections
of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.890> crops<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:27.210> look<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.689> disease<00:00:28.199> or

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
of the crops to look for disease or

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.580 
of the crops to look for disease or

complementary<00:01:48.740> money<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:50.390> idea<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.290> have

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
complementary money the idea is to have

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.969 
complementary money the idea is to have
a<00:01:51.560> tool<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.310> will<00:01:52.759> also<00:01:53.050> be<00:01:54.050> associated<00:01:54.440> to

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
a tool that will also be associated to

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.680 
a tool that will also be associated to
the<00:01:55.100> EB<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:56.180> map<00:01:57.700> different<00:01:58.700> kind<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.360> areas

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
the EB to map different kind of areas

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.660 
the EB to map different kind of areas
like<00:02:00.160> bridges<00:02:01.160> or<00:02:01.580> buildings<00:02:02.300> or<00:02:02.660> towers

I'll<00:02:10.920> show<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.640> little<00:02:11.880> bit<00:02:12.120> more<00:02:12.450> what

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
I'll show you a little bit more what

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.020 
I'll show you a little bit more what
we've<00:02:14.220> developed<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.360> exam<00:02:15.810> so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
we've developed for the exam so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.290 
we've developed for the exam so
basically<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:19.410> main<00:02:19.650> goal<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.220> fans<00:02:20.670> life<00:02:20.970> to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
basically the main goal of fans life to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.240 
basically the main goal of fans life to
give<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.660> platform<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:23.010> easy<00:02:23.070> to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
give a platform that is really easy to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.480 
give a platform that is really easy to
use<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.630> main<00:02:24.840> innovation<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.980> exam

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
use so the main innovation with the exam

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.120 
use so the main innovation with the exam
is<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:27.630> not<00:02:27.840> focus<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.770> flying

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
is that you do not focus on the flying

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.180 
is that you do not focus on the flying
anymore<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> results<00:02:31.650> meaning

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
anymore but just on the results meaning

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.660 
anymore but just on the results meaning
that<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:34.110> watch<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.410> screen<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.190> will

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
that if you watch that screen that will

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670 
that if you watch that screen that will
actually<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.420> Canada<00:02:37.020> flight<00:02:37.260> management

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
actually be Canada flight management

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.150 
actually be Canada flight management
software<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.970> you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.050 

tap<00:02:41.850> on<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.510> point<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.900> interest<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.710> will

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
tap on the point of interest you will
