00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
should do is go easy as you notice my
first<00:01:45.090> game<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> while<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> picked<00:01:46.229> q<00:01:46.560> by

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
first game in a while I picked q by

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.999 
first game in a while I picked q by
mistake<00:01:47.780> not<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> bad<00:01:49.170> idea<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
mistake not a bad idea because you can

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
mistake not a bad idea because you can
still<00:01:50.220> harass<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.939> perhaps<00:01:51.119> pretty<00:01:51.509> quickly

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
still harass and perhaps pretty quickly

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.920 
still harass and perhaps pretty quickly
with<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.399> although<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> Atari<00:01:53.909> its<00:01:54.630> weak

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
with it although I Atari its weak

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.380 
with it although I Atari its weak
initially<00:01:55.670> because<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> does<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
initially because what it does is it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
initially because what it does is it
takes<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.899> portion<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.350> your<00:01:58.469> ability<00:01:58.890> power

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
takes a portion of your ability power

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.389 
takes a portion of your ability power
and<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.610> attack<00:01:59.909> power<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:02.009> also<00:02:02.159> slows

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and your attack power and it also slows

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
and your attack power and it also slows
the<00:02:02.820> enemy<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.899> really

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the enemy so it's really it's a really

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.330 
the enemy so it's really it's a really
really<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.770> move

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
really good move

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.809 
really good move

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
through code hmm which really shouldn't

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.309

just saw me do the day with kale is
after<00:03:18.090> i<00:03:18.120> saw<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.420> one<00:03:18.630> minion<00:03:18.870> was<00:03:19.170> low<00:03:19.380> on

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
after i saw the one minion was low on

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.610 
after i saw the one minion was low on
health<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.459> one<00:03:21.239> hit<00:03:21.389> away<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.870> immediately

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
health I one hit away I immediately

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.660 
health I one hit away I immediately
switched<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> next<00:03:23.730> minion<00:03:24.090> because

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
switched to the next minion because

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.190 
switched to the next minion because
you're<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.910> does<00:03:27.120> more<00:03:27.450> damage<00:03:27.480> with<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
you're a does more damage with the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.849 
you're a does more damage with the
direct<00:03:28.560> hit<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.840> splash<00:03:31.230> damage<00:03:31.560> of

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
direct hit then the splash damage of

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.470 
direct hit then the splash damage of
deals<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:34.700> if<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.849> switch<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.359> next

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
deals so if you switch to the next

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.089 
deals so if you switch to the next
minute<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.959> does<00:03:37.109> more<00:03:37.290> damage<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:37.829> next

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
minute it does more damage to that next

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.559 
minute it does more damage to that next
minion<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.609> can<00:03:38.790> essentially<00:03:39.150> farm

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
minion so you can essentially farm

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.550 
minion so you can essentially farm
faster<00:03:40.819> but<00:03:41.819> I<00:03:42.180> don't<00:03:42.450> know<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:43.319> really

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
faster but I don't know it's really

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.490 
faster but I don't know it's really
worth<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:44.160> or<00:03:44.250> not<00:03:44.400> because<00:03:45.410> generally<00:03:46.410> you're

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
worth it or not because generally you're

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.379 
worth it or not because generally you're
not<00:03:46.650> pushing<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.190> ranked<00:03:47.489> games<00:03:47.730> more<00:03:48.180> just

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
not pushing in ranked games more just

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.080 
not pushing in ranked games more just
doing<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.720> last<00:03:48.930> hit<00:03:49.200> farm<00:03:49.709> which<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.849> don't

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
doing the last hit farm which I don't

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.370 
doing the last hit farm which I don't
know<00:03:51.150> what<00:03:51.299> kale<00:03:51.510> it's<00:03:51.720> really<00:03:52.019> annoying<00:03:52.349> to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
know what kale it's really annoying to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.720 
know what kale it's really annoying to
do<00:03:52.910> because<00:03:53.910> she<00:03:54.150> has<00:03:54.269> such<00:03:54.419> a<00:03:54.480> good<00:03:54.690> efore

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.730

hmm Vlad's wedding oh you pushed into

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.710 
hmm Vlad's wedding oh you pushed into

load so get back Carter early I mean

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.270 
load so get back Carter early I mean
that's<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.990> strategy<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.440> wish<00:04:10.620> I'd<00:04:10.770> seen<00:04:11.040> more

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
that's the strategy I wish I'd seen more

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.699 
that's the strategy I wish I'd seen more
in<00:04:11.430> ranked<00:04:11.670> games<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.390> people<00:04:13.140> just<00:04:13.320> pushing

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
in ranked games is people just pushing

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.530 
in ranked games is people just pushing
hard<00:04:14.010> because<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.760> lot<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.030> times<00:04:15.270> you'll<00:04:15.510> see

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
hard because a lot of times you'll see

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.470 
hard because a lot of times you'll see
the<00:04:15.810> one-hit<00:04:16.700> kills<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.060> then<00:04:18.150> they'll<00:04:18.299> just

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
the one-hit kills and then they'll just

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.259 
the one-hit kills and then they'll just
fall<00:04:19.470> back<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:19.920> if<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.160> have<00:04:20.340> pressure<00:04:21.000> on

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
fall back but if you have pressure on

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.150 
fall back but if you have pressure on
them<00:04:21.510> then<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.140> anticipate<00:04:22.650> where<00:04:23.040> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
them then you can anticipate where the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.390 
them then you can anticipate where the
gang<00:04:23.370> from<00:04:24.000> their<00:04:24.180> jungler<00:04:24.450> will<00:04:24.690> come<00:04:25.400> so

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
gang from their jungler will come so

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.340 
gang from their jungler will come so
it's<00:04:26.550> kind<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.880> by<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.420> putting<00:04:27.870> pressure<00:04:28.140> on

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
it's kind of by you putting pressure on

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.409 
it's kind of by you putting pressure on
those<00:04:28.650> people<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.460> can<00:04:29.669> relieve<00:04:30.000> pressure

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
those people you can relieve pressure

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.180 
those people you can relieve pressure
