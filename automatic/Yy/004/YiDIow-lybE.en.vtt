simply the laws of supply and demand in
the<00:00:29.310> sense<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.390> there's<00:00:30.570> demand<00:00:30.869> for

the sense that when there's demand for

the sense that when there's demand for

commodity traders I spoke to last year

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.020 
commodity traders I spoke to last year
told<00:00:39.030> me<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.200> subsidy<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
told me that because of this subsidy and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.750 
told me that because of this subsidy and
because<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.300> mandate<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.770> price<00:00:44.219> for

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
because of this mandate the price for

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.779 
because of this mandate the price for
global<00:00:45.510> grain<00:00:45.780> has<00:00:46.079> skyrocketed<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
global grain has skyrocketed because of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.580 
global grain has skyrocketed because of
speculation<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:48.960> markets<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.469> other

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
speculation in these markets in other

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.830 
speculation in these markets in other
words<00:00:49.800> we're<00:00:49.980> putting<00:00:50.280> tremendous

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
words we're putting tremendous

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.479 
words we're putting tremendous
speculative<00:00:51.840> pressure<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.010> global

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
speculative pressure on the global

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.840 
speculative pressure on the global
futures<00:00:53.940> prices<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.660> grain<00:00:55.440> along<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
futures prices of grain along with the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
futures prices of grain along with the
simple<00:00:57.180> laws<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.570> supply<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.899> demand<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
simple laws of supply and demand and so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.979 
simple laws of supply and demand and so
this<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.010> part<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.820> snow<00:01:00.359> balled<00:01:00.690> into

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
this is part of what as snow balled into

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.860 
this is part of what as snow balled into
these<00:01:01.500> doubling<00:01:02.250> prices<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.629> really

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
these doubling prices that has really

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
these doubling prices that has really
caused<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> world<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.979> much<00:01:05.159> suffering<00:01:05.460> now

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
caused the world so much suffering now

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.410 
caused the world so much suffering now
the<00:01:06.479> hype<00:01:06.810> surrounding<00:01:07.200> ethanol<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the hype surrounding ethanol was that it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
the hype surrounding ethanol was that it
was<00:01:09.600> supposed<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.920> green

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
was supposed to be this this green

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820 
was supposed to be this this green
alternative<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> fossil<00:01:12.540> fuels<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.439> um<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
alternative to fossil fuels but um but

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.399 
alternative to fossil fuels but um but
how<00:01:14.220> environmentally<00:01:14.729> friendly<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.840> ethanol

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
how environmentally friendly is ethanol

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.510 
how environmentally friendly is ethanol
really<00:01:17.840> it's<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.900> disaster<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
really it's a disaster it's a it's a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.850 
really it's a disaster it's a it's a
really<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.180> ridiculous<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.990> almost<00:01:22.229> every

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
really it's ridiculous on almost every

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.090 
really it's ridiculous on almost every
level<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> sense<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.900> using<00:01:24.900> corn<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
level in the sense that using corn to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700 
level in the sense that using corn to
create<00:01:26.520> gasoline<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.320> country

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
create gasoline as we do in this country

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.850 
create gasoline as we do in this country
actually<00:01:29.130> takes<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.970> energy<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.630> make<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
actually takes more energy to make that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.700 
actually takes more energy to make that
gas<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.640> fossil<00:01:33.180> fuel<00:01:33.390> energy<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:34.320> comes

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
gas more fossil fuel energy then comes

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.090 
gas more fossil fuel energy then comes
out<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> global<00:01:37.170> level<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.920> for

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
out of it and on a global level like for

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.649 
out of it and on a global level like for
instance<00:01:38.189> down<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.759> Brazil<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.240> use<00:01:39.390> sugar

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
instance down in Brazil they use sugar

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
instance down in Brazil they use sugar
cane<00:01:39.990> they're<00:01:40.170> getting<00:01:40.439> their<00:01:40.619> ethanol<00:01:41.189> from

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
cane they're getting their ethanol from

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.819 
cane they're getting their ethanol from
sugar<00:01:41.430> well<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.329> say<00:01:42.540> well<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.530> actually

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
sugar well they say well this actually

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
sugar well they say well this actually
is<00:01:44.220> much<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.640> efficient<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.299> may<00:01:45.540> be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
is much more efficient well it may be

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
is much more efficient well it may be
more<00:01:45.869> efficient<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:46.979> does<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> lead

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
more efficient but what does this lead

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.179 
more efficient but what does this lead
to<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.909> leads<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.560> unbelievable<00:01:49.560> clearing<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to it leads to unbelievable clearing of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.120 
to it leads to unbelievable clearing of
the<00:01:50.250> rainforest<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.509> huge<00:01:52.200> emissions<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.890> co2

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the rainforest and huge emissions of co2

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.940 
the rainforest and huge emissions of co2
into<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.210> atmosphere<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.380> course<00:01:55.619> it's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
into the atmosphere and of course it's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.550 
into the atmosphere and of course it's
an<00:01:56.219> environmental<00:01:56.909> disaster<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.689> what<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.469> we

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
an environmental disaster and what do we

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
an environmental disaster and what do we
see<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.829> Africa<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.670> everybody<00:02:00.000> rushing

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
see in Africa we see everybody rushing

see in Africa we see everybody rushing
to<00:02:00.659> another<00:02:01.380> kind<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.890> biofuel<00:02:02.369> crop<00:02:02.610> called

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
to another kind of biofuel crop called

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.539 
to another kind of biofuel crop called
jatropha<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.770> what's<00:02:04.979> happening<00:02:05.040> there

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.789 
jatropha and so what's happening there
we<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.850> political<00:02:06.149> chaos<00:02:06.630> when<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
you're saying that the process of using

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.679 
you're saying that the process of using
these<00:02:17.780> biofuels<00:02:18.500> actually<00:02:19.129> uses<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.480> more

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
these biofuels actually uses but more

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.479 
these biofuels actually uses but more
fossil<00:02:21.230> fuels<00:02:21.500> while<00:02:21.799> we're<00:02:21.980> trying<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.459> use

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
fossil fuels while we're trying to use

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.690 
fossil fuels while we're trying to use
more<00:02:22.879> biofuels<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:24.680> yeah<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.040> an

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
more biofuels it's yeah it's an

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.610 
more biofuels it's yeah it's an
absurdity<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.480> american<00:02:27.049> way<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.319> doing<00:02:27.590> this

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
absurdity the american way of doing this

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
that these problems with ethanol exists

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.580 
that these problems with ethanol exists
why<00:02:46.879> keep<00:02:47.090> using<00:02:47.329> it<00:02:49.000> well<00:02:50.000> there's<00:02:50.959> money<00:02:51.349> in

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
why keep using it well there's money in

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.830 
why keep using it well there's money in
it<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.859> lot<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.430> people<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.849> lot<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.359> blenders

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
decision in favor of biofuel might have

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.890 
decision in favor of biofuel might have
had<00:03:00.379> something<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.859> do<00:03:01.040> with<00:03:01.760> voters<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.420> Iowa

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
ethanol from corn in the gas in this

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.390 
ethanol from corn in the gas in this
country<00:03:18.109> and<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.379> course<00:03:18.590> there<00:03:18.739> are<00:03:18.889> tariffs

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
country and of course there are tariffs

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.809 
country and of course there are tariffs
up<00:03:19.930> not<00:03:20.930> letting<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:22.099> ethanol<00:03:22.519> from

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
up not letting in that ethanol from

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.330 
up not letting in that ethanol from
other<00:03:23.090> countries<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:25.069> some<00:03:25.310> ways

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
other countries here and so in some ways

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.689 
other countries here and so in some ways
politically<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.629> financially<00:03:27.139> it's<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.459> win

whole<00:04:02.480> notion<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.199> bio<00:04:03.379> fuel<00:04:03.829> subsidy

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
whole notion of the bio fuel subsidy

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.009 
whole notion of the bio fuel subsidy
that<00:04:04.849> what<00:04:05.120> we've<00:04:05.239> been<00:04:05.419> seeing<00:04:05.690> are<00:04:05.930> these

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
that what we've been seeing are these

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.259 
that what we've been seeing are these
bizarrely<00:04:06.799> strange<00:04:07.280> bedfellows<00:04:07.970> which<00:04:08.150> is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
ridiculous it's driving up the cost of

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.820 
ridiculous it's driving up the cost of
our<00:04:22.729> basic<00:04:23.180> ingredients<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:23.930> not<00:04:24.289> allowing

for<00:04:26.190> global<00:04:27.190> grain<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.729> it's<00:04:28.180> been<00:04:28.330> a

for global grain and it's been a

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.150 
for global grain and it's been a
disaster<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.139> so<00:04:29.259> now<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.680> those<00:04:29.800> subsidies

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
disaster and so now that those subsidies

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.339 
disaster and so now that those subsidies
have<00:04:30.460> been<00:04:30.580> taken<00:04:30.910> away<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.930> United<00:04:32.199> States

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
the gas tank well you know this seems to

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.270 
the gas tank well you know this seems to
be<00:04:37.780> yet<00:04:38.020> another<00:04:38.050> example<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.979> some<00:04:39.129> of<00:04:39.220> the

be yet another example of some of the
outrage<00:04:39.610> we've<00:04:39.819> seen<00:04:40.060> recently<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.720> corporate

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
outrage we've seen recently of corporate

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.610 
outrage we've seen recently of corporate
influence<00:04:41.789> in<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:43.210> government<00:04:43.690> what<00:04:44.349> will<00:04:44.470> it

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
influence in the government what will it

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.129 
influence in the government what will it
take<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.860> reverse<00:04:45.340> this<00:04:45.610> trend<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:46.659> eliminate

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
take to reverse this trend to eliminate

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.670 
take to reverse this trend to eliminate
the<00:04:47.259> use<00:04:47.349> of<00:04:47.409> biofuels<00:04:48.960> well<00:04:49.960> like<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.349> say<00:04:50.500> it's

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the use of biofuels well like I say it's

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.559 
the use of biofuels well like I say it's
a<00:04:50.770> growing<00:04:51.009> trend<00:04:51.340> it's<00:04:51.639> not<00:04:51.789> just<00:04:52.060> America

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
a growing trend it's not just America

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.540 
a growing trend it's not just America
it's<00:04:52.750> all<00:04:53.020> over<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.349> world<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:54.009> Chinese<00:04:54.520> are

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
it's all over the world the Chinese are

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.790 
it's all over the world the Chinese are
using<00:04:55.389> cassava<00:04:56.110> all<00:04:56.319> the<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.430> crushes<00:04:57.970> of

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
using cassava all the the crushes of

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.290 
using cassava all the the crushes of
oils<00:04:59.800> that<00:04:59.949> come<00:05:00.159> from<00:05:00.280> vegetables<00:05:00.759> are<00:05:00.909> being

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
oils that come from vegetables are being

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.839 
oils that come from vegetables are being
deployed<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.560> really<00:05:02.860> at<00:05:03.130> this<00:05:03.280> point<00:05:03.669> I

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
deployed and so really at this point I

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.330 
deployed and so really at this point I
think<00:05:04.240> what<00:05:04.389> is<00:05:04.509> really<00:05:04.750> needed<00:05:04.960> is<00:05:05.340> new

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
think what is really needed is new

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.520 
think what is really needed is new
technology<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:07.090> what<00:05:07.449> we<00:05:07.569> see<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.470> very

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
technology and what we see is is very

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.680 
technology and what we see is is very
promising<00:05:08.949> technology<00:05:09.759> also<00:05:10.060> although<00:05:10.330> still

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
promising technology also although still

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.570 
promising technology also although still
in<00:05:10.810> an<00:05:10.900> early<00:05:10.990> stage<00:05:11.139> with<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:12.130> all<00:05:12.280> things

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
in an early stage with of all things

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.260 
in an early stage with of all things
algae<00:05:13.479> from<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.110> from<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.650> sea<00:05:14.889> and<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:15.849> maybe

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
algae from the from the sea and so maybe

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.270 
algae from the from the sea and so maybe
this<00:05:16.509> is<00:05:16.659> going<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.990> give<00:05:17.110> us<00:05:17.259> some<00:05:17.710> way<00:05:17.919> some

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
this is going to give us some way some

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.730 
this is going to give us some way some
other<00:05:18.520> Avenue<00:05:19.120> other<00:05:19.419> than<00:05:19.990> this<00:05:20.199> ridiculous

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
other Avenue other than this ridiculous

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.290 
other Avenue other than this ridiculous
