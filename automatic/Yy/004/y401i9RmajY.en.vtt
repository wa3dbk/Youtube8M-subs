underneath<00:05:20.910> that<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.180> rather<00:05:21.780> like<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.430> so

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
that the coil tap let's have a little

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.780 

see<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:38.870> tone<00:05:39.050> is<00:05:39.199> quite<00:05:39.410> quite<00:05:40.010> similar<00:05:40.490> but

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
see the tone is quite quite similar but

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:53.100 
see the tone is quite quite similar but
the<00:05:41.240> Power<00:05:42.080> has<00:05:42.350> been<00:05:42.530> racked<00:05:42.830> back

the<00:05:54.110> quill<00:05:54.499> tap<00:05:54.800> taps<00:05:55.159> both<00:05:55.460> pickups<00:05:55.879> at<00:05:56.120> once

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
the quill tap taps both pickups at once

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.239 
the quill tap taps both pickups at once
so<00:05:56.599> a<00:05:56.629> flick<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.229> the<00:05:57.259> neck<00:05:57.560> pickup<00:05:57.979> that's

00:05:58.239 --> 00:05:58.249 
so a flick to the neck pickup that's

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:03.790 
so a flick to the neck pickup that's
tapped<00:05:58.610> also

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.580 

and<00:06:04.310> then<00:06:05.210> of<00:06:05.330> course<00:06:05.360> in<00:06:06.319> the<00:06:06.440> middle

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
and then of course in the middle

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:16.689 
and then of course in the middle
position<00:06:12.940> perhaps<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:15.220> best<00:06:16.220> use<00:06:16.430> of<00:06:16.460> this

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
position perhaps the best use of this
