we'll go ahead and move on then to

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.709 
we'll go ahead and move on then to
actually<00:00:47.309> first<00:00:47.610> taking<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> off<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.329> bike

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
actually first taking it off the bike

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.560 
actually first taking it off the bike
and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.010> will<00:00:50.190> move<00:00:50.399> towards<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
and then we will move towards the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.740 
and then we will move towards the
mounting<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> first<00:00:54.360> thing<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
mounting of this so the first thing the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.420 
mounting of this so the first thing the
instructions<00:00:55.230> tell<00:00:55.469> us<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> remove

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
instructions tell us to do is to remove

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.479 
instructions tell us to do is to remove
the<00:00:56.670> four<00:00:56.910> screws<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.920> put<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> windshield

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the four screws that put the windshield

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.680 
the four screws that put the windshield
on<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> we'll<00:01:01.109> start<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.420> once<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.570> get

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
on so we'll start with that once we get

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
on so we'll start with that once we get
those<00:01:03.930> off<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.769> start<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> work<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
those off then we start to work on the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.980 
those off then we start to work on the
bracket<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:08.330> generally<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
bracket so generally that's how this is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.070 
bracket so generally that's how this is
going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> work<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.510> we've<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
going to work so now that we've got the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
going to work so now that we've got the
screws<00:01:13.409> loose<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.159> ahead<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.549> remove

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
screws loose we can go ahead and remove

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.679 
screws loose we can go ahead and remove
the<00:01:15.030> windshield<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.100> there's<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.180> young<00:01:18.390> hot

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the windshield and there's the young hot

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.620 
the windshield and there's the young hot
stock<00:01:19.020> windshield<00:01:19.590> free<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> ready<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
stock windshield free and ready for the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.670 
stock windshield free and ready for the
bracket<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.229> mounted

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.040 

so<00:01:27.220> as<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.400> can<00:01:27.520> see<00:01:27.670> here's<00:01:28.000> one<00:01:28.870> of<00:01:28.960> the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
so as you can see here's one of the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.600 
so as you can see here's one of the
brackets<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:29.710> happens<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.220> be<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.430> right

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
brackets this happens to be the right

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.660 
brackets this happens to be the right
side<00:01:30.850> bracket<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.590> what<00:01:33.130> we'll<00:01:33.280> do<00:01:33.430> is<00:01:33.520> go

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
side bracket and what we'll do is go

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.930 
side bracket and what we'll do is go
ahead<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:33.970> attach<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.660> then<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.380> bike

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
ahead and attach this then to the bike

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.090 
ahead and attach this then to the bike
it<00:01:36.940> goes<00:01:37.210> back<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.990> standard<00:01:38.590> Yamaha

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
it goes back to the standard Yamaha

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.420 
it goes back to the standard Yamaha
mount<00:01:39.700> in<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.900> upper<00:01:41.260> position<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:42.310> just

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
mount in the upper position so it's just

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.520 
mount in the upper position so it's just
a<00:01:42.610> matter<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:43.030> screwing<00:01:43.540> these<00:01:43.690> in<00:01:49.290> same<00:01:50.290> type

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
a matter of screwing these in same type

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.380 
a matter of screwing these in same type
of<00:01:50.560> bracket<00:01:51.130> again<00:01:51.190> this<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.730> for<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.180> left

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
of bracket again this is for the left

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.520 
of bracket again this is for the left
side<00:01:52.980> so<00:01:53.980> again<00:01:54.010> very<00:01:54.340> very<00:01:54.670> simple<00:01:55.360> comes<00:01:56.320> in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
side so again very very simple comes in

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.870 
side so again very very simple comes in
the<00:01:56.710> high<00:01:56.890> mounts<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.920> Yamaha<00:01:59.920> windshield

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the high mounts of the Yamaha windshield

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880 
the high mounts of the Yamaha windshield
bracket<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.570> all<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.960> takes<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.380> order<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.650> do

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
bracket is all it takes in order to do

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.950 
bracket is all it takes in order to do
this<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.110> fairly<00:02:05.380> simple<00:02:06.960> quick

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
this so it's a fairly simple quick

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.080 
this so it's a fairly simple quick
operation<00:02:14.190> I'm<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.610> go<00:02:15.730> ahead<00:02:15.820> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
operation I'm now going to go ahead and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.480 
operation I'm now going to go ahead and
do<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.840> crossbar<00:02:17.380> mount<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.830> comes<00:02:18.010> with<00:02:18.310> it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
do the crossbar mount that comes with it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.030 
do the crossbar mount that comes with it
this<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.750> mount<00:02:19.870> gps's<00:02:20.560> or<00:02:20.890> other

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
this is so you can mount gps's or other

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.860 
this is so you can mount gps's or other
items<00:02:21.490> that<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.700> might<00:02:22.000> like<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.270> do<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
items that you might like to do on the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.200 
items that you might like to do on the
bike<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.070> pretty<00:02:24.280> straightforward<00:02:24.670> it's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
bike this is pretty straightforward it's

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.660 
bike this is pretty straightforward it's
just<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.570> simple<00:02:25.930> bar<00:02:26.140> it's<00:02:26.770> got<00:02:26.950> two<00:02:27.250> screws<00:02:27.640> on

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
just a simple bar it's got two screws on

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.290 
just a simple bar it's got two screws on
either<00:02:28.030> side<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.530> will<00:02:29.530> go<00:02:29.710> on<00:02:29.920> as<00:02:30.880> well<00:02:31.150> as

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
either side that will go on as well as

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.000 
either side that will go on as well as
they<00:02:31.450> even<00:02:31.720> send<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.350> allen<00:02:32.709> wrench<00:02:32.739> that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
they even send you the allen wrench that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.830 
they even send you the allen wrench that
is<00:02:33.280> required<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.850> order<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.090> put<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.510> so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
is required in order to put it on so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.300 
is required in order to put it on so
we'll<00:02:34.959> go<00:02:35.110> ahead<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.440> mount<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.950> very

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
we'll go ahead and mount that very

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.940 
we'll go ahead and mount that very
quickly<00:02:36.640> it's<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.450> very<00:02:37.660> simple<00:02:38.110> process<00:02:38.380> very

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
quickly it's a very simple process very

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.390 
quickly it's a very simple process very
straightforward<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:39.880> slides<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.510> and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
straightforward it just slides in and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.330 
straightforward it just slides in and
put<00:02:42.400> them<00:02:42.550> out<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:44.290> really<00:02:44.739> about<00:02:45.010> as

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
put them out on so it's really about as

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.650 
put them out on so it's really about as
simple<00:02:45.730> as<00:02:45.850> can<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.239> in<00:02:47.170> terms<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.100> doing<00:02:48.280> this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
simple as can be in terms of doing this

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.210 
simple as can be in terms of doing this
the<00:02:49.660> challenge<00:02:50.080> with<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.980> fact

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the challenge with it is just the fact

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.460 
the challenge with it is just the fact
that<00:02:51.340> you've<00:02:51.520> only<00:02:51.700> got<00:02:51.910> one<00:02:52.120> hand<00:02:52.420> put<00:02:53.260> that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
that you've only got one hand put that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.810 
that you've only got one hand put that
on<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.920> tighten<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.310> down<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.280> we've<00:02:57.430> got<00:02:57.459> that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
on and tighten it down so we've got that

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.070 
on and tighten it down so we've got that
side<00:02:58.180> tight<00:02:59.190> and<00:03:00.190> then<00:03:01.060> we've<00:03:01.239> got<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.750> side

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
side tight and then we've got this side

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.760 
side tight and then we've got this side
in<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:04.290> very<00:03:05.290> close<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.890> tight<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.989> it's<00:03:08.500> now

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
in and very close to tight so it's now

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.860 
in and very close to tight so it's now
in<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.070> tight<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> next<00:03:10.420> piece<00:03:10.600> is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
in and tight so the next piece is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.040 
in and tight so the next piece is
actually<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:12.390> reinstall<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.600> windshield

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
actually to reinstall the windshield

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.220 
actually to reinstall the windshield
itself<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:16.150> windshield<00:03:16.540> itself<00:03:16.930> will<00:03:17.110> get

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
itself the windshield itself will get

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.060 
itself the windshield itself will get
reinstalled<00:03:17.830> using<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.400> same<00:03:19.830> brackets<00:03:20.830> that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
reinstalled using the same brackets that

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.050 
reinstalled using the same brackets that
came<00:03:21.459> with<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.880> bike<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:24.010> hold<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.580> up<00:03:24.760> here

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
came with the bike so hold it up here

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.340 
came with the bike so hold it up here
and<00:03:26.880> try<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.910> get<00:03:28.150> these<00:03:28.330> two<00:03:28.660> screws<00:03:29.050> back

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
and try to get these two screws back

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.820 
and try to get these two screws back
into<00:03:29.769> place<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.720> one<00:03:32.080> size<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:33.150> also<00:03:34.150> you

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
into place so one size in also you

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.860 
into place so one size in also you
type<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.190> up<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.430> little<00:03:35.610> bit<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.210> then<00:03:36.690> we'll

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
type it up a little bit and then we'll

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.370 
type it up a little bit and then we'll
work<00:03:37.050> on<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.350> other<00:03:37.380> side<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.690> tighten<00:03:43.290> these

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
work on the other side so tighten these

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.310 
work on the other side so tighten these
down<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.710> little<00:03:44.040> bit<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.870> looks<00:03:45.960> like

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
down a little bit and it looks like

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.080 
down a little bit and it looks like
we're<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.560> about<00:03:46.920> done<00:03:46.980> it's<00:03:47.550> like<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.880> only

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
we're just about done it's like the only

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.620 
we're just about done it's like the only
piece<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.330> we<00:03:48.630> need<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.020> now<00:03:50.330> means<00:03:51.330> going

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
piece that we need to do now means going

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.630 
piece that we need to do now means going
to<00:03:51.780> be<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.970> go<00:03:53.970> ahead<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.920> type<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.040> all<00:03:56.160> up<00:03:56.400> and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
to be to go ahead and type it all up and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.850 
to be to go ahead and type it all up and
adjust<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.450> make<00:03:57.600> sure<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:57.990> fits<00:03:58.560> and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
adjust it to make sure it's fits and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.970 
adjust it to make sure it's fits and
take<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.160> out<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.310> write<00:03:59.550> it<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.440> we<00:04:01.800> have

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
take it out and write it so that we have

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.650 
take it out and write it so that we have
the<00:04:02.160> bracket<00:04:02.580> tightened<00:04:02.970> down<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.150> install

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
the bracket tightened down and install

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.200 
the bracket tightened down and install
like<00:04:03.960> everything<00:04:04.410> set<00:04:04.920> for<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.490> mounting

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
piece in terms of tightening down how it

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.030 
piece in terms of tightening down how it
can<00:04:09.510> sit<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:09.960> can<00:04:10.140> see<00:04:10.290> from<00:04:10.560> here<00:04:10.800> here's

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
can sit so you can see from here here's

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.180 
can sit so you can see from here here's
the<00:04:11.100> lowest<00:04:12.090> portion<00:04:12.860> tilted<00:04:13.860> all<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.100> way

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
the lowest portion tilted all the way

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.460 
the lowest portion tilted all the way
back<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.670> lowest<00:04:15.030> portion<00:04:15.270> give<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.380> an

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470

back at the lowest portion give you an
idea<00:04:16.560> let's<00:04:17.010> come<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.609> way<00:04:17.760> up<00:04:17.880> that's

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
idea let's come all the way up that's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.380 
idea let's come all the way up that's
how<00:04:18.959> high<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.230> can<00:04:19.470> come<00:04:19.680> now<00:04:19.890> there's<00:04:20.700> fully

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
how high it can come now there's fully

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.120 
how high it can come now there's fully
forward

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
forward

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.470 
forward

the camera so again from a side view
perspective<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.070> can<00:04:35.220> see<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.610> amount<00:04:35.910> of

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
perspective you can see the amount of

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.390 
perspective you can see the amount of
movement<00:04:37.140> that<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.470> can<00:04:37.680> put<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:37.980> this<00:04:38.130> thing

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
movement that you can put in this thing

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.290 
movement that you can put in this thing
forward<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.419> back<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.790> bring<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.150> all<00:04:42.270> the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
forward to back and we bring it all the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.540 
forward to back and we bring it all the
way<00:04:42.419> down<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.169> can<00:04:43.350> see<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.740> significant

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
way down so you can see that significant

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.850 
way down so you can see that significant
amount<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:44.850> movement<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.360> can<00:04:45.480> be<00:04:45.630> done<00:04:45.860> with

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
amount of movement that can be done with

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.580 
amount of movement that can be done with
this<00:04:47.100> thing<00:04:47.460> forward<00:04:49.820> back<00:04:50.820> up<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.990> down<00:04:52.169> so

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
this thing forward back up and down so

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.730 
this thing forward back up and down so
it's<00:04:53.310> going<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.520> have<00:04:53.730> an<00:04:53.910> infant<00:04:54.270> amount<00:04:54.540> of

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
it's going to have an infant amount of

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.540 
it's going to have an infant amount of
adjustments<00:04:55.740> compared<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.100> what<00:04:56.220> I've<00:04:56.340> got

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
adjustments compared to what I've got

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.190 
adjustments compared to what I've got
now<00:04:56.760> so<00:04:57.060> I'll<00:04:57.300> have<00:04:57.480> to<00:04:57.630> go<00:04:57.720> out<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:57.930> write<00:04:58.050> it

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
now so I'll have to go out and write it

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.260 
now so I'll have to go out and write it
down<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.470> see<00:04:58.620> how<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.890> works<00:04:59.100> but<00:04:59.430> going<00:05:00.210> to

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
down and see how it works but going to

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.730 
down and see how it works but going to
be<00:05:00.330> significantly<00:05:00.840> better<00:05:00.930> than<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.350> has<00:05:01.500> been

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
be significantly better than it has been

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.340 
be significantly better than it has been
in<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.950> stock<00:05:02.190> position<00:05:02.340> I'm<00:05:02.790> sure<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:07.110> here's
