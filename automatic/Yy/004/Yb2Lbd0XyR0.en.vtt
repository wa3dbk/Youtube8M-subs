youngest uh and I have been keeping up
with<00:00:49.409> her<00:00:49.499> since<00:00:49.859> but<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.999> of<00:00:51.659> late<00:00:51.899> possibly

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
with her since but as of late possibly

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.579

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
within the last year or so just kind of

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.290 
within the last year or so just kind of
drifted<00:00:55.589> away<00:00:55.679> from<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.579> went<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
drifted away from it because I went to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540 
drifted away from it because I went to
school<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.510> graphic<00:00:57.749> design<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.550> totaling

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
school for graphic design and totaling

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.379 
school for graphic design and totaling
as<00:00:59.909> I<00:01:00.659> used<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.019> isn't<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.940> doesn't<00:01:03.210> fit

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:03.389 
as I used to isn't like it doesn't fit

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.830 
as I used to isn't like it doesn't fit
well<00:01:03.539> into<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.680> car<00:01:04.890> design<00:01:05.190> part<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.840> um

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
well into the car design part but um

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.180 
well into the car design part but um
that's<00:01:07.229> late<00:01:07.560> I've<00:01:07.740> been<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
that's late I've been kind of

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.440 
that's late I've been kind of
illustrating<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.759> lot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.030> stuff<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
illustrating a lot of stuff like kind of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.600 
illustrating a lot of stuff like kind of
doing<00:01:12.450> things<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> cartoon<00:01:14.009> characters

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
doing things with the cartoon characters

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.359 
doing things with the cartoon characters
and<00:01:14.640> other<00:01:15.329> things<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:16.100> serious<00:01:17.100> drawing

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and other things like serious drawing

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
and other things like serious drawing
sometimes<00:01:18.000> portraits<00:01:18.540> something<00:01:18.899> like<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
sometimes portraits something like that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.870 
sometimes portraits something like that
but<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.520> um<00:01:21.049> off<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.289> subject

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
but up on that um off of that subject

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.090 
but up on that um off of that subject
what<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.030> will<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.280> do<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.799> continue<00:01:28.799> d

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
what I will have to do now is continue d

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.139 
what I will have to do now is continue d
social<00:01:29.490> drunk<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.360> explain<00:01:31.289> myself

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
social drunk and then explain myself

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.660 
social drunk and then explain myself
because<00:01:33.149> my<00:01:33.180> drawing<00:01:34.109> style<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.890> kind<00:01:35.430> of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
because my drawing style is kind of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.690 
because my drawing style is kind of
simple<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> same<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.490> still

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
simple but at the same time it still

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.039 
simple but at the same time it still
kind<00:01:38.969> of<00:01:39.030> shows<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:41.189> shows<00:01:41.399> I<00:01:41.549> start<00:01:41.789> off

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
kind of shows up it shows I start off

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.300 
kind of shows up it shows I start off
pretty<00:01:43.049> detailed<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.159> go

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
pretty detailed but then I just go

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
pretty detailed but then I just go
backwards<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.539> just<00:01:45.600> fill

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
backwards from there because I just fill

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.919 
backwards from there because I just fill
out<00:01:46.079> either<00:01:46.289> use<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.680> silhouette<00:01:47.039> technique<00:01:47.929> to

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
out either use a silhouette technique to

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.590 
out either use a silhouette technique to
get<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> shape<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:50.270> position<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
get the shape in a position of the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.410 
get the shape in a position of the
character<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:52.109> whatever<00:01:52.409> i'm<00:01:52.530> drawing<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
character or whatever i'm drawing and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.050 
character or whatever i'm drawing and
then<00:01:54.420> i<00:01:55.049> use<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:55.979> pretty<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.429> the<00:01:56.549> base<00:01:56.729> or

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
then i use it as pretty much the base or

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.660 
then i use it as pretty much the base or
the<00:01:57.359> line<00:01:57.539> drawings<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.960> put<00:01:58.109> on<00:01:58.170> top<00:01:58.289> of<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
the line drawings I put on top of it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.739 
the line drawings I put on top of it
it's<00:01:59.670> kind<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.020> kind<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> backwards<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:01.740> uh<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
it's kind of kind of a backwards my uh a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:08.389 
it's kind of kind of a backwards my uh a
backwards<00:02:03.749> step<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:06.229> if<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
backwards step so if if you want to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.999 
backwards step so if if you want to
follow<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.729> could<00:02:08.850> try<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.960> I<00:02:10.259> possibly

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
follow you could try it and I possibly

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.160 
follow you could try it and I possibly
do<00:02:11.130> some<00:02:11.280> tutorials<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.210> things<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.110> that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
do some tutorials and things like that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.630 
do some tutorials and things like that
but<00:02:14.330> yeah<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.680> reason<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.220> don't<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.489> too

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
but yeah so the reason I don't do too

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.350 
but yeah so the reason I don't do too
much<00:02:17.760> detail

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
much detail

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.130 
much detail
is<00:02:18.660> because<00:02:19.700> for<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.880> had<00:02:21.270> planned<00:02:21.960> on

is because for one I had planned on

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.980 
is because for one I had planned on

kind of awkward to do because he has a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.190 
kind of awkward to do because he has a
lot<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.459> texture<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.420> lot<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.600> detail<00:03:25.170> in

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
lot of texture and a lot of detail in

his<00:03:25.410> face<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.860> on<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> plush<00:03:26.940> animal<00:03:27.680> they

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
his face and on a plush animal they

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.100 
his face and on a plush animal they
usually<00:03:28.980> don't<00:03:29.070> have<00:03:29.250> any<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.880> just<00:03:30.540> eyes

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
usually don't have any like just eyes

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.130 
usually don't have any like just eyes
mouth<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.239> barely<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> nose<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.810> ever<00:03:33.930> see

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
mouth and barely a nose if you ever see

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.400 
mouth and barely a nose if you ever see
it<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.840> getting<00:03:36.840> all<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.080> detail<00:03:37.380> was

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
it and so getting all that detail was

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.979 
it and so getting all that detail was
just<00:03:37.709> kind<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.920> rough<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.900> something<00:03:39.900> that

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
just kind of rough so something that

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.949 
just kind of rough so something that
just<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:41.040> worked<00:03:41.370> out<00:03:41.489> at<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.090> beginning<00:03:42.269> as

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
just it worked out at the beginning as

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.080 
just it worked out at the beginning as
yourself<00:03:43.430> what<00:03:44.430> I'm<00:03:44.519> doing<00:03:44.670> right<00:03:44.730> now<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
yourself what I'm doing right now in the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.690 
yourself what I'm doing right now in the
video<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.480> cross<00:03:45.959> hatching<00:03:46.320> that's<00:03:47.130> usually

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
video is cross hatching that's usually

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.120 
video is cross hatching that's usually
my<00:03:47.850> favorite<00:03:48.209> way<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.360> add<00:03:49.200> shading<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.799> detail

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
my favorite way to add shading in detail

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.090 
my favorite way to add shading in detail
but<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.820> tend<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.019> not<00:03:52.320> do<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.590> sometimes

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
but I tend to not do it sometimes

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.300 
but I tend to not do it sometimes
because<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:54.120> becomes<00:03:54.810> fairly<00:03:55.530> busy<00:03:55.890> looking

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
because it becomes fairly busy looking

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.080 
because it becomes fairly busy looking
but<00:03:56.549> it's<00:03:57.230> it's<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.980> toss-up<00:03:59.430> between<00:03:59.610> either

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
but it's it's a toss-up between either

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.479 
but it's it's a toss-up between either
leaving<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.540> out<00:04:00.630> put<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.170> if<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:02.220> deems<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
leaving it out put it in if it deems a

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.530 
leaving it out put it in if it deems a
little<00:04:02.640> bit<00:04:02.730> more<00:04:02.850> weight<00:04:03.000> if<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.269> seems<00:04:03.450> like

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
little bit more weight if it seems like

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.990 
little bit more weight if it seems like
it's<00:04:03.840> just<00:04:04.200> like<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.739> line<00:04:05.070> drawing<00:04:05.370> i<00:04:05.580> did<00:04:05.610> i<00:04:05.910> do

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
it's just like a line drawing i did i do

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.860 
it's just like a line drawing i did i do
add<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:07.049> that's<00:04:07.980> something<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.430> i<00:04:08.940> do

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
add it so that's something that i do

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.350 
add it so that's something that i do
tend<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.170> do<00:04:10.350> this<00:04:10.410> but<00:04:10.620> um<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.030> pretty

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
tend to do this but um it's a pretty

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.699 
tend to do this but um it's a pretty
interesting<00:04:12.660> style<00:04:13.579> it<00:04:14.579> for<00:04:15.120> drawings<00:04:15.510> with<00:04:15.660> a

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
interesting style it for drawings with a

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.469 
interesting style it for drawings with a
like<00:04:16.709> complete<00:04:17.400> cross<00:04:17.820> edgings<00:04:18.209> are

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
like complete cross edgings are

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.009 
like complete cross edgings are
beautiful<00:04:19.350> but<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:21.120> can<00:04:21.570> be<00:04:21.750> kind<00:04:21.900> of

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
beautiful but it can be kind of

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.380 
beautiful but it can be kind of
overwhelming<00:04:22.229> sometimes<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.300> tend<00:04:24.300> to

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
overwhelming sometimes so I tend to

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.740 
overwhelming sometimes so I tend to
stray<00:04:24.630> away<00:04:24.660> from<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:25.169> but<00:04:26.599> and<00:04:27.599> the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
stray away from it but and the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.000 
stray away from it but and the
background<00:04:28.140> that's<00:04:28.410> another<00:04:28.650> thing<00:04:28.830> I

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
background that's another thing I

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.330 
background that's another thing I
usually<00:04:29.520> try<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.760> avoid<00:04:30.150> getting

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
usually try to avoid getting

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.220 
usually try to avoid getting
detailed<00:04:31.760> in<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.060> my<00:04:32.180> backgrounds<00:04:32.690> because<00:04:32.810> it

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
detailed in is my backgrounds because it

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.200 
detailed in is my backgrounds because it
will<00:04:33.350> draw<00:04:33.500> away<00:04:33.650> from<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:34.040> actual<00:04:34.210> character

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
will draw away from the actual character

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.610 
will draw away from the actual character
that's<00:04:35.419> being<00:04:35.900> drawn<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:36.949> I<00:04:37.960> mean<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.350> fits

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
that's being drawn and I mean it fits

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.409 
that's being drawn and I mean it fits
fits<00:04:39.889> in<00:04:40.100> like<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.639> first<00:04:40.850> video<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.210> had<00:04:41.389> I

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
fits in like on the first video I had I

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.520 
fits in like on the first video I had I
had<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.750> ribbon<00:04:42.320> in<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.830> clouds<00:04:43.479> with<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.530> i

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
had a ribbon in the clouds with a i

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.500 
had a ribbon in the clouds with a i
think<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.250> was<00:04:46.310> once<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.940> photo<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.360> i

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
think it was once a photo that i

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.780 
think it was once a photo that i
duplicate<00:04:48.139> in<00:04:48.260> flipped<00:04:48.530> pretty<00:04:49.280> obvious<00:04:49.580> but

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
duplicate in flipped pretty obvious but

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.750 
duplicate in flipped pretty obvious but
um<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.750> kind<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:51.020> just<00:04:51.199> became<00:04:51.560> too<00:04:52.460> strong<00:04:52.729> of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
um it kind of just became too strong of

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.400 
um it kind of just became too strong of
an<00:04:52.970> image<00:04:53.210> because<00:04:53.630> i<00:04:53.660> didn't<00:04:53.930> have<00:04:54.050> written

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
an image because i didn't have written

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.530 
an image because i didn't have written
it<00:04:54.620> as<00:04:54.650> filled<00:04:55.100> in<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:56.060> background<00:04:56.389> was

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
it as filled in and the background was

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.409 
it as filled in and the background was
full<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.290> i<00:04:57.610> just<00:04:58.610> pulled<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:58.940> out<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.060> left<00:04:59.240> it

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
full so i just pulled it out and left it

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.810 
full so i just pulled it out and left it
blank<00:04:59.540> and<00:05:00.490> a<00:05:01.490> lot<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.240> times<00:05:02.510> um<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:03.550> used<00:05:04.550> mask

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
blank and a lot of times um I used mask

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.790 
blank and a lot of times um I used mask
a<00:05:05.090> lot<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.510> in<00:05:05.630> Photoshop<00:05:06.080> this<00:05:06.290> is<00:05:06.470> actually

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
a lot and in Photoshop this is actually

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.900 
a lot and in Photoshop this is actually

computer<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.470> random<00:05:18.650> they<00:05:18.830> get<00:05:18.950> a

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
computer and this random they get a

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.969 
computer and this random they get a
virus<00:05:19.190> burnt<00:05:19.520> like<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:19.880> so<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.780> had<00:05:21.320> three<00:05:21.680> on

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
virus burnt like that so I had three on

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.590 
virus burnt like that so I had three on
the<00:05:22.220> disk<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.700> ahead<00:05:22.910> and<00:05:23.060> use<00:05:23.150> on<00:05:23.330> any<00:05:23.450> other

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
the disk and ahead and use on any other

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.190 
the disk and ahead and use on any other
computer<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:25.039> was<00:05:25.190> legit<00:05:25.780> let's<00:05:26.780> hope

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
computer so it was legit let's hope

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.490 
computer so it was legit let's hope
hopefully<00:05:27.830> my<00:05:28.270> money<00:05:29.270> situation<00:05:29.500> improves

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.610 
little more fun in the more freedom with
the<00:05:34.490> designs<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.270> drawings<00:05:35.600> but<00:05:36.229> yeah<00:05:36.410> as<00:05:36.530> I

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
the designs and drawings but yeah as I

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.990 
the designs and drawings but yeah as I
was<00:05:36.650> saying<00:05:36.919> before<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.340> drawings<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:37.970> the

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
was saying before the drawings and the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.370 
was saying before the drawings and the
ideas<00:05:38.389> just<00:05:38.539> come<00:05:38.630> out<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:38.840> nowhere<00:05:38.930> and<00:05:39.200> I

just toying around with a bunch of

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.159 
just toying around with a bunch of
random<00:05:51.200> features<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:53.120> just<00:05:53.570> tore<00:05:53.900> my<00:05:54.050> with
