 Tell if 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:37.830
 That in Bethlehem for so long ago, 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.610
 Almost two thousand years, less or more, 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.610
 The Love of God once again was present 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.350
 For, it is said: 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.350
 That a beautiful star suddenly hovered in the air, 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.430
 Like it came just to light up 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.430
 With divine and resplendent light. 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.519
 The beautiful event that happened there 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.519
 The birth of Jesus, the great savior, 

00:01:51.519 --> 00:02:00.519
 That in this moment of Heaven came down 

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:08.519
 In order to save the sinner. 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:19.610
 This is a true story. 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:29.610
 That the whole humanity does not get tired of telling, 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:39.610
 And we who understand accurately 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:54.610
 Your reason for being we are celebrating. 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.949
 And it is said: 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.949
 In the sky angels, stars, martial songs. 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:36.949
 On Earth only nature and nobody else 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:46.949
 They witnessed the great event. 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.690
 And then there is 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.690
 That the prince of life came to Earth, yes, 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:08.439
 In a simplicity that had no end, 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:18.439
 Bring to the sufferer the great breath. 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:28.190
 Bring also the seed 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:38.190
 Of love, of good, of peace, of faith, of heavenly life. 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 And he came as a brave prince 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 Who leaves the throne and goes to war to fight evil, 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.709
 And this beautiful true story. 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.709

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:24.709
