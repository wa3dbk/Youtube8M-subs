hi this video is about involute of a
Pentagon

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
Pentagon

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.249 
Pentagon
so<00:00:05.009> here<00:00:05.310> before<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.730> go<00:00:06.029> on<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.390> figure<00:00:06.690> let

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
so here before I go on this figure let

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.310 
so here before I go on this figure let
me<00:00:07.410> run<00:00:07.620> small<00:00:07.980> video<00:00:08.189> clip<00:00:08.510> so<00:00:09.510> here<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.139> have

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
me run small video clip so here I have

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.009 
me run small video clip so here I have
called<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.130> video<00:00:11.429> clip<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.660> one

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
called this video clip I have one

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.079 
called this video clip I have one
Pentagon<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:13.920> there<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.429> string<00:00:14.730> attached

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
Pentagon here there is a string attached

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.800 
Pentagon here there is a string attached
to<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.440> am<00:00:16.760> tracing<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.970> end<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to it and I am tracing this end of the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.740 
to it and I am tracing this end of the
string<00:00:19.080> while<00:00:19.920> I'm<00:00:20.130> unwinding<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.180> okay<00:00:21.510> so

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
string while I'm unwinding it okay so

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:31.390 
string while I'm unwinding it okay so
that<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.490> involute<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.029> Pentagon

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.680 

okay<00:00:31.970> so<00:00:32.739> see<00:00:33.739> they<00:00:33.920> let<00:00:34.160> me<00:00:34.370> pause<00:00:34.670> here<00:00:34.700> is

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
okay so see they let me pause here is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.060 
okay so see they let me pause here is
some<00:00:36.050> invalid<00:00:36.590> of<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:36.920> pentagon<00:00:37.520> is<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:38.210> trace

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
some invalid of a pentagon is a trace

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.280 
some invalid of a pentagon is a trace
which<00:00:40.070> end<00:00:40.370> of<00:00:40.730> string<00:00:41.059> will<00:00:41.239> make<00:00:41.480> while<00:00:42.020> we

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
which end of string will make while we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.630 
which end of string will make while we
are<00:00:42.410> unwinding<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:43.430> okay<00:00:44.239> now<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:45.860> draw<00:00:46.129> I<00:00:46.280> am

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
are unwinding it okay now to draw I am

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.430 
are unwinding it okay now to draw I am
showing<00:00:47.059> I<00:00:47.270> am<00:00:47.449> going<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.809> show<00:00:48.019> you<00:00:48.080> how<00:00:48.379> you

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
showing I am going to show you how you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.030 
showing I am going to show you how you
can<00:00:48.860> do<00:00:49.250> in<00:00:49.489> engineering<00:00:49.730> drawing<00:00:50.390> here<00:00:51.040> so

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
can do in engineering drawing here so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.850 
can do in engineering drawing here so
the<00:00:53.000> first<00:00:53.300> step<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:53.600> are<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.440> draw<00:00:54.650> this

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
the first step here are you draw this

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.759 
the first step here are you draw this
Pentagon<00:00:55.430> here<00:00:55.760> okay<00:00:56.629> that's<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.019> first<00:00:57.290> step

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
Pentagon here okay that's the first step

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.509 
Pentagon here okay that's the first step
second<00:00:58.280> thing<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:59.089> draw<00:00:59.750> this<00:01:00.290> p<00:01:00.620> 0<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.070> P<00:01:01.100> Phi

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
second thing you draw this p 0 to P Phi

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.939 
second thing you draw this p 0 to P Phi
line<00:01:01.730> which<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:02.989> perimeter<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.710> this

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
line which is the perimeter of this

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.170 
line which is the perimeter of this
Pentagon<00:01:04.519> here<00:01:04.820> each<00:01:05.750> side<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.229> 30<00:01:06.470> mm<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.580> p<00:01:07.850> 0

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
Pentagon here each side is 30 mm so p 0

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.850 
Pentagon here each side is 30 mm so p 0
to<00:01:08.420> P<00:01:08.450> 5<00:01:08.930> will<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.500> 150<00:01:10.190> mm<00:01:11.290> third<00:01:12.290> thing<00:01:12.619> you

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
to P 5 will be 150 mm third thing you

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.630 
to P 5 will be 150 mm third thing you
draw<00:01:13.159> is<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:13.729> this<00:01:14.450> line<00:01:14.780> here<00:01:15.280> let<00:01:16.280> me<00:01:16.430> open

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
draw is that this line here let me open

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.789 
draw is that this line here let me open
one<00:01:16.970> tool<00:01:17.210> here<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:18.500> will<00:01:18.830> call<00:01:20.409> size<00:01:21.409> and

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
one tool here that will call size and

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.030 
one tool here that will call size and
position<00:01:22.280> window<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:22.820> tells<00:01:23.150> me<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.040> length

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
position window it tells me the length

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.230 
position window it tells me the length
of<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:26.090> line<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.439> line<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:27.770> 30<00:01:28.159> mm<00:01:28.369> so

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
of this line so this line is 30 mm so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.690 
of this line so this line is 30 mm so
then<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.630> third<00:01:29.869> step<00:01:30.170> then<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:31.280> am<00:01:31.340> going<00:01:31.580> to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
then the third step then I am going to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.050 
then the third step then I am going to
draw<00:01:31.939> this<00:01:32.180> line<00:01:32.450> here<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:32.979> length<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.220> 60<00:01:34.820> mm

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
draw this line here this length is 60 mm

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.410 
draw this line here this length is 60 mm
a<00:01:35.299> step<00:01:36.290> number<00:01:36.470> 5<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.340> draw<00:01:37.550> this<00:01:37.790> line<00:01:38.150> and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
a step number 5 you draw this line and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.010 
a step number 5 you draw this line and
the<00:01:39.050> point<00:01:39.230> number<00:01:39.530> 3<00:01:39.830> its<00:01:40.280> length<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.270> 90<00:01:41.780> mm

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
the point number 3 its length is 90 mm

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.940 
the point number 3 its length is 90 mm
and<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:43.460> draw<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:43.910> line<00:01:44.500> at<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.710> point

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and you draw this line at the point

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.360 
and you draw this line at the point
number<00:01:46.250> 4<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.730> 90<00:01:47.180> 120<00:01:47.659> mm<00:01:48.170> once<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.190> have

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
number 4 is 90 120 mm once you have

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
number 4 is 90 120 mm once you have
these<00:01:49.580> two<00:01:49.820> lines<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.480> in<00:01:50.930> 3<00:01:51.560> 4<00:01:52.070> 5<00:01:52.550> &amp;<00:01:52.820> 6
