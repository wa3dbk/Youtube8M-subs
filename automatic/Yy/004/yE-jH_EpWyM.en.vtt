00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
rocket shape to it it's very similar to

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.180 
rocket shape to it it's very similar to
the<00:01:05.729> covergirl<00:01:06.090> LashBlast<00:01:06.840> mascara<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.650> the

the covergirl LashBlast mascara and the
bristles<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:08.880> pretty<00:01:09.299> short<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.810> like

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
bristles are also pretty short just like

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.660 
bristles are also pretty short just like
the<00:01:10.140> lash<00:01:10.320> blast<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> lash

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the lash blast so if you like the lash

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
the lash blast so if you like the lash
blast<00:01:12.030> brush<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.870> you're<00:01:12.990> definitely<00:01:13.200> going

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
blast brush then you're definitely going

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.380 
blast brush then you're definitely going
to<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.100> mess<00:01:14.370> here<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.090> similar

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to like this mess here it's very similar

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
to like this mess here it's very similar
to<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.680> those<00:01:16.890> rubbery

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to that it kind of has those rubbery

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.180 
to that it kind of has those rubbery
spiky<00:01:17.700> bristles<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> big<00:01:18.810> fat<00:01:19.110> wand<00:01:19.500> but

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
spiky bristles and that big fat wand but

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.280 
spiky bristles and that big fat wand but
the<00:01:20.430> only<00:01:20.610> bad<00:01:20.760> thing<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.600> bristles<00:01:22.080> are

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the only bad thing is the bristles are

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.960 
the only bad thing is the bristles are
pretty<00:01:22.530> small<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> end<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.820> it's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
pretty small there at the end so it's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
pretty small there at the end so it's
kind<00:01:24.120> of<00:01:24.150> hard<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> catch<00:01:24.660> little<00:01:24.990> baby<00:01:25.170> lashes

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
kind of hard to catch little baby lashes

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
kind of hard to catch little baby lashes
so<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> formulation<00:01:26.730> of<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.030> mascara<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
so the formulation of this mascara is

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.170 
so the formulation of this mascara is
definitely<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> wet<00:01:28.590> mascara<00:01:29.190> from<00:01:29.550> me<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:29.790> like

definitely a wet mascara from me I like

covergirl clump crusher mascara which i

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.680 
covergirl clump crusher mascara which i
was<00:01:44.040> using<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.370> a<00:01:44.490> lot<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.820> videos<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.360> i

really<00:01:45.960> liked<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.380> wand<00:01:46.650> on<00:01:46.980> it<00:01:47.160> but<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.370> was

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
really liked the wand on it but it was

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.430 
really liked the wand on it but it was
just<00:01:47.520> too<00:01:47.760> dry<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.510> formula<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.260> have

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
just too dry of a formula if you have

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.960 
just too dry of a formula if you have
seen<00:01:49.650> my<00:01:49.770> other<00:01:49.800> tutorials<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> stuff<00:01:50.760> you'll

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
seen my other tutorials and stuff you'll
see<00:01:51.150> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> how<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> applied<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.260> just

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
see kind of how it applied it just

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
see kind of how it applied it just
didn't<00:01:53.190> get<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.370> all<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> way<00:01:53.790> through<00:01:54.060> my

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
didn't get it all the way through my

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
didn't get it all the way through my
lashes<00:01:54.480> but<00:01:54.900> if<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.320> very<00:01:55.620> short<00:01:55.980> sparse

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
lashes but if you have very short sparse

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
lashes but if you have very short sparse
lashes<00:01:56.970> then<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> dryer<00:01:58.080> formula<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.680> course

lashes then a dryer formula of course
it's<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> work<00:01:59.370> better<00:01:59.580> because<00:01:59.820> it's

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
it's going to work better because it's

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.240 
it's going to work better because it's
not<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.330> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.840> make<00:02:01.140> them<00:02:01.320> all<00:02:01.530> stick

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
not just going to make them all stick

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.940 
not just going to make them all stick
together<00:02:02.400> it's<00:02:02.910> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.500> work<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.680> little<00:02:04.830> bit

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
together it's going to work a little bit

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
together it's going to work a little bit
better<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.580> very<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.240> sparse

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
better if you have very like sparse

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.680 
better if you have very like sparse
really<00:02:07.530> short<00:02:07.860> lashes<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.269> me<00:02:09.390> i<00:02:09.420> like

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
really short lashes but for me i like

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.180 
really short lashes but for me i like
more<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.050> wet<00:02:10.200> mascara<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.769> kind<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:10.979> comb

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
more of a wet mascara to kind of comb

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.339 
more of a wet mascara to kind of comb
all<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.519> way<00:02:11.610> through<00:02:11.879> them<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.269> this<00:02:13.140> one

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
all the way through them and this one

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.930 
all the way through them and this one
just<00:02:13.500> works<00:02:13.709> perfectly<00:02:14.159> for<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.819> you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
just works perfectly for that so as you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.729 
just works perfectly for that so as you
can<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> demo<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.019> applies<00:02:16.290> really

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
can see in the demo it applies really

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.740 
can see in the demo it applies really
nicely<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.430> little<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.910> no<00:02:17.940> clumps<00:02:18.450> at<00:02:18.569> all

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
nicely I have little to no clumps at all

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.690 
nicely I have little to no clumps at all
the<00:02:19.319> only<00:02:19.530> time<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.980> see<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> little<00:02:20.490> bit<00:02:20.640> of

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the only time that I see a little bit of

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.430 
the only time that I see a little bit of
clumps<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.510> go<00:02:21.690> back<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.050> this

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
clumps is if I go back in with this

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.900 
clumps is if I go back in with this
I<00:02:22.470> can't<00:02:22.680> code<00:02:22.860> after<00:02:23.100> I've<00:02:23.340> let<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> first

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I can't code after I've let the first

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.790 
I can't code after I've let the first
one<00:02:24.150> dry<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.500> apply<00:02:25.740> two

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
one dry so if you like to apply two

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.470 
one dry so if you like to apply two
coats<00:02:25.980> which<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.550> actually<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.060> did<00:02:27.300> today

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
coats which is actually what I did today

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.090 
coats which is actually what I did today
make<00:02:28.050> sure<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.440> keep<00:02:28.680> coming<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
make sure you just keep coming it

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.500 
make sure you just keep coming it
through<00:02:29.280> your<00:02:29.370> lashes<00:02:29.580> without<00:02:29.910> letting<00:02:30.360> them

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
through your lashes without letting them

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.330 
through your lashes without letting them
dry<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.020> won't<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.380> clumpy<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.980> even<00:02:32.280> if

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
dry so it won't get clumpy and even if

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.440 
dry so it won't get clumpy and even if
you<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.580> weight<00:02:32.760> forward<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.090> dry<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.300> little

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
you do weight forward to dry a little

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.060 
you do weight forward to dry a little
bit<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.870> doesn't<00:02:34.140> get<00:02:34.230> very<00:02:34.290> clumpy<00:02:34.770> at<00:02:34.830> all<00:02:34.950> as

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
bit it doesn't get very clumpy at all as

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.830 
bit it doesn't get very clumpy at all as
you<00:02:35.190> can<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:36.000> see<00:02:36.240> maybe<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.570> little

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
you can see you can see maybe a little

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.750 
you can see you can see maybe a little
bit<00:02:37.080> really<00:02:37.530> close<00:02:37.740> up<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.160> from<00:02:38.340> far<00:02:38.580> back

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
bit really close up but from far back

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.850 
bit really close up but from far back
you<00:02:38.910> don't<00:02:39.030> really<00:02:39.300> see<00:02:39.510> any<00:02:39.660> at<00:02:39.810> all<00:02:40.020> that's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you don't really see any at all that's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.380 
you don't really see any at all that's
what<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.070> really<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.490> about<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.180> just

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
what I really like about it and I just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.270 
what I really like about it and I just
love<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> separation<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.470> gives<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:44.070> for

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
love the separation it gives because for

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.430 
love the separation it gives because for
my<00:02:44.400> lashes<00:02:44.700> they<00:02:45.420> are<00:02:45.570> not<00:02:45.720> super<00:02:45.990> long<00:02:46.110> but

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
my lashes they are not super long but

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.230 
my lashes they are not super long but
they're<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:46.620> super<00:02:46.890> short<00:02:47.310> either<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.000> just

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
they're not super short either so just

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.480 
they're not super short either so just
more<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.930> linkedin<00:02:49.320> separated<00:02:49.890> look<00:02:50.040> looks

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
more of a linkedin separated look looks

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.010 
more of a linkedin separated look looks
best<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.940> them<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.450> feel<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.900> really

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
best on them and I feel like it really

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.260 
best on them and I feel like it really
separates<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.830> well<00:02:53.070> without<00:02:53.700> clumping<00:02:54.000> or

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
separates them well without clumping or

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.090 
separates them well without clumping or
anything<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.470> makes<00:02:55.710> them<00:02:55.890> like

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
anything and it just makes them like

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.910 
anything and it just makes them like
evenly<00:02:56.520> spaced<00:02:56.820> if<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.150> makes<00:02:57.390> any<00:02:57.480> sense

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
evenly spaced if that makes any sense

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.590 
evenly spaced if that makes any sense
the<00:02:58.920> one<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.400> not<00:02:59.550> too<00:02:59.850> big<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.210> doesn't<00:03:00.510> really

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the one is not too big it doesn't really

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.210 
the one is not too big it doesn't really
make<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.990> hard<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> apply<00:03:01.560> or<00:03:01.680> anything<00:03:02.100> I'm

make it hard to apply or anything I'm
pretty<00:03:02.430> much<00:03:02.490> used<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:03.900> a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
pretty much used to it it can be a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.360 
pretty much used to it it can be a
little<00:03:04.080> bit<00:03:04.290> difficult<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.890> get<00:03:05.040> into<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
little bit difficult to get into the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.980 
little bit difficult to get into the
inner<00:03:05.490> corners<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.300> only<00:03:06.480> problem<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
inner corners of the only problem that I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.140 
inner corners of the only problem that I
have<00:03:07.200> with<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.770> wish<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.370> mascaras<00:03:08.910> came

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940 
have with it I wish all mascaras came
with<00:03:09.330> like<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.600> spiky<00:03:09.960> ball<00:03:10.140> at<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.410> end<00:03:10.590> like

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
with like the spiky ball at the end like

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.220 
with like the spiky ball at the end like
my<00:03:11.190> Revlon<00:03:11.610> 3d<00:03:12.000> volume<00:03:12.390> mascara<00:03:12.570> which<00:03:13.080> is

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
my Revlon 3d volume mascara which is

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.960 
my Revlon 3d volume mascara which is
probably<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.710> my<00:03:13.800> all-time<00:03:14.010> favorite<00:03:14.610> but

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
probably one of my all-time favorite but

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.970 
probably one of my all-time favorite but
that<00:03:15.120> mascara<00:03:15.450> smudges<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.260> bad<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.770> so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
that mascara smudges really bad and so

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.350 
that mascara smudges really bad and so
it<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.460> kind<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.670> hard<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.940> wear<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.210> in<00:03:18.300> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
it can be kind of hard to wear it in the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.240 
it can be kind of hard to wear it in the
summer<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.690> stuff<00:03:19.110> if<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.620> get<00:03:19.770> sweaty<00:03:20.070> and

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
summer and stuff if you get sweaty and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.160 
summer and stuff if you get sweaty and
that<00:03:20.400> sort<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.700> thing<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.750> can<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:21.960> pretty

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
that sort of thing and it can be pretty

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.320 
that sort of thing and it can be pretty
annoying<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.890> have<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.310> constantly<00:03:24.060> wipe

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
annoying to have to like constantly wipe

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.479 
annoying to have to like constantly wipe
it<00:03:24.510> off<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.870> stuff<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.770> mascara<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.340> have

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.220 
it off and stuff so this mascara I have
not<00:03:26.700> noticed<00:03:27.030> any<00:03:27.180> smudging<00:03:27.780> with<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.080> all

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
not noticed any smudging with it all

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.199 
not noticed any smudging with it all
it's<00:03:28.620> held<00:03:28.860> up<00:03:29.010> really<00:03:29.250> well<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.760> it's

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
it's held up really well and it's

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.910 
it's held up really well and it's
actually<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.630> little<00:03:30.840> bit<00:03:31.080> harder<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.440> get<00:03:31.709> off

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
actually a little bit harder to get off

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.010 
actually a little bit harder to get off
then<00:03:32.280> my<00:03:32.459> Revlon<00:03:32.850> 3d<00:03:33.270> volume<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
then my Revlon 3d volume and the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.830 
then my Revlon 3d volume and the
covergirl<00:03:34.320> clump<00:03:34.620> crusher<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.880> have<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.390> let<00:03:36.570> my

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
covergirl clump crusher I have to let my

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.510 
covergirl clump crusher I have to let my
makeup<00:03:37.260> wipe<00:03:37.440> still<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.130> bit<00:03:38.370> longer

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
makeup wipe still in a little bit longer

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.770 
makeup wipe still in a little bit longer
which<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.940> good<00:03:39.120> because<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.330> lasts<00:03:39.750> longer

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
which is good because it lasts longer

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.080 
which is good because it lasts longer
and<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.560> doesn't<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.070> flake<00:03:41.940> away

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
and it doesn't like flake away

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.970 
and it doesn't like flake away
throughout<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> day<00:03:42.780> but<00:03:43.380> when<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.620> do

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
throughout the day but when you do

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.890 
throughout the day but when you do
remove<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.700> does<00:03:44.910> kind<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.239> flake<00:03:45.480> off<00:03:45.660> as

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
remove it it does kind of flake off as

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.479 
remove it it does kind of flake off as
you're<00:03:46.110> removing<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.860> guess<00:03:47.070> that's<00:03:47.340> just

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
you're removing it I guess that's just

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.729 
you're removing it I guess that's just
because<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.420> like<00:03:48.840> pretty<00:03:49.140> long<00:03:49.410> wearing

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
because it is like pretty long wearing

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.410 
because it is like pretty long wearing
so<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.280> kind<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.520> comes<00:03:50.730> off<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:50.970> way<00:03:51.300> it

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
so it kind of comes off that way it

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.479 
so it kind of comes off that way it
doesn't<00:03:51.570> just<00:03:51.720> melt<00:03:52.080> away<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:53.070> if<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.310> add<00:03:53.459> a

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
doesn't just melt away but if you add a

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.160 
doesn't just melt away but if you add a
little<00:03:53.700> bit<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:53.910> warm<00:03:54.180> water<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.600> your<00:03:54.930> face

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
little bit of warm water to your face

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.170 
little bit of warm water to your face
first<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.800> then<00:03:56.040> use<00:03:56.220> your<00:03:56.280> makeup<00:03:56.730> wipe<00:03:56.910> over

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
first and then use your makeup wipe over

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.150 
first and then use your makeup wipe over
top<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.600> or<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:57.870> use<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.320> make<00:03:58.530> remember<00:03:59.010> i'm

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
top of it or if use I make remember i'm

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.860 
top of it or if use I make remember i'm
sure<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.430> will<00:03:59.489> work<00:03:59.550> just<00:03:59.880> fine<00:04:00.030> for<00:04:00.180> removing

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
sure it will work just fine for removing

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.810 
sure it will work just fine for removing
it<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.140> this<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.070> not<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.370> waterproof

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
it and this is not the waterproof

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.790 
it and this is not the waterproof
version<00:04:03.000> either<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:04.019> kind<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.590> little

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
version either so it kind of is a little

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.470 
version either so it kind of is a little
bit<00:04:05.100> difficult<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.580> get<00:04:05.790> off<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.060> i<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.300> it

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
bit difficult to get off but i like it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.030 
bit difficult to get off but i like it
because<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.900> doesn't<00:04:07.200> smudge<00:04:07.440> or<00:04:07.650> anything

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
because it doesn't smudge or anything

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.710 
because it doesn't smudge or anything
it's<00:04:08.220> not<00:04:08.400> too<00:04:08.580> big<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.940> pain<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.540> not

it's not too big of a pain and it's not

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.900 
it's not too big of a pain and it's not

they<00:04:13.950> can<00:04:14.160> just<00:04:14.370> totally<00:04:14.880> make<00:04:15.269> your<00:04:15.450> lashes

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.909 
harden into that shape and it can be
actually<00:04:18.750> kind<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:18.989> painful<00:04:19.230> when<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.680> press

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
actually kind of painful when you press

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.500 
actually kind of painful when you press
on<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.100> sometimes<00:04:20.400> or<00:04:20.910> when<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.209> move<00:04:21.359> your

on it sometimes or when you move your
lashes<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:22.440> doesn't<00:04:22.650> make<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:22.980> like<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.280> at

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
lashes this doesn't make it like that at

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.580 
lashes this doesn't make it like that at
all<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:23.880> very<00:04:24.150> um<00:04:24.419> it's<00:04:25.230> still<00:04:25.440> like

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
all it's very um it's still like

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.650 
all it's very um it's still like
flexible<00:04:26.040> if<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.430> makes<00:04:26.640> any<00:04:26.730> sense<00:04:27.030> as<00:04:27.390> far

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
flexible if that makes any sense as far

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.360 
flexible if that makes any sense as far
as<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.900> darkness<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.650> mascara<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.160> think

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
as the darkness of this mascara I think

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.370 
as the darkness of this mascara I think
it<00:04:29.520> is<00:04:29.550> very<00:04:29.880> black<00:04:30.390> it's<00:04:30.630> definitely<00:04:30.990> true<00:04:31.140> to

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
it is very black it's definitely true to

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.260 
it is very black it's definitely true to
the<00:04:31.530> name<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:31.950> not<00:04:32.039> it<00:04:32.729> doesn't<00:04:32.760> have<00:04:33.120> that

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
the name it's not it doesn't have that

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.360 
the name it's not it doesn't have that
grayish<00:04:33.750> tint<00:04:34.050> or

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
grayish tint or

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.920 
grayish tint or
thing<00:04:34.610> actually<00:04:35.060> let<00:04:35.419> me<00:04:35.510> show<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:35.720> the

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
thing actually let me show you the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.689 
thing actually let me show you the
covergirl<00:04:36.260> clump<00:04:36.650> crusher<00:04:36.770> mascara<00:04:37.250> because

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
covergirl clump crusher mascara because

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.670 
covergirl clump crusher mascara because
that<00:04:38.060> one<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.360> definitely<00:04:38.870> more<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.500> dryer

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
that one is definitely more of a dryer

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.650 
that one is definitely more of a dryer
formula<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.490> does<00:04:40.880> have<00:04:40.910> more<00:04:41.449> of<00:04:41.540> that

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
formula and it does have more of that

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.469 
formula and it does have more of that
like<00:04:41.900> great<00:04:42.550> tint<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.090> it's<00:04:44.210> not<00:04:44.330> very

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
like great tint to it so it's not very

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.000 
like great tint to it so it's not very
black<00:04:44.810> at<00:04:44.960> all<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:45.410> can<00:04:45.530> kind<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.740> see<00:04:45.889> the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
black at all so you can kind of see the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.689 
black at all so you can kind of see the
difference<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.460> how<00:04:46.490> black<00:04:46.910> this<00:04:46.940> is<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:48.699> how

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
difference on how black this is and how

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.760 
difference on how black this is and how
the<00:04:49.760> formula<00:04:50.270> compares<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.440> these<00:04:51.560> are<00:04:51.620> the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
the formula compares so these are the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.469 
the formula compares so these are the
two<00:04:51.889> mascaras<00:04:52.430> compared<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.360> the

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
two mascaras compared this is the

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:54.909 
two mascaras compared this is the
covergirl<00:04:53.780> clump<00:04:54.080> crusher<00:04:54.199> in<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> green

covergirl clump crusher in the green

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.409 
covergirl clump crusher in the green
tube<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.340> as<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.550> can<00:04:55.699> see<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:56.000> formula<00:04:56.389> is

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
tube and as you can see the formula is

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.300 
tube and as you can see the formula is
definitely<00:04:56.930> more<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.260> gray<00:04:57.470> color<00:04:57.710> I'm<00:04:58.190> not

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
definitely more of a gray color I'm not

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.740 
definitely more of a gray color I'm not
sure<00:04:58.370> if<00:04:58.550> my<00:04:58.669> camera<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.120> picking<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.570> up<00:04:59.720> but

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
sure if my camera is picking it up but

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.200 
sure if my camera is picking it up but
the<00:05:00.290> rocket<00:05:00.740> vol<00:05:01.100> 1<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.520> definitely<00:05:02.000> more

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
the rocket vol 1 is definitely more

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.240 
the rocket vol 1 is definitely more
black<00:05:02.540> you<00:05:03.110> can<00:05:03.260> see<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.590> difference<00:05:03.949> if<00:05:04.130> you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
black you can see the difference if you

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.159 
black you can see the difference if you
look<00:05:04.460> up<00:05:04.639> close<00:05:04.669> than<00:05:05.240> much<00:05:05.449> or<00:05:05.690> how<00:05:05.840> well<00:05:05.990> it's

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169

look up close than much or how well it's
picking<00:05:06.470> it<00:05:06.590> up<00:05:06.710> but<00:05:07.030> definitely<00:05:08.030> on<00:05:08.180> the
