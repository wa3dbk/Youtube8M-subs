take two and a half hours it's got a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.490 
take two and a half hours it's got a
difficulty<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.579> whisks<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.270> is

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
difficulty of two whisks which is

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.210 
difficulty of two whisks which is
something<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.799> handle

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
something I can handle

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.630 
something I can handle
and<00:01:39.200> cook<00:01:40.200> time<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.409> 10<00:01:40.680> minutes<00:01:40.890> makes<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.400> pint

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and cook time is 10 minutes makes a pint

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.149 
and cook time is 10 minutes makes a pint
of<00:01:41.729> ice<00:01:41.850> cream<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> great<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.130> to
