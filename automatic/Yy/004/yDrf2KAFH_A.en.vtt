00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
handlebar let's start with the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.210 
handlebar let's start with the
combination<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.100> works<00:02:29.310> together<00:02:29.670> well

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
combination that works together well

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.310 
combination that works together well
with<00:02:32.220> Sun<00:02:32.430> throttle<00:02:32.880> whilst<00:02:33.870> all<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> brake

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
next and then the grip shift when

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.710 
next and then the grip shift when
installed<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.640> you're<00:02:42.450> able<00:02:42.630> to

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
installed this way you're able to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.920 
installed this way you're able to
operate<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.920> thumb<00:02:44.130> throttle<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.720> brake

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
operate the thumb throttle the brake

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.289 
operate the thumb throttle the brake
lever<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.930> shifter<00:02:50.299> without

lever and the shifter without
interfering<00:02:51.750> with<00:02:51.780> each<00:02:51.959> other<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.890> keeping

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
interfering with each other and keeping

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
interfering with each other and keeping
everything<00:02:53.519> fairly<00:02:53.880> close

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
everything fairly close

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.880 
everything fairly close
the<00:02:54.780> reason<00:02:55.049> it's<00:02:55.200> nice<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.500> keep<00:02:55.620> things

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the reason it's nice to keep things

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.580 
the reason it's nice to keep things
close<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.510> sake<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.720> reach<00:02:58.019> if<00:02:58.440> you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
close is for the sake of reach if you

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.930 
close is for the sake of reach if you
have<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.799> slide<00:02:59.040> things<00:02:59.220> apart<00:02:59.549> so<00:02:59.670> they<00:02:59.760> don't

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
have to slide things apart so they don't

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.640 
have to slide things apart so they don't
interfere<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.390> each<00:03:00.510> other<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.350> find

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
interfere with each other you find

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.319 
interfere with each other you find
you're<00:03:01.799> gonna<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.220> reaching<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
you're gonna have to be reaching for the

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.180 
you're gonna have to be reaching for the
throttle<00:03:03.570> you're<00:03:04.500> going<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.739> be<00:03:04.829> reaching<00:03:05.010> for

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
throttle you're going to be reaching for

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.130 
throttle you're going to be reaching for
the<00:03:05.340> brake<00:03:05.549> lever<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.150> depending<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.049> the

the brake lever and depending on the
kind<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.350> shifter<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.709> have<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.950> may<00:03:08.100> be

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
kind of shifter you have you may be

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.770 
kind of shifter you have you may be
having<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.670> reach<00:03:08.850> for<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.090> shifter<00:03:09.420> as<00:03:09.570> well

having to reach for the shifter as well

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.289 
having to reach for the shifter as well
here<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.100> trigger<00:03:11.370> shifter<00:03:11.820> from<00:03:11.940> SRAM

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
here we have a trigger shifter from SRAM

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.280 
here we have a trigger shifter from SRAM
it<00:03:12.540> works<00:03:12.750> with<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.320> thumb<00:03:13.530> thumb<00:03:13.829> style

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
it works with the thumb thumb style

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.850 
it works with the thumb thumb style
let's<00:03:16.290> start<00:03:16.530> with<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.950> half<00:03:17.400> twist<00:03:18.230> with<00:03:19.230> no

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
let's start with the half twist with no

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.880 
let's start with the half twist with no
led<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:23.370> see<00:03:23.519> there's<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.760> little<00:03:23.940> shifting

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
led you see there's a little shifting

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.259 
led you see there's a little shifting
and<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.010> course<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> throttle<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.000> fine

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
and of course the throttle just fine

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.520 
and of course the throttle just fine
right<00:03:27.480> here<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.049> reach<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.320> brake

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
right here and we can reach the brake

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.449 
right here and we can reach the brake
lever<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.820> thumb<00:03:30.030> throttle<00:03:30.299> with<00:03:30.570> led<00:03:31.459> can

lever the thumb throttle with led can

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.340 
lever the thumb throttle with led can
work<00:03:32.730> if<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.540> cut<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.810> little<00:03:34.019> ways<00:03:34.170> away

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
work if it's cut the little ways away

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.910 
work if it's cut the little ways away
from<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.680> shifter<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.280> there's<00:03:35.459> room

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
from the shifter so that there's room

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.840 
from the shifter so that there's room
shift<00:03:38.359> we<00:03:39.359> have<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.510> similar<00:03:39.780> situation<00:03:40.850> with

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
shift we have a similar situation with

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.509 
shift we have a similar situation with
the<00:03:42.000> half<00:03:42.150> twist<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:43.079> this<00:03:43.200> combination<00:03:43.440> if<00:03:44.370> we

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
the half twist in this combination if we

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.130 
the half twist in this combination if we
hold<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.820> away<00:03:45.060> from<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> shifter<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> little

hold it away from the shifter a little

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.449 
hold it away from the shifter a little
bit<00:03:46.230> we<00:03:46.380> can<00:03:46.530> make<00:03:46.650> room<00:03:46.859> for<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.070> shifter<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
bit we can make room for the shifter to

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.580 
bit we can make room for the shifter to
operate<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.750> we<00:03:48.810> can<00:03:48.930> also<00:03:49.049> reach<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.290> brake

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590
