 hello guys with you I just and Rav 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.330
 are on entertaining games 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.370
 joystick channel is quite 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.059
 non-standard video for this channel 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.560
 but guys in general, I decided to write one 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.260
 such a curious video is a review on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 remote control service android 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 android device manager from google in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.990
 Generally this site is needed for those who 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.789
 lost your phone most likely 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.590
 android that is, it can still be 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 samsung galaxy so on and so forth 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.489
 in general guys to take advantage of it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.110
 site you must go to one of 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.030
 google services from your android 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.550
 devices that is valid if you have 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 samsung phone then you have to go to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.950
 play market through your name through your 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.160

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.410
 i8552 galaxy win 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.210

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.579
 record this video to help those who 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.870

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.229
