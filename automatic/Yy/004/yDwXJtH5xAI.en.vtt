00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
can go through these games really really

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.490 
can go through these games really really
slow<00:06:59.520> but<00:06:59.880> you<00:07:00.030> saw<00:07:00.300> how<00:07:00.600> it<00:07:00.810> kind<00:07:01.050> of<00:07:01.110> affected

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
slow but you saw how it kind of affected

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.680 
slow but you saw how it kind of affected
the<00:07:01.770> gameplay<00:07:02.190> a<00:07:02.220> little<00:07:02.520> bit<00:07:02.639> the<00:07:03.090> slower<00:07:03.419> you

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
the gameplay a little bit the slower you

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.330 
the gameplay a little bit the slower you
went<00:07:03.960> because<00:07:04.169> the<00:07:04.470> games<00:07:04.680> were<00:07:04.889> tailored

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
went because the games were tailored

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.320 
went because the games were tailored
towards<00:07:05.610> that<00:07:05.759> this<00:07:05.940> is<00:07:06.060> a<00:07:06.090> new<00:07:06.300> generation

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330
