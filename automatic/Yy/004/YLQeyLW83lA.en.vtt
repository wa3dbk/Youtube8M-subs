than<00:00:49.050> 1080p<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.700> take<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> 1080p

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
than 1080p so when you take a 1080p

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
than 1080p so when you take a 1080p
picture<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.379> image<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.800> compared<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
picture like this image and compared to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
picture like this image and compared to
a<00:00:53.640> 1440p<00:00:54.420> image<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.020> will<00:00:55.230> look<00:00:55.440> something

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
a 1440p image it will look something

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.650 
a 1440p image it will look something
like<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> same<00:00:57.149> exact

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
like this now this is the same exact

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.439 
like this now this is the same exact
picture<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.590> originally<00:00:59.280> 1080p<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

is powered by this
it's<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.299> mobi<00:03:06.600> magic<00:03:07.170> charger<00:03:07.709> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
it's a mobi magic charger and

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
essentially comes with a base piece as

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.330 
essentially comes with a base piece as
well<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.959> charging<00:03:10.410> pack<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.069> hook

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
well as a charging pack that you hook

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.100 
well as a charging pack that you hook
into<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.760> bottom<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.330> Magic<00:03:12.720> Mouse<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
into the bottom of the Magic Mouse and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.509 
into the bottom of the Magic Mouse and
then<00:03:13.319> when<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.530> set<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.709> on<00:03:13.890> top<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> base

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
then when you set it on top of the base

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.789 
then when you set it on top of the base
pad<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.120> actually<00:03:15.569> charges<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.140> free<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.530> wires

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
pad it actually charges it free of wires

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.130 
pad it actually charges it free of wires
and<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.640> simply<00:03:17.820> hooks<00:03:18.180> up<00:03:18.420> through<00:03:18.750> USB

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
and it just simply hooks up through USB

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.289 
and it just simply hooks up through USB
so<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> great<00:03:20.549> charging<00:03:21.090> solution

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
so this is a great charging solution

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.199 
so this is a great charging solution
that<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.959> use<00:03:22.320> all<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.620> time<00:03:22.859> for<00:03:23.519> my<00:03:23.700> magic

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.839 
actually what I'm using to do the
voiceovers<00:04:59.409> for<00:04:59.650> this<00:04:59.800> video<00:05:00.129> right<00:05:00.430> now<00:05:00.460> and

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
voiceovers for this video right now and

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.020 
voiceovers for this video right now and
attached<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.930> have<00:05:02.139> a<00:05:02.169> PF<00:05:02.860> 1<00:05:03.129> pop<00:05:03.520> filter

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
attached to it I have a PF 1 pop filter

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.020 
attached to it I have a PF 1 pop filter
by<00:05:04.240> Sterling<00:05:04.750> audio<00:05:05.319> which<00:05:05.770> I<00:05:05.979> just<00:05:06.490> picked<00:05:06.819> up

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
by Sterling audio which I just picked up

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.760 
by Sterling audio which I just picked up
so<00:05:07.479> hopefully<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.020> audio<00:05:08.349> in<00:05:08.469> this<00:05:08.590> video

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
so hopefully the audio in this video

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.070 
so hopefully the audio in this video
sounds<00:05:09.340> better<00:05:09.580> than<00:05:09.699> the<00:05:09.940> audio<00:05:10.270> in<00:05:10.539> previous

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
sounds better than the audio in previous

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.959 
sounds better than the audio in previous
videos<00:05:11.469> because<00:05:12.009> now<00:05:12.159> I'm<00:05:12.370> able<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.639> turn<00:05:12.940> up

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
videos because now I'm able to turn up

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.790 
videos because now I'm able to turn up
the<00:05:13.240> gain<00:05:13.479> more<00:05:13.780> without<00:05:14.020> having<00:05:14.469> to<00:05:14.620> worry

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800
