00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello i am very happy about you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.160
 find and I have not you are well and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.870
 so in this video we will see 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.200
 together concretely how to pass a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 cap in painting so we'll see all that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.960
 but just before it was to tell you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 that I have not by a second video that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 is just below where we will go 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.039
 in fact much further and so you 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.029
 see all this right after this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.439
 video so I wanted to you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.330
 speak and above all finally it's some 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.070
 important thing I think of you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 reveal a little bit how to pass a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 cap in painting is something that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 has really finally I reflected by 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.280
 report to my personal case and that's 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 something that worked very well 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.460
 for me is actually to pass a course 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.200
 in fact the thing is to push his 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.850
 mastery of painting and two inches 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.920
 and more particularly his mastery of 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 accuracy then there is a big debate 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 around precision there are a lot 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.340
 finally there are people it interests him 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.989
 are people trying to constantly 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.120
 to increase their accuracy in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.840
 painting and whose purpose is to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.840
 paint precisely that and there are plenty 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.640
 other people that I do more 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 or less part but these nuances and I 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 you will talk about it again but there is 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.890
 other people who say no the goal 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 it's not about painting like 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.010
 photo i agree with that but he 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.540
 was worth there are other people who say 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.210
 I prefer not downright rats 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.560
 abstract or game finally it's the precision 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.880
 it's not my thing at all it's not this 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.549
 I'm looking for it's not my style of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.600
 painting and the thing is that in fact in 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.880
 does precision is something 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.079
 indispensable to work even if we 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.400
 I do not want to do that 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.530
 explain to me I give an example toussaint 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 for example someone if we have someone 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.780
 who learns piano 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.549
 in the beginning he will take his scales 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.890
 then he'll start with pieces 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.030
 more or less easy he goes 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.189
 gradually progressing wants 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.869
 progress he's going and a word he's going to want 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.399
 pass a course and so he will have to 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.810
 tackle very difficult pieces 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.380
 he's going to tackle very pieces 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.420
 difficult 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.439
 difficult and in the end he will know how to play 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.119
 his pieces there and so in the end it will be 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.590
 played the most difficult pieces 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.420
 so he's just going all 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.380
 master and once he has 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.490
 acquire this mastery there he will be able 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.380
 do whatever he wants he'll be able 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.580
 invent his own pieces playing 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.979
 much more pieces ran a lot 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.660
 easier slower it will be able everything 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.970
 to do because precisely he was very 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.800
 far he knew how to play pieces of who 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.180
 did not necessarily interest him but he knew 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.730
 play pieces that was very 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.200
 hard to play he tried to go the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.700
 further as possible precisely in his 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.930
 practice and balas and painting is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400
 exactly the same thing the idea is it 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.959
 it's going to go the furthest 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.180
 practice is to go the furthest 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.440
 in its accuracy and once we 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.569
 control and precision there and well we can 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 do really what you want with 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.380
 can go back to something of a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.430
 little more abstract or less accurate 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.290
 but we control all that is so then 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 there is no problem for all 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.400
 the doors open for example I 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.840
 often gives the example of picasso who 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.340
 go to him it's someone who did 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.500
 a lot of abstract finally we know 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.859
 picasso with work on the form etc 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.799
 but you have to know that early picasso 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.049
 it was a work that is he 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.790
 really develop his technique thoroughly 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.500
 and he had a pretty technical 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.609
 impressive in his debut after he has 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.040
 could do what they wanted 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.780
 because they mastered it control 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.650
 is really painting and then he 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.079
 has embarked on all these 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.100
 experiments and he could really 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.049
 to go very far and do what he 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.799
 wanted because they mastered that 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.540
 so that's so what very 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.519
 interesting also with the work of the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.019
 accuracy is that it allows 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.209
 develop a whole set of qualities 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.639
 I give you an example to be 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.750
 precise you have to be very observant by 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.040
 example if you have a model you have to 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.319
 really look at all the little ones 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.060
 milk shades every detail for 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.530
 can their reach on the canvas and so 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.850
 it's something that helps 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.260
 work also his observation so 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.450
 that's what it's like trying to 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.579
 work here his precision so his 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.840
 mastery and ben we will develop a whole 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.489
 set of qualities that will us 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.620
 serve later to do what we 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.630
 wants in the painting 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.489
 so here is something 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.910
 of absolutely fundamental then me this 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.650
 What I propose is that 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.930
 we go to the second video where I'm going 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.210
 we will see together 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.670
 concretely how to paint a lot 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.440
 closer finally finally precisely that you 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.660
 love breads precise finally that is 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.220
 your goal as I told you where that 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.420
 that is not necessarily your life so 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.780
 we find ourselves right away in the 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.780
 second video
