00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.080
 How long, this is Kisa! 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.501
 Today will be one of those series of special effects makeup, and this time I will create an injury make with the rigid collodion 

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:27.266
 With these eyes everything becomes clearer. I mean those moves! Can we start the video then? 

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:42.301
 In the first step, just draw the make format. It's pretty obvious this but since it's a tutorial I have to explain! 

00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:52.294
 Put some of both on some surface then mix the two to dilute the red color 

00:00:52.512 --> 00:00:58.364
 OK! Now let me take a rest for now ... Could not you just watch and enjoy this step with your eyes? 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.057
 Repeat the mixing process, but this time mixing the dark red with the castor oil 

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:19.502
 Apply dark red to just the edges, and take the opportunity to hide the white outline of make 

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:28.360
 Now shade the edges to the inner side giving depth to the make 

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:45.388
 Add a layer of rigid collodion over the entire make 

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:55.373
 After only waiting until dry, we will be repeating this same process for 7 times 

00:01:55.373 --> 00:02:00.411
 Is it dry, can you tell something different? 

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:05.479
 You can not? Fine, call me now! Now we are exactly in the fifth layer 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.387
 Here goes the last layer! 

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:13.430
 This is the situation that should be after the last application, now we can call it a wound, right? Please just say YES! 

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:24.459
 Add the artificial blood in the center of it to create texture and give more depth, see? The real power is right here! 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.354
 When the parade is true, it is! Nothing else matters, man! Take advantage then and bring some coffee for me then! Hurry up! 

00:02:29.354 --> 00:02:31.399
 Return with these two 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:36.717
 Then apply the two colors around the wound and spread some of the color with your fingers giving more realism 

00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:47.072
 So, what do you think then? Ended! When it's time to remove it is just pull quiet because the stop is firmness in morale! Thank you for watching Moro!
