00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
of goldfish and the number one I would

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.000 
of goldfish and the number one I would
say<00:01:06.890> is<00:01:07.340> not<00:01:08.090> having<00:01:08.900> a<00:01:09.170> big<00:01:09.380> enough<00:01:09.620> tank

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
say is not having a big enough tank

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.430 
say is not having a big enough tank
because<00:01:10.460> goldfish<00:01:10.970> are<00:01:11.120> super<00:01:11.690> messy<00:01:12.170> and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
because goldfish are super messy and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.920 
because goldfish are super messy and
they<00:01:13.070> give<00:01:13.460> off<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> big<00:01:14.000> bio<00:01:14.330> load<00:01:14.690> just

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
they give off a big bio load just

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.810 
they give off a big bio load just
because<00:01:15.290> they're<00:01:15.470> constantly<00:01:16.010> eating<00:01:16.640> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
because they're constantly eating and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.200 
because they're constantly eating and
they're<00:01:17.690> given<00:01:17.960> off<00:01:18.080> feces<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.700> raises

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
they're given off feces and it raises

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.210 
they're given off feces and it raises
nitrates<00:01:20.750> in<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.020> water<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:23.950> long<00:01:24.950> story

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
nitrates in the water and long story

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.620 
nitrates in the water and long story
short<00:01:25.370> you're<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.030> going<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.210> want<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.420> get

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
short you're just going to want to get

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.810 
short you're just going to want to get
the<00:01:26.810> biggest<00:01:27.020> aquarium<00:01:27.680> possible<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.400> would

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
the biggest aquarium possible I would

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.460 
the biggest aquarium possible I would
say<00:01:29.119> a<00:01:29.150> minimum<00:01:29.750> for<00:01:29.960> one<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.380> these

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
say a minimum for one of these

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.320 
say a minimum for one of these
Blackmore's<00:01:31.130> should<00:01:31.490> be<00:01:31.640> at<00:01:31.729> least<00:01:31.790> thirty

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
Blackmore's should be at least thirty

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.020 
Blackmore's should be at least thirty
gallons<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.260> if<00:01:33.950> you're<00:01:34.100> adding<00:01:34.549> more<00:01:34.820> of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
gallons and if you're adding more of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.620 
gallons and if you're adding more of
them<00:01:35.530> it's<00:01:36.530> going<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.799> be<00:01:36.950> more<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.940> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
them it's going to be more so the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.510 
them it's going to be more so the
biggest<00:01:39.049> failure<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:39.710> people<00:01:40.280> don't

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
biggest failure is that people don't

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.609 
biggest failure is that people don't
have<00:01:40.580> big<00:01:40.820> enough<00:01:40.940> aquariums<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.900> the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
have big enough aquariums and the

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.710 
have big enough aquariums and the
nitrates<00:01:43.189> add<00:01:43.400> up<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.909> water<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.420> they

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
nitrates add up in the water and they

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.170 
nitrates add up in the water and they
were<00:01:44.750> not<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.020> oxygen<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.830> they<00:01:46.040> died<00:01:46.280> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
were not on oxygen and they died the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.810 
were not on oxygen and they died the
goldfish<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.810> actually<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.560> most<00:01:48.740> common<00:01:49.100> pet

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
goldfish is actually the most common pet

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.690 
goldfish is actually the most common pet
fish<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.689> have<00:01:50.810> died<00:01:51.080> on<00:01:51.260> people<00:01:51.650> maybe<00:01:52.400> that

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
fish to have died on people maybe that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.160 
fish to have died on people maybe that
could<00:01:52.850> be<00:01:52.909> because<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.570> goldfish<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.049> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
could be because the goldfish is the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.770 
could be because the goldfish is the
most<00:01:54.350> popular<00:01:54.799> fish<00:01:55.100> or<00:01:55.340> just<00:01:56.150> because<00:01:56.540> they

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
most popular fish or just because they

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.859 
most popular fish or just because they
are<00:01:57.280> they're<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.430> messiest<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.270> people

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
are they're the messiest and people

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.030 
are they're the messiest and people
think<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.259> can<00:02:00.409> just<00:02:00.590> put<00:02:00.770> them<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:00.920> a

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
think you can just put them in a

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.310 
think you can just put them in a
goldfish<00:02:01.549> bowl<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.119> that's<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.900> huge

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
goldfish bowl and that's a huge

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.780 
goldfish bowl and that's a huge
misbelief<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.400> um<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:06.470> second<00:02:06.950> most<00:02:07.640> common

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
misbelief and um the second most common

misbelief and um the second most common
failure<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.509> see<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:08.959> people<00:02:08.989> feeding<00:02:09.739> this

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
failure I see is people feeding this

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.239 
failure I see is people feeding this
these<00:02:10.489> fish<00:02:10.759> weigh<00:02:11.060> too<00:02:11.120> much<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.810> know<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.249 
these fish weigh too much you know the

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.290 
these fish weigh too much you know the
stomp<00:02:13.249> their<00:02:13.609> stomach<00:02:13.969> is

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
stomp their stomach is

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.450 
stomp their stomach is
the<00:02:14.420> size<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.780> their<00:02:14.900> eyeball<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.590> granted

goldfish<00:02:16.970> constantly<00:02:17.750> are<00:02:17.900> eating<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.590> when

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
goldfish constantly are eating and when

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
goldfish constantly are eating and when
we<00:02:19.160> feed<00:02:19.520> them<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.330> kind<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.720> gives<00:02:20.900> us<00:02:21.020> this

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
we feed them it kind of gives us this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.800 
we feed them it kind of gives us this
good<00:02:21.560> feeling<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.340> having<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.060> relationship

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
good feeling of having a relationship

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.570 
good feeling of having a relationship
because<00:02:24.020> it's<00:02:24.320> really<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.920> only<00:02:24.950> interaction

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
because it's really the only interaction

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.080 
because it's really the only interaction
we<00:02:25.910> have<00:02:25.940> with<00:02:26.270> our<00:02:26.390> fish<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.060> a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
we have with our fish so we just have a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.000 
we have with our fish so we just have a
tendency<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.570> do<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.990> lot<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.410> when<00:02:30.920> you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
tendency to do it a lot and when you

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.640 
tendency to do it a lot and when you
over<00:02:31.310> feed<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.730> fish<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.870> food<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.320> doesn't

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
over feed the fish the food that doesn't

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.740 
over feed the fish the food that doesn't
get<00:02:33.770> eaten<00:02:33.890> sinks<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.550> bottom<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
get eaten sinks to the bottom and it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.310 
get eaten sinks to the bottom and it
decays<00:02:36.200> in<00:02:36.920> your<00:02:37.160> tank<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:37.730> raises<00:02:38.720> bad

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
decays in your tank and raises bad

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.950 
decays in your tank and raises bad
levels<00:02:39.890> in<00:02:40.040> your<00:02:40.190> water<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.820> kills<00:02:41.330> oxygen

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
levels in your water and kills oxygen

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.740 
levels in your water and kills oxygen
for<00:02:42.170> your<00:02:42.290> fish<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:42.920> making<00:02:43.790> sure<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.240> you

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
for your fish so making sure that you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.920 
for your fish so making sure that you
don't<00:02:45.380> over<00:02:45.680> feed<00:02:46.100> them<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:47.240> trick<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:47.720> that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
don't over feed them and a trick is that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.310 
don't over feed them and a trick is that
only<00:02:48.860> feed<00:02:49.520> them<00:02:49.790> enough<00:02:50.330> food<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.810> where<00:02:51.200> they

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
only feed them enough food to where they

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.960 
only feed them enough food to where they
can<00:02:51.500> eat<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.130> couple<00:02:52.340> minutes<00:02:52.760> because

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
can eat it in a couple minutes because

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.030 
can eat it in a couple minutes because
that<00:02:53.510> food<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.810> sinks<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.410> bottom<00:02:54.500> is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
that food that sinks to the bottom is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.350 
that food that sinks to the bottom is
just<00:02:55.220> terrible<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:55.910> your<00:02:56.090> water<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.310> um<00:02:58.360> with

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
just terrible on your water so um with

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.510 
just terrible on your water so um with
with<00:02:59.990> I<00:03:00.230> mean<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:00.650> perfectly<00:03:01.070> fine<00:03:01.340> they

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
with I mean it's perfectly fine they

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.370 
with I mean it's perfectly fine they
have<00:03:01.640> tank<00:03:01.910> mates<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.170> add<00:03:03.350> up

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380
