00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello and we will learn how to make a 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.920
 romantic hairstyle like this one that is based 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.680
 in a ballerina bun and two braids 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.209
 intertwined I hope you like it 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.920
 first thing we're going to do is comb the 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.019
 hair back on this occasion we're going to 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 leave a little bangs with which 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.400
 you leave the fringe with the stripe of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 half to the side as you like it and the rest 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.690
 think about it once we have it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.260
 combed back we'll load the area 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.260
 higher 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.600
 this time as I already have a lot of hair I'm going to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.730
 use this brush that is wider 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.220
 Once we've gotten some 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.320
 volume in the crown area let's go 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.870
 to pick up the hair backwards doing 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.930
 a queue for what is important 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.400
 let loose both the fringe and in 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.400
 the area of ​​the pin on each side 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.360
 a tuft not too fat, you're worth 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.980
 to leave one on each side 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.530
 Well, we have already collected all the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.450
 hair backwards let's loosen what 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.580
 a little bit because we want the effect 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.500
 be a bit like semi tousled to the 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.570
 then but we loosened a bit so that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.190
 what as oscar davant and follow store and 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.190
 volume 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.690
 and we will load the cabbage 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.950
 we have to now let's take the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.430
 head forward and let's make a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.430
 monkey 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.520
 thus giving it small turns 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.049
 we do it and then we have to hold it 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.570
 well with all the forks that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.270
 you need and the question here below 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 to prevent the tail from falling more 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.920
 as you see in the cover of a little with the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.899
 bun and now let's fix it well 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.700
 As you can see we have been fixing the bun well 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.890
 that looks disheveled but remains 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.490
 quite bulky is now worth what 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.670
 let's do is braid 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.250
 the part of the leg that we have left 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.780
 here initially for this we are going to 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.229
 make a very simple braid of three 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.229
 capes 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.900
 one on each side good now 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.110
 we have the braids done we're going to 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.210
 use as a headband for this we are going to 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.560
 put one on this side and the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.860
 we will hook the other side with a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.860
 fork 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.690
 and then we will do the same with the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.220
 with the other good as you see we have 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.769
 separated the braids a bit so that 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.300
 stay here a little more bulky and this 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.200
 would be the end result of our 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.200
 romantic hairstyle
