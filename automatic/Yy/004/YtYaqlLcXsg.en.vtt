see the iOS 7 multitasking functionality

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
see the iOS 7 multitasking functionality
is<00:00:42.360> very<00:00:42.540> similar<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.200> jailbreak<00:00:43.680> tweak

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
is very similar to a jailbreak tweak

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
is very similar to a jailbreak tweak
called<00:00:43.950> dash<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.030> allows<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
called dash that allows you to have a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
called dash that allows you to have a
full<00:00:46.260> screen<00:00:46.559> app<00:00:46.890> preview<00:00:47.219> dash<00:00:47.969> isn't<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
full screen app preview dash isn't the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.850 
full screen app preview dash isn't the
only<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:48.930> are<00:00:49.020> various<00:00:49.350> other<00:00:49.559> tweaks

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
only one there are various other tweaks

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.490 
only one there are various other tweaks
that<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.789> obviously<00:00:51.090> taken<00:00:51.809> cues<00:00:52.320> from

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that this has obviously taken cues from

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
that this has obviously taken cues from
or<00:00:52.829> maybe<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.940> coincidence<00:00:54.059> for

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
or maybe it's just a coincidence for

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
or maybe it's just a coincidence for
instance<00:00:54.989> also<00:00:55.440> how<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.010> swipe<00:00:56.219> up

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
instance also how you can just swipe up

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
instance also how you can just swipe up
and<00:00:56.699> dismiss<00:00:57.149> various<00:00:57.989> apps<00:00:58.199> orbit<00:00:58.710> comes<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and dismiss various apps orbit comes to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.189 
and dismiss various apps orbit comes to
mind<00:00:59.309> various<00:00:59.879> other<00:01:00.090> jailbreak<00:01:00.600> tweaks<00:01:00.899> come

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
mind various other jailbreak tweaks come

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.219

to mind as well all the jailbreak tweaks

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.530 
to mind as well all the jailbreak tweaks
are<00:01:04.379> starting<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.769> optimized<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.700> iOS<00:01:06.299> 5

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

sbsettings<00:01:11.780> obviously<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.260> had<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.890> have

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
sbsettings obviously this had to have

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.210 
sbsettings obviously this had to have
come<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.580> iOS<00:01:15.450> eventually<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.380> we're<00:01:16.979> glad

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.729 
well obviously the team behind iOS 7
realized<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.330> was<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.569> huge<00:02:42.780> limitation<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
realized this was a huge limitation and

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.190 
realized this was a huge limitation and
they<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:44.670> eliminated<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.569> arbitrary

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
they have now eliminated that arbitrary

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.860 
they have now eliminated that arbitrary
eight<00:02:46.739> tab<00:02:47.100> barrier<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.940> now<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:48.750> open

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
eight tab barrier and now you can open

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.070 
eight tab barrier and now you can open
up<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.290> many<00:02:49.500> tabs<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.900> possibly<00:02:51.900> could

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
up as many tabs as you possibly could

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.370

end in sight I don't know if there's an
actual<00:02:59.130> limit<00:02:59.549> but<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.440> pretty

actual limit but if there is it's pretty

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.520 
actual limit but if there is it's pretty

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
high as you can see here but this one is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.009 
high as you can see here but this one is
