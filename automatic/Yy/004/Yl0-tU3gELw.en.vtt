 180 hp strong Ford Coppola cashed a penalty minutes 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.340
 GM had already been in the third of a total of five laps on the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.370
 ITB Berlin 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 made up for a few seconds 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.720
 you do not even know nine minutes down six hundredths of a second that is 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.770
 an average speed of 150 point 5 kilometers per hour one 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.890
 new touring car 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.580
 this hot chase had not withstood the cafe's rear axle 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.170
 the route speaker 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.910
 despite the favorite is out of fashion 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.910
 that speaks like wildfire 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.240
 for the mass of the series and small special touring car little interesting 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.510
 but for the fast BMW Alpina 2002 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.160
 by Hans Stuck Junior the chance to reach the top of the visitor field 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.740
 actually put us down 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.740
 through the Union 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.140

 Minutes the Nordschleife 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.150
 with their numerous curves on the 22 of the 8 kilometers that cover 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.180
 Times will be for the first time at the Nürburgring 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 the reason for this is extensive construction work 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.500
 Jump hill soil worn down curves straightened trees come to be cut down 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.910
 On the entire coast run-off areas the racing events on the race 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.909
 make it safer and sprayed

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:26.619
 because the new spectacular lap record for touring cars also makes headlines 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.879
 than three quarters of an hour 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.879
 everything went 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.719
 Although the small shops deliver Kelz which are now heavily bleached 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:43.350
 still has it 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.600
 File position battles 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.899
