00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.400 
difficult for us there are really tough
teams<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.309> better<00:00:15.150> teams<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.660> us<00:00:15.780> New

Zealand<00:00:16.830> South<00:00:17.490> Africa<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:17.910> they're

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
Zealand South Africa I think they're

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.120 
Zealand South Africa I think they're
better<00:00:18.330> teams<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.690> us<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> lot<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
better teams in us but we do a lot of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.330 
better teams in us but we do a lot of
work<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.580> guys<00:00:21.170> are<00:00:22.170> doing<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.680> big<00:00:23.100> sacrifice

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
work the guys are doing a big sacrifice

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.710 
work the guys are doing a big sacrifice
to<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:24.600> here<00:00:25.400> most<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.519> them<00:00:26.699> work<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.180> train

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to be here most of them work and train

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
to be here most of them work and train
so<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> surprise<00:00:29.160> they're<00:00:29.310> not

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so it's it's not a surprise they're not

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.859 
so it's it's not a surprise they're not
professional<00:00:29.970> players<00:00:30.240> none<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.689> are

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
professional players none of them are

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
professional players none of them are
professional<00:00:31.349> players<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.399> very

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
professional players so it's very

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.120 
professional players so it's very
difficult<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:33.000> us<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.079> being<00:00:34.590> amateur

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
difficult for us and and being amateur

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860 
difficult for us and and being amateur
playing<00:00:35.340> against<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> professional<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
playing against the professional that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
playing against the professional that
makes<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.500> tournament<00:00:37.920> even<00:00:38.040> even

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
makes this this tournament even even

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.229 
makes this this tournament even even
bigger<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.390> Doman<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:41.239> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
bigger this this Doman was just one it's

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
bigger this this Doman was just one it's
really<00:00:42.450> important<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.020> us<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> team<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
really important for us for the team and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
really important for us for the team and
I<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.550> Argentine<00:00:44.969> rugby<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
I think for for Argentine rugby what is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959 
I think for for Argentine rugby what is
the<00:00:46.260> X<00:00:46.410> Factor<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.550> explain

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the X Factor how do you explain

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.010 
the X Factor how do you explain
Argentina's<00:00:48.750> continued<00:00:49.410> success<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.930> think<00:00:51.930> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
Argentina's continued success I think I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.810 
Argentina's continued success I think I
think<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.710> Argentine<00:00:53.070> player<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
think the Argentine player has has a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
think the Argentine player has has a
very<00:00:54.539> big<00:00:55.199> heart

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
very big heart

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.060 
very big heart
okay<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:57.440> that's<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> most

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
okay I think that's that's the most

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
okay I think that's that's the most
important<00:00:59.520> thing<00:00:59.550> now<00:01:00.539> we're<00:01:00.960> getting<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
important thing now we're getting a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.679 
important thing now we're getting a
little<00:01:01.859> bit<00:01:02.039> better<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> fitness

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
little bit better in the in the fitness

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.060 
little bit better in the in the fitness
we're<00:01:06.689> getting<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.560> better<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.920> other

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
we're getting a little better in other

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.550 
we're getting a little better in other
things<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> think<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:10.020> still<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
things but I think that it's still that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.550 
things but I think that it's still that
valve<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.369> player<00:01:12.060> has<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:13.200> makes<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
valve and player has that makes it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.160 
valve and player has that makes it
different<00:01:13.890> from<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> rest<00:01:15.170> sometimes

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
different from from the rest sometimes

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920 
different from from the rest sometimes
once<00:01:17.040> once<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.850> talked<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.090> Erik<00:01:18.540> garage<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
once once I talked with Erik garage and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.499 
once once I talked with Erik garage and
he<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> he<00:01:19.320> said<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:20.670> he<00:01:20.790> never<00:01:21.240> liked<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
he and he said that he never liked to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.850 
he and he said that he never liked to
play<00:01:21.750> against<00:01:21.960> Argentina<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.710> they

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
play against Argentina because they

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.640 
play against Argentina because they
never<00:01:23.040> give<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> score<00:01:25.439> maybe

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
never give up you you if you score maybe

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.740 
never give up you you if you score maybe
two<00:01:25.920> tries<00:01:26.159> against<00:01:26.520> other<00:01:26.700> teams<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.570> game

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
two tries against other teams the game

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
two tries against other teams the game
is<00:01:27.869> over<00:01:28.100> against<00:01:29.100> Argentina<00:01:29.549> no<00:01:29.729> because

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
is over against Argentina no because

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.330 
is over against Argentina no because
they<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.960> till<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> end<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
they just go till the end so I think

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
they just go till the end so I think
that's<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> very<00:01:32.939> important<00:01:33.450> factor<00:01:33.570> for

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that's a very important factor for

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.469 
that's a very important factor for
Argentina<00:01:34.829> apart<00:01:35.549> from<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> were<00:01:36.030> working<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
Argentina apart from that were working a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.940 
Argentina apart from that were working a
lot<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.960> guys<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> field

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
lot the guys are doing a lot of field

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.730 
lot the guys are doing a lot of field
fitness<00:01:38.720> working<00:01:39.720> really<00:01:39.869> hard<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> think

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
fitness working really hard but I think

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.440 
fitness working really hard but I think
that<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> heart<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> Argentine<00:01:42.210> player

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that the heart of the Argentine player

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560 
that the heart of the Argentine player
it's<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.530> special<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> last

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's it's special this was the last

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560 
it's it's special this was the last
warm-up<00:01:46.110> before<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.040> World<00:01:47.220> Cup<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> win

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
warm-up before the World Cup can you win

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.130 
warm-up before the World Cup can you win
the<00:01:48.689> World<00:01:48.899> Cup

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the World Cup
