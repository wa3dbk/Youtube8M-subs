00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
but I assume it's going to be a sheer
I've<00:00:52.410> heard<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.920> sheer<00:00:53.190> brown<00:00:53.520> color<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I've heard it's a sheer brown color it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
I've heard it's a sheer brown color it
tastes<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.809> chocolate<00:00:55.370> it's<00:00:56.370> probably<00:00:56.760> very

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
tastes like chocolate it's probably very
