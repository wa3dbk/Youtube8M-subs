00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.140
 this new video from minecraft italia e 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.910
 I'm francis drake and a new one 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.889
 youtuber that will make videos with everyone 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 the other youtubers you present on 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.309
 this channel 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.199
 but a question arises spontaneously francis 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.010
 drake of what deals with minecraft 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.840
 of Italy 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 I will deal with alternate redstone 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.460
 Sunday with the techno bros and also of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.560
 texture pec and Tuesday alternated with 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 alex 8133 a new youtube that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 you will learn to know then boys 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.869
 having said that we now start with the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.869
 review of the tech texture 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.690
 the texture pack we are going to today 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.539
 see is called utic asthma and is one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 texture because really very beautiful that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.280
 it is rather simple but above all it is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.199
 beautiful with the fashion shader even if yes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.239
 I know it with the wake of the mod and beautiful 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.010
 whatever said this anyway 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.800
 let's see right away what this smoothies are 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.320
 then I would start immediately with the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.899
 most used tools of the sword the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.090
 pickaxe leaves and the shovel and of course 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.340
 also the bow so let's start with the bow 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 The bow I have to say that has not changed 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.970
 a great deal compared to what there is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.250
 first on minecraft I have to say that it is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.680
 really very nice and goes a lot 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.080
 good with the texture pack to which it belongs 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.580
 what to say then for the sword in fact also 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.040
 this very very well 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.030
 the same goes for the pickaxe to leave 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.500
 and for the shovel 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.090
 this too very well another 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.610
 a must-see in these 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.860
 texture packs are armor or rather 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.500
 diamond armor because boys 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.869
 this is a mature diamond lady 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.659
 we see that it is a diamond to look at 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.520
 these dots really make you think 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.009
 in fact, let's look at the diamond live 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.380
 and even here I have to say that they did a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.970
 very good job but now let's see 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.070
 suffered the blocks that are 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.320
 obviously the most important part of the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.270
 texture packs obviously kids don't 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.520
 I'll show you all the blocks that are 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 available on minecraft because there 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.210
 would like an eternity and above all 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.399
 because thus I would ruin the discovery of 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.330
 this texture pack, however, let's start 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.190
 immediately from the workbench 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.170
 from work and I must say that it is also made 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.540
 this very well simple with this 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.960
 a little weird style silva type something a 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.150
 what to do with space and then of course 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.190
 here we have the cash here too we have 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.740
 the same style of work table 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.710
 we have the furnace that looks like an oven 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.840
 modern and finally we have the ces del 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.390
 land that I don't know in Italy if you know 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.760
 it's called the omega trunk when I have it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.500
 discovered i really died on 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.570
 desk, however, we move on to be 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.340
 most important blocks or wood 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.320
 why you guys in wood and the part 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.510
 more important than missing or at least this 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.190
 according to me because with wood you do it 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.290
 that is, we all do the others 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.810
 tools we also make beautiful homes 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.190
 which then will probably be on fire 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.470
 the fact is that in this texture pack 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.890
 they are really very well looked at 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.840
 how beautiful they are clean, clean and clean 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.390
 right term and a note of merit 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.400
 should give it to this wood here that it is 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.200
 in acacia wood and I have to give it a 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.120
 I deserve it because of this orange color 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.190
 above that is beautiful and above all 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.120
 these this decoration which is not 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.400
 not bad 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.200
 now instead we have the land area here 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.209
 they are the most used soils 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.660
 the most common ones on minecraft however the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.709
 earth with grass pole the mycelium la 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.570
 gravel sand and red sand all 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.190
 how many even these are very beautiful and with 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.989
 a style that really comes back a lot 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.209
 good with all the texture pack 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.940
 let us now turn to pity for the stone 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.590
 boys is also this one in one 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.900
 this very particular style too 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.489
 very clean but like all the texture 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.350
 in fact, look here, there is the 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.810
 sponge and hay these too are 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.060
 really very well done if you notice us 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.950
 even the orange here is beautiful 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.050
 now we pass instead has things 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.570
 really very beautiful 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.459
 or this part here that is usually 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.340
 my favorite of the texture packs 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.840
 however here we have the light of stone 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.269
 red excuse the rambla of 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.640
 cretarossa elements very pretty I think 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.549
 that with the shader is beautiful then 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.130
 we especially have the light there 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.590
 or lag the stone is in English he has 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.299
 a beautiful animated texture and then 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.060
 we have the funniest part of the 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.090
 texture packs that are the pumpkins for 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.650
 the note seems 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.100
 I don't know if you have a spongebob head 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.800
 present spongebob but look like the head 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.990
 of spongebob a little then from this one 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.210
 the sand is also very beautiful 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.460
 of the souls that is precisely of the souls or 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.460
 of the species of zombies, in short , of the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.010
 souls that open and close the mouth in 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.680
 then repeated the animated texons 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.389
 I think they are the best in general 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.010
 in the textures, however, these must 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.260
 say I 'm really very pretty 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.449
 they blend precisely with all the texture 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.000
 pack going forward we find obviously 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.280
 the minerals guarding minerals how much 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.530
 they are simple but still as usual 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.639
 these too blend very well with the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.650
 tech texture 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.690
 now let's move on to the red stone part 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.360
 part rexton boys is normal is 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.340
 there is nothing that stands out from this 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.930
 part redstone let's try at this point 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.030
 also the redzone on 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.620
 look at is a normal bed in 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.260
 a heated that does this too 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.780
 the animation of red bubbles and 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.639
 now let's get to the doors then I don't have 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.229
 put all the doors but I only put 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.940
 those that I like best and I have to 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.979
 say that they are really very nice and 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.380
 this is the hunting door 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.720
 this is the mahogany strength this la 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.300
 birch door and this brings her to 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.669
 fir I prefer between these four 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.440
 obviously the door from home because 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.539
 I find it wonderful if it looks like a door 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.340
 elegant that usually goes well in all 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.380
 the houses and finally in the part of the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.840
 blocks we find the colored clay the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.840
 colored glass and colored wool 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.970
 great guys the video ends here 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.650
 we'll see you next time if 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.570
 liked this video commented 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.120
 write from the channel share it e 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.370
 put a video like and us there 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.990
 let's see this at the next video 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.180
 is the French drake found all the links 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.730
 descriptions including the black and 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.950
 opti find to make the 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.250
 texture itself and now I leave you with 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.350
 a final transition of images that there 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.790
 show how this trucks tour pak 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.210
 with the shader ways 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.210
 good vision
