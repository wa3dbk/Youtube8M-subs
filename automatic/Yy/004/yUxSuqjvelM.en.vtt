00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.620
 Y 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.039
 a greeting and a presentation by the 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.260
 program the work of Peru that is so 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.210
 efficiently carries it and that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.670
 is doing so much use to him 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.339
 but do not know the background 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.579
 and the technique and the breeding of the horse 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.579
 Peruvian 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.680
 as background then here in this 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.810
 our rich land was always raised in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.330
 Peruvian Paso horses and very good 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.060
 horses that were not as well known in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 Peru and that with the presence of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 car but he lost a bit 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.259
 validity until there for the years 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 fifty a group of little ones among the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.789
 who told me I rescued this 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.460
 but I can not talk about hair 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.909
 Peruvian but I know that they and did not mention 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 some people for many centuries and 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.210
 a lot of time they gave her doctors that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.250
 they generated this horse they deny the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.800
 importance with which we 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.539
 we found in the shelters 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.819
 we have to talk then and going back 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.800
 well over a hundred years ago it was because 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.460
 the 1800s and many years of Don Domingo 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.310
 elias great character of the republic and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.869
 great farmer great entrepreneur and a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.470
 great creator of horse extended in the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.210
 King design area 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.220
 we have to talk about creators 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.800
 connoted from there as the life of the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.830
 fat we have to talk about don jose 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.009
 tired of the creators of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.620
 broken 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.439
 sands in the sierra fence that 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.079
 preserved until recently is this 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:23.640
 breeding for many years as those of 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:28.170
 Gregorio in Bauta as a famous as 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 for ranks touches those you do not touch 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.049
 etcetera is that where we make 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.760
 40 years we collected what was left of there 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.870
 the good of good breeding and what 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.870
 we spread the clumsy 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.970
 more than 50 years ago and I'm spending 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:52.120
 to be in third and receive greatly 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.460
 the assets of many creators that 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.430
 modified the first risks and that a 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.910
 careful work of 50 years conserving 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.060
 this breed of small horses then it 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.270
 I got a video and I got some 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.910
 some satisfactions say the Arabs 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.020
 that the desert is the formator of 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.790
 horses 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.610
 and in this guide these lands and that they 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.220
 in the valleys with distances by 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.900
 travel more than 200 kilometers 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.380
 they were traveled on horseback for more 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.770
 of 400 years and that fire and formed a 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.770
 grease 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.270
 with a lot of temperament with great solidity 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.610
 with great elegance horses because 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.390
 they transported the inhabitants of this 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.880
 land that they have before the 1926 century the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.459
 The first railway and the peak were 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.930
 with walking around pisco ica pisco 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.450
 palpar disco with 70 to 100 200 kilometers 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.560
 for those deserts on horseback that he forged 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.480
 is this head race today as 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.920
 the portfolios the modernity 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.049
 I have tried to postpone we are 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.390
 to rescue him keep them and we support 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.989
 programs like yours both the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.989
 I found so much 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.270
 and
