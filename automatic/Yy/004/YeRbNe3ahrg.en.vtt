day not just once but I think it was a
great<00:01:20.490> tournament<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:22.080> played

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409

really well and we we get an example to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460 
really well and we we get an example to
to<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> holy<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.150> sports<00:01:27.479> too<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.409> we

another good and good story to tell but
it<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.739> not<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.980> main<00:02:20.540> goal<00:02:34.670> well<00:02:35.670> he<00:02:35.879> mentioned
