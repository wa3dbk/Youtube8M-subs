00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.740
 hello everyone welcome to lethal 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.780
 crisis' and today I 'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.990
 the easiest crossbow in the world 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.330
 it's really that it's very very simple if 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.240
 you want you can propel the propel 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.520
 the projectile the ink in this case with 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.270
 a rubber like this one to look at that is very 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.029
 very powerful and resistant but good 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.110
 Once we going to do with one of these 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.570
 these are two good beige paintings 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.690
 for not very long video se 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.790
 hit already are two paintings or sticks of 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.250
 Coloring for painting 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.220
 and I've stuck each one with the tip 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.620
 to one side as you see white towards 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.200
 this side and the reservation towards this and the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.110
 I have stuck with electrical tape as you can 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.640
 watch 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.460
 and now the only thing we're going to have to 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.380
 do is going to be from a pen in case 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.320
 it's done just like we 're taking the 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.080
 ink and we save it for later and 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.930
 we have to cut this part because 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.240
 you see that it is narrower 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.690
 Well, we have the cannon. I'm going to 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.090
 explain with the saw I could not so 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.770
 I have taken the pliers and I have cut though 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.310
 he mistreated a little bit like you see here 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 but good 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.079
 now the only thing we're going to have to 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.759
 do is going to be catch the cop we're going to 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.020
 use as cannon and paste deposits 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.909
 isolate here above the cultures 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.040
 well we have it already 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.700
 look like a cross 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.010
 now let's put the rubber from here 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.410
 up to this point 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.870
 that's why we had to put every tip of 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.420
 paint to one side to let us 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.640
 this hole to fit the rubber 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.480
 and now we just have to put here 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.480
 the ink 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.130
 our only do we have to put 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.299
 here the ink 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.299
 take both forms 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.980
 and shoot so I'm going to teach you 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.980
 some shots 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.230
 ah
