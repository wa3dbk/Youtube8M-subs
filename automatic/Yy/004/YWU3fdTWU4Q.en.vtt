00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.910
 Hello friends with you ds and today 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.320
 I'll show you some secret places in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.940
 gta online and actually first place or 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.180
 such a not such a small glitch is in 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.850
 Generally how to get inside the cinema 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.779
 In general, we choose one of the three 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.189
 movie theaters 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.800
 I took chose this one go into it 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.590
 we start to watch a movie but immediately 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.290
 after the start we will deliver the phone and 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.120
 go to any mission in which we 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.570
 invited by martin let's say and words 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.300
 or Lester in general, then we go in and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 confirming affirm settings like 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 would start this mission and as soon 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.710
 start see what we start this 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.539
 mission right in the cinema and thereby 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.829
 we can run here not to look 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.250
 all sorts of interesting places because except 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.170
 as 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.090
 do not take advantage of this glitch we 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.060
 we canâ€™t get to another one 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.490
 you can only kill all the visitors they are on 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 we are small at all no attention 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.350
 by the way the picture on the screen for free got to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.930
 You can raise money by the way quite good 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.950
 and let's try to get out of this 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.540
 cinema verteb happen and in general 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.979
 of what happened we started to fall 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.570
 through the textures 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.729
 we can see the whole city at all but through 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.340
 some time we will be back 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:46.780
 come back on our street like this 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.930
 here's a funny lich next this here 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.630
 a place we have to take a helicopter to fly 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.479
 on the skyscraper from the car, we will try 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.810
 get inside this building fb time 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:03.100
 to the building she was still a mission alone 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.850
 and we can actually get into this. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.440
 building and take a walk there it's very cool in 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.019
 In general, we approach this and 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.810
 start here so here in the side here somehow 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.420
 walk from side to side and across 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.819
 some time you have to somehow through 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.300
 this wall just leak out and 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.819
 stupidity that's how i start to fall i 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.150
 just squeezed many times and to release 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.670
 I don't know parachutes 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.590
 Does it affect you? 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.709
 enclose a little hang here 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.580
 buildings see this very building so 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.480
 wrecked just like a mission here 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.830
 you can walk everywhere on different 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.709
 alarms blink here you can be like 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.450
 open the door it is very funny very 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.319
 cool and I remembered right and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.709
 I wanted to go through this mission again 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:07.180
 undress different pb Russians 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:10.160
 symbols everywhere scattered ashes and other 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.260
 the other trash did n't even sell that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.420
 my room here in my flew 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.170
 helicopter or something I donâ€™t remember 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.390
 and from here you can have fun and 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.739
 shoot down all the cars that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:29.180
 come down the highway actually what 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:33.710
 I did, I decided to shoot the bear 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.290
 cars while I'm here on us right away 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.320
 they put stars on copan 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.190
 freeze but we are in a place where we are 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.170
 nobody will get 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.180
 even the players because now see me 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.660
 try to jump out of here on my mind nothing 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.070
 the disk will not work like an invisible wall 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.060
 eisa somehow see me outside 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:59.480
 there is just an ordinary building an ordinary wall 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.320
 glasses and here so here well and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.830
 last place 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.530
 this cave and before the cave is still there 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.880
 gta 5 if you have not seen here actually 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.730
 the location of this cave 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.850
 here are in the middle of this 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.550
 trickle though let's run into it see what 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:23.090
 here here is actually nothing enough 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:27.590
 interesting but still cave it is 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.430
 already cool cool stuff like this 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.330
 she actually looks like I was thinking of course 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.920
 what if aliens and but this 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.870
 my all sorts of fiction there are notions of course 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.160
 Of course in the head took such a thing that 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.700
 if you throw a grenade or something 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.610
 blow up then break a small layer 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.140
 rocks and I fell through in either 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.480
 the room there will wait for me with my 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.470
 favorite jetpack but this did not happen 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.510
 it's also not harmful to dream 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.740
 actually this video ends
