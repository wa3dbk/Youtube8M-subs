00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.110
 colorful eggs and bunnies on this berliner 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.860
 Ostermarkt exists in all forms 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.809
 and colors 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.480
 in Germany they are typical symbols 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:25.830
 But the Easter fests where they come from 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:27.660
 actually applicants need them 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.530
 something symbol of fertility can 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 I imagine 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.840
 in the spring all the little bunnies 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.160
 to be born 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.199
 I really do not know this is not a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.720
 joke may spring after spring 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.500
 that the idea but what the eggs with it 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.270
 therefore have to do the next question and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 there is more to it than just one 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 Answer in many countries are becoming 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.550
 Easter eggs eaten 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.350
 an explanation for this comes from the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.120
 medieval there is a very old thesis 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.610
 and that is also occupied that bayern am 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 Founded by farmers in the farm 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.909
 and then as rent 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.159
 were passed on 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.100
 eggs were first mentioned in writing 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.229
 and easter bunny around 330 years ago 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.200
 a work of the german physician georg 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.210
 symbolized by frankenau the rabbit 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.109
 ever since fertility spring and 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.119
 neuanfang 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.740
 that he brings just eggs 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.170
 especially with that too easter 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.450
 The 40-day fasting time ends 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.700
 they can say that in the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.759
 certainly not so fast to the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.069
 sensuality of the lawn multiply to the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.569
 vitality and that's exactly how it is 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.719
 of course not with the eggs either 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.360
 in the lent with larger and smaller 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.060
 were eaten but collected the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.770
 things for the time afterwards and that's why 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.229
 it is also a festival not only because we 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.569
 is again one is happy to live and 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.729
 My symbolizes in the eggs in 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.729
 mÃ¼hlhausen also the new life 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.910
 not only as decoration do these 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.910
 a good figure on stage 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.380
 They are also very popular as sweets 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.210
 typical of Germany is the custom 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.680
 that the easter bunny hides the eggs 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.730
 and the children on Easter Sunday 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.730
 have to search 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.709
 Of course, that also has analysis again 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.629
 and spiritual dimension one seeks 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.639
 something makes you look for a knowledge 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.680
 and another state not the one 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:34.930
 resurrection and so brings the easter bunny 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.329
 million again this year 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.329
 children's colorful eggs and chocolate latte 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.260
 no matter where the custom originally comes from 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.260
 the main thing is that it tastes good
