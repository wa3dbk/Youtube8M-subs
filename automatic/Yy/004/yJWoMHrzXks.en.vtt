on the real gun it does have an
aesthetically<00:01:01.079> pleasing<00:01:01.109> gas<00:01:01.739> tube<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.579> is

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
aesthetically pleasing gas tube it is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
aesthetically pleasing gas tube it is
exposing<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:03.719> ports<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
exposing they do have these ports on it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
exposing they do have these ports on it
so<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.710> mostly<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.250> sex<00:01:05.549> cuz<00:01:05.760> you're<00:01:05.880> not

so that's mostly for sex cuz you're not

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
so that's mostly for sex cuz you're not
gonna<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.420> actual<00:01:07.020> gas<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:07.740> there

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
gonna get actual gas going through there

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
gonna get actual gas going through there
the<00:01:08.430> other<00:01:08.549> polymer<00:01:08.909> parts<00:01:09.180> include<00:01:09.540> this

the other polymer parts include this
pistol<00:01:10.650> grip<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.280> looks<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.850> similar

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
pistol grip now it looks very similar

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
pistol grip but as you can see it is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
hop-up which is right there now further

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
hop-up which is right there now further
back<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> fire<00:01:36.600> selector

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
back we also have the fire selector

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840

which those of you who use ak's will be

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
which those of you who use ak's will be
familiar<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> top<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.409> safe

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
familiar with this now the top is safe

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.710 
familiar with this now the top is safe
further<00:01:41.280> down<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.700> fully<00:01:42.060> automatic<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.600> all

the way down is semi-automatic now just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.679 
the way down is semi-automatic now just
to<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.600> guess<00:01:45.960> aesthetically<00:01:47.450> realistic<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to be I guess aesthetically realistic to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.749 
to be I guess aesthetically realistic to
the<00:01:48.899> real<00:01:49.170> Israeli<00:01:50.040> military<00:01:50.399> industries

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the real Israeli military industries

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
the real Israeli military industries
Galil<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> fire<00:01:51.990> selector<00:01:52.170> here

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
Galil they do have a fire selector here

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.679 
Galil they do have a fire selector here
on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> left<00:01:52.890> side<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.030> does<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.600> not

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
on the left side but it does not is not

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.990 
on the left side but it does not is not
functionally<00:01:55.680> well<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.729> doesn't

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
functionally well it just doesn't

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.609 
functionally well it just doesn't
function<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.049> aesthetics

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
function it's just there for aesthetics

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.410 
function it's just there for aesthetics
so<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.490> wish<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> functioned<00:02:00.299> but

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so you know I wish it functioned but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.399 
so you know I wish it functioned but
didn't<00:02:00.750> they're<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:01.020> trying<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.320> as

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
didn't they're just trying to be as

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
didn't they're just trying to be as
realistic<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.070> real<00:02:02.250> thing<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.579> possible

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
realistic to the real thing as possible

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.639 
realistic to the real thing as possible
so<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.570> least<00:02:03.869> give<00:02:04.020> them<00:02:04.110> props<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
so I can least give them props for that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.709 
so I can least give them props for that
further<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.670> back<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.030> actually<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.509> an

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
further on back we actually have an

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.990 
further on back we actually have an
enhanced<00:02:07.200> mag<00:02:07.560> release<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.789> using

enhanced mag release so if you are using

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550 
enhanced mag release so if you are using
this<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.479> push<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.289> index

finger and it will release mag it makes

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.220 
finger and it will release mag it makes
it<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> little<00:02:12.750> bit<00:02:12.900> easy

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
it a little bit easy

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.250 
it a little bit easy
to<00:02:13.409> use<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.709> as<00:02:14.340> opposed<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.819> other<00:02:15.110> aks<00:02:16.110> or

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
foldable stock which I'm a big fan of

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.680 
foldable stock which I'm a big fan of
because<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.220> makes<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> easier<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.120> vehicle

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
because it makes it easier for vehicle

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.539 
because it makes it easier for vehicle
boring<00:02:21.989> operations<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.860> operate<00:02:23.220> from<00:02:23.459> a

vehicle and I can personally attest that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.280 
vehicle and I can personally attest that
because<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> did<00:02:26.310> use<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.760> Galil<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> Midwest

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290

because some people don't want to use

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.150 
because some people don't want to use
mid<00:02:51.480> caps<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.170> people<00:02:52.410> don't<00:02:52.500> use<00:02:52.769> high<00:02:52.890> caps

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
