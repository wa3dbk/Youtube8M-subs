younger to think about being an inventor
and<00:00:51.250> but<00:00:51.610> I<00:00:51.640> didn't<00:00:52.089> actually<00:00:52.300> think<00:00:52.539> I<00:00:52.839> would

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
and but I didn't actually think I would

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.290 
and but I didn't actually think I would
ever<00:00:53.140> choose<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:54.850> standing<00:00:55.000> here

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300
