designing<00:02:10.920> something<00:02:11.130> that's<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.820> thin<00:02:12.120> in

designing something that's this thin in
this<00:02:12.510> light<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.740> really<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.850> hard<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
this light it's really really hard to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.470 
this light it's really really hard to
design<00:02:16.110> something<00:02:16.590> that's<00:02:16.800> also<00:02:17.480> strong

I<00:02:45.260> think<00:02:45.319> one<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.010> most<00:02:46.280> beautiful

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
I think one of the most beautiful

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.979 
I think one of the most beautiful
products<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:47.659> other<00:02:47.840> design<00:02:49.780> one<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.900> the

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
products with other design one of the

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.679 
products with other design one of the
key<00:02:51.260> design<00:02:51.799> decisions<00:02:52.549> that<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.150> made<00:02:53.359> early

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
key design decisions that we made early

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.080 
key design decisions that we made early
on<00:02:53.720> with<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.200> new<00:02:54.349> macbook<00:02:54.769> air<00:02:54.980> was<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.849> use

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
on with the new macbook air was to use

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.809 
on with the new macbook air was to use
flash<00:02:56.540> for<00:02:56.900> storage<00:02:57.319> we<00:02:58.010> do<00:02:58.190> flash<00:02:58.459> storage

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
flash for storage we do flash storage

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.399 
flash for storage we do flash storage
differently<00:02:59.510> than<00:02:59.720> other<00:02:59.900> computer

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
differently than other computer

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.220 
differently than other computer
manufacturers<00:03:01.480> rather<00:03:02.480> than<00:03:02.659> package<00:03:03.079> it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
manufacturers rather than package it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.319 
manufacturers rather than package it
inside<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.620> housing<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.579> placed<00:03:04.909> the<00:03:05.090> chips

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
inside a housing we placed the chips

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.720 
inside a housing we placed the chips
directly<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.139> logic<00:03:06.530> board<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.280> we<00:03:07.430> can<00:03:07.609> be

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
directly on the logic board so we can be

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.640 
directly on the logic board so we can be
much<00:03:07.939> more<00:03:08.000> efficient<00:03:08.720> about<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.170> way<00:03:09.319> we<00:03:09.349> do

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
much more efficient about the way we do

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.339 
much more efficient about the way we do
space<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.760> gives<00:03:11.000> us<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.299> lot<00:03:11.540> more<00:03:11.599> room<00:03:12.019> for

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
space this gives us a lot more room for

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.640 
space this gives us a lot more room for
