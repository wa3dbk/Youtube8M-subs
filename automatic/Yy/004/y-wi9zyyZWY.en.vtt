going<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.900> tie<00:02:18.050> this<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.470> on<00:02:18.650> top<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.130> fly

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
going to tie this in on top of the fly

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.110 
going to tie this in on top of the fly
right<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:21.980> top<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.700> thorax<00:02:23.540> here

just a little bit about third of the way
back<00:02:39.690> from<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.140> eye<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.440> hook<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:42.050> take

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
back from the eye of the hook and take

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.690 
back from the eye of the hook and take
my<00:02:43.200> thread<00:02:43.410> forward<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.070> eye<00:02:44.100> I'm<00:02:44.490> going

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
my thread forward to the eye I'm going

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.580 
my thread forward to the eye I'm going
to<00:02:44.760> pull<00:02:44.940> all<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.300> floor<00:02:45.810> fiber<00:02:46.080> over<00:02:46.470> the

that's all there is to the jujube midge

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.369 
that's all there is to the jujube midge
very<00:03:38.010> simple<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.940> very<00:03:39.180> effective<00:03:39.360> fly<00:03:39.959> for
