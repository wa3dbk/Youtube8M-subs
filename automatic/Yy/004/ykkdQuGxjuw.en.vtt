00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.320
 I greet my friends with you liquid 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.780
 steel and here came the new patch and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.450
 Today in this video we will look at 7 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.840
 tanks that were introduced in this patch 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.880
 and the first unit this t-54 is legendary 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.590
 soviet medium tank which was 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.289
 developed at the end of the great 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.470
 patriotic war in armored warfare he 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.230
 is on the second level between pt-76 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.480
 and t-62 and at the moment in the game 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.790
 presented early model with 100 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.340
 millimeter cannon d-10t 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.340
 in principle, quite logical replacement 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.320
 considering that that branch and bt of a scorpion 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.530
 in turn transferred to the third 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.829
 level branches bbm Well next 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.550
 the car is m48 patton american 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.219
 medium tank 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.340
 post-war period it is located 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.630
 branches safeever Flea on the second level as the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.259
 replacing the love 150 is followed by the m60 and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.190
 leopard leopard by the way yes it is 3 liters and 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.610
 m 62 is no longer premium 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.060
 becomes a regular tank level 4 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.400
 but as the Italian of 40 I can 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.090
 say about this paton played on it 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 a couple of fights 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.500
 the tank liked however that 50 four 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.330
 what patton 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.820
 pretty good tanks and 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.640
 they definitely fit better 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.450
 branches than the same scorpion or love 150 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.820
 further consider tank object 430 is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.000
 experimental version of the tank t-64 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.880
 It was created in the USSR in the 50s for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.549
 replace the outdated t-54 and t-55 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.310
 in armored warfare it is premium 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.439
 second level car strong armor and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.329
 powerful gun allows him to effectively 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.070
 fight with enemy tanks and you 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.070
 know once again make sure that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.009
 worries about warfare buying prema suffering 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.269
 will not be 4 tank which developers 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.519
 they put into the game this centaurus 120 well 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.470
 clearly he was introduced as an alternative to lave 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.340
 600 alpha with him 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.710
 higher speed a little more and a little overclocking 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.780
 faster but compared to the same lava at 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.020
 there is absolutely no armor 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.810
 there is no catch either, but the feeling is that a centaurus 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.260
 120 just made of cardboard also 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.980
 Centauri longer information time more 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.080
 reload time and greater variation in 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.400
 Generally what exactly is this to take to you 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.530
 decide for yourself f in 721 fox appeared in 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.500
 armored warfare on the fifth level immediately 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.010
 after swing fair and previous car ppm 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.810
 level five has been moved to 6 a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.120
 vizul 1 to 7 fox was established in the 1970s 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.430
 years to replace saladin armored cars ev 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.830
 fr red low silhouette and excellent 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.390
 mobility make it great 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.530
 a little scout for this kid 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 have ptu 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.550
 and in the drum of them for two I played on 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.850
 this tank a few fights 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.310
 tank just fire 30 millimeter cannon 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.650
 shit classmates both in board and in 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.140
 forage and with damage 106 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.910
 and a cassette for six shells you for 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.620
 seconds from your own 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.680
 enemy damage 600 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.340
 but if you had charged pturs then all 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.320
 800 generally repeat machine class 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.140
 worthy representative of his branch 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.510
 next is such an interesting machine as 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.400
 runs panzer 57 it was developed in 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.950
 1970s and was part of 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.470
 bmp marder with 57 millimeter 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.630
 bofors automatic gun aiming 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.519
 the project was easy but good 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.760
 armed fire support vehicles 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.920
 mass production fluent panzer so 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.019
 and did not go in the game is the light tank of the fifth 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.459
 level which is at marat 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.480
 shishkina between lt swedes and stingray 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.400
 Sorry to ride it with me 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.700
 turned out but judging by the characteristics 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.970
 tank pretty crediting well and the main 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.850
 the hero of our video is t-72 and this 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.190
 an improved version of t 72 which 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.030
 fill the gap between t-72 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.100
 80 branches of Marat Shishkin T-72 is different 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.350
 from the basic version more perfect 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.660
 protection of a modernized weapon and 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.460
 better mobility had the pleasure 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.950
 roll out this tank and you guys know 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.450
 tell you what is so rare 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.550
 representative of that branch which 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.410
 pleasure and despite 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.900
 that most fights are not on it 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.560
 turned out not strong successful because 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.650
 that threw to 8 mg seventh anyway tank 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.530
 cool that's all the tanks that led 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.810
 developers in this patch and I wish you 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.680
