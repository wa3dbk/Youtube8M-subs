00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
of the last ones of the day okay so I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
of the last ones of the day okay so I
remember<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.380> I'd<00:01:28.439> already<00:01:28.710> done<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.310> 40

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
shoot them they're in a hostage

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.310 
shoot them they're in a hostage
situation<00:05:44.120> you<00:05:44.480> shoot<00:05:44.690> them<00:05:44.810> in<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:44.930> top<00:05:45.110> lip

because<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.130> takes<00:05:46.310> out<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.670> brain<00:05:46.880> stem<00:05:47.180> so

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
because that takes out the brain stem so

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.870 
because that takes out the brain stem so
there's<00:05:47.840> no<00:05:47.960> reflex<00:05:48.440> so<00:05:48.920> they<00:05:49.040> can't<00:05:49.280> they<00:05:49.670> die

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
there's no reflex so they can't they die

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.510 
there's no reflex so they can't they die
