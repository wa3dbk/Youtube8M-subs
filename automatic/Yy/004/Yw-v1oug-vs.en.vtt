I I adored the show my parents watched

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.660 
I I adored the show my parents watched
it<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.050> lot<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.650> was<00:02:12.800> little<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.430> didn't

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
it a lot and I was little but I didn't

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.330 
it a lot and I was little but I didn't
really<00:02:13.850> get<00:02:14.300> involved<00:02:14.630> until<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.800> new<00:02:15.950> movie

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
really get involved until the new movie

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.240 
really get involved until the new movie
came<00:02:16.550> out<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.650> when<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.739> was<00:02:18.860> watching<00:02:19.010> it

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
came out and when I was watching it

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.680 
came out and when I was watching it
seemed<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:19.850> there<00:02:19.880> were<00:02:20.150> some<00:02:20.330> things<00:02:20.510> that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
seemed like there were some things that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.020 
seemed like there were some things that
were<00:02:20.870> different<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.520> thought<00:02:22.730> that's

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
were different and I thought that's

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.600 
were different and I thought that's
weird<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.660> don't<00:02:23.900> remember<00:02:23.989> Spock<00:02:24.860> ever<00:02:25.130> having

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
weird I don't remember Spock ever having

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.180 
weird I don't remember Spock ever having
a<00:02:25.790> thing<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.180> her<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.440> I'm<00:02:27.650> being<00:02:27.890> able<00:02:28.100> to
