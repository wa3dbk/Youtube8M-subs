00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.910
 the additional students besides years in which the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.730

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.040
 the way they offered NATO to Tirana to have the students with z 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 this method we could have 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.040
 The main crop is briefly in as they look on the Internet on top of the honor point

 Learn more information against anyone who speaks professionally 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.560
 it still has to be worked on 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.090

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.119
 Japanese school canteens 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.549

 the students complete the text 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.849
 Step 1

 after the active HÃ¶rmann 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.459
 Let the students lead the test as many times as possible 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.479
 this united 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.959
 you get rivets in the leather 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.959

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:32.009
 the students can actively participate in the lessons 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.419
 It is often like that 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.499
 the first one was the action and whether or not you could have extra running times 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.809
 anything but a chance Europe is flowing 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.089
 So here's a buzz you've been on hold of Reduce
