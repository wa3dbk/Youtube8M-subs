about<00:00:28.520> for<00:00:28.939> a<00:00:29.000> company<00:00:29.270> like<00:00:29.329> Honda<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.869> do

that it's pretty impressive

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.009 
that it's pretty impressive
I<00:00:31.460> think<00:00:31.789> contractors<00:00:32.269> for<00:00:32.449> sure<00:00:32.660> will<00:00:32.899> use

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
I think contractors for sure will use

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:34.630 
I think contractors for sure will use
the<00:00:33.199> long<00:00:33.470> range<00:00:33.680> Buffalo<00:00:34.100> because<00:00:34.339> they've

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
the long range Buffalo because they've

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.369 
the long range Buffalo because they've
adapted<00:00:34.879> what<00:00:35.390> was<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.540> bloody<00:00:35.900> good<00:00:36.079> mower<00:00:36.260> in

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
adapted what was a bloody good mower in

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.079 
adapted what was a bloody good mower in
the<00:00:36.470> first<00:00:36.680> place<00:00:36.890> made<00:00:37.309> it<00:00:37.430> more<00:00:37.550> commercial

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
the first place made it more commercial

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.360 
the first place made it more commercial
friendly<00:00:38.390> with<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.050> 10%<00:00:39.260> larger<00:00:39.710> bag<00:00:40.159> it

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
friendly with the 10% larger bag it

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.100 
friendly with the 10% larger bag it
makes<00:00:40.579> mowing<00:00:40.909> easier<00:00:41.300> because<00:00:41.659> you<00:00:41.900> can<00:00:42.019> go

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
makes mowing easier because you can go

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.079 
makes mowing easier because you can go
on<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.409> on<00:00:42.530> without<00:00:42.860> actually<00:00:43.519> changing<00:00:43.699> and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
larger bag it's a 10% greater caching

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.320

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
capacity with better air flow so it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.600 
capacity with better air flow so it
actually<00:00:59.720> catches<00:01:00.350> grass<00:01:00.920> more<00:01:01.189> efficiently

actually<00:01:44.210> breathing<00:01:44.450> cleaner<00:01:44.900> air<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.350> again

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
actually breathing cleaner air and again

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.380

with<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.130> amount<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.400> mowing<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.760> do<00:01:46.820> they're

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
with the amount of mowing I do they're

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.580

I<00:01:48.740> think<00:01:49.130> Honda<00:01:49.400> engines<00:01:49.729> are<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.090> best<00:01:50.299> in

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
I think Honda engines are the best in
