does a really good job of protecting the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.740 
does a really good job of protecting the
corners<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.910> see<00:02:24.090> anyway<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.540> clip

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
corners you can see anyway like a clip

on<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.960> back<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.920> pops<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.970> this

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
on the back here this pops out and this

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.840 
on the back here this pops out and this
acts<00:02:27.690> as<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.020> stand<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.950> when<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.130> turn<00:02:29.700> this

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
acts as a stand so when you turn this

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.900 
acts as a stand so when you turn this
around<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.470> put<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.560> down<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.850> you

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
around here put this down so if you

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.340 
around here put this down so if you
don't<00:02:33.060> watch<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.240> videos<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.960> can<00:02:34.110> do<00:02:34.200> like

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
don't watch your videos you can do like

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.380 
don't watch your videos you can do like
that<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.430> slightly<00:02:35.850> adjust<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> little

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
that you can slightly adjust a little

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.030 
that you can slightly adjust a little
not<00:02:36.720> by<00:02:36.840> much<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.320> kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.650> does<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.800> for

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
not by much it just kind of does it for

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.680 
not by much it just kind of does it for
one<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.970> type<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.210> thing<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.480> actually

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
one one type of thing and it actually

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.480 
one one type of thing and it actually
hits<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.960> ridges<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.530> doesn't<00:02:40.740> slide<00:02:40.950> past

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
hits the ridges so it doesn't slide past

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.290 
hits the ridges so it doesn't slide past
that<00:02:41.900> or<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.680> want<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.890> type<00:02:44.210> there's<00:02:45.210> a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
that or if you want to type there's a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.790 
that or if you want to type there's a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
secondary one right here a smaller one

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.620 
secondary one right here a smaller one
and<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.670> makes<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> angle<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.360> little<00:02:48.540> bit

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
and that makes the angle a little bit

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.210 
and that makes the angle a little bit
lower<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:49.410> either<00:02:49.560> gonna<00:02:49.710> type<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.070> there

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
lower so it's either gonna type on there
