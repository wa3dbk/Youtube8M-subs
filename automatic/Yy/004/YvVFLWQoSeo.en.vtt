00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.860 
a I've had multiple short talks with
Larry<00:07:20.560> Brown<00:07:20.890> and<00:07:21.450> one<00:07:22.450> of<00:07:22.540> the<00:07:22.600> things<00:07:22.660> you

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
Larry Brown and one of the things you

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.130 
Larry Brown and one of the things you
said<00:07:23.170> you<00:07:23.320> know<00:07:23.470> every<00:07:24.400> kid<00:07:25.020> believes<00:07:26.020> he

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.140 
said you know every kid believes he

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.260 
said you know every kid believes he
should<00:07:26.170> play<00:07:26.500> a<00:07:26.620> lot<00:07:26.920> and<00:07:27.190> just<00:07:27.220> can't<00:07:28.030> happen

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
should play a lot and just can't happen

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.800 
should play a lot and just can't happen
and<00:07:28.840> so<00:07:29.520> I've<00:07:30.520> always<00:07:30.850> remember<00:07:31.660> in<00:07:31.720> the

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
and so I've always remember in the

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.000 
and so I've always remember in the
beginning<00:07:31.930> of<00:07:32.170> season<00:07:32.320> I<00:07:32.410> said<00:07:32.590> look<00:07:32.710> we<00:07:32.860> could

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010 
beginning of season I said look we could

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.910 
beginning of season I said look we could
go<00:07:33.100> 11<00:07:33.520> deep<00:07:33.700> and<00:07:34.230> it's<00:07:35.230> you<00:07:35.770> know<00:07:35.830> it's

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:35.920 
go 11 deep and it's you know it's

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.580 
go 11 deep and it's you know it's
frustrating<00:07:36.250> for<00:07:36.670> a<00:07:36.730> kid<00:07:37.000> I<00:07:37.030> think<00:07:37.180> who<00:07:37.590> thinks

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590 
frustrating for a kid I think who thinks

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.840 
frustrating for a kid I think who thinks
he's<00:07:38.680> going<00:07:38.800> to<00:07:38.890> play<00:07:38.980> a<00:07:39.070> lot<00:07:39.310> doesn't<00:07:39.550> play<00:07:39.820> a

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:39.850 
he's going to play a lot doesn't play a

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.580 
he's going to play a lot doesn't play a
lot<00:07:40.030> because<00:07:40.300> the<00:07:40.360> coach<00:07:40.630> hasn't<00:07:40.870> another

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:41.590 
lot because the coach hasn't another

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.830 
lot because the coach hasn't another
thing<00:07:41.800> in<00:07:41.920> mind<00:07:42.130> because<00:07:42.280> of<00:07:42.520> rotation<00:07:43.120> and<00:07:43.660> I

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 
thing in mind because of rotation and I

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.720 
thing in mind because of rotation and I
just<00:07:44.050> think<00:07:44.290> that<00:07:44.470> they<00:07:44.860> have<00:07:45.070> to<00:07:45.190> understand

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.730 
just think that they have to understand

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.510 
just think that they have to understand
that<00:07:46.000> and<00:07:46.210> come<00:07:46.870> back<00:07:47.050> and<00:07:47.380> play<00:07:48.010> harder<00:07:48.460> in

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 
that and come back and play harder in

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.830 
that and come back and play harder in
practice<00:07:48.580> and<00:07:49.120> believe<00:07:49.420> that<00:07:49.600> they're<00:07:49.720> going

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 
practice and believe that they're going

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.810 
practice and believe that they're going
to<00:07:49.930> get<00:07:50.050> a<00:07:50.110> chance<00:07:50.440> like<00:07:51.070> they've<00:07:51.280> always<00:07:51.490> had

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:51.820 
to get a chance like they've always had

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.480 
to get a chance like they've always had
a<00:07:51.880> chance<00:07:52.180> everyone's<00:07:52.600> had<00:07:52.750> a<00:07:52.780> chance<00:07:53.050> to<00:07:53.230> play
