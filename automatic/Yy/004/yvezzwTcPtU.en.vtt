00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
one I call ghosting and you need a few

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.959 
one I call ghosting and you need a few
basic<00:00:12.360> supplies<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.559> technique<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
basic supplies to do this technique and

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.019 
basic supplies to do this technique and
need<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.480> art<00:00:16.139> journal<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.279> set<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.820> pages

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
need a art journal with a set of pages

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.650 
need a art journal with a set of pages
pre<00:00:18.810> gesso<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.529> sanded<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.730> you're<00:00:21.539> gonna

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
pre gesso and sanded so you're gonna

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.710 
pre gesso and sanded so you're gonna
need<00:00:21.750> gesso<00:00:24.590> also<00:00:25.699> some<00:00:26.699> sharpies<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.449> least

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
need gesso also some sharpies at least

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.839 
need gesso also some sharpies at least
three<00:00:27.990> colors<00:00:28.410> work<00:00:29.250> best<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
three colors work best for this

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.630 
three colors work best for this
technique<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:31.080> use<00:00:31.140> more<00:00:31.560> colors<00:00:31.920> as

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
technique you can use more colors as

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.810 
technique you can use more colors as
many<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:34.020> see<00:00:34.290> fit<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.130> you're<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.730> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
many as you see fit and you're going to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.790 
many as you see fit and you're going to
need<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:37.370> wide<00:00:38.370> flat<00:00:39.059> brush<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:40.260> spread<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
need a wide flat brush to spread the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.639 
need a wide flat brush to spread the
gesso<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.660> journal<00:00:43.020> after<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.500> do

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
gesso out in the journal after you do

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.360 
gesso out in the journal after you do
the<00:00:43.770> writing<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> essence<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> this

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
the writing but the essence of this

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.639 
the writing but the essence of this
technique<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.390> write<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.350> page

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
technique is that you write on a page

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.470 
technique is that you write on a page
first<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.340> direction<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.180> color

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
first in one direction in one color

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.270 
first in one direction in one color
starting<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.469> lightest<00:00:52.829> color<00:00:53.039> I'm

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
starting with your lightest color I'm

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.979 
starting with your lightest color I'm
gonna<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.640> lime<00:00:54.510> green<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.190> then<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:56.579> that

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
gonna do lime green and then over that

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
gonna do lime green and then over that
color<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.399> another<00:00:59.399> color<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:00.030> another

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
color in another color in another

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.000 
color in another color in another
direction<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.320> you're<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> 90

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
direction so you're going to go to 90

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.969 
direction so you're going to go to 90
degrees<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> I'm<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> use

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
degrees to it so I'm going to use

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.100 
degrees to it so I'm going to use
magenta<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.760> next<00:01:06.030> darkest<00:01:06.420> color<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
magenta for my next darkest color and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.399 
magenta for my next darkest color and
then<00:01:07.740> your<00:01:08.670> final<00:01:08.939> shade<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.170> said<00:01:10.350> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
then your final shade like I said you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.679 
then your final shade like I said you
can<00:01:10.560> work<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.340> could<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.850> yellow

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
can work your way up you could go yellow

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.679 
can work your way up you could go yellow
orange<00:01:13.290> red<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.240> forth

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
orange red you know so on and so forth

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.710 
orange red you know so on and so forth
until<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> finally<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.450> black<00:01:18.450> layer

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
until you finally get to a black layer

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410 
until you finally get to a black layer
and<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.220> done<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:21.210> going

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and then when you're done you're going

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.170 
and then when you're done you're going
to<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.570> over<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> whole<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:23.400> some

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to go over the whole thing with some

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
to go over the whole thing with some
gesso<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:26.310> happens<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.869> color<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
gesso and what happens is the color of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
gesso and what happens is the color of
the<00:01:29.220> ink<00:01:29.579> starts<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.360> lift<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.900> through<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the ink starts to lift up through the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.819 
the ink starts to lift up through the
gesso<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.409> finished

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
gesso and you can see it in the finished

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.100 
gesso and you can see it in the finished
piece<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.150> makes<00:01:36.329> another<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.990> great

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
piece so it makes another really great

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.840 
piece so it makes another really great
background<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.100> also<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.880> gives<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> some<00:01:39.590> a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
background it's also it gives you some a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
background it's also it gives you some a
way<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> journal<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.689> your<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.890> art

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
way to journal in your in your art

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.639 
way to journal in your in your art
journal<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> no<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.470> you've

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
journal and no one can see what you've

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.260 
journal and no one can see what you've
journaled<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.880> you've<00:01:48.000> got<00:01:48.119> something

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
journaled so if you've got something

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.609 
journaled so if you've got something
particularly<00:01:48.720> painful<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> can

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
particularly painful going on you can

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289 
particularly painful going on you can
write<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.369> obscure<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
write it down like this obscure it and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.830 
write it down like this obscure it and
then<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:52.049> art<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.619> top<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:54.390> gesso

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
then do more art on top of it the gesso

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.440 
then do more art on top of it the gesso
again<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.740> can

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
again you can

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.399 
again you can
paint<00:01:56.719> on<00:01:56.869> top<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.289> that<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.960> know<00:02:00.049> get

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
paint on top of that and you know get

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.410 
paint on top of that and you know get
something<00:02:00.680> really<00:02:00.799> cool<00:02:01.039> going<00:02:01.250> on<00:02:01.460> grab<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
something really cool going on grab a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.029 
something really cool going on grab a
cup<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.659> coffee<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.380> put<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:03.680> some<00:02:03.860> good<00:02:03.979> music

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
cup of coffee and put on some good music

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:29.550 
cup of coffee and put on some good music
and<00:02:04.810> watch<00:02:05.810> as<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:06.979> technique<00:02:07.369> so

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.530 

that's<00:02:30.560> what<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.099> page<00:02:31.910> looks<00:02:31.940> like<00:02:32.299> when

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that's what the page looks like when

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.449 
that's what the page looks like when
you're<00:02:32.660> finished<00:02:32.690> writing<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.650> three

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
you're finished writing in three

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.190 
you're finished writing in three
directions<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.180> could<00:02:35.299> go<00:02:35.450> further<00:02:35.720> instead

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
directions you could go further instead

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.680 
directions you could go further instead
of<00:02:36.290> do<00:02:36.440> black<00:02:36.709> here<00:02:37.040> do<00:02:37.340> like<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> dark<00:02:38.000> blue<00:02:38.329> and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
of do black here do like a dark blue and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.039 
of do black here do like a dark blue and
then<00:02:39.380> do<00:02:39.829> black<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.000> direction<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.989> that

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
then do black in this direction and that

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.910 
then do black in this direction and that
would<00:02:42.680> further<00:02:43.299> obscure<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:46.640> writing

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
would further obscure the the writing

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.460 
would further obscure the the writing
I'm<00:02:48.920> gonna<00:02:49.760> grab<00:02:49.970> my<00:02:50.030> handy<00:02:50.599> deli<00:02:50.810> dandy

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
I'm gonna grab my handy deli dandy

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:17.590 
I'm gonna grab my handy deli dandy
pallet<00:02:52.280> slash<00:02:54.400> lid<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:57.489> cover<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.670> with<00:02:59.980> gesso

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:28.790 

I<00:03:24.460> don't<00:03:25.460> know<00:03:25.520> if<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.850> see<00:03:26.150> that

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.360 

how<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.580> how<00:03:30.450> its<00:03:30.660> ghosted<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:32.070> can<00:03:32.220> see

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
how it's how its ghosted you can see

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.450 
how it's how its ghosted you can see
that<00:03:32.520> it's<00:03:32.640> definitely<00:03:33.120> like<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:34.460> colors

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
that it's definitely like the colors

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.040 
that it's definitely like the colors
have<00:03:35.640> lifted<00:03:35.940> up<00:03:36.030> through<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.330> gesso<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.960> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
have lifted up through the gesso so the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.710 
have lifted up through the gesso so the
gesso<00:03:37.350> hasn't<00:03:37.740> really<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.730> know<00:03:38.850> covered<00:03:39.630> it

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
gesso hasn't really you know covered it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.810 
gesso hasn't really you know covered it
completely<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.980> could<00:03:41.100> add<00:03:41.250> another<00:03:41.400> layer

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
completely you could add another layer

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.260 
completely you could add another layer
of<00:03:42.000> gesso<00:03:42.680> thicker<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.830> some<00:03:44.100> layers<00:03:44.370> some

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
of gesso thicker in some layers some

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.150 
of gesso thicker in some layers some
colors<00:03:45.630> lift<00:03:45.930> through<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.230> gesso<00:03:46.740> even

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
colors lift through the gesso even

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.090 
colors lift through the gesso even
better<00:03:47.340> than<00:03:47.550> other<00:03:47.700> colors<00:03:48.890> I'm<00:03:49.890> going<00:03:49.950> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
better than other colors I'm going to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.190 
better than other colors I'm going to
add<00:03:50.250> some<00:03:52.010> watercolor<00:03:53.010> crayons<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:54.200> just

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
add some watercolor crayons to this just

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.260 
add some watercolor crayons to this just
add<00:03:55.380> some<00:03:55.560> additional<00:03:55.740> color<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:57.030> then

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
add some additional color and then

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:23.520 
add some additional color and then
another<00:03:57.690> layer<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.110> gesso<00:03:58.320> over<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.740> top

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.860 

so<00:04:24.430> something<00:04:24.760> really<00:04:24.790> cool<00:04:25.240> it's<00:04:25.480> happened

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
so something really cool it's happened

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.120 
so something really cool it's happened
as<00:04:26.050> it's<00:04:26.290> dry<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.640> pink<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.480> magenta

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
as it's dry is that the pink the magenta

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.770 
as it's dry is that the pink the magenta
sharpie<00:04:30.130> has<00:04:30.400> lifted<00:04:30.970> up<00:04:31.090> through<00:04:31.360> more<00:04:31.750> than

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
sharpie has lifted up through more than

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.870 
sharpie has lifted up through more than
the<00:04:32.110> other<00:04:32.260> colors<00:04:32.550> usually<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.670> black

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
the other colors usually the black

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.240 
the other colors usually the black
sharpie<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.480> what<00:04:34.720> really<00:04:35.470> looks<00:04:35.800> through<00:04:36.040> but

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
sharpie is what really looks through but

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.430 
sharpie is what really looks through but
in<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:36.460> case<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:37.330> magenta<00:04:37.810> really<00:04:38.110> lifted

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
in this case the magenta really lifted

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.780 
in this case the magenta really lifted
through<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.860> think<00:04:39.070> it's<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.250> really<00:04:39.520> cool

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
through so I think it's a really cool

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.610 
through so I think it's a really cool
kind<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.620> kind<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.710> kind<00:04:41.920> of<00:04:42.220> background
