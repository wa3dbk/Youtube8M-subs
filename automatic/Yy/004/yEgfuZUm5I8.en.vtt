00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the multipliers work and I've explained

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.030 
the multipliers work and I've explained
it<00:02:10.289> before<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.790> think<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.660> those<00:02:12.780> who<00:02:13.040> had

it before I think but for those who had

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.500 
it before I think but for those who had
didn't<00:02:14.520> hear<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.000> first<00:02:15.030> few<00:02:15.540> times<00:02:15.810> or

mission and I split up into the six part
as<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.760> also<00:04:12.030> did<00:04:12.420> with<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> next<00:04:12.959> mission
