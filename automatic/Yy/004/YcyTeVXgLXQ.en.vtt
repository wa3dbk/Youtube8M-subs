smaller<00:02:50.110> tree<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:51.130> tree<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.489> about<00:02:51.549> three

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
smaller tree this tree is about three

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.610 
smaller tree this tree is about three
years<00:02:52.209> old<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:55.480> happens<00:02:55.900> with<00:02:56.140> apple

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
years old and what happens with apple

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.180 
years old and what happens with apple
trees<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.500> plant<00:02:59.860> them<00:02:59.950> from

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
trees is that if you plant them from

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.240 
trees is that if you plant them from
seed<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.000> can't<00:03:01.299> tell<00:03:01.739> what<00:03:02.739> kind<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
seed and you can't tell what kind of

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.059 
seed and you can't tell what kind of
food<00:03:03.459> you're<00:03:03.640> going<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:04.209> because<00:03:05.069> they

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
food you're going to get because they

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.710 
food you're going to get because they
cross<00:03:06.340> pollinate<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:09.599> usually<00:03:10.599> the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
cross pollinate and usually the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.960 
cross pollinate and usually the
crabapples<00:03:11.049> they<00:03:11.709> have<00:03:11.890> more<00:03:12.099> flowers<00:03:12.670> and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
crabapples they have more flowers and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.800 
crabapples they have more flowers and
their<00:03:13.480> DNA<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.349> stronger<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.569> have<00:03:16.690> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
their DNA is stronger so if you have the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.090 
their DNA is stronger so if you have the
seed<00:03:17.080> from<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:18.480> cooking<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.750> pole<00:03:20.019> or<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.380> desert<00:03:20.980> a

seed from a cooking a pole or a desert a

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.360 
seed from a cooking a pole or a desert a
pole<00:03:21.370> from<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.480> seed<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.859> tree<00:03:24.190> will

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
pole from that seed that tree will

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.060 
pole from that seed that tree will
produce<00:03:24.420> some<00:03:25.420> kind<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.810> crabapple<00:03:26.079> now

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
produce some kind of a crabapple now

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
you first plant them they'll need

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.430 
you first plant them they'll need
watering<00:04:41.340> every<00:04:41.700> day<00:04:42.570> for<00:04:42.900> about<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.260> first

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
watering every day for about the first

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.580 
watering every day for about the first
month<00:04:43.830> after<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.880> if<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.570> water<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:46.140> very

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
month after that if you water it very

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.550 
month after that if you water it very
thoroughly<00:04:47.460> once<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:48.090> week<00:04:48.300> so<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.960> roots<00:04:49.200> go

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
thoroughly once a week so the roots go

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.650 
thoroughly once a week so the roots go
deep<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.160> they<00:04:50.520> become<00:04:50.790> drought<00:04:51.090> resistance

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
deep and they become drought resistance

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.820 
deep and they become drought resistance
that<00:04:52.320> would<00:04:52.500> be<00:04:52.620> enough<00:04:52.920> and<00:04:53.160> then<00:04:54.650> after<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
that would be enough and then after the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.490 
that would be enough and then after the
first<00:04:56.040> year<00:04:56.460> or<00:04:56.910> so<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.960> wouldn't<00:04:58.260> need<00:04:58.470> to

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
first year or so you wouldn't need to

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.520 
first year or so you wouldn't need to
water<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.460> except<00:04:59.850> in<00:05:00.060> drought<00:05:00.630> conditions<00:05:00.660> or

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
water it except in drought conditions or

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.630 
water it except in drought conditions or
very<00:05:01.800> dry<00:05:01.980> weather<00:05:03.650> if<00:05:04.650> you<00:05:05.340> want<00:05:05.550> to

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
very dry weather if you want to

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.700 
very dry weather if you want to
encourage<00:05:06.350> heavy<00:05:07.350> cropping<00:05:08.000> then<00:05:09.710> it's

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
encourage heavy cropping then it's

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.450 
encourage heavy cropping then it's
advisable<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.760> water<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.660> with<00:05:13.320> about<00:05:13.650> 10

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
advisable to water it with about 10

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.820 
advisable to water it with about 10
liters<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.120> water<00:05:15.420> so<00:05:15.870> about<00:05:16.020> one<00:05:16.230> bucket<00:05:16.620> full

to prune this normally each year but
only<00:05:59.160> if<00:05:59.580> you<00:05:59.670> want<00:05:59.820> to<00:05:59.850> limit<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.270> size<00:06:00.510> you

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
only if you want to limit the size you

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.230 
only if you want to limit the size you

could prune it back in July or August as

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.960 
could prune it back in July or August as
we<00:06:03.360> mentioned<00:06:03.720> earlier<00:06:04.190> they<00:06:05.190> also<00:06:05.370> benefit

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
we mentioned earlier they also benefit

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.080 
we mentioned earlier they also benefit
from<00:06:06.000> mulching<00:06:06.870> in<00:06:07.080> spring<00:06:07.500> with<00:06:08.010> well<00:06:08.760> rotted

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
from mulching in spring with well rotted

from mulching in spring with well rotted
manure<00:06:09.270> or<00:06:09.750> compost<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:11.580> cover<00:06:11.850> the<00:06:12.090> root<00:06:12.300> area

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
manure or compost to cover the root area

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.280 
manure or compost to cover the root area
this<00:06:13.500> is<00:06:13.680> some<00:06:14.460> you<00:06:15.120> can<00:06:15.300> see<00:06:15.420> the<00:06:15.570> compost<00:06:16.080> was

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
this is some you can see the compost was

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.950 
this is some you can see the compost was
some<00:06:16.790> some<00:06:17.790> weeds<00:06:18.060> have<00:06:18.270> grown<00:06:18.480> over<00:06:18.690> there

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
some some weeds have grown over there

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.020 
some some weeds have grown over there
and<00:06:19.230> this<00:06:19.860> was<00:06:20.040> put<00:06:20.340> there<00:06:20.700> in<00:06:20.880> spring<00:06:21.210> so<00:06:22.110> this

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
and this was put there in spring so this

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.570 
and this was put there in spring so this
compost<00:06:24.030> allows<00:06:24.620> water<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.890> stay<00:06:26.250> longer

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
compost allows water to stay longer

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.420 
compost allows water to stay longer
around<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.540> roots<00:06:27.750> and<00:06:28.050> also<00:06:28.710> suppresses<00:06:29.160> the

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
around the roots and also suppresses the

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.910 
around the roots and also suppresses the
weeds<00:06:30.200> so<00:06:31.200> there<00:06:31.350> would<00:06:31.440> have<00:06:31.530> been<00:06:31.590> a<00:06:31.680> lot

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
weeds so there would have been a lot

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.620 
weeds so there would have been a lot
more<00:06:31.950> weeds<00:06:32.340> here<00:06:32.610> if<00:06:32.850> we<00:06:33.090> hadn't<00:06:33.390> put<00:06:33.510> the

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
more weeds here if we hadn't put the

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.260 
more weeds here if we hadn't put the
compost<00:06:33.840> down<00:06:34.580> because<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.700> restricts<00:06:36.120> the

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
compost down because it restricts the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.600 
compost down because it restricts the
light<00:06:36.480> to<00:06:36.720> the<00:06:36.810> c2<00:06:37.380> the<00:06:37.860> seedlings<00:06:38.280> of<00:06:38.520> the

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
light to the c2 the seedlings of the

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.690 
light to the c2 the seedlings of the
weeds<00:06:39.440> so<00:06:40.440> once<00:06:40.650> in<00:06:40.890> the<00:06:41.040> spring<00:06:41.160> some

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
weeds so once in the spring some

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.360 
weeds so once in the spring some
mulching<00:06:42.360> is<00:06:42.540> beneficial

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
mulching is beneficial

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.670 
mulching is beneficial
reading<00:06:45.210> of<00:06:45.330> course<00:06:45.510> is<00:06:45.720> beneficial<00:06:46.200> so<00:06:46.530> these

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
reading of course is beneficial so these

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.460 
reading of course is beneficial so these
wheels<00:06:47.010> they<00:06:47.190> need<00:06:47.340> to<00:06:47.460> be<00:06:47.580> pulled<00:06:47.820> out<00:06:48.000> and

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
wheels they need to be pulled out and

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.230 
wheels they need to be pulled out and
the<00:06:49.470> root<00:06:49.650> area<00:06:49.890> if<00:06:50.280> it's<00:06:50.490> kept<00:06:50.760> weed<00:06:50.970> free

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
the root area if it's kept weed free

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.560 
the root area if it's kept weed free
then<00:06:51.540> the<00:06:51.990> plant<00:06:52.260> is<00:06:52.470> much<00:06:52.620> healthier<00:06:53.100> and<00:06:53.570> the

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
then the plant is much healthier and the

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.870 
then the plant is much healthier and the
fruit<00:06:54.870> get<00:06:55.350> more<00:06:55.590> nutrients<00:06:56.160> as<00:06:56.370> the<00:06:56.640> wheels

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
fruit get more nutrients as the wheels

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.840 
fruit get more nutrients as the wheels
