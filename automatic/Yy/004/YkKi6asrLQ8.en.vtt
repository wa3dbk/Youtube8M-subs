00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello dear friends with you shots in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.220
 This video will show you as an addition to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.980
 skyrim dawnguard find return rather 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.660
 your soul or something that was taken from her 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.320
 so on the internet I am so nothing 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.140
 I did not find the original to think what to look for 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.109
 Here in this all will be madness though 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.109
 so it was however I found it myself 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.420
 it means from the castle that we are 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.420
 turn right 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.880
 go along these buildings 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.680
 go ahead turn here to this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.680
 home 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.440
 since he became our character 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:15.910
 you are a dragon 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:15.910
 so god passes here we find this one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.159
 these stones which sucks the soul when 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.390
 approaching 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.390
 means go so 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 when dieting 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.520
 so that 's what the bow 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.520
 he will be there 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.940
 This is true 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:09.220
 there is a chest and we go 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:15.310
 Here in this here I do find this stone 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 there is but the principle of a bone with us 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.730
 completed and 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:36.410
 negatives disappeared here and decided to write down 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.410
 but I think you now understand how to find 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 until
