00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 award renzi was received this morning at 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.920
 quirinale by the head of the state theme 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.420
 central of the meeting just the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 tomorrow afternoon European Council 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.679
 the president of the republic also has 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.969
 recalled the respect of deadlines for 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.429
 the election of two judges 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.510
 Constitutional of eight lay members of the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.100
 superior council of the judiciary 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.580
 reforms have been set the new 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.220
 meeting between pd and 5 stars that will start 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.970
 precisely from the theme of the electoral law 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.219
 giuseppe carboni see you Thursday at 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.320
 14 in bing on the blog 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.120
 the technical term schedule for 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.460
 indicate the programs and start times 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.200
 wave is this but in the exchange of 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 missives written first digital then a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 striking are the tones and the broad 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 five star availability 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 definitely positive that picks up the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.829
 comparison it is necessary to arrive at one 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 satisfactory solution for all ed 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.610
 even phrases like there is our 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 willingness to welcome yours 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.059
 needs in terms of governability 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.460
 we wish the same from you 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.090
 when we talk about the representativeness of the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 parliament 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.170
 no crashes as predictable but 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.390
 foil shots tactical answers in 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.189
 this preliminary phase but the nodes for the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 movement are always the same 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.909
 we are ready to discuss with the party 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 democratic on the merits of the law 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 electoral we are very open as 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.369
 we have been discussing it so far 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.740
 merit of the measures 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.090
 but on two conditions that are introduced 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.650
 preferences are not 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.540
 absolutely the most admitted convicts in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.850
 parliament if this is the epilogue 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.159
 the day began with the hunt for 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.110
 but he who does not speak is that cricket also 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.820
 he is silent when he is young 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.430
 exits the hotel spreads his arms 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.200
 when he enters the Senate in the classroom for 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 assist jobs and when it arrives towards 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.109
 response groups 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.880
 words in the wind then repeats 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.759
 I don't come to dictate the political line 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.369
 of gentlemen here I come to greet them 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.710
 we drink coffee there maybe eat them 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.670
 I reassure why they are depressed because 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.420
 all initiatives are taxed 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.369
 commissions don't even come anymore 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.060
 He is taken into account read 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.859
 emotions 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.569
 no consideration whatsoever 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.490
 they come to us that the moment requires 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.869
 caution is beyond doubt inside 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.759
 because up to the feet three stomach ache 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.530
 there were strong but parliamentarians 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.540
 above all because the turning towards the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.310
 negotiation with the pd is delicate 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.290
 the goal is to crack the pact of 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.790
 nazareno understand what's behind it 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.680
 explains crisis but the risk is of 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.329
 find yourself with the match in hand 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.310
 also because on the rest of the reforms a 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.620
 starting from the Senate as Lombardi says 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.329
 our clear opposition passage 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.250
 tight therefore for a game that 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.340
 will resume Thursday without cricket and without 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.840
 casaleggio as precedent the meeting it 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.739
 we will see in stereo means this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.739
 vote is worth nine tenths
