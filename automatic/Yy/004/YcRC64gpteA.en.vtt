00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Let's continue before we pass. 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.029
 for the toolbar, shall I go? 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.710
 show is a tutorial here applying 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.719
 some features we have filters 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.530
 and effects there is only now in a 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.780
 Image 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.269
 The idea is to make a tutorial is where you 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.220
 can take any picture and let 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.289
 she looks like a drawing 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 obviously no longer with many colors 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.550
 it is the one with few traits that will not stay 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.680
 So cool, I got one here. Let's do it. 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.910
 the test with her do a how do you guys 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 have there 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.050
 the process is simple first I need 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.850
 to take the color of this image I'm going to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 to decrease this way here did not ask 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 left expanded need to touch the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.739
 layers will explain to you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.899
 so let 's get the color off the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 object is to modify nÃ© 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.370
 if you have excuse and modified it is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.590
 as if you have with him it's english 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.260
 that goes from the creative and 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.250
 creative convert it to shades of gray 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.520
 A gray scale that goes there is 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 convert into a month that if it is now the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.379
 name of the gift of gray but will be in 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.780
 same position then you will convert 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.360
 he grays something on 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 big that I forgot there is and there beauty 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.110
 I made it gray here , I'm going 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.840
 do the following to ensure that I 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.390
 I took all the cabbage field is cormat 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.549
 and I'm going to remove all this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.490
 situation of my image that leaves her - 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.380
 in saturation intensity of the color then 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.049
 has no color intensity he 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.500
 is now 100% 5 is large scale and that 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.750
 speaks lineu written year in the tone of ash is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.159
 control and control v for copy and paste 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.810
 her to make sure you copied and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.759
 If you look here in the layers I have 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.110
 two layers now beauty is from above 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.970
 Even though I'm going to work, you need to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 nor click on the bottom you copy and paste 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.860
 Japan has already selected the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.540
 process is the next one where it is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.189
 black here eg hair some 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.780
 points will turn white and where it is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.869
 white will turn black this is what 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.560
 Reversal so filters adjust color 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.720
 reverse 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 are color of the image beauty stay 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.049
 that's strange anyway 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.780
 now let's do the following to apply one 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.939
 super super color exposure nec is a 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.409
 mode of layer mixing and back 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.789
 this principle here and when just to 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.880
 show the properties panel here 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.120
 under an expanded form since the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.739
 resolution is somewhat restricted here from the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.750
 side of the opacity above the filters 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.430
 mixing modes that themselves modes 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.890
 that exist in photoshop 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.739
 I will choose here and if I go up there 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.110
 will leave the image that way 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.640
 but it disappeared and that thousand would be very much 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.489
 much beyond a view just see 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.989
 small points here is kind of sound 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.989
 ears and clean and applied a 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.569
 brightness on top of the image now 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.130
 applying a filter can be either 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.680
 here on the filter menu here below that I 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.260
 I taught her how to blur it. 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.330
 apply a defocus filter I'll stay or 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.459
 if he is going to start showing me the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.709
 traces of that image then go beyond 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.900
 cool or increase a little bit here 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.940
 ohio just go controlling according to 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.850
 fire proportion 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.579
 The bigger the bolt is, the more traces you get. 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.709
 can not keep there in that image 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.690
 can be useful for something in some 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.660
 project that you want to present 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.060
 no image maybe a bar you 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.340
 you can use those features there that have 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.519
 inside the headlight are mixing filters 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.430
 and mixing there is resources is of 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.239
 light so that mixing 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.640
 of the layer 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.850
 we can get out and get an effect 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.090
 until cool then beauty phone then 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.900
 Let's continue our class now. 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.880
 and it 's ok here and let's go there is the proportion 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.829
 ranking will then set the proportion of 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.630
 of traits that you will apply 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.819
 there in that image then 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.280
 I work on it and neither with with 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.430
 the filter features with justice here 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.920
 also in color it's okay that now we 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.109
 we remove it in case it is removing all 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.050
 the colors would give you just for me power is 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.700
 to darken a little bit more she 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.560
 You can not touch these tones here. 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.330
 contrast and does not always change much 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.220
 little due not to fear not having not 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.820
 have almost no colors in it but you can 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.220
 you make changes that are 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.720
 your project using these resources in 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.310
 that I showed working with these 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.380
 who works with the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.959
 can also do and 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.030
 to apply it there is easy there 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.930
 also due to having these same 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.060
 resources 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.980
 Let me go back here and I'll give it to you. 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.660
 worsening our project here or 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.370
 cancel this filter then this 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.770
 Tip and in the next class we will give 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.500
 sequence with the project here we go 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.870
 begin to see aa toolbar 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.240
 show the first ones - here are the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 cutting tools position selection 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.680
 so a hug until the next
