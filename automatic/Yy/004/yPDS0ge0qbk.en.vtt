00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 but everything is fine with you today 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.299
 I came here to win another video of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.589
 cauterization because I had 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 done that other video only that I do not 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.480
 I was thinking the lighting was cool 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.700
 I think it got much better a lot more 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 easy to understand and much more beautiful 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.470
 also people because the lighting is 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.119
 better everything is better 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 but I would like to give an alert to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 you about the cauterization you 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.849
 will do only the hair you are 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.740
 damaged 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.720
 This is going to be the last time I do 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.189
 because my hair is back and three 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 times I did I've recovered a lot 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 a lot of it is already good it's shiny 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.170
 Look, I just did look how it is. 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 shining like it's beautiful but you can 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 do as many times as necessary 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.460
 but they never do is sure if your hair 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 have good already hydrated does 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.739
 because it will damage your hair and there it goes 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.610
 have an inverse result and moisturize will 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.230
 You're ruining your hair, it's good to drink. 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.640
 careful about it ok 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.680
 this procedure is most appropriate for 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.439
 Who makes a heart for those who make lights? 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 for those who play with hair chemistry 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.799
 I would also like to say that the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.240
 indicated is that you use shampoo 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.549
 anti-waste silver making 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 cauterization but I do not like using 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.119
 shampoo anti-waste shape girls 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 any because my hair 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.710
 despite being more hydrated it is 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.020
 cuter I do not like to use it because 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.700
 I dry a lot of hair so I did with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.540
 normal shampoo got results 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.659
 excellent sound the only hair I wash 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 the hair three times with shampoo is there 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.320
 our option if you want to use the shampoo 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 anti-waste or if you want to use the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.549
 shampoo as that is so I very much hope that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.970
