the last time i was that in any i'll
show<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.880> what's<00:03:01.060> supposed<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.630> happen<00:03:04.980> okay

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
show you what's supposed to happen okay

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
show you what's supposed to happen okay
come<00:03:06.190> down<00:03:06.340> here<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.989> turns<00:03:08.350> around<00:03:08.700> OOP<00:03:09.700> oh

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
come down here it turns around OOP oh

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.110 
come down here it turns around OOP oh
you're<00:03:10.239> done<00:03:10.330> okay<00:03:10.390> we<00:03:11.230> hit<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> switch<00:03:12.120> push

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you're done okay we hit the switch push

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.440 
you're done okay we hit the switch push
it<00:03:13.239> over<00:03:13.360> there<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.510> little<00:03:13.630> bit<00:03:15.120> due<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.330> do

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
it over there a little bit due to do

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.390 
it over there a little bit due to do
then<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.840> go<00:03:16.989> through<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.260> quantum<00:03:18.160> train

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
then you go through the quantum train

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.740 
then you go through the quantum train
booster<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.920> go<00:03:21.070> all<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.670> way<00:03:21.700> back<00:03:21.790> up<00:03:22.209> it'll

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
booster and go all the way back up it'll

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.319 
booster and go all the way back up it'll
actually<00:03:22.900> give<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.350> momentum<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.640> go<00:03:25.120> all

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
actually give you a momentum to go all

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.120 
actually give you a momentum to go all
the<00:03:25.360> way<00:03:25.450> back<00:03:25.510> up<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:26.019> but<00:03:26.440> we<00:03:26.860> don't<00:03:27.010> want

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
the way back up this but we don't want

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.470 
the way back up this but we don't want
to<00:03:27.190> do<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.280> right<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:29.040> we'll<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:30.480> head

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
to do that right now so we'll just head

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.500 
to do that right now so we'll just head
back<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:32.019> down<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.500> I'll<00:03:35.709> show<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
back on down and I'll show you the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.110 
back on down and I'll show you the
extent<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.660> some<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:37.959> my<00:03:38.079> mining<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:38.709> far<00:03:42.120> okay

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
extent of some of my mining so far okay

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.440 
extent of some of my mining so far okay
so<00:03:44.110> as<00:03:44.350> you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.500> see<00:03:44.650> i<00:03:44.680> have<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:45.160> shaft<00:03:46.150> going

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
so as you can see i have a shaft going

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.280 
so as you can see i have a shaft going
this<00:03:46.600> way<00:03:46.870> this<00:03:47.530> way<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:48.340> way<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:48.910> way<00:03:49.299> and

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
this way this way this way this way and

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.940 
this way this way this way this way and
then<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.280> same<00:03:51.730> on<00:03:51.910> this<00:03:52.060> side<00:03:52.120> over<00:03:52.510> here

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
then the same on this side over here

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.970 
then the same on this side over here
there<00:03:53.950> there<00:03:54.579> there<00:03:54.940> there<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.200> only<00:03:56.320> one<00:03:56.709> has

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
there there there there the only one has

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.699 
there there there there the only one has
really<00:03:57.790> been<00:03:59.190> particularly<00:04:00.190> fruitful<00:04:01.709> has

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
really been particularly fruitful has

really been particularly fruitful has
been<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:04.480> one<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:06.820> cavern<00:04:07.239> is

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
been this one and this cavern is

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.289 
been this one and this cavern is
extremely<00:04:08.170> monster<00:04:08.620> invested<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:09.910> i<00:04:09.940> have

let's plays but my computer can barely
run<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.990> graphically<00:05:12.440> so<00:05:12.950> i'm<00:05:13.340> not<00:05:13.490> sure<00:05:13.550> how

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
run it graphically so i'm not sure how
