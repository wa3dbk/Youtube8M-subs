00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
gotta do it like so eventually they're

gotta do it like so eventually they're
going<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.270> end<00:00:38.390> up<00:00:38.480> together<00:00:38.720> two<00:00:39.650> layers

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
going to end up together two layers

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.619 
going to end up together two layers
thick<00:00:40.160> at<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.370> bottom<00:00:42.579> they're<00:00:43.579> pretty<00:00:44.420> much

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
thick at the bottom they're pretty much

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.630 
thick at the bottom they're pretty much
done<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.080> bottom<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:45.680> now<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:45.920> just<00:00:46.040> put<00:00:46.400> in

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
done the bottom so now we just put in

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.960 
done the bottom so now we just put in
the<00:00:47.360> other<00:00:47.480> stuff<00:00:47.809> like<00:00:48.730> doesn't<00:00:49.730> matter<00:00:49.879> if

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
the other stuff like doesn't matter if

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.240 
the other stuff like doesn't matter if
as<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.180> whole<00:00:50.360> I'm<00:00:51.290> just<00:00:51.440> happy<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:51.949> have<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
as a whole I'm just happy to have the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.470 
as a whole I'm just happy to have the
whole

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
whole

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.720 
whole
so<00:00:54.170> it's<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.380> this<00:00:54.649> now<00:00:55.220> allowed<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.610> to

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
so it's like this now allowed you to

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.640 
so it's like this now allowed you to
make<00:00:55.880> this<00:00:56.000> easier<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.600> shoot<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:57.020> I<00:00:57.290> put<00:00:57.500> in

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
make this easier to shoot is I put in

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:13.420 
make this easier to shoot is I put in
these<00:00:57.860> really<00:00:58.190> smooth<00:00:58.430> parts

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.980 

if<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:13.940> go<00:01:14.030> all<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.270> way<00:01:14.300> down<00:01:14.390> here<00:01:14.840> that's

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
if they go all the way down here that's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.720 
if they go all the way down here that's
good<00:01:15.200> but<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:15.560> don't<00:01:15.650> make<00:01:15.860> me<00:01:16.040> on<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.340> edges

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
good but just don't make me on the edges

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.250 
good but just don't make me on the edges
because<00:01:16.940> that's<00:01:17.240> where<00:01:17.450> everything<00:01:17.810> else<00:01:17.990> to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
because that's where everything else to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.400 
because that's where everything else to
go<00:01:18.380> keep<00:01:19.130> these<00:01:19.340> two<00:01:19.490> places<00:01:19.730> clear<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.420> ring

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
go keep these two places clear a ring

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.190 
go keep these two places clear a ring
past<00:01:21.710> those<00:01:22.550> those<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.360> orange<00:01:23.720> one<00:01:23.870> has<00:01:24.080> to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
past those those that orange one has to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.800 
past those those that orange one has to
be<00:01:24.320> clear<00:01:24.530> on<00:01:24.680> both<00:01:24.830> sides<00:01:25.660> next<00:01:26.660> bar<00:01:27.160> take

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
be clear on both sides next bar take

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.030 
be clear on both sides next bar take
anything<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.140> just<00:01:30.200> really<00:01:30.530> build<00:01:30.920> around

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
anything and just really build around

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.590 
anything and just really build around
the<00:01:31.610> wall<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:34.210> just<00:01:35.210> take<00:01:35.450> stuff

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the wall of it so like just take stuff

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.170 
the wall of it so like just take stuff
and<00:01:35.900> build<00:01:36.229> around<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.430> it's<00:01:37.610> like<00:01:37.760> one

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
and build around it so it's like one

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.800 
and build around it so it's like one
layer<00:01:38.420> thick<00:01:39.020> around<00:01:39.290> it

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.270 

and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.370 

like

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.380 

got<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.740> get<00:01:48.799> this<00:01:48.920> off

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380 

good<00:01:52.390> now<00:01:53.080> that's<00:01:53.320> done<00:01:53.650> now<00:01:54.210> you're<00:01:55.210> pretty

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
good now that's done now you're pretty

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.560 
good now that's done now you're pretty
much<00:01:55.510> down<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.840> base<00:01:55.960> except<00:01:56.410> for<00:01:57.510> there<00:01:58.510> you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
much down the base except for there you

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.570 
much down the base except for there you
go<00:01:58.690> put<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.460> stuff<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.670> make<00:02:00.790> this<00:02:00.970> like

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
go put in stuff to make this like

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.410 
go put in stuff to make this like
like<00:02:03.150> basically<00:02:03.720> once<00:02:04.200> higher<00:02:04.700> like<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.210> not

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
like basically once higher like like not

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.999 
like basically once higher like like not
one<00:02:06.660> higher<00:02:06.870> but<00:02:07.050> like<00:02:07.170> half<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.590> thing<00:02:07.800> higher

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
one higher but like half a thing higher

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.370 
one higher but like half a thing higher
okay<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.869> put<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.440> rage<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:12.380> because

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
okay so put in one rage here because

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.840 
okay so put in one rage here because
then<00:02:14.180> I'm<00:02:15.180> before<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.140> put<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.500> one<00:02:16.710> on

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
then I'm before you put this one on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.130 
then I'm before you put this one on
don't<00:02:17.850> because<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.630> have<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.840> keep<00:02:18.960> this

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
don't because you have to keep this

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.350 
don't because you have to keep this
clear<00:02:19.710> book<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.370> put<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> elastic<00:02:20.850> on

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
clear book so you can put the elastic on

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.390 
clear book so you can put the elastic on
let's<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.230> put<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.650> right<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.220> we<00:02:24.280> can

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
let's just put it on right now so we can

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
let's just put it on right now so we can
finish<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.820> quicker<00:02:26.970> ok<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.620> elastics<00:02:30.220> in

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.530 

now<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.080> making<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:41.240> 2.1<00:02:42.240> higher

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
now it's just making it like 2.1 higher

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.690 
now it's just making it like 2.1 higher
or<00:02:42.900> something<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:50.310> base<00:02:50.670> is
