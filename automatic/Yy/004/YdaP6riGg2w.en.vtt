I<00:00:02.659> have<00:00:03.659> with<00:00:03.810> me<00:00:03.960> Calvin<00:00:04.350> ions<00:00:04.680> one<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:04.979 
I have with me Calvin ions one of the

I have with me Calvin ions one of the
co-authors<00:00:05.189> of<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> box<00:00:06.059> and<00:00:06.299> book<00:00:06.480> effects

co-authors of the box and book effects

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:09.590 
co-authors of the box and book effects
Carol<00:00:07.979> you've<00:00:08.129> written<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.090> scope<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600 
Carol you've written the scope and

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.500 
Carol you've written the scope and
sequence<00:00:09.719> charts<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.459> addition<00:00:12.090> facts

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
sequence charts for the addition facts

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.570 
sequence charts for the addition facts
and<00:00:12.840> free<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.260> the<00:00:13.289> operations<00:00:13.920> why<00:00:14.459> do<00:00:14.520> you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and free to the operations why do you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.430 
and free to the operations why do you
need<00:00:14.699> a<00:00:14.760> scope<00:00:15.029> and<00:00:15.180> sequence<00:00:15.299> chart<00:00:15.660> well

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
need a scope and sequence chart well

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
need a scope and sequence chart well
when<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.949> look<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.189> the<00:00:17.369> book<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.210> book<00:00:18.480> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
when you look at the book the book is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.270 
when you look at the book the book is
written<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.290> that<00:00:19.560> each<00:00:20.370> strategy<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:22.280> all

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
written so that each strategy is all

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.130 
written so that each strategy is all
group<00:00:23.730> together<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> count<00:00:24.960> on

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
group together so we have the count on

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800 
group together so we have the count on
strategy<00:00:25.680> doubling<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.730> defend<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.600> bridge

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
strategy doubling and defend that bridge

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.410 
strategy doubling and defend that bridge
to<00:00:27.960> ten<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.850> one<00:00:29.850> of<00:00:29.940> the<00:00:30.000> things<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
to ten and one of the things that the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.910 
to ten and one of the things that the
book<00:00:30.570> doesn't<00:00:30.840> show<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.680> show<00:00:31.860> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
book doesn't show is this in show you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
book doesn't show is this in show you
exactly<00:00:32.250> where<00:00:32.579> each<00:00:32.730> part<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> sequence

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
exactly where each part of the sequence

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.989 
exactly where each part of the sequence
for<00:00:34.050> those<00:00:34.170> strategies<00:00:34.440> fits<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.640> that's<00:00:35.850> why

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:35.999 
for those strategies fits so that's why

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.250 
for those strategies fits so that's why
we<00:00:36.030> decided<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> scope<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.109> sequence

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
we decided you a scope and sequence

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.369 
we decided you a scope and sequence
chart<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.069> the<00:00:38.159> book<00:00:38.339> gives<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> sequence

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
chart so the book gives you the sequence

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.299 
chart so the book gives you the sequence
essentially<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> order<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:40.949> you<00:00:41.069> would

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
essentially the order in which you would

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
essentially the order in which you would
teach<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.819> strategy<00:00:42.300> strategies<00:00:42.780> but

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
teach the strategy strategies but

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590 
teach the strategy strategies but
doesn't<00:00:43.890> blend<00:00:44.190> those<00:00:44.789> strategies<00:00:45.179> within

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
doesn't blend those strategies within

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
doesn't blend those strategies within
these<00:00:46.079> strategies<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.679> other<00:00:46.829> operations

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
these strategies of the other operations

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.239 
these strategies of the other operations
and<00:00:47.789> also<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.539> stages<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.319> each<00:00:49.559> exactly

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.249 
and also the stages of each exactly

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.009 
and also the stages of each exactly
right<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.699> so<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.359> you<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.569> at<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
right so so when you look at the the

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.229 
right so so when you look at the the
order<00:00:52.409> of<00:00:52.499> the<00:00:52.559> book<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> follows<00:00:53.280> strategy

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
order of the book it follows strategy

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
order of the book it follows strategy
one<00:00:54.389> strategy<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.049> strategy<00:00:55.589> three<00:00:55.859> but<00:00:56.039> one

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
one strategy to strategy three but one

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.739 
one strategy to strategy three but one
in<00:00:56.429> practice<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.999> may<00:00:57.120> want<00:00:57.299> to<00:00:57.389> start<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
in practice you may want to start to

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.569 
in practice you may want to start to
blend<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.499> integrate<00:00:58.799> those<00:00:58.979> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.429> show

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
blend and integrate those you can show

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.889 
blend and integrate those you can show
me<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.789> your<00:00:59.819> main<00:01:00.059> use<00:01:00.209> in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> child<00:01:00.659> well

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
me with your main use in the child well

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.329 
me with your main use in the child well
if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.049> look<00:01:01.139> at<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.129> strategy

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
if you look at this the first strategy

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.180 
if you look at this the first strategy
is<00:01:02.760> count<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.479> strategy<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.080> addition<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.500> we

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
is count on strategy for addition and we

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.910 
is count on strategy for addition and we
go<00:01:05.339> through<00:01:05.700> four<00:01:06.240> stages<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.289> each<00:01:07.500> strategy

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
go through four stages for each strategy

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
go through four stages for each strategy
there's<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> introduced<00:01:08.759> reinforce

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
there's the introduced reinforce

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.740 
there's the introduced reinforce
practice<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:11.490> later<00:01:11.759> on<00:01:11.880> much<00:01:12.329> later<00:01:12.479> on

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
practice and then later on much later on

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.100 
practice and then later on much later on
extent<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.979> before<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.789> finish<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.930> work

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
extent but before we finish the work

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
extent but before we finish the work
with<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.500> strategy<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.280> may<00:01:17.430> want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> start

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
with one strategy we may want to start

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
with one strategy we may want to start
with<00:01:18.180> another<00:01:18.869> yeah<00:01:19.289> so<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.710> shows<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.070> how

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
with another yeah so this shows you how

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
with another yeah so this shows you how
these<00:01:20.460> strategies<00:01:20.969> are<00:01:21.600> weave<00:01:21.899> together<00:01:22.109> so

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
these strategies are weave together so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
these strategies are weave together so
this<00:01:22.950> probably<00:01:23.219> all<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> guys<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.030> see

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this probably all you guys you can see

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.029 
this probably all you guys you can see
that<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.539> were<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.719> be<00:01:24.840> introducing<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
that you were to be introducing the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.249 
that you were to be introducing the
count<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.490> strategy<00:01:26.939> early<00:01:27.359> in<00:01:27.539> year<00:01:27.960> one

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
count on strategy early in year one

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
count on strategy early in year one
that's<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:28.859> and<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:29.939> start

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that's right and you would start

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
that's right and you would start
extending<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:31.020> strategy<00:01:31.469> towards<00:01:31.890> anyone

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
extending that strategy towards anyone

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580 
extending that strategy towards anyone
and<00:01:32.759> well<00:01:33.420> before<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.899> do<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.500> would

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and well before you do that you would

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
and well before you do that you would
start<00:01:34.799> introducing<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> next<00:01:35.609> strategy<00:01:35.939> yes

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
start introducing the next strategy yes

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
start introducing the next strategy yes
that's<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> bridge

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that's right and so on with the bridge

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.219 
that's right and so on with the bridge
to<00:01:38.399> 10<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.789> in<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.060> book<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> book<00:01:39.689> has<00:01:39.960> them

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
to 10 and in the book the book has them

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
to 10 and in the book the book has them
grouped<00:01:40.679> by<00:01:40.890> introduced<00:01:41.399> reinforced

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
grouped by introduced reinforced

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.550
