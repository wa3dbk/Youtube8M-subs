going to be doing is either cross two or
maybe<00:01:35.250> crysis<00:01:35.970> 3<00:01:36.210> depending<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.780> arm<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.259> know

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
maybe crysis 3 depending on arm you know

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
maybe crysis 3 depending on arm you know
what<00:01:38.040> i<00:01:38.070> want<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.700> yeah<00:01:39.119> anyway<00:01:39.540> guys

that's<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.350> benchmark<00:01:40.860> test<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that's the benchmark test for a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880 
that's the benchmark test for a
battlefield<00:01:42.390> 3<00:01:42.840> i'll<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.290> display<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> game

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
battlefield 3 i'll just display the game

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700 
battlefield 3 i'll just display the game
a<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.070> bit<00:01:44.399> more<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.700> least<00:01:45.470> I'll<00:01:46.470> try<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
a little bit more at least I'll try and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.530 
a little bit more at least I'll try and
get<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.100> an<00:01:47.159> intensive<00:01:47.729> area<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.270> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
get to more of an intensive area here so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.940 
get to more of an intensive area here so
you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.049> least<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.439> how<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> card

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you can at least see how the card

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.499 
you can at least see how the card
performs<00:01:52.549> like<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:53.790> trying<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
performs like you I'm trying to do the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
performs like you I'm trying to do the
best<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> try<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> FPS<00:01:55.979> drop<00:01:56.310> no

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
best I can to try get the FPS drop no

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.770 
best I can to try get the FPS drop no
it's<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.759> dropping<00:01:57.210> which<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> know

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it's not dropping which is you know

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.719 
it's not dropping which is you know
fantastic<00:01:58.350> considering<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.130> price<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
fantastic considering the price of the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.389 
fantastic considering the price of the
GPU<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.420> actually<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.770> unbelievable

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
GPU it's actually it's unbelievable

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.100 
GPU it's actually it's unbelievable
really<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> mean<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:02.969> costs<00:02:03.390> less<00:02:03.540> than<00:02:03.600> xbox

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
really I mean it costs less than xbox

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.330 
really I mean it costs less than xbox
one<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.680> thinking<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.130> getting

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
one which I was thinking about getting

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.760 
one which I was thinking about getting
but<00:02:05.869> screw<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.899> when<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.409> actually<00:02:07.500> have

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
but screw that when I can actually have

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.139 
but screw that when I can actually have
one<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.009> these<00:02:08.129> cars<00:02:08.459> next<00:02:08.759> year<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> can

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
one of these cars next year I can

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.089 
one of these cars next year I can
upgrade<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.479> another<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.289> wish<00:02:10.560> because
