 I think the proper answer to my previous question on ahningeo dad also had this 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.330
 I was there. 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:56.970
 When I was a college student, 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:02.060
 The incident happened a lot on Guam Reagent that day my dad came to illness. 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.060
 But then, I only wrote what the manager scolded me finish 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.650
 I get out of there and my father tells me to buy something delicious . 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.739
 I came to the stalls in foreign countries to eat udon noodles . 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.720
 And one that whispers ignorance haetnabwayo 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:20.540
 He did not want to spend money, so he found out he was going to eat cheap labor . 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.470
 Why is it possible to talk about gold bullion? 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.220
 Right now , it's just like I look at my time. 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.540
 Because when I say that I live, I will buy the stake purpose and the money. 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.540
 I have been to Udon date 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.130
 I told you before. 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:43.630
 I'm not that kind of person. 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.630

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.880

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.600
 Well , you said that before. 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.020
 That's because I was so afraid of you. 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.360
 I think he's the one who took the scene right now. 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.360
 Originally, it was not cheap.
