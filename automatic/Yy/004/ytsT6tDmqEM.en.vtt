00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.380
 very good I am adrián de la cruz and like 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.850
 you see today I'm not in the bush 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.980
 I'm home so I'm going to take advantage 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.350
 to explain something that you have asked me 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.630
 many of you how to make a 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.480
 homemade wax stove 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.300
 so nothing I'm going to apply the elements 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.619
 that you need that are very basic a 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.290
 carton a metallic tin type wax level 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.919
 of candle a container to heat the 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.360
 wax and a knife and scissors in my 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.360
 use case of thousands of brothers 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.920
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:42.719
 the entity cardboard for it we go the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.179
 container and we mark the measure of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.710
 strips that is a little smaller than the 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.870
 width that has 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.870
 so you can make the bed 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.760
 I do not need anything 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.420
 now we have to roll up the strips 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.549
 when we have 1 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.549
 we take another pile we splice 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.400
 when we already have more or less the measure 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 tin container as 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.880
 we introduce 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.719
 and it would only be to throw the wax over 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 We split the wax into pieces 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.380
 and we put it in the container 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.409
 yes 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.659
 to heat the sidewalk the easiest 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.049
 it's with the microwave we put it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.049
 minutes 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.220
 care that burns 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:11.160
 I'm going to wet one more stretch 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.160
 and our caritas will handle the best 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.260
 just leave a container 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.180
 I ask you justitos 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.140
 arguiñano here explaining a recipe for 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.870
 kitchen and now we have to wait for it to 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.000
 cool progressed solidify or 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.970
 enganchadores this is already a 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.450
 cold acceleration of the class so I'm going 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.450
 to prove it 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.489
 little by little the flame grows 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.860
 we already have a considerable flame the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.950
 true that it is a fairly high flame 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.270
 and you can transport it and handle it 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.810
 serves to warm tea 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.360
 plan 30 you turn it on in a moment a lot 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.730
 more better than making a bonfire 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.880
 You can also cook food even 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.070
 boil water and good before burning my 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.930
 I will pay for it to pay 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.930
 we just take cover it 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.440
 and we stole oxygen from the flame 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.440
 ready 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:37.920
 and I present to you my cody cat 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.900
 it's called cody in a landing lake 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.900
 because they are both fat 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.980
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.350
 video is quite useful the truth to bring 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.290
 this over the same took some trouble 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.350
 sometime to heat water and so 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.790
 be able to boil it and make it drinkable or 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.820
 Warm up in some situation that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.360
 He was also cold and hard 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.940
 several hours is great that lasts a 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.180
 week will last seven hours maybe and 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.519
 it makes a considerable flame 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.189
 so I hope you prove it 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.009
 do at home with care and if you have 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.410
