00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
instead of the opposite way because

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.459 
instead of the opposite way because

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.510 
see I guess you could call it just
around<00:02:05.360> everything<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.770> fill<00:02:06.950> everything<00:02:07.250> in

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
around everything to fill everything in

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.999 
around everything to fill everything in
and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.599> put<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.840> color<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.709> middle

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
and then I put that color in the middle

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.630 
and then I put that color in the middle
where<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.729> guess<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.739> knot<00:02:12.739> would<00:02:13.010> be<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.459> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
where I guess the knot would be in the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.750 
where I guess the knot would be in the
bow<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:14.569> taking<00:02:15.109> a<00:02:15.290> gray<00:02:15.919> color<00:02:16.219> light

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
bow and then taking a gray color light

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.280 
bow and then taking a gray color light
gray<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.299> just

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
gray I just

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.280 
gray I just
created<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.470> rectangle<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.540> taking<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.750> black<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
created a rectangle and taking a black I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.670 
created a rectangle and taking a black I
just<00:02:22.530> made<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.769> couple<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.220> dots<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:24.530> make<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
just made a couple of dots to make the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.500 
just made a couple of dots to make the
illusion<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> gems<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.030> dress<00:02:27.269> has

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
illusion of the gems that the dress has

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.130 
illusion of the gems that the dress has
and<00:02:28.940> now<00:02:29.940> i'm<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.269> start<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.660> do<00:02:30.810> these

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and now i'm going to start to do these

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.040 
and now i'm going to start to do these
zebra<00:02:31.500> stripes<00:02:31.769> which<00:02:32.160> i<00:02:32.519> don't<00:02:33.480> really

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
zebra stripes which i don't really

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.949 
zebra stripes which i don't really
there's<00:02:34.470> an<00:02:34.560> explanation<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:35.220> how<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.519> do<00:02:35.730> it

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
there's an explanation on how to do it

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.570 
there's an explanation on how to do it
it's<00:02:36.959> really<00:02:37.319> easy<00:02:37.500> though<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:38.760> depends<00:02:39.269> on

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
it's really easy though just depends on

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.890 
it's really easy though just depends on
how<00:02:41.580> ever<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.849> want<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:44.450> for<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
how ever you want to do it and for the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.289 
how ever you want to do it and for the
the<00:02:46.860> dots<00:02:47.099> which<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.580> supposed<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.910> imitate

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
the dots which are supposed to imitate

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.780 
the dots which are supposed to imitate
the<00:02:48.480> gems<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.379> dress<00:02:49.650> what<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> did<00:02:50.489> was<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the gems on the dress what I did was I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.729 
the gems on the dress what I did was I
actually<00:02:50.849> took<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.540> black<00:02:52.049> nail<00:02:52.319> polish<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
actually took a black nail polish and

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.580 
actually took a black nail polish and
went<00:02:53.069> over<00:02:53.569> with<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.870> black<00:02:55.230> nail<00:02:55.440> polish

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
went over with that black nail polish

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.500 
went over with that black nail polish
just<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.730> give<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.060> more<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.410> 3d<00:02:59.329> type<00:03:00.329> of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
just to give it more of a 3d type of

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.600 
just to give it more of a 3d type of
look<00:03:00.720> although<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.829> it<00:03:02.130> doesn't<00:03:02.160> really

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
look although it's not it doesn't really

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.410 
look although it's not it doesn't really
stand<00:03:03.450> out<00:03:03.920> or<00:03:04.920> make<00:03:05.489> too<00:03:05.700> many<00:03:05.819> bumps<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.329> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
stand out or make too many bumps on the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.410 
stand out or make too many bumps on the
nail<00:03:06.599> so<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.290> was<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:08.540> really<00:03:09.560> perfect<00:03:11.420> addition

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
nail so it was a really perfect addition

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.569 
nail so it was a really perfect addition
I<00:03:12.510> guess<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.959> then<00:03:13.709> all<00:03:13.829> you<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.099> do<00:03:14.250> is

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
I guess and then all you have to do is

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.670 
I guess and then all you have to do is
add<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.090> top<00:03:15.299> coat<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.049> could<00:03:16.260> see<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
add a top coat so you could see that the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.949 
add a top coat so you could see that the
other<00:03:16.829> nails<00:03:17.129> don't<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.329> pro<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.720> just

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
other nails don't have the pro they just

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.009 
other nails don't have the pro they just
have<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.379> trip<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.099> um<00:03:20.700> some<00:03:21.660> highlights
