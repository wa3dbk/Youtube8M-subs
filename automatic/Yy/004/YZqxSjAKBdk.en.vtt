process<00:01:10.330> of<00:01:10.660> 3d<00:01:10.930> printing<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.410> basically<00:01:11.649> a

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
process of 3d printing it's basically a

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
print head moving back and forth in one

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.550 
print head moving back and forth in one
axis<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:16.149> goes<00:01:16.360> forward<00:01:16.720> back<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.080> side<00:01:17.170> to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
axis it goes forward back and side to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.020 
axis it goes forward back and side to
side<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:17.950> then<00:01:18.039> goes<00:01:18.250> up<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.580> down<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.850> well

so<00:01:19.270> what<00:01:19.660> it<00:01:19.750> does<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.020> lays<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.229> small<00:01:20.680> layer<00:01:21.130> of

people<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.659> print<00:01:49.810> with<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.200> use

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
people can print with so you can use

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.499 
people can print with so you can use
that<00:01:50.950> as<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> support<00:01:51.610> material<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.090> hold<00:01:52.270> up

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
that as a support material to hold up

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.080 
that as a support material to hold up
the<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.439> other<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:54.250> know<00:01:54.340> more<00:01:54.640> traditional

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
the the other you know more traditional

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.760 
the the other you know more traditional
plastics<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.659> then<00:01:56.049> drop<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.560> boiling

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
plastics and then drop it in boiling

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.580 
plastics and then drop it in boiling
water<00:01:56.950> in<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.259> sugar<00:01:59.259> base<00:01:59.439> stuff

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
water in the and the sugar base stuff

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.319 
water in the and the sugar base stuff
will<00:01:59.770> just<00:01:59.890> dissolve<00:02:00.040> away<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:01.030> you'll<00:02:01.150> have<00:02:01.270> a

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
will just dissolve away so you'll have a

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.670 
will just dissolve away so you'll have a
model<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.079> comes<00:02:02.140> out<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.439> block<00:02:02.650> of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
model that comes out of a block of

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.830 
model that comes out of a block of
nothing<00:02:03.220> um<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:03.790> can<00:02:03.880> also<00:02:04.030> print<00:02:04.210> chocolate

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
nothing um you can also print chocolate

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.660 
nothing um you can also print chocolate
you<00:02:05.079> can<00:02:05.229> print<00:02:05.500> some<00:02:06.310> people<00:02:06.490> are<00:02:06.579> pretty

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
you can print some people are pretty

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.910 
you can print some people are pretty
sugar<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:08.200> there's<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> ton<00:02:08.799> of<00:02:08.829> things

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
sugar there's there's a ton of things

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.710 
sugar there's there's a ton of things
people<00:02:09.579> have<00:02:09.759> been<00:02:09.850> printing<00:02:10.090> like<00:02:10.329> living

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
people have been printing like living

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.569 
people have been printing like living
cells<00:02:10.989> at<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.470> point<00:02:11.709> yeah<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.489> was

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
cells at this point yeah that was

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.440 
cells at this point yeah that was
something<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.820> was<00:02:12.910> gonna<00:02:13.000> ask<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.299> about

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
something I was gonna ask you about

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.090 
something I was gonna ask you about
recently<00:02:13.930> because<00:02:14.140> I've<00:02:14.260> seen<00:02:14.470> things<00:02:14.799> like

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
recently because I've seen things like

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.920 
recently because I've seen things like
you<00:02:15.310> know<00:02:15.340> they<00:02:15.640> do<00:02:15.760> cloning<00:02:16.299> type<00:02:16.480> stuff<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
you know they do cloning type stuff and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.289 
you know they do cloning type stuff and
I've<00:02:16.989> seen<00:02:17.140> ears<00:02:17.590> being<00:02:17.950> grown<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.370> mice<00:02:18.640> but

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
I've seen ears being grown on mice but

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.360 
I've seen ears being grown on mice but
where<00:02:19.690> are<00:02:19.900> we<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.530> whole<00:02:20.739> printing<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
where are we in the whole printing of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.819 
where are we in the whole printing of
organic<00:02:21.910> material<00:02:22.480> situation<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.560> it's

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
organic material situation it's it's

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.060 
organic material situation it's it's
really<00:02:24.190> really<00:02:24.579> in<00:02:24.670> its<00:02:24.880> infancy<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:26.070> recently

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
really really in its infancy so recently

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.310 
really really in its infancy so recently
some<00:02:27.340> researchers<00:02:28.329> in<00:02:28.480> Pennsylvania<00:02:29.079> have

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
some researchers in Pennsylvania have

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.319 
some researchers in Pennsylvania have
figured<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.799> how<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.010> print<00:02:30.820> basically<00:02:31.299> a

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
figured out how to print basically a

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.600 
figured out how to print basically a
sugar<00:02:31.630> lattice<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.350> then<00:02:32.769> they<00:02:32.920> put<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.340> gel

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
sugar lattice and then they put a gel

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.160 
sugar lattice and then they put a gel
around<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.120> sugar<00:02:34.329> lattice<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.989> then

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
around that sugar lattice and then

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.410 
around that sugar lattice and then
inject<00:02:35.709> cells<00:02:36.010> into<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:37.269> what<00:02:37.360> that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
inject cells into that and what that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.480 
inject cells into that and what that
does<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.900> solves<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.290> problem<00:02:38.739> of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
does is it solves the problem of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.640 
does is it solves the problem of
of<00:02:39.760> printing<00:02:40.240> living<00:02:40.660> cells<00:02:40.870> when<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.470> lay

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
of printing living cells when you lay

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.710 
of printing living cells when you lay
down<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> layer<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.130> cells<00:02:42.310> there's<00:02:42.970> no<00:02:43.240> support

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
down a layer of cells there's no support

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.570 
down a layer of cells there's no support
infrastructure<00:02:44.320> no<00:02:44.500> vascular<00:02:44.980> system<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
infrastructure no vascular system to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.040 
infrastructure no vascular system to
supply<00:02:45.910> blood<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.450> nutrients<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.900> oxygen

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
supply blood and nutrients and oxygen

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.930 
supply blood and nutrients and oxygen
and<00:02:47.410> all<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.650> stuff<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.160> what<00:02:48.610> happens<00:02:48.880> is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
and all that stuff to it what happens is

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.670 
and all that stuff to it what happens is
the<00:02:49.120> sugar<00:02:49.300> matrix<00:02:49.720> provides<00:02:50.110> those<00:02:50.350> channels

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the sugar matrix provides those channels

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.440 
the sugar matrix provides those channels
and<00:02:51.130> then<00:02:51.550> they<00:02:51.670> can<00:02:51.790> kind<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.180> put<00:02:52.300> in<00:02:52.390> a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
and then they can kind of just put in a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.910 
and then they can kind of just put in a
back<00:02:52.600> but<00:02:52.990> it's<00:02:53.200> still<00:02:53.350> nothing<00:02:53.530> like

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
back but it's still nothing like

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.620 
back but it's still nothing like
printing<00:02:54.340> an<00:02:54.430> actual<00:02:54.670> organ<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.270> just<00:02:55.510> a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
printing an actual organ it's just a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.050 
printing an actual organ it's just a
collection<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.470> cells<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.010> almost<00:02:57.340> like<00:02:57.670> if

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
collection of cells and almost like if

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.940 
collection of cells and almost like if
you're<00:02:58.240> looking<00:02:58.420> at<00:02:58.510> cells<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.990> make

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
you're looking at cells that make

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.310 
you're looking at cells that make
tissues<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.580> make<00:03:00.610> organs<00:03:01.090> we're<00:03:01.630> kind<00:03:02.110> of

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
tissues that make organs we're kind of

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.200 
tissues that make organs we're kind of
printing<00:03:02.530> tissues<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.160> not<00:03:03.340> really<00:03:03.700> anywhere

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
printing tissues but not really anywhere

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.940 
printing tissues but not really anywhere
near<00:03:04.390> close<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.600> printing<00:03:05.050> organs<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.710> does

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
near close to printing organs and does

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.920 
near close to printing organs and does
the<00:03:06.070> body<00:03:06.220> reject<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.850> kind<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.150> thing<00:03:07.330> if<00:03:07.510> it

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
the body reject that kind of thing if it

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.300 
the body reject that kind of thing if it
doesn't<00:03:08.140> come<00:03:08.260> from<00:03:08.290> your<00:03:08.620> own<00:03:08.740> tissue<00:03:09.010> I

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
doesn't come from your own tissue I

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.440 
doesn't come from your own tissue I
don't<00:03:09.550> even<00:03:09.610> know<00:03:09.760> if<00:03:09.790> they've<00:03:09.940> tried<00:03:10.240> putting

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
don't even know if they've tried putting

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.760 
don't even know if they've tried putting
it<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.780> body<00:03:10.960> right<00:03:11.200> now<00:03:11.320> it's<00:03:11.530> literally

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
it in a body right now it's literally

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.580 
it in a body right now it's literally
just<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:12.100> petri<00:03:12.430> dish<00:03:12.610> with<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:13.290> blob<00:03:14.290> of

gelatinous cube of living tissue that
they<00:03:17.050> can<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.320> use<00:03:17.350> for<00:03:17.530> who<00:03:18.070> knows<00:03:18.220> what

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
they can then use for who knows what

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.370
