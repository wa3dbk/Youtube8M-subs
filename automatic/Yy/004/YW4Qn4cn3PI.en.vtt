00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
that's what you'll have to do these are

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.890 
that's what you'll have to do these are
about<00:02:25.819> 11<00:02:26.750> pounds<00:02:27.020> each<00:02:27.970> pretty<00:02:28.970> heavy<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.430> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
about 11 pounds each pretty heavy so and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.870 
about 11 pounds each pretty heavy so and
they're<00:02:32.900> identical<00:02:33.910> what<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.940> mean<00:02:35.180> by<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.630> oh

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
they're identical what I mean by that oh

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.250 
they're identical what I mean by that oh
and<00:02:37.880> they<00:02:37.940> have<00:02:38.150> these<00:02:38.330> little<00:02:38.569> pads<00:02:38.900> they

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
and they have these little pads they

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.360 
and they have these little pads they
come<00:02:39.500> with<00:02:41.200> put<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.530> wherever<00:02:42.800> surface

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
come with put that on wherever surface

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.910 
come with put that on wherever surface
you're<00:02:43.520> putting<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.910> on<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:45.349> I<00:02:45.560> guess<00:02:45.770> it

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
you're putting it on and I guess it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.160 
you're putting it on and I guess it
helps<00:02:46.190> with<00:02:46.340> vibration<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.270> stuff<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.660> that

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
helps with vibration and stuff like that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.780 
helps with vibration and stuff like that
school<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:51.590> looks<00:02:51.830> exactly<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.760> other

cell<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:55.040> take<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.730> put<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:55.910> down

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
cell I can take this and put this down

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.559 
cell I can take this and put this down
and<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.360> open<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.989> one<00:03:01.090> I'll<00:03:02.090> show<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.360> what
