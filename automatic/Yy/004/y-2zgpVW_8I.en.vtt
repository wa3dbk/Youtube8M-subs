00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.970
 then yesterday evening on Italy 1 in second 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 In the evening half were lost 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.480
 the episode sent a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.219
 service on video games and on 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.410
 dependency they can create on 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.120
 people the hyena in question listing 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.580
 all possible damages that these 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.800
 video games usually online can 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 create you fake an employee of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.430
 video games and went with one 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.250
 hidden camera to hear what 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.019
 it happened in clinics and therapeutics 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.420
 where people can detoxify has 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.759
 explained what has changed since the 1980s 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710
 today, for example , more and more realism 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.540
 high is increasingly true that we find 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 now in the new video games that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 indeed it can contribute very well 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 to addiction because if a person 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.059
 he wants to escape from his real life yes 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.670
 identifies with a video game that is always 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.320
 more true, more like a life 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.300
 she was even real 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 interviewed a house manufacturer 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 of Italian music to understand what 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.109
 think more about what they are 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.730
 marketing and psychological strategies 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.980
 to sell a video game 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.019
 because you know behind the video game there is a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.760
 absurd marketing just think of the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.130
 number years more than a billion euros 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.530
 earned from every videogame home for 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.460
 a title took as an example of gta 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.259
 5 which cost 250 million euros but 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.360
 that in the first three days it has collected 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.140
 a billion you can very well understand from 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.670
 just as much as the gynaeceum shrink for 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.650
 to sell a video game to all 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 costs to people and service yes 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.670
 concludes with the philosopher ax who says 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 who takes it seriously 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.630
 call of duty is a jerk because you don't 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 was understood 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.040
 and so far so good but then where 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.670
 they got it wrong what's wrong with it 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.259
 this service is wrong first 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.119
 exploit to dress video games and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.979
 say that they are the evil that I am 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.130
 addiction and what they can cause 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.560
 only the pain but sorry but one 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.259
 what but if on call of duty it is written 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.840
 peggy 18 if a dad with to call of 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.820
 duty to his 12 year old son but who 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.800
 fuck to see 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.900
 take is obvious that this little boy I 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.600
 he goes into paranoia because he is still an infant 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.750
 because a kid still can't 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.459
 to distinguish reality from fantasy not 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.709
 why he is a jerk but why 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.420
 simply not yet the mind 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.459
 developed and does not yet have the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.430
 adult responsibility therefore a 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.160
 carefree child kills the Viet Cong on 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.690
 call of duty and is happy and passes us the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.400
 hours for the older ones instead is 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.900
 simply a matter of strength of 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.500
 will or even a question of 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.110
 brain 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.180
 ok is a sentence taken for granted and imbecile but 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.250
 actually j ax is right not 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.410
 you have to take a video game seriously 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.300
 who does it is a jerk though the service 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's wrong because it's not just i 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.920
 video games cause these things because 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.470
 crucify video games as gta 5 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.870
 hours dead redemption in short all the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.570
 violent video games and not crucify 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.459
 the TV series the film because a parent 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.640
 should be happy if your own 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.310
 son look at the passion rather 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.800
 playing gta 5 is not the same thing 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.790
 blood dead people crucified Jesus who 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.769
 suffer 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.870
 at this point it is better gta 5 not for 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.760
 obviously being transferred is this 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.519
 it's not good it's always made to stop 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.650
 to superficiality and not to think that 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.840
 maybe in the world of things they do 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.150
 suffer people and cause 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.010
 there are so many diseases 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.500
 but no here in Italy you have to take 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.570
 always minor things and magnify them 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.519
 this, moreover, the country of newscasts 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.049
 who ridicule cosplayer gods 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.850
 TV news programs that advise against 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.230
 buy violent video games because 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.049
 they are bad for your health 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.209
 but guys but enough but you have it too 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.549
 broken cock is not the fault of 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.150
 video game if you become sick is fault 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.190
 our 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.860
 evidently the people passing by 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.690
 eighteen hours per pc without working without 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.180
 eat and take care of 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.650
 family is because they want it because they have 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.239
 of problems because it does not know how to relate 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.430
 with people 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.700
 then he prefers to spend his whole 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.739
 day on the internet because he thinks that there 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.480
 will breed a day somehow and 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.120
 so on for days and days and weeks 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.740
 and years so just break my balls 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.750
 on things that 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.850
 do not exist I grew up with i 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.890
 video games with stupid video games 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.560
 with violent video games with i 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.470
 complicated video games yet they are not 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.840
 in the serial killer or a mentally ill 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.610
 oh my God if video games attack but maybe 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.800
 then they are sick of video games 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.660
 otherwise not and this applies to everyone 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.310
 those who watch this video but 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.560
 you don't feel a little pissed off 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.300
 do not believe that they have ridiculed us 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.180
 a little solve the problem of 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.310
 simple video game disease is enough 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.860
 unplug but for these shit 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.900
 where the plug is, let's get everyone off the hook 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.520
 together let me know as always what 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.500
 think about this service 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.120
 and if you agree with us we will 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.950
 let's see in the next video that you 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.290
 I recommend do not be fooled and 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.650
 keep playing video games if you do n't 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.650
 kill
