00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:12.620
 hello and welcome to ours 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.230
 Ideas for teaching with lego 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.000
 mindstorms education ev3 i'm martin 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.040
 Engels from the lego education team 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.930
 Germany and I would like to meet in 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.910
 to incorporate a topic that is in the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.590
 robotics will be encountered again and again 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.050
 at vending machines where we have something 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.960
 buy or service or factory robots 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.820
 All these robots must be during the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.649
 Execution of program information 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.290
 save and return to this later 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.170
 if you're in computer science 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.000
 structured data stores and 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.280
 Organized one also speaks of 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.079
 Data structures and one of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.649
 basic data structures is that 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.540
 ray or drops and get it with this 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.460
 we can get acquainted with one 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.770
 Exercise unit from the robot educator 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.820
 our lego mindstorms education ev3 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.220
 use software 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.170
 we do not find this exercise unit in 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.070
 the basics but the more complex 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.630
 and your programs at the very end and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.610
 look at the preview already that we 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.250
 work here with a robot 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.140
 the information has to be saved 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.520
 later a certain sequence of 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.710
 to perform movements 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.140
 which opens this exercise unit here 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.580
 once in the digital workbook and us 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.840
 look at the little video for the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.500
 the target on the robot will be here 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.860
 shown in succession different colors 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.310
 and he obviously has to remember this 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.170
 because after four colors he should now 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.350
 according to the colors a consequence of 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.090
 to do some movement when I get that 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.689
 correctly noticed has the robot 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.759
 get shown green here and first 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.909
 went to the front 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.710
 then he was shown yellow then he has 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.780
 turned right then became him 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 again shown in green is so again 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 driven to the front and to the conclusion 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.520
 was still shown him since he has blue 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.920
 finally turned to the left 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.990
 if we are in the digital workbook now 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.239
 go further we see that we also for 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.220
 this exercise unit again the standard 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.770
 Chassis of all robot educator 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.480
 can use tutorials 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.160
 In this case I already have the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.740
 touch sensors the color sensor 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.210
 grown and also the small color choice 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.990
 So we can prepare directly 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.990
 go further 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.570
 to the interactive animations of us 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.100
 our program again parallel to 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.530
 video can run 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.700
 and here we see that the program off 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.300
 consist of two parts 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.010
 the first part of the program is busy 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.580
 apparently the color codes 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.220
 to scan and the lower part of the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.270
 program is now responsible for the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.920
 sequence of movements 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.560
 this program we can now in 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.730
 Create the following yourself if we 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.890
 but now our equivalent 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.480
 lessons would prepare us 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.890
 that of course takes some time 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.640
 and besides, maybe we just want to 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.860
 briefly in the example solution for 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.690
 to look into this project and for it 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.890
 we can easily do that if we can 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.170
 Software in the mode for teachers 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.270
 have installed here on top of that 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.420
 click icon for teacher mode 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.540
 and immediately get the finished one here 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.070
 example program displayed as 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.400
 this program works but now 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.959
 we have seen that after each 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.660
 Press the button on the touch sensors 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.670
 the robot remembers an information 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.350
 But how can the robot do that? 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.209
 Ever do how can he get information 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.530
 to save 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.030
 we can imagine ourselves in principle 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.580
 that the robot is something like that 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.410
 a small suitcase used in the 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.690
 Computer science is also called one 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.459
 variable and when the robot itself 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.240
 So remember something here, for example 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.410
 then the first color green in the case 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.360
 He saves this information sets 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.100
 she in the suitcase and if he later 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.020
 Look into the suitcase again 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.690
 he reads the variable then he finds 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.370
 This information is there again 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.350
 but happens now if the robot 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.020
 not just a color but just 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.180
 to remember a second now if 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.670
 we work with such a suitcase 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.000
 who only remember one single value 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.220
 can 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.530
 then the following would happen if the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.590
 robot would like to save yellow here 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.030
 Green simply fly out and the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.169
 robot would only have noticed yellow 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.530
 would have forgotten green 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.030
 of course that is not allowed to happen 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.650
 So we have to tell the robot that 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.130
 he not only one in this suitcase 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.140
 single value should save but 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.360
 therefore, several values â€‹â€‹are just a structure 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.400
 of data in this case so an array 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.600
 or a field you can imagine 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.250
 like a table 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.810
 The robot should now always first 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.470
 look into the suitcase what already 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.320
 is included and the information he 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.289
 remember this is easy on the 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.810
 attach existing ones and the 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.020
 merged information again 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.610
 put in the suitcase and in the next case 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.930
 of course, here again attach to and 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.120
 Finally, it's still blue so he turns 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.240
 afterwards the full color here in the 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:11.860
 noticed suitcase and goes the same way 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.410
 our program also before the button 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.940
 waited on offices senso waits the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.330
 Robot showed him one of the colors 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.190
 turns green yellow or blue 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.410
 all three colors accepted 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.320
 and put them here in the variable 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.900
 The whole thing he has exactly four times 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.520
 then all four-color short and saved 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.130
 after a small beep he 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.590
 Immediately on the way power enters 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.750
 again a loop the four times 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.630
 is going through and in this loop 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.970
 he now looks into the head 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.150
 In the first run of the loop looked 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.919
 this is the first element in our 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.830
 second the second element and so on 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.560
 and depending on the color he is in 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.979
 this ray finds he now leads here 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.050
 this branch out and if he is here 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.240
 then he turns blue 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.830
 left if the green one finds then 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.560
 he drives straight ahead and when he turns yellow 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.419
 he finds himself turning to the right and 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.190
 Of course I would like to do that now 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.960
 with a different sequence of colors 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.160
 try out 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.919
 For that I leave the robot in this 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.240
 First, for example, forward again 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:22.930
 But then go first with blue 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.710
 Turn left then again forward 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.590
 drive and finally with yellow after 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.020
 Turn right 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.729
 I have 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.800
 mother already connected via bluetooth 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.870
 so that the program is wireless directly 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.970
 download free here about the start 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.129
 and can perform 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.930
 So I show the robot the four-color 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.080
 in short we start with the green 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:49.699
 color area then the robot 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.009
 turn to the left with you too 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:55.370
 each with a sound then he should 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.310
 driving forward with green again and 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.610
 concluding with yellow again after 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:05.449
 turn right and our robot is seated 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.099
 in motion drives straight ahead 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.289
 turning left turns straight ahead 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.180
 right and on it we can now in 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.770
 naturally build and could follow 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.539
 For example, expand the program 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.099
 that we provide with more color code for 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.409
 example red for backward more 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:20.360
 add actions and so always us 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:22.880
 more complex vending machines and 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.680
 Applications are approaching 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.719
 In this case, especially with computer science 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.969
 and keep busy with 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:30.830
 data structures in this case the rey 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:32.629
 but of course with the read and 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.550
 Write variables we have 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:36.650
 control structures such as grinding and 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.969
 Branches used and from the 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.099
 field of science and 

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:42.349
 Technology us with the control of 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.630
 vehicles and the use of short 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:47.710
 Thank you very much for seeing 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.710
 see you next time
