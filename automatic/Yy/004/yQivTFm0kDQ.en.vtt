00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
see now as you can see we did not win

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.949 
see now as you can see we did not win
the<00:03:10.220> dodgeball<00:03:10.820> because<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.420> arms<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the dodgeball because the arms of the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.930 
the dodgeball because the arms of the
claw<00:03:12.170> did<00:03:12.470> not<00:03:12.620> fit<00:03:13.250> all<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.459> way<00:03:13.489> around<00:03:13.820> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
claw did not fit all the way around the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.910 
claw did not fit all the way around the
ball<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.720> could<00:03:14.900> be<00:03:15.020> either<00:03:15.170> because<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
ball that could be either because the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.800 
ball that could be either because the
ball<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.430> will<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:16.970> not<00:03:17.120> fit<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.540> claw

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
ball it will just not fit in the claw

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.900 
ball it will just not fit in the claw
and<00:03:18.140> it's<00:03:18.739> also<00:03:18.920> more<00:03:19.250> unlikely<00:03:19.640> because<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and it's also more unlikely because the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.550 
and it's also more unlikely because the
ball<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.239> more<00:03:20.450> wedged<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:21.050> between<00:03:21.080> these

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
ball is more wedged in between these

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.810 
ball is more wedged in between these
other<00:03:21.770> plush<00:03:22.100> here<00:03:24.280> now<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.340> second<00:03:25.730> example

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
other plush here now the second example

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.060 
other plush here now the second example
we're<00:03:26.300> gonna<00:03:26.390> go<00:03:26.600> for<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.560> little<00:03:27.739> puffer

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
we're gonna go for the the little puffer

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.490 
we're gonna go for the the little puffer
ball<00:03:28.489> here<00:03:28.820> it's<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:29.720> sort<00:03:30.020> of<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
ball here it's it's sort of in the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.199 
ball here it's it's sort of in the
middle<00:03:30.709> between<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.250> first<00:03:31.520> two<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.790> mean<00:03:32.060> it's

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
middle between the first two I mean it's

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.970 
middle between the first two I mean it's
sort<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.570> wedged<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.959> there<00:03:33.110> same<00:03:33.769> rule

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
sort of wedged in there same rule

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.229 
sort of wedged in there same rule
applies<00:03:34.280> Center<00:03:34.790> Center<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:37.430> claw<00:03:37.670> in<00:03:38.060> it

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
applies Center Center the the claw in it

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.970 
applies Center Center the the claw in it
this<00:03:38.480> basically<00:03:38.870> depends<00:03:39.320> on<00:03:39.440> how<00:03:39.530> strong<00:03:39.950> the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
this basically depends on how strong the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.740 
this basically depends on how strong the
claw<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.370> if<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.790> has<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.970> good<00:03:41.239> grip

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
claw is if it has a good grip

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.470 
claw is if it has a good grip
it'll<00:03:41.959> get<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:42.590> not<00:03:43.010> it'll<00:03:43.549> slide<00:03:43.970> off<00:03:44.000> just

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
it'll get it if not it'll slide off just

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.840 
it'll get it if not it'll slide off just
like<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:44.900> by<00:03:45.650> going<00:03:45.860> for<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.280> again<00:03:46.340> by

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
like that by going for it again by

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.070 
like that by going for it again by
placing<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.420> right<00:03:47.600> there

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
placing it right there

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.470 
placing it right there
I'll<00:03:49.010> show<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.280> exactly<00:03:49.580> what<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:49.880> mean<00:03:50.120> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
I'll show you exactly what I mean the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.270 
I'll show you exactly what I mean the
claws<00:03:50.750> arms<00:03:51.260> are<00:03:51.500> all<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.799> way<00:03:51.890> around<00:03:52.190> the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
claws arms are all the way around the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.640 
claws arms are all the way around the
ball<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:53.180> was<00:03:53.330> able<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.810> grab<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.440> this

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
ball and it was able to grab it and this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.860 
ball and it was able to grab it and this
again<00:03:55.010> will<00:03:55.160> depend<00:03:55.459> on<00:03:55.519> how<00:03:55.700> strong<00:03:56.690> your

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
again will depend on how strong your

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.180 
again will depend on how strong your
claws<00:03:57.079> mine's<00:03:57.440> about<00:03:57.709> right<00:03:57.860> in<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:57.980> middle

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
claws mine's about right in the middle

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.810 
claws mine's about right in the middle
right<00:03:58.430> now<00:03:59.049> and<00:04:00.280> as<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.489> see<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.730> was

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
right now and as you can see it was

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.020 
right now and as you can see it was
easier<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.269> win<00:04:02.420> because<00:04:02.690> there<00:04:03.530> was<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.850> was

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
easier to win because there was it was

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.940 
easier to win because there was it was
higher<00:04:05.420> up<00:04:05.450> off<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.019> playfield<00:04:06.410> as<00:04:06.590> opposed

dug in there too and it's really hard

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.719

for<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.930> arms<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.590> go<00:04:57.830> around<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.400> ball<00:04:58.550> now

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
for the arms to go around the ball now

for the arms to go around the ball now
let's<00:04:58.970> say<00:04:59.180> let's<00:04:59.539> prop<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.229> up<00:05:00.320> here<00:05:00.680> where

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
let's say let's prop it up here where

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.279 
let's say let's prop it up here where
it's<00:05:00.979> more<00:05:01.250> out<00:05:01.280> in<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.639> open<00:05:02.110> we'll<00:05:03.110> put

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
it's more out in the open we'll put

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.100 
it's more out in the open we'll put
another<00:05:03.320> quarter<00:05:03.949> in<00:05:05.620> but<00:05:06.620> remember<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.310> ball

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
another quarter in but remember the ball

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.719 
another quarter in but remember the ball
is<00:05:09.110> very<00:05:09.470> small<00:05:10.150> LA<00:05:11.830> so<00:05:12.830> it's<00:05:13.130> even<00:05:13.490> though<00:05:13.610> the

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
is very small LA so it's even though the

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.640 
is very small LA so it's even though the
claws<00:05:13.970> arms<00:05:14.720> are<00:05:14.870> all<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.050> way<00:05:15.139> around<00:05:15.440> it

it<00:05:17.270> up<00:05:17.479> see<00:05:18.110> how<00:05:18.289> it<00:05:18.380> slid<00:05:18.770> out<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.820> either<00:05:20.030> end

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389
