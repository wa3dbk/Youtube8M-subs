today<00:00:07.300> we're<00:00:07.540> going<00:00:07.569> to<00:00:07.930> learn<00:00:08.350> how<00:00:08.410> to<00:00:08.650> make

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
today we're going to learn how to make

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.600 
today we're going to learn how to make
an<00:00:09.280> origami<00:00:09.690> swan<00:00:10.799> the<00:00:11.799> first<00:00:12.040> thing<00:00:12.250> we<00:00:12.370> need

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
an origami swan the first thing we need

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.600 
an origami swan the first thing we need
is<00:00:12.879> one<00:00:13.510> sheet<00:00:13.930> of<00:00:14.170> five<00:00:14.799> and<00:00:15.129> seven<00:00:15.490> eighths

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
is one sheet of five and seven eighths

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.019 
is one sheet of five and seven eighths
inch<00:00:16.170> origami<00:00:17.170> paper<00:00:17.500> you<00:00:18.369> will<00:00:18.520> see<00:00:18.699> that<00:00:18.850> one

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
inch origami paper you will see that one

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.499 
inch origami paper you will see that one
side<00:00:19.300> is<00:00:19.510> dark<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.400> other<00:00:21.609> side<00:00:21.939> is<00:00:22.210> light

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
side is dark the other side is light

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.079 
side is dark the other side is light
we're<00:00:23.439> going<00:00:23.710> to<00:00:23.800> start<00:00:24.099> with<00:00:24.339> the<00:00:24.490> dark<00:00:24.759> side

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
we're going to start with the dark side

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.499 
we're going to start with the dark side
up<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:27.220> first<00:00:27.519> thing<00:00:27.730> you're<00:00:27.849> going<00:00:27.999> to<00:00:28.089> do<00:00:28.240> is

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
up the first thing you're going to do is

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.890 
up the first thing you're going to do is
take<00:00:28.869> one<00:00:29.259> corner<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:31.300> meet<00:00:31.570> the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
take one corner and have it meet the

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.600 
take one corner and have it meet the
opposite<00:00:32.740> corner<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:33.790> makes<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:34.180> triangle

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
opposite corner so it makes a triangle

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.230 
opposite corner so it makes a triangle
be<00:00:36.610> very<00:00:36.850> careful<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.390> line<00:00:37.750> up<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:37.990> edges<00:00:38.290> and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
be very careful to line up the edges and

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:48.670 
be very careful to line up the edges and
then<00:00:40.240> crease<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.500> makes<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:41.890> nice<00:00:42.130> triangle

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.990 

ok<00:00:48.920> now<00:00:49.220> we've<00:00:49.490> got<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:50.000> perfect<00:00:50.570> triangle

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.370 

and<00:00:55.510> we're<00:00:55.720> going<00:00:55.990> to<00:00:56.140> open<00:00:56.320> it<00:00:56.620> up<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.350> that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
and we're going to open it up so that

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.600 
and we're going to open it up so that
you<00:00:59.590> can<00:00:59.739> see<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.100> crease<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.620> take<00:01:02.950> one<00:01:03.340> edge

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
you can see the crease and take one edge

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:17.330 
you can see the crease and take one edge
and<00:01:04.680> pull<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.880> up<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:08.170> meet<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:09.040> center<00:01:09.400> line

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.940 

be<00:01:18.340> very<00:01:18.580> careful<00:01:18.910> that<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:20.410> get<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.800> edges

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
be very careful that you get the edges

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:35.280 
be very careful that you get the edges
to<00:01:21.670> meet<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.030> line<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:22.750> then<00:01:23.320> crease

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.350 

you're<00:01:36.290> going<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.710> do<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.400> exact<00:01:37.820> same<00:01:37.910> thing

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
you're going to do the exact same thing

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.900 
you're going to do the exact same thing
on<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.990> other<00:01:39.020> side<00:01:42.040> make<00:01:43.040> sure<00:01:43.100> when<00:01:43.580> you<00:01:43.700> do

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
on the other side make sure when you do

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.230 
on the other side make sure when you do
the<00:01:44.510> sides<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.230> you<00:01:45.350> don't<00:01:45.620> have<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.670> pages

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the sides that you don't have the pages

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.760 
the sides that you don't have the pages
overlap<00:01:48.200> all<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.460> edges<00:01:49.880> need<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.360> meet<00:01:50.770> but

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
overlap all the edges need to meet but

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:03.820 
overlap all the edges need to meet but
not<00:01:51.950> overlap

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.550 

just<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:04.760> that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.479 

okay<00:02:09.399> now<00:02:09.610> we've<00:02:09.849> got<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.780> edges<00:02:11.319> meeting<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
okay now we've got the edges meeting the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.580 
okay now we've got the edges meeting the
next<00:02:12.970> thing<00:02:13.270> we're<00:02:13.390> going<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.690> do<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.200> slip<00:02:14.440> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
next thing we're going to do is slip the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.960 
next thing we're going to do is slip the
entire<00:02:14.950> thing<00:02:14.980> over<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:18.550> can<00:02:18.730> see<00:02:18.940> that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
entire thing over you can see that

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.380 
entire thing over you can see that
middle<00:02:19.510> crease<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.760> you're<00:02:21.760> going<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.150> take

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
middle crease and you're going to take

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.259 
middle crease and you're going to take
one<00:02:22.630> corner<00:02:25.680> flip<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.860> up<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.849> meet

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
one corner flip it up and have it meet

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:40.170 
one corner flip it up and have it meet
the<00:02:29.040> center<00:02:30.040> line<00:02:30.190> once<00:02:31.060> again<00:02:39.180> carefully

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the center line once again carefully

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.289 
the center line once again carefully
crease<00:02:40.870> you'll<00:02:41.470> see<00:02:41.799> that<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.220> dark<00:02:42.519> side<00:02:42.880> is

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
crease you'll see that the dark side is

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.570 
crease you'll see that the dark side is
showing<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.170> little<00:02:44.200> bit<00:02:44.560> but<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
showing just a little bit but the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.900 
showing just a little bit but the
prominent<00:02:46.120> side<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.690> lighter<00:02:46.930> side<00:02:50.910> we're

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
prominent side is the lighter side we're

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.170 
prominent side is the lighter side we're
going<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.239> do<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.540> exact<00:02:53.049> same<00:02:53.170> thing<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
going to do the exact same thing on the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:15.770 
going to do the exact same thing on the
other<00:02:55.209> side

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.410 

be<00:03:16.470> very<00:03:16.680> careful<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.250> get<00:03:17.550> all<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.000> edges

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
be very careful to get all of the edges

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.620 
be very careful to get all of the edges
to<00:03:18.630> meet<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:20.160> crease<00:03:20.520> them<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.450> they're

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
to meet and then crease them so they're

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.820 
to meet and then crease them so they're
nice<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.080> tight<00:03:22.260> creases

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.090 

the<00:03:31.830> next<00:03:32.280> step<00:03:32.520> is<00:03:32.880> taking<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.319> narrow

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
the next step is taking the narrow

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.750 
the next step is taking the narrow
pointy<00:03:35.819> side<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.920> we're<00:03:37.920> going<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.220> flip<00:03:38.700> it

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
pointy side and we're going to flip it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.650 
pointy side and we're going to flip it
up<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.540> meet<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.230> wider<00:03:41.780> side<00:03:44.270> going<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.420> need

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
up to meet the wider side going to need

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.420 
up to meet the wider side going to need
to<00:03:45.810> work<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.260> paper<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.709> little<00:03:46.950> bit<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.400> that

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
to work the paper a little bit so that

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.170 
to work the paper a little bit so that
you<00:03:47.670> make<00:03:47.850> sure<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.240> smooth<00:03:49.430> line<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.610> up<00:03:50.730> so

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
you make sure it's smooth line it up so

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.260 
you make sure it's smooth line it up so
that<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.390> edges<00:03:51.720> meet<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:53.400> point<00:03:53.760> meets<00:03:54.000> the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
that the edges meet the point meets the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.290 
that the edges meet the point meets the
point<00:03:54.830> then<00:03:55.830> work<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.400> paper<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.850> little<00:03:57.090> bit

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
point then work the paper a little bit

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.400 
point then work the paper a little bit
so<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.110> have<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.709> nice<00:03:59.239> smooth<00:04:00.410> crease

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
so that you have a nice smooth crease

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:13.220 
so that you have a nice smooth crease
just<00:04:07.640> like<00:04:08.640> so

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.470 

the<00:04:14.230> next<00:04:14.590> thing<00:04:14.740> we're<00:04:14.920> going<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.190> do<00:04:15.490> is<00:04:15.819> to

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
the next thing we're going to do is to

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.870 
the next thing we're going to do is to
make<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.049> Swans<00:04:17.380> head<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.489> we're<00:04:18.700> going<00:04:18.820> to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
make the Swans head and we're going to

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.280 
make the Swans head and we're going to
put<00:04:19.090> your<00:04:19.570> finger<00:04:20.139> right<00:04:21.630> above<00:04:22.630> where<00:04:23.080> the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
put your finger right above where the

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.100 
put your finger right above where the
other<00:04:23.919> colors<00:04:24.340> meet<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.480> that's<00:04:25.840> where

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
other colors meet and that's where

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.409 
other colors meet and that's where
you're<00:04:26.260> going<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.740> crease<00:04:27.070> going<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.150> pull<00:04:28.389> it

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
you're going to crease going to pull it

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:42.960 
you're going to crease going to pull it
up<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.639> make<00:04:30.639> a<00:04:30.669> nice<00:04:31.290> straight<00:04:32.290> crease<00:04:41.970> just

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
up and make a nice straight crease just

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.200 
up and make a nice straight crease just
like<00:04:43.210> that

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.030 

the<00:04:49.210> next<00:04:49.600> step<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.530> we're<00:04:50.680> going<00:04:50.919> to

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
the next step is that we're going to

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.650 
the next step is that we're going to
pick<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.520> entire<00:04:51.910> thing<00:04:52.270> up<00:04:53.850> very<00:04:54.850> carefully

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.080 

and<00:04:58.660> then<00:04:58.780> we're<00:04:58.960> going<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.290> wreak<00:04:59.950> Reese<00:05:00.400> your

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
and then we're going to wreak Reese your

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.659 
and then we're going to wreak Reese your
original<00:05:01.990> crease<00:05:03.570> just<00:05:04.570> like<00:05:05.080> so<00:05:05.860> but<00:05:06.430> be<00:05:06.639> very

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
original crease just like so but be very

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.080 
original crease just like so but be very
careful<00:05:07.360> not<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:08.590> touch<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.160> very<00:05:09.370> front<00:05:09.850> of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
careful not to touch the very front of

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.300 
careful not to touch the very front of
it<00:05:10.240> just<00:05:11.610> crease<00:05:12.610> back<00:05:12.970> on<00:05:13.740> your<00:05:14.740> original

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
it just crease back on your original

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.999 
it just crease back on your original
line<00:05:16.410> like<00:05:17.410> so

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.109 

the<00:05:20.969> next<00:05:21.419> step<00:05:21.689> is<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.589> pull<00:05:23.189> that<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.879> neck

00:05:24.109 --> 00:05:24.119 
the next step is to pull that the neck

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:27.980 
the next step is to pull that the neck
so<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:24.990> its<00:05:25.379> upright<00:05:26.330> it's<00:05:27.330> going<00:05:27.629> to<00:05:27.779> take

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
so that its upright it's going to take

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.790 
so that its upright it's going to take
it<00:05:28.259> and<00:05:28.580> pull<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:30.110> once<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.319> have<00:05:31.529> it<00:05:31.680> in

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
it and pull it once you have it in

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.459 
it and pull it once you have it in
position<00:05:32.149> crease<00:05:34.369> the<00:05:35.369> corner<00:05:35.819> where<00:05:35.999> you've

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.369
