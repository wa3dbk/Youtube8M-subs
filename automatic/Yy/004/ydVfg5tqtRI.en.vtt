00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:12.050
 [music] 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.070
 all the nonsense committed your mind and this 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.869
 minecraft mechanisms on the channel sang on 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.680
 this moment this third series 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.529
 and I will show less so simple and 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.169
 interesting mechanism maybe you have it 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.899
 seen now i will demonstrate how he 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.510
 works we put a piece here 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.700
 redstone and we open the door 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.670
 set again and we have it all 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.570
 the whole point is not closed in this door but in 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.320
 the most activator opened now 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:55.270
 we will retreat a little space and we will begin 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:01.990
 build our whole system and so before the start 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:07.180
 let's build a platform like this 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.229
 Here is the way it turns out at one two three 4 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.329
 5 wide 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:17.619
 Well, the length of course it does not matter here 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:21.219
 here at the corner put the lever at the end under 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:25.600
 bottom and click on it here here 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.700
 put 2 blocks here put sticky 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.869
 piston and block 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.869
 here these blocks can be removed further do 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.869
 the wall 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:49.569
 three blocks would be nice too 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:52.240
 do and here and in three blocks here and so 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.959
 and here's a platformochka still do 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.959
 to exit 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.599
 that's so perfect so from here we put 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:08.429
 torch 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:11.650
 block torch block redstone here 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.500
 funnels direct each other clamped 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.800
 a cipher if who does not know 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.220
 I think everyone knows we will put it like this 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:27.360
 block 2 blocks 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:34.580
 and here the comparator here is the repeater unit 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.900
 and here the roof is now close all 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.750
 [music] 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.340
 so here there is none here in one block 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.340
 close here here 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.310
 So 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.450
 so here 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.420
 [music] 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.720
 here we make a hole a hole here sometimes 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:12.640
 it happens so put sticky pistons 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:15.950
 for our ordinary door blocks and spend 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:24.730
 the blocks like this 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:29.830
 the roof here and so it turns out here is given and 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.599
 redstone redstone redstone redstone 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.090
 repeater redstone repeaters 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:42.830
 a delay of 4 so here 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.270
 here and look so there is no and we forgot 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:51.800
 put one any item over here 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:55.960
 the very day any subject and look all 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:02.440
 works as you can connect here 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:05.230
 just some kind of how to say it 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:13.760
 connect a button here for example 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:17.609
 here and so here we have a docking here 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:24.659
 not included here 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:26.759
 so here not so here so here they are 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:31.590
 will not work well, then it can be shorter 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:33.919
 itâ€™s easy to come up in principle 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.719
