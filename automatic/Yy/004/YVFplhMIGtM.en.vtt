00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.160
 drawn face less vitality afterwards it may had 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.130
 especially jeroen stevens plastic surgeon 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.029
 and gladly present kriek 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.089
 the biological cosmetic surgery as I like it part 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.589
 From the child I became a bit of a concept 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.720
 look at how the face gets older and what you have to do 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.869
 and growth factors 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.940
 good factors 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.520
 ideal addition 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.740
 to ensure that wound healing posed with own 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.659
 platelets 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.710
 it all sounds complex, that of course also says how do you become 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 exactly for young and older 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.220
 Well obviously the gravity has gone from the top down when they entered 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.130
 dimensional and so is the correct answer from the surgeon 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.130
 exactly vertically up in the opposite direction 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.429
 if following is like here 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.790
 agrees with various techniques including gives 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.010
 very successful 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.090
 a kind of new one does not give a very natural look 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.500
 a powerful jaw line and a nice crown 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.300
 a nice exercise in the face 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.450
 read more hold large epidermis 8 that gives little import you two later 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.160
 dimensionally the flat surface 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.240
 and those are 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.910
 very diffuse 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.810
 small fine lines or a larger surface 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.320
 then the correct answer 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 you don't draw that card on that fine little girl 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.230
 but concentric the opposite direction for example pius x 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.210
 here you see 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 how the skin can indeed redecorate the face the friesian 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770
 appearance but it is more complex 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.150
 look at 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.610
 this animation someone who turns 40 in four seconds from 10 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.439
 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 years 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.120
 when i returned 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 had obviously seen Belserang 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.130
 always and not everywhere with pain from this how the stains 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.580
 in the hope that someone will be 40 years older 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.900
 especially on that should actually work out of place at all 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.200
 so it is not always raised hand in the face 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.290
 his drawing anyway 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.820
 due to volume loss 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.660
 but with your mouse to sleep 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.890
 here you can see what someone was like 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.610
 have a nice club in the face with complete but Hamilton birth 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.709
 card reader 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.129
 and that actually also applies to the area at the eyebrows upper eyelid 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.579
 plenty of but the eye sockets land 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.589
 the clocks dog life eye sockets of someone who is too 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.200
 but also scared of the flatter areas for the next twelve months 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.050
 within the lines of this bank ever in the project 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.059
 4 volume loss 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.790
 and also 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.290
 the lips become less volt over time 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.589
 The volume loss is three dimensional that this happens all directions 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.640
 deteriorated, the foundation sinks under the face 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.859
 i get you that is called implosion sagging face 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.409
 is the correct answer three-dimensional 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.450
 supporting expansion 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.429
 to the outside I find that people give back 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:57.269
 it is about larger volumes of loss and therefore also large volumes 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.299
 to give boredom to animals and that is now possible with lipofilling milito 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.429
 own fat 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.229
 that only costs a loss of volume 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.570
 is a vs has 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.320
 no need to go back feeling first choice and if she is here you have to 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.629
 it only had the volume freezing the face 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.760
 handsome to be on 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.380
 from only own fat 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.969
 a stable result after one year 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.969
 curves the contours that radiate vitality 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:24.949
 is it about a more complex problem 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.759
 so quoted his thing from 20 and right or 60 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.759
 he has a one and 2 and three-dimensional 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.289
 leaving the face not drawn 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.109
 and then with respect to all those elements you have to face bitten by there 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.589
 attached to correct 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.439
 and, for example, dermabrasion completes the eu shutdown 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.660
 the upper lip but also 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.999
 give volume to fulfillment 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.509
 Then you get that team's vitality on this article as in these results 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:53.809
 but it is more complex 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.119
 Now that we know that it's not just about pulling her but it's about living 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:59.679
 cells and active substances between them 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.439
 scientific research is needed and what appears 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.010
 present published that state that slowly start getting more out of it 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.039
 understand here when they have a lot to do with blood flow 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.939
 perisic they argue 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.919
 the blue celien left corner around blood vessels 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.009
 and that the substances that active substance is good factors 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.699
 they appear together 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.620
 mean something for the level of blood flow and vitality 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.710
 for instance 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.379
 osn transferred fit center feeling shoot 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.159
 to keep alive 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.949
 in the picture you see how good the course is, activated platelets you 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.169
 for example the 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.529
 father stimulating good factor 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.559
 dsk and of course stronger because in a few steps am 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:41.680
 the outside of a bus 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.409
 can also stick 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.099
 there blood vessel cells would grow into new pennies 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.990
 in a few steps 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.729
 that it stands in the base, all those tubular bushes form the entire field 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.260
 lierse of new blood vessels slightly better blood flow 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.300
 but by example 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.110
 transferred the fat cells 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.210
 stay alive 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.939
 this site 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.210
 stabilized those new blood vessels 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.430
 the ability to make it contract later becomes that blood 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.669
 flow improves everything added together 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.869
 james to understand things that are not designed for the molecular level 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:17.599
 and with 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.710
 that pirlo suspended ritchie fight 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.930
 can do something with that 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.180
 here you see how i take that blood 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.419
 if that is to be used 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.999
 to there the 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:31.249
 active substances from the platelets 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:32.509
 to separate 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.740
 with a centrifuge as you see here it is relatively easy even within 15 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.759
 minutes 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.120
 and see the plasma cloud to Reims here 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.349
 there would be a thief 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.869
 he provides a very thin layer with the platelets that it's all about 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:47.020
 goes that floats on the red blood cells 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.330
 a clinic with 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.180
 the pictures 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.169
 literally 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.059
 introduce good factors 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:55.490
 on the spot 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.240
 but changed as we her friend 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.589
 you can literally be present later 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:01.600
 return 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.500
 to return the vitality to 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.020
 he sat and so we go for the stage 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.270
 safety 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.900
 not that chance 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.400
 digitally at this time 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.569
 with good factors in combination with that profiling 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.449
 of puffing result 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.699
 want to know more about this 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.240
 cosmetic organic 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.939
 plastic surgery 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.520
 look on the tab reachable to the strongest point and make an appointment 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.789
 and i think i would like more about it
