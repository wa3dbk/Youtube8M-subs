00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.750
 new my name is abel varela and today I 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.069
 I bring the review of pemex watches 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.990
 masters is a mouse that comes to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.449
 replace the art you explore form 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.449
 the vector forment was introduced to 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:18.269
 market 4 or 5 years ago 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.179
 then this art is already working 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.349
 long ago and let's see what he did box lake 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.679
 to improve 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.589
 'the opinion' best mouse that was in 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.169
 the market and if it's worth updating 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.510
 to this new mouse style or if you have 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.690
 elements to performance stay with 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.219
 this with this we see in a fast boxing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.930
 and then we return with my or with my 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.680
 opinions and what I think from this 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.379
 frame and here is the 1000 ex masters 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.550
 masters ready for action boxing comes 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.489
 direct from the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 from the amazon warehouse so 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.559
 let's see that inside still packaged 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.549
 ergonomically it feels very good is a 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.720
 very stable solid mouse and it seems that 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.720
 It is built in a good way 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 here we can see the mode of 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.079
 pairing has three ways to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 match or you can drive with three 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:25.200
 devices at the same time can 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.939
 be that number one is floating that 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 means that it is available for 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.810
 pair with max tablets or 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.630
 tablets like the ipad and devices 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.830
 android feels good in the hands is 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.619
 if you expect the previous 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.630
 lp mex performance was also very 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.360
 well and I think it feels better here 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.899
 We have a side scroll wheel for 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 move in sheets prestige in sheets 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.680
 excel or what you get using 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.040
 sideways 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.290
 and it feels solid and has a little bit of 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.720
 weight and here we have the back buttons 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.200
 forward or you can also 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.460
 program for any function that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.350
 it can happen to you 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.070
 I usually use them as a paste 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.070
 cut and paste 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.640
 it has a surface 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.000
 sticky as they are not slippery 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.470
 like the imex performance 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.320
 I do not know if this is going to be always or 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.710
 only now with him with this new 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.750
 but the surface is 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.440
 very solid here we have the scroll wheel 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:48.030
 frisco wheel if you have a long long 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.800
 list you can move quickly and 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.960
 is the biggest discussion how it 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.360
 compare to the already so good in my ex 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.170
 performance for me the best mouse that 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.170
 I know in my life 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.730
 undoubtedly the in former masters mouse 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.590
 which looks very attractive visually not 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.900
 it will look bad on your desk and it will 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.780
 work wonders with any 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.020
 thing that you use it yet I have my 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.020
 Reservations 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.920
 by itself the mx masters is a very 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.020
 good mouse adds functions like working 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.270
 with several devices long life of 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.150
 up to 40 hours battery which is also 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.760
 rechargeable and a very modern look but at 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.220
 adding the side scroll makes it less 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.050
 comfortable that the next performance this is 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.140
 because to use the buttons you have to 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.209
 move your thumb back and it's not 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.209
 so common and do not fulfill their task of 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.060
 replace being better than it is already 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.830
 mentioned in mix for mans simply 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.799
 there is no reason to upgrade to the master mix 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.590
 if you already have the performance my verdict 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.569
 is the mix master is a very good mouse 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.910
 and the best to replace the mix 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.560
 performance that goes out if you're in 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.569
 the market to buy a newer 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.000
 I recommend that you look for the same forms 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.310
 on offer and if you do not find it the mx 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.810
 masters will not disappoint you being the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.420
 best mouse that works with bluetooth 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.630
 on any surface and economically 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.790
 very comfortable the question is whether it is worth 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.340
 the 100 dollars that logitech asks for him 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.170
 or if you are going to wait for it to go down in price 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.620
 in a year or two 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.620
 Thank you
