00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.110
 this is what gives us another video aquino 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.099
 chubby and this time people are here to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.960
 talk about something really controversial but 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 Let's go for parts before we talk about 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.699
 subject itself I wanted to 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.519
 first to thank the 300 thousand 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.740
 subscribed here on the channel face is 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.480
 unbelievable 300,000 people have me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.939
 accompanying here on the channel 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.410
 Anyway I'll talk more about this about 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.079
 the thank you draw 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.140
 later another video but that I 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.020
 I wanted to talk to you today about one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 possible rac1 possible bug someone 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 is exploring within the clash of lance 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 As I discovered it, basically I 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.039
 I like to give credits to where 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.190
 find the news or the channel that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.469
 talked about it 1st and in the case was a channel 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.930
 that I actually clicked was not for the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.570
 news I clicked to know why 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.309
 I like to follow but most of the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.489
 clash of thrones channels of brazil 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.560
 nelson enrolled in the staff channel is 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.420
 precisely to be able to follow how it is 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.140
 what is the people like quetta community 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.330
 and I went to the buggy law channel 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 games is a girl who makes videos of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.640
 dog clans is representing the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.259
 class of girls in the game including 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.290
 Let me send a big kiss to everything. 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.390
 world of clash girls axa 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.090
 I was there recently was very 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.920
 Nice kiss for all of you there. 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.070
 they are really sensational 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.770
 finally she showed in the video that in 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.409
 It is true who is denouncing 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.829
 quotation marks disclosing this problem this bug 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.619
 This hack is a gringo and its three videos 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.130
 who have now come out talking about a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.560
 such as the one that ram that is a face that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.390
 I do not know where he left where 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 that he is perhaps of his own 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 Finland is because there they have these 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.890
 very bizarre names and he simply 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.619
 is going out attacking the villages with 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.140
 1.300 2000 giants exactly like 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.050
 many do there with using some 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.290
 applications to be able to simulate s 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.990
 attacks with thousands of troops but are 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.360
 always offline attacks however this 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.730
 goal and he is achieving 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 Make it serious, he's succeeding. 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.990
 attack that for real 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.730
 at least that is what seems to show the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.260
 videos will show you in replays 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 in fact it looks like it's true and well 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.960
 convincing the replays that the guys 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.630
 actually appeared to be the game 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.660
 no it's not a pirate server it's not a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.180
 simulated attack the face shows on the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.970
 replays or anything about attacks that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.870
 received the attack of obeying that 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.750
 Ram 1300 with giants in the other 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.140
 with 2 thousand at the end is something that really 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.000
 impressed and motivated me to bring video 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.100
 neither should I who should be studying now 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.110
 for my morning class to be praised 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.120
 why recording this video fast to 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.060
 talk to you about it 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.610
 good until then fast to dog clans 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.920
 does not exist maybe this is not hack 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.900
 maybe he has is a village of 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.170
 developer because we know it's 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.200
 like it was the twins of the games right? 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.380
 games have availability of power 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.770
 do some testing and have it all 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.950
 at most eg gm from other games 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.450
 always has infinite money 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.380
 infinite equipment because they are 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.300
 in the case company employees 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.230
 maybe it's a gm village and that I 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.660
 I'm afraid there 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.239
 his nephew took his life left 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.520
 maybe that's it maybe 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.280
 a very fucked hacker who managed to 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.620
 fact hacking the clash system 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.209
 We do not know what people are saying. 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.270
 knows that this news is spreading 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.190
 quick and everyone is impressed 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.110
 Imagine if this guy is a 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.540
 hacker was able to hack and will 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.910
 make the method available to guys 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.150
 currently expensive so if you simply 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.040
 would ruin the game would still 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.799
 we know in the clash including 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.049
 economy and destroy the game and the game went to 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.630
 bankruptcy in a short time if this does not 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.240
 be corrected as soon as possible 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.850
 Let's see from now on how it's going to be 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.440
 the reaction 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.620
 Marcel if they will say anything 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.450
 because they usually try to lower it is the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.730
 dust does not let the dust spread 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.590
 but anyway I believe it is not a 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.720
 hacker i believe it's a gm life 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.360
 or today he rebelled 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.210
 or his nephew took it and the son took it 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.850
 his village started to fly or something 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.280
 genre of the book is more on the side of the grid 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.010
 more on the side of the bug than on the side 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.200
 I think in the case it would be 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.510
 this fact educate by attacking with giants 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.120
 good may also be a great move 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.150
 marketing that the guy is doing here 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.320
 to promote the channel itself is 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.110
 could do something extremely 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.810
 convincingly convinced at least 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.790
 me that really expensive looks a lot 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.410
 very real even from your opinion 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.880
 here in the comments you think this 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.670
 is real do you think this is done you 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.650
 Do you think this is going to be kept do you think? 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.990
 that is superficial will do something 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.880
 What are you going to talk about this? 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.920
 Let's see in the future maybe I'll bring it to 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.610
 you update as it was right 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.160
 case and find out how this 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.260
 situation but after a long time 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.390
 without recording videos I'll start to bring 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.410
 some blogs because they are easier for 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.030
 I could record 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.230
 so you can stay connected here on the channel 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.270
 that at least the blocks I go 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.280
 able to bring more frequently 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.650
 for you because it's easier for 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.570
 I bring content through blogs 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.760
 here in the channel so special beauty and 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.940
 you liked the novelty between 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.700
 afros of exclusive news between the streets 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.380
 It is also but I'll leave the video of 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.000
 lady bug in description if you want to see 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.560
 What did she say? 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.930
 is here in the description like to give the 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.970
 after all, it did not start from 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.770
 I found on her channel and torq 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.510
 Bringing you beauty, then let it 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.400
 her limit on the license in her video too

 it is inscribed that it subscribes there 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.260
