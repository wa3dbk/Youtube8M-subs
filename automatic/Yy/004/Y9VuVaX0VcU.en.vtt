00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.059 
it but you can't so you are maybe to use
this<00:03:16.650> way<00:03:17.330> okay<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.629> this<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.019> cool<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:19.680> one

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
this way okay so this is cool but one

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.500 
this way okay so this is cool but one
question<00:03:20.540> whoa<00:03:21.540> why<00:03:22.140> do<00:03:22.950> we<00:03:23.099> get<00:03:23.280> fat<00:03:23.519> in<00:03:24.299> this

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
question whoa why do we get fat in this

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.259 
question whoa why do we get fat in this
way<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:25.200> good<00:03:25.500> but<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.980> could<00:03:26.580> be<00:03:26.730> better<00:03:26.760> if

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
way it's good but it could be better if

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.140 
way it's good but it could be better if
we<00:03:27.330> have<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:28.500> plugin<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.700> way<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:29.940> know

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
we have this plugin in this way you know

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.470 
we have this plugin in this way you know
so<00:03:30.870> maybe<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.410> can<00:03:31.590> do<00:03:31.769> something<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.340> that

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
so maybe you can do something like that

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.330 
so maybe you can do something like that
okay<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.290> way<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.680> don't<00:03:34.709> work<00:03:35.310> very

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
