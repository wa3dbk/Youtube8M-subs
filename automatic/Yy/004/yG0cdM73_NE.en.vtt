then<00:04:18.030> if<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.510> protect<00:04:18.870> your<00:04:19.049> livestock<00:04:19.229> have

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
then if you protect your livestock have

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.150 
then if you protect your livestock have
wildlife<00:04:20.359> predators<00:04:21.359> can<00:04:21.750> live<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:22.950> have

wildlife predators can live and not have

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
of the attendees it was a course that

it<00:04:32.190> was<00:04:32.460> not<00:04:32.639> all<00:04:32.819> about<00:04:33.030> receiving<00:04:33.629> a

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
it was not all about receiving a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.080 
it was not all about receiving a
certificate<00:04:34.470> after<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.039> course<00:04:35.280> but<00:04:35.940> the

certificate after the course but the

certificate after the course but the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
future of the cheetah and I think for me

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.149 
future of the cheetah and I think for me
conservation<00:04:42.810> started<00:04:43.289> when<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.770> started

about keeping one thing of the system

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.200 
about keeping one thing of the system
healthy<00:04:49.919> but<00:04:50.069> it's<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> entire<00:04:50.610> system<00:04:50.940> as<00:04:51.180> a
