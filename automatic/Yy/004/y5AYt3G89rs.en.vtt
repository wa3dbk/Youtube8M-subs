what<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.880> ended<00:01:56.180> up<00:01:56.300> doing<00:01:56.479> was<00:01:56.750> cutting

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
what I ended up doing was cutting

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.840 
what I ended up doing was cutting
another<00:01:57.290> white<00:01:57.560> strand<00:01:57.950> from<00:01:58.159> this<00:01:58.310> shirt<00:01:58.520> and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
another white strand from this shirt and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.550 
another white strand from this shirt and
now<00:01:59.330> I'm<00:01:59.450> just<00:01:59.600> measuring<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.110> off<00:02:00.229> with<00:02:00.440> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
now I'm just measuring it off with the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.440 
now I'm just measuring it off with the
previous<00:02:00.950> one<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.190> I<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.610> cut<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.180> 20

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
previous one so I can cut it to 20

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.320 
previous one so I can cut it to 20
inches<00:02:02.690> as<00:02:02.840> well<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.740> in<00:02:03.950> all<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.340> want<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.820> 20

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
inches as well so in all you want to 20

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.509 
inches as well so in all you want to 20
inch<00:02:05.479> strands<00:02:06.050> that<00:02:06.140> are<00:02:06.200> white<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:10.190> remember

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
inch strands that are white so remember

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.009 
inch strands that are white so remember
that<00:02:10.550> gray<00:02:10.880> strand<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.360> showed<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.690> guys<00:02:11.720> at

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
that gray strand I showed you guys at

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.030 
that gray strand I showed you guys at
the<00:02:12.080> beginning<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> video

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
the beginning of the video

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
the beginning of the video
well<00:02:13.459> now<00:02:13.610> I'm<00:02:13.790> taking<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.360> measuring<00:02:14.750> it

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
well now I'm taking it and measuring it

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.570 
well now I'm taking it and measuring it
off<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.739> one<00:02:15.890> actually<00:02:16.160> splits<00:02:16.430> in<00:02:16.550> half

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
off and this one actually splits in half

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.300 
off and this one actually splits in half
perfectly<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.630> have<00:02:17.840> 4<00:02:18.110> strands<00:02:18.440> now<00:02:18.650> two

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
perfectly so we have 4 strands now two

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.300 
perfectly so we have 4 strands now two
white<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.730> two<00:02:20.000> gray<00:02:23.530> okay<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.739> we<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.190> now

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
white and two gray okay so we can now

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.979 
white and two gray okay so we can now
take<00:02:25.340> our<00:02:25.730> two<00:02:25.880> hair<00:02:26.090> ties<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:26.630> pull<00:02:26.840> them

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
take our two hair ties and pull them

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.060 
take our two hair ties and pull them
through<00:02:27.019> each<00:02:27.260> other<00:02:27.440> if<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.680> guys<00:02:27.800> didn't

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
through each other if you guys didn't

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.650 
through each other if you guys didn't
get<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.400> then<00:02:28.610> maybe<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.940> guys<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.330> rewatch

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
get that then maybe you guys can rewatch

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.770 
get that then maybe you guys can rewatch
it<00:02:33.190> pick<00:02:34.190> one<00:02:34.430> side<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.880> four<00:02:35.120> strands<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
it pick one side of the four strands and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.690 
it pick one side of the four strands and
bring<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.440> through<00:02:36.470> once<00:02:37.010> out<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.340> hair<00:02:37.519> tie

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
bring it through once out of a hair tie

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.520 
bring it through once out of a hair tie
you<00:02:38.269> want<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> make<00:02:38.630> sure<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:39.049> face<00:02:39.290> them

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you want to make sure you face them

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.530 
you want to make sure you face them
inward<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.130> now<00:02:40.280> take<00:02:40.519> your<00:02:40.610> crazy<00:02:40.940> glue<00:02:41.299> and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
inward so now take your crazy glue and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:51.010 
inward so now take your crazy glue and
start<00:02:42.200> gluing<00:02:42.350> section-by-section

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.740 

so<00:02:51.980> keep<00:02:52.220> adding<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.700> crazy<00:02:52.970> glue<00:02:53.270> on<00:02:53.420> top<00:02:53.570> of

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
so keep adding the crazy glue on top of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.660 
so keep adding the crazy glue on top of
each<00:02:53.930> layer<00:02:54.200> until<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.800> glued<00:02:54.980> all<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.460> four

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
each layer until you glued all the four

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:08.710 
each layer until you glued all the four
strands<00:02:56.000> down

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.420 

and<00:03:09.720> that's<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.379> for<00:03:10.530> one<00:03:10.739> side<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.280> can

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and that's it for one side now we can

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.970 
and that's it for one side now we can
start<00:03:11.849> braiding<00:03:12.299> this<00:03:13.140> part<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.620> kind<00:03:13.890> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
start braiding this part is kind of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.500 
start braiding this part is kind of
tricky<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> actually<00:03:14.610> had<00:03:14.939> some<00:03:15.150> troubles

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
tricky I actually had some troubles

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.990 
tricky I actually had some troubles
myself<00:03:16.019> as<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.290> guys<00:03:16.409> can<00:03:16.620> probably<00:03:16.680> tell<00:03:17.189> but

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
myself as you guys can probably tell but

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.190 
myself as you guys can probably tell but
you're<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.269> doing<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.540> four<00:03:18.780> strand<00:03:19.170> braid

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you're just doing a four strand braid

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.410 
you're just doing a four strand braid
and<00:03:19.560> I'm<00:03:20.250> trying<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.610> figure<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.879> out<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.390> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
and I'm trying to figure it out but you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.559 
and I'm trying to figure it out but you
can<00:03:21.599> just<00:03:21.780> braid<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.430> try<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.730> braid<00:03:24.060> as

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
can just braid just just try to braid as

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.240 
can just braid just just try to braid as
well<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:25.409> and<00:03:25.680> bring<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.980> strands

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
well as you can and bring the strands

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.699 
well as you can and bring the strands
together<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.090> just<00:03:27.629> do<00:03:28.109> this<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.590> way

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
together and just do this all the way

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:46.570 
together and just do this all the way
down

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.000 

so<00:03:47.240> as<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.720> was<00:03:47.750> getting<00:03:48.020> closer<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.710> end<00:03:48.770> I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
so as I was getting closer to the end I

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.410 
so as I was getting closer to the end I
was<00:03:49.130> getting<00:03:49.460> a<00:03:49.520> little<00:03:49.640> bit<00:03:49.850> better<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.330> a

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
was getting a little bit better and a

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.460 
was getting a little bit better and a
lot<00:03:50.570> faster<00:03:50.600> at<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:55.960> can<00:03:56.960> you<00:03:57.020> guess<00:03:57.230> what's

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
lot faster at it can you guess what's

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.380 
lot faster at it can you guess what's
next<00:03:57.860> now<00:03:58.460> you<00:03:58.490> have<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.820> bring<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.240> other

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
next now you have to bring the other

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.810 
next now you have to bring the other
four<00:03:59.690> strands<00:04:00.080> over<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.410> hair<00:04:00.650> tie<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.190> again

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
four strands over the hair tie and again

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.730 
four strands over the hair tie and again
bring<00:04:02.060> them<00:04:02.180> inwards<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.900> begin<00:04:03.290> gluing<00:04:03.620> them

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
bring them inwards and begin gluing them

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:17.740 
bring them inwards and begin gluing them
strand<00:04:04.190> by<00:04:04.400> strand<00:04:15.070> if<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.730> have<00:04:16.940> any<00:04:17.180> extra

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
strand by strand if you have any extra

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:27.600 
strand by strand if you have any extra
material<00:04:17.870> now<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.859> time<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.370> snip<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:19.940> off

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.190 

both<00:04:28.610> sides<00:04:28.640> are<00:04:29.030> now<00:04:29.150> secured<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.930> we<00:04:30.050> can

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
both sides are now secured and we can

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.920 
both sides are now secured and we can
start<00:04:30.470> designing<00:04:33.880> you<00:04:34.880> guys<00:04:35.060> ready<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.600> be
