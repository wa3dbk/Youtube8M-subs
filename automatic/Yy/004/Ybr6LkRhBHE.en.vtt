into<00:01:19.590> our<00:01:19.740> own<00:01:19.920> game<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.580> should<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:20.850> do

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
into our own game so you should also do

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
into our own game so you should also do
invite<00:01:22.590> only<00:01:22.770> games<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.150> in

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299

invite only games so it's just you in
there<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.659> seem<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> higher<00:01:25.320> chance

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there you seem to have a higher chance

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
there you seem to have a higher chance
for<00:01:25.950> some<00:01:26.100> reason<00:01:26.460> run<00:01:26.729> from<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.390> shipping

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
for some reason run from the shipping

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.920 
for some reason run from the shipping
yard<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.850> area<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.570> there's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
yard up to this area and then there's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
yard up to this area and then there's
the<00:01:31.350> industrial<00:01:31.890> park<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.369> above<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the industrial park just above the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.670 
the industrial park just above the
shipping<00:01:33.240> yard<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.630> north<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.439> also

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
shipping yard just north of that is also

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.359 
shipping yard just north of that is also
another<00:01:35.130> good<00:01:35.400> spot<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> but

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
another good spot to get it but

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.330 
another good spot to get it but
basically<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> don't<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.270> within

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
basically if you don't have it within

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.030 
basically if you don't have it within
probably<00:01:41.340> 20<00:01:42.090> minutes<00:01:42.420> 30<00:01:42.960> minutes<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.680> mean

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
probably 20 minutes 30 minutes I mean

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
probably 20 minutes 30 minutes I mean
you<00:01:44.130> could<00:01:44.220> probably<00:01:44.280> every<00:01:45.030> 15<00:01:45.450> minutes<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you could probably every 15 minutes just

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
you could probably every 15 minutes just
leave<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> game<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.619> come<00:01:46.770> back<00:01:46.979> someone<00:01:47.790> was

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
leave the game and come back someone was

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.460 
leave the game and come back someone was
telling<00:01:48.060> me<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.390> helps<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
telling me that that helps with the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
telling me that that helps with the
respawn<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.399> there's<00:01:50.640> been<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> few

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
respawn and then there's been a few

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
respawn and then there's been a few
people<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.540> told<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.710> how

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830 
people that have told me that that's how
they've<00:01:53.040> gotten<00:01:53.399> their<00:01:53.520> success<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.750> know

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
they've gotten their success is you know

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
they've gotten their success is you know
coming<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> game<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.520> down<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
coming in the game going down to the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.580 
coming in the game going down to the
shipping<00:01:57.299> yard<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> chipping<00:01:58.409> yard

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
shipping yard it's not a chipping yard

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.289 
shipping yard it's not a chipping yard
they<00:01:58.770> leave<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.310> go<00:01:59.610> into<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> new<00:02:00.090> game

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
they leave the game go into a new game

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.630 
they leave the game go into a new game
so<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.350> still<00:02:01.680> might<00:02:01.860> take<00:02:02.189> quite<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.520> while

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so it still might take quite a while

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609 
so it still might take quite a while
sometimes<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.570> lucky<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.170> seems<00:02:04.439> like

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
sometimes you get lucky it seems like

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.089 
sometimes you get lucky it seems like
these<00:02:04.799> are<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.520> location<00:02:06.390> /<00:02:06.869> timer<00:02:07.500> type<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
these are on a location / timer type of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.680 
these are on a location / timer type of
thing<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> location

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
thing you know it's like the location

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.900 
thing you know it's like the location
and<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.080> time<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> original

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
and the time and this is the original

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.330 
and the time and this is the original
video<00:02:12.420> showing<00:02:12.959> right

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
video showing right

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
video showing right
now<00:02:13.430> for<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.480> one<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.750> i<00:02:14.780> had<00:02:15.019> just<00:02:15.379> so<00:02:15.530> i

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
now for the one that i had just so i

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.900 
now for the one that i had just so i
could<00:02:15.650> extend<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.280> little<00:02:16.310> bit<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.700> show

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
could extend it a little bit and show

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.259 
could extend it a little bit and show
you<00:02:17.019> new<00:02:18.019> people<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.860> they<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.910> know<00:02:19.970> here's

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
you new people that they you know here's

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.030 
you new people that they you know here's
two<00:02:20.450> different<00:02:20.780> locations<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.590> found<00:02:21.800> in

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
two different locations that is found in

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.309 
two different locations that is found in
and<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.849> can<00:02:22.940> also<00:02:23.120> go<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.720> i<00:02:23.840> said<00:02:24.019> just<00:02:24.140> a

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
and you can also go like i said just a

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.710 
and you can also go like i said just a
little<00:02:24.560> north<00:02:24.769> of<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.519> location<00:02:25.940> yeah<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
little north of this location yeah it

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.860 
little north of this location yeah it
doesn't<00:02:26.989> seem<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.440> matter<00:02:28.239> what<00:02:29.239> vehicle

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
doesn't seem to matter what vehicle

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.630 
doesn't seem to matter what vehicle
you're<00:02:30.019> in<00:02:30.200> because<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:30.590> tried<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.280> tried<00:02:31.310> to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
you're in because we tried we tried to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.280 
you're in because we tried we tried to
see<00:02:31.790> if<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:32.060> would<00:02:32.120> spawn<00:02:32.390> quicker<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:33.140> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
see if it would spawn quicker in a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.680 
see if it would spawn quicker in a
phoenix<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.580> actually<00:02:34.790> seems<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.420> spawn

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
phoenix and it actually seems to spawn

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.690 
phoenix and it actually seems to spawn
slover<00:02:36.349> in<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.620> phoenix<00:02:36.980> if<00:02:37.099> anything<00:02:37.519> like

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
slover in a phoenix if anything like

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.309 
slover in a phoenix if anything like
this<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> only<00:02:38.269> time<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.540> i<00:02:38.720> found<00:02:39.019> one

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
this is the only time that i found one

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.650 
this is the only time that i found one
in<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.769> phoenix<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:41.180> took<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.480> couple

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
in a phoenix and this took a couple

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.770 
in a phoenix and this took a couple
hours<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.230> find<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.709> i<00:02:43.640> was<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.209> 70's

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
hours to find it i was in that 70's

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.979 
hours to find it i was in that 70's
camaro<00:02:45.110> for<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.890> them<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.280> was<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:46.989> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
camaro for one of them I was in the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.960 
camaro for one of them I was in the
comment<00:02:48.440> for<00:02:48.620> another<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.700> seems<00:02:49.910> like

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
comment for another and it seems like

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.150 
comment for another and it seems like
this<00:02:50.239> one<00:02:50.450> tends<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.230> spawn<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.500> little<00:02:51.860> slower

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
this one tends to spawn a little slower

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.600 
this one tends to spawn a little slower
or<00:02:52.630> it's<00:02:53.630> just<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.019> timing<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.980> on<00:02:55.220> this<00:02:55.400> map

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
or it's just the timing but on this map

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.580 
or it's just the timing but on this map
if<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.910> look<00:02:56.060> up<00:02:56.299> just<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.810> right<00:02:56.840> right

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
if you look up just to the right right

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.380 
if you look up just to the right right
where<00:02:57.829> I<00:02:57.860> was<00:02:58.069> going<00:02:58.340> yeah<00:02:58.670> right<00:02:58.910> up<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.180> there

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
where I was going yeah right up in there

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.660 
where I was going yeah right up in there
you<00:02:59.959> can<00:03:00.110> go<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.349> to<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.680> area<00:03:00.950> as<00:03:01.220> well<00:03:01.280> so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
you can go up to that area as well so

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.970 
you can go up to that area as well so
there's<00:03:01.849> really<00:03:02.030> three<00:03:02.569> areas<00:03:03.049> all<00:03:03.410> kind<00:03:03.860> of

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
there's really three areas all kind of

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.190 
there's really three areas all kind of
in<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.129> same<00:03:04.220> area<00:03:04.610> ish<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.840> makes<00:03:06.019> sense

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
in the same area ish that makes sense

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.930 
in the same area ish that makes sense
that<00:03:06.829> you<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.069> just<00:03:07.220> go<00:03:07.340> back<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.790> forth

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
that you can just go back and forth

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.640 
that you can just go back and forth
between<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.629> just<00:03:08.780> keep<00:03:08.959> resetting<00:03:09.379> that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
between and just keep resetting that

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.360 
between and just keep resetting that
spawn<00:03:09.950> um<00:03:11.379> reset<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.410> game<00:03:12.709> from<00:03:12.980> time<00:03:13.220> to

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
spawn um reset the game from time to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.690 
spawn um reset the game from time to
time<00:03:13.400> or<00:03:14.060> read<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.810> leave<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.290> re-enter<00:03:15.700> but

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.759 
time or read like leave and re-enter but
hopefully<00:03:17.239> everybody<00:03:17.569> finds<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.079> this

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
hopefully everybody finds it and this

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.970 
hopefully everybody finds it and this
brings<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.190> video<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.730> an<00:03:19.790> end
