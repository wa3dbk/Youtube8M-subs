talking about that the design of the

very<00:01:16.080> thin<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:17.340> view<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.850> phones<00:01:18.149> that<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
very thin my view of one phones that I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.779 
very thin my view of one phones that I
really<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.259> using<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.220> case<00:01:20.549> on

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
really don't like using a case on

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.330 
really don't like using a case on
because<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> feels<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.780> nice<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.770> premium<00:01:23.009> with

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
because it feels so nice so premium with

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
because it feels so nice so premium with
the<00:01:23.430> metal<00:01:24.110> obviously<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.289> worry<00:01:25.440> about

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the metal obviously in the worry about

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.580 
the metal obviously in the worry about
scratching<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:26.970> light<00:01:27.780> silver<00:01:28.319> well

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
scratching with the light silver well

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.680 
scratching with the light silver well
any<00:01:28.890> color<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.770> lightning<00:01:32.100> cable<00:01:32.280> I've<00:01:33.090> grown

any color the lightning cable I've grown

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.160 
any color the lightning cable I've grown
to<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.490> especially<00:01:35.490> compared<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to like especially compared to the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.340 
to like especially compared to the
Android<00:01:38.000> just<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> feels<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
Android just because it feels like it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
Android just because it feels like it
fits<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:40.920> snug<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:43.220> usually<00:01:44.220> buy<00:01:45.060> ten

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
fits in there snug I usually buy ten

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.800 
fits in there snug I usually buy ten

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
dollar Apple certified ones on Amazon

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.499 
dollar Apple certified ones on Amazon
but<00:01:49.280> they<00:01:50.280> feel<00:01:50.490> about<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.789> same<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
but they feel about the same as the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.590 
but they feel about the same as the
Apple<00:01:52.380> branded

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.940 

now<00:01:59.600> here<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.840> have<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.140> phone<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.380> its<00:02:00.680> full

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
now here I have the phone on its full

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.640 
now here I have the phone on its full
brightness<00:02:01.600> until<00:02:02.600> later<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:02.900> in<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.229> review

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
brightness until later on in the review

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.440 
brightness until later on in the review
so<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.430> way<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.580> can<00:02:04.729> see<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.060> screen<00:02:05.420> a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
so that way I can see the screen a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.810 
so that way I can see the screen a
little<00:02:05.630> bit<00:02:05.720> better<00:02:06.340> but<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.610> just

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
little bit better but this is just

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.310 
little bit better but this is just
showing<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.240> brightness<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.110> phone

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
showing you the brightness of the phone

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.830 
showing you the brightness of the phone
don't<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:10.610> have<00:02:10.759> any<00:02:11.000> problems<00:02:11.570> in

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
daytime view anything goals I really

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.280 
daytime view anything goals I really
like<00:02:16.070> keeping<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.580> minimal<00:02:17.209> screen<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.260> I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
like keeping a minimal screen so I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.530 
like keeping a minimal screen so I
pulled<00:02:19.130> all<00:02:19.220> my<00:02:19.340> folders<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.970> another<00:02:20.209> screen

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
pulled all my folders on another screen

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.460 
pulled all my folders on another screen
I<00:02:22.060> need<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> probably<00:02:23.450> break<00:02:23.660> down<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.140> buy<00:02:24.290> an

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.199 
I really like the cameras phone I think
it<00:02:35.459> beats<00:02:35.760> any<00:02:36.540> other<00:02:36.870> phone<00:02:37.319> right<00:02:37.590> now

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209
