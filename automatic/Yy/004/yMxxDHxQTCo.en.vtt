this one gets the first gate in the
second<00:00:13.740> gain<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> little<00:00:14.280> more<00:00:14.719> staggered

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
second gain a little more staggered

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.320 
second gain a little more staggered
fashion<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:17.190> then<00:00:17.400> third<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.880> fourth<00:00:18.090> gate

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
fashion and then third and fourth gate

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.510 
fashion and then third and fourth gate
are<00:00:18.570> got<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:18.990> once<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.160> other<00:00:20.250> four

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
are got all at once a lot of other four

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920 
are got all at once a lot of other four
gates<00:00:20.730> get<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> second<00:00:21.510> third<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.750> fourth

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
gates get the second third and fourth

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.580 
gates get the second third and fourth
gate<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.369> once<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.480> slight<00:00:25.019> variation

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
gate all at once so a slight variation

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.830 
gate all at once so a slight variation
here<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.689> show

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
here and that's what we're going to show

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720 
here and that's what we're going to show
just<00:00:28.800> sped<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.160> there<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> first

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
just sped it up there for the first

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
ten pylon 12 gateway and at 14 we're

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.700 
ten pylon 12 gateway and at 14 we're
getting<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> first<00:00:36.059> gas<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:37.230> probe<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.590> I'm

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
getting the first gas this probe is I'm

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
getting the first gas this probe is I'm
going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> push<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.660> find

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
going to push out and see we can find

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.400 
going to push out and see we can find
the<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.140> base<00:00:41.540> get<00:00:42.540> our<00:00:42.660> second<00:00:43.050> file<00:00:43.200> on

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the other base get our second file on

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.940 
the other base get our second file on
there<00:00:43.649> right<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> 16<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:46.110> 17<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
there right at a 16 and it's 17 the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.639 
there right at a 16 and it's 17 the
cybernetics<00:00:47.610> core<00:00:47.850> goes<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.500> okay<00:00:49.500> we

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
cybernetics core goes down okay we

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
cybernetics core goes down okay we
probably<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.070> back<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.399> normal<00:00:50.550> speed<00:00:50.940> here

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
probably go back to normal speed here

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.639 
probably go back to normal speed here
since<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.410> interesting

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
since it's a little more interesting

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
since it's a little more interesting
here<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> match<00:00:56.789> between<00:00:56.969> me

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
here on out this is a match between me

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.560 
here on out this is a match between me
over<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.820> my<00:00:59.820> buddy<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.210> which<00:01:00.390> she

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
over here and my buddy in which she

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.139 
over here and my buddy in which she
absolutely<00:01:00.930> kicks<00:01:01.379> my<00:01:01.530> ass<00:01:01.760> with<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.910> for

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
absolutely kicks my ass with this for

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.880 
absolutely kicks my ass with this for
gate<00:01:03.359> build

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.770 

so<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.820> sky<00:01:07.000> was<00:01:07.090> kind<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.330> pass<00:01:07.479> each<00:01:07.659> other

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
so the sky was kind of pass each other

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.000 
so the sky was kind of pass each other
there<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.960> got<00:01:11.110> our<00:01:11.200> second<00:01:11.620> gas<00:01:11.770> down

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
there and we got our second gas down

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.670 
there and we got our second gas down
here<00:01:12.490> right<00:01:12.790> at<00:01:13.030> 19<00:01:13.659> of<00:01:14.050> course<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
here right at 19 of course that the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.399 
here right at 19 of course that the
YouTube<00:01:15.070> details<00:01:15.520> are<00:01:15.700> going<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.880> have<00:01:16.060> all

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
YouTube details are going to have all

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.410 
YouTube details are going to have all
the<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:18.100> steps<00:01:18.550> in<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.760> build<00:01:18.909> order<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.360> you

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
the the steps in the build order and you

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.030 
the the steps in the build order and you
can<00:01:19.540> check<00:01:19.720> out<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.930> full<00:01:20.380> write-up<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.830> build
