00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
waited I know it's a very strange notion

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.260 
waited I know it's a very strange notion
why<00:01:07.620> not<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.280> morning<00:01:08.520> itself<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.120> quite

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
why not in the morning itself was quite

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
why not in the morning itself was quite
tense<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.650> felt<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.220> best<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
tense and I just felt the best way to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.950 
tense and I just felt the best way to
deal<00:01:11.940> with<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.540> through<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.870> as

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
deal with it was get through it as

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.620 
deal with it was get through it as
quickly<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.380> possible<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.729> labor<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
quickly as possible and not labor and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.590 
quickly as possible and not labor and
not<00:01:15.750> doing<00:01:15.960> loads<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.590> Tanks<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.940> get<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
not doing loads of Tanks and just get to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.760 
not doing loads of Tanks and just get to
the<00:01:18.720> moment<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.229> could<00:01:19.440> say<00:01:19.560> that's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the moment where we could say that's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.370 
the moment where we could say that's
about

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.100 

I<00:01:26.880> feel<00:01:27.880> like<00:01:27.970> I've<00:01:28.090> blocked<00:01:28.360> out<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.780> memory

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
I feel like I've blocked out the memory

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.570 
I feel like I've blocked out the memory
because<00:01:29.290> it's<00:01:29.530> almost<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.100> was<00:01:30.220> always<00:01:30.340> like

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
because it's almost it was always like

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.270 
because it's almost it was always like
