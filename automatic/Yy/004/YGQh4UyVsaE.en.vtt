00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello to all I come back for a video 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.180
 to tell you about my eyebrows I'm going 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.440
 show you exactly how I do 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.420
 my eyebrows me I do it in a way 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.650
 very very very very simple and I find 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.120
 that really the eyebrows is something 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.889
 something that I could not do without 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.660
 once we tried we started 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.090
 to do them we can not pass 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 besides these like mascara or the bottom of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 short complexion it's really something 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.910
 who sees there is the architect of the face 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.800
 and it's true that when I do not do them 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.119
 when I do them very lightly I 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.410
 really feel like my eyes 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 seem lighthouse so game seems a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.859
 little sick so I'll go 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
 show right away how I do and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.680
 it will also allow me to introduce you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.390
 my two favorite products so a 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.579
 product pb cosmetics to a product 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.140
 rimmel of products small budgets I 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.360
 not talking about free in this video 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.190
 i migros of beneficial i love i 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.050
 you will make a video a little bit more 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.399
 specific nothing to him because I the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.350
 but it's true that this is 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.210
 very small budget products that I have 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.680
 loved and who are really very very 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 very good quality find you all 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.000
 in price info bar and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.500
 links he wanted to see how 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 I do my eyebrows 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.510
 I left at first 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.760
 come take eyebrow mongel 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.900
 waterproof from bp cosmetics then 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.100
 for me it is not water proof 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.250
 but he has a very good performance 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.200
 I own it 1 0 a car is really 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 perfect for me it's shaped like a little 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.310
 bridge like this so really they do 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.740
 very very few products I support 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.450
 hardly on the skin a tiny 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.770
 drop like this is largely enough 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.770
 for my two eyebrows 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.540
 I will come to carvin sobiz high and 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.730
 so here make up for ever but little 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.770
 matter to make a line with very little 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.020
 products quite net enough right so at 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 level below my eyebrows all at 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.980
 Throughout my eyebrows and I will come 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.810
 do exactly the same thing above 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.220
 I intensified a little bit there 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.020
 my eyebrows because my thing if the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.090
 tend to be a bit short but 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.130
 it will be for another video and I 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.080
 let 's go fill the inside 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.340
 uncle cordemans eyebrows with very little 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.230
 products in small movements 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.300
 back and forth I'm doing exactly the same 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.560
 thing with even fewer products at 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.540
 level of the head of my eyebrows 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.740
 really for the dimmed to the maximum and the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.740
 north indeed very natural 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.510
 second favorite product is the beautiful 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.520
 this way in time 0 0 a blonde of 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.260
 rimmel so I bought on asso I you 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.240
 put all links in info bar 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.400
 only small that I find that the brush 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.190
 and a bit too big compared 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.570
 to the immigrants to really benefit it 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.030
 would have deserved to go a little smaller 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.620
 memo it works i'm going to remove 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.830
 the surplus because there is way too much 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 of materials on top and in addition the material 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.500
 is very very liquid which you can 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.850
 also do it in a handkerchief without 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.460
 worry and I want to come simply 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.280
 brushed my eyebrows at barley insist 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.900
 more on the body and there that demont 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.550
 eyebrows and I'm going to really put some 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.200
 very very little at the head for 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:05.370
 no wildlife is too much and to keep 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:07.560
 the very natural effect and here we see 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.880
 really a difference I find it's 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.790
 pretty blatant but it's still pretty 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.990
 natural all the same 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.850
 and of course I go back to you 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.660
 exactly the same on my 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.280
 second eyebrows a small precision 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.200
 at the level of the arc so make them a 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.150
 little bit square at the heart of 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.010
 eyebrows me I do not have any at all and at 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.209
 whenever I do it I find that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.100
 it gives me a stern look which must 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.810
 really adapt to your eyebrows 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.490
 natural course you are not 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.480
 obliged to do them exactly the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.480
 same shape as me 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.840
 and that's the result with a little before 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.840
 after 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.939
