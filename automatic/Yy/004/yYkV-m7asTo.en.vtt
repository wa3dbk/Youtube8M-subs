00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:22.000
 Simple but serious! 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.400
 I tried to make a gateau chocolate. 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.380
 (Refer to the animation explanation column for ingredients) 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.140
 Using a microwave, melt the butter in 30 seconds to 1 minute. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.520
 Crush the chocolate. 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.600
 Put the butter you just melted. 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.220
 Melt the chocolate with the heat of butter. 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.540
 Mix egg and sugar with a hand mixer. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.360
 Add lemon juice. 

00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:50.544
 Mix the chocolate just before. 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.060
 Mix so as not to crush the bubbles. 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.840
 (※ Please do not let the pet eat chocolate.) 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.660
 Mix the sieved flour. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.640
 If you do not mix as you cut it, gluten will be produced. 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.780
 Pour into a mold with a cooking sheet. 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.440
 Prepare the shape. 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.140
 Bake in an oven at 190 ° C (374 ° F) for 20 minutes. 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.540
 Let's check if the fire goes through. 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.240
 Remove from mold and let cool down and cut. 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.200
 done! 

00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:16.456
 Thank you for your viewing.
