how to do a defender and striker there

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
how to do a defender and striker there
isn't<00:00:25.260> much<00:00:25.320> difference<00:00:25.859> between<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> two<00:00:26.400> in

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
isn't much difference between the two in

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.029 
isn't much difference between the two in
fact<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.910> literally<00:00:27.619> close<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.800> zero

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
fact is literally close to zero

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.099 
fact is literally close to zero
difference<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.359> goes<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.929> my

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
difference but that just goes with my

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.240 
difference but that just goes with my
little<00:00:31.289> series<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> other

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
little series because on the other

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.520 
little series because on the other
classes<00:00:32.460> varies<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.180> difference<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.989> want

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
classes varies are difference so I want

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.459 
classes varies are difference so I want
to<00:00:34.620> keep<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.040> continent<00:00:35.630> continuity<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:37.050> up

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to keep the continent continuity all up

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
to keep the continent continuity all up
to<00:00:37.620> scratch<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.670> I'll<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.329> showing

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to scratch and now I'll also be showing

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
to scratch and now I'll also be showing
you<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> without<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you what it's like with and without the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
you what it's like with and without the
mida<00:00:42.239> multi-tool<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.590> mida

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
mida multi-tool and because mida

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.830 
mida multi-tool and because mida
multi-tool<00:00:44.070> adds<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.610> lot<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.789> agility<00:00:45.120> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
multi-tool adds a lot of agility so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.790 
multi-tool adds a lot of agility so
we're<00:00:45.960> gonna<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.140> able<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> look<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> class

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
we're gonna be able to look at the class

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.799 
we're gonna be able to look at the class
first<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.820> let's<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
first of all so let's have a look at the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.979 
first of all so let's have a look at the
fender<00:00:49.050> class<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.760> we've<00:00:50.940> got

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
fender class so as you can see we've got

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.549 
fender class so as you can see we've got
max<00:00:51.989> agility<00:00:52.489> which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:54.120> vital

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
max agility which is pretty vital

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.170 
max agility which is pretty vital
especially<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.980> Titan<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:56.610> Titan<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
especially with Titan because Titan is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.349 
especially with Titan because Titan is
the<00:00:57.329> best<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.020> doing<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.770> also<00:00:59.460> you

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the best for doing this and also you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.880 
the best for doing this and also you
want<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.629> point<00:01:00.780> increased<00:01:01.079> high<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.680> will

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
want to point increased high on it will

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.650 
want to point increased high on it will
take<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.280> through<00:01:02.309> yes<00:01:02.850> increased<00:01:03.480> control

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
take you through yes increased control

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899 
take you through yes increased control
does<00:01:04.110> give<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:04.559> agility<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.549> increased

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
does give you more agility but increased

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.850 
does give you more agility but increased
height<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.390> still<00:01:06.780> gives<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.229> more<00:01:07.590> height

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
height it still gives you more height

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
height it still gives you more height
and<00:01:08.220> catapult<00:01:09.150> doesn't<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:09.900> give<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and catapult doesn't actually give you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.190 
and catapult doesn't actually give you
more<00:01:10.500> high<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.890> gives<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> latter<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.200> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
more high it gives you latter so it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
more high it gives you latter so it
makes<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> faster<00:01:13.760> when<00:01:14.760> you're<00:01:14.790> trying<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
makes you faster when you're trying to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.690 
makes you faster when you're trying to
get<00:01:15.270> away<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:15.450> crota<00:01:15.780> later<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.700> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
get away from crota later on but this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.429 
get away from crota later on but this
increased<00:01:18.360> why<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.200> bit

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
increased why it is good for this bit

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.100 
increased why it is good for this bit
here<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.439> class<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.860> sword

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
here so that is the class out sword

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.940 
here so that is the class out sword
obviously<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.200> goes<00:01:25.380> without<00:01:25.590> saying<00:01:25.650> but

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
obviously this goes without saying but

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
obviously this goes without saying but
you<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.090> sure<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.720> light

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you want to make sure that a light

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.030 
you want to make sure that a light
weight<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:29.700> mind<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> if

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
weight is on your mind at all and so if

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.990 
weight is on your mind at all and so if
you<00:01:32.070> don't<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> mind<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.640> water<00:01:32.790> tool

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you don't have a mind and water tool

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
you don't have a mind and water tool
then<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.299> wait<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.689> second<00:01:34.170> i<00:01:34.290> will<00:01:34.500> show<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
then just wait a second i will show you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.929 
then just wait a second i will show you
how<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.100> without<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.729> pretty

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
how to do this without it it's pretty

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.480 
how to do this without it it's pretty
much<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.299> technique<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.040> but<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.400> just

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
much the same technique and but you just

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
much the same technique and but you just
going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:38.939> bit<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.150> careful<00:01:39.590> so
