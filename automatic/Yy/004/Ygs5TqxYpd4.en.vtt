00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.290 
recent ones so perhaps they do stand the
chance<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:43.200> doing<00:04:43.350> well<00:04:43.650> at<00:04:43.890> Rio<00:04:44.460> 2014

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
chance of doing well at Rio 2014

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.720 
chance of doing well at Rio 2014
although<00:04:45.570> their<00:04:45.750> qualifying<00:04:46.170> campaign

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
although their qualifying campaign

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.830 
although their qualifying campaign
wasn't<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.850> best<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.360> course<00:04:48.510> they<00:04:48.660> went

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
wasn't the best of course they went

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.540 
wasn't the best of course they went
through<00:04:49.140> in<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.470> playoffs<00:04:49.890> against<00:04:50.430> their

through in the playoffs against their
new<00:04:50.730> zealand<00:04:51.120> two<00:04:51.360> rather<00:04:52.320> easy<00:04:52.650> games<00:04:52.980> for

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
new zealand two rather easy games for

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.680 
new zealand two rather easy games for
them<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.400> disc<00:04:53.610> or<00:04:53.760> choir<00:04:53.970> law<00:04:54.090> goes<00:04:54.270> over<00:04:54.600> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
them the disc or choir law goes over the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.500 
them the disc or choir law goes over the
two<00:04:54.870> legs<00:04:55.080> but<00:04:55.520> Mexico<00:04:56.520> as<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.760> whole<00:04:57.270> their

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
two legs but Mexico as a whole their

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.600 
two legs but Mexico as a whole their
recent<00:04:57.900> form<00:04:58.080> hasn't<00:04:58.590> been<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:59.040> good<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.520> as

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
recent form hasn't been that good and as

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.820 
recent form hasn't been that good and as
a<00:04:59.640> prediction<00:05:00.030> for<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.140> for<00:05:01.680> their

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
a prediction for the for their

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.830 
a prediction for the for their
performance<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.430> Rio<00:05:02.670> 2014<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.360> actually<00:05:03.510> think

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
performance in Rio 2014 I actually think

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.360 
performance in Rio 2014 I actually think
they're<00:05:04.080> not<00:05:04.350> going<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.800> make<00:05:04.890> it<00:05:04.950> through<00:05:05.250> to

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
they're not going to make it through to

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.400 
they're not going to make it through to
the<00:05:05.400> round<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.700> 16<00:05:06.060> this<00:05:06.240> time<00:05:06.420> I<00:05:06.600> do<00:05:06.960> see

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
the round of 16 this time I do see

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.380 
the round of 16 this time I do see
Mexico<00:05:07.830> getting<00:05:08.130> knocked<00:05:08.340> out<00:05:08.550> in<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.880> group

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
Mexico getting knocked out in the group

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.730 
Mexico getting knocked out in the group
stage<00:05:09.630> of<00:05:09.780> course<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.050> other<00:05:10.200> teams<00:05:10.500> in<00:05:10.650> the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
stage of course the other teams in the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.010 
stage of course the other teams in the
group<00:05:10.890> are<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.130> hosts<00:05:11.520> Brazil<00:05:11.880> Croatia<00:05:12.720> who

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
group are the hosts Brazil Croatia who

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.800 
group are the hosts Brazil Croatia who
would<00:05:13.170> be<00:05:13.260> covering<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.830> next<00:05:14.190> week<00:05:14.370> and

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
would be covering and next week and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.940 
would be covering and next week and
Cameroon<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.990> course<00:05:16.140> we<00:05:16.260> covered<00:05:16.530> last<00:05:16.560> week

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
Cameroon of course we covered last week

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.520 
Cameroon of course we covered last week
so<00:05:17.190> why<00:05:17.400> personally<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.240> think<00:05:18.360> Mexico<00:05:19.290> neither

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
so why personally I think Mexico neither

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.840 
so why personally I think Mexico neither
come<00:05:19.650> third<00:05:19.890> or<00:05:20.010> fourth<00:05:20.190> it's<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.550> toss-up

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
come third or fourth it's a toss-up

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.090 
come third or fourth it's a toss-up
between<00:05:20.970> them<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.510> Cameroon<00:05:21.990> for<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.860> third

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
between them and Cameroon for the third

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.680 
between them and Cameroon for the third
and<00:05:23.340> fourth<00:05:23.490> positions<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.360> group<00:05:24.540> it

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
and fourth positions in that group it

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.060 
and fourth positions in that group it
could<00:05:24.870> go<00:05:24.990> either<00:05:25.020> way<00:05:25.320> camera<00:05:25.740> in<00:05:25.830> a<00:05:25.890> very

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
could go either way camera in a very

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.980 
could go either way camera in a very
very<00:05:26.280> solid<00:05:26.580> but<00:05:26.760> if<00:05:26.850> Mexico<00:05:27.300> turn<00:05:27.540> up<00:05:27.750> and

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
very solid but if Mexico turn up and

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.409 
very solid but if Mexico turn up and
perform<00:05:28.410> like<00:05:28.740> we<00:05:28.830> know<00:05:28.950> they<00:05:29.130> can<00:05:29.310> with<00:05:30.240> the

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
perform like we know they can with the

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.360 
perform like we know they can with the
with<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.930> players<00:05:31.140> at<00:05:31.320> their<00:05:31.440> disposal<00:05:31.650> then

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
with the players at their disposal then

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.730 
with the players at their disposal then
they<00:05:32.760> may<00:05:32.970> stand<00:05:33.300> a<00:05:33.390> chance<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.990> pushing

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
they may stand a chance of pushing

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.440 
they may stand a chance of pushing
Croatia<00:05:35.250> out<00:05:35.430> second<00:05:35.850> place<00:05:36.000> but<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.240> don't

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
Croatia out second place but I don't

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.030 
Croatia out second place but I don't
quite<00:05:36.780> think<00:05:36.810> they're<00:05:37.530> going<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.740> be<00:05:37.800> able<00:05:37.890> to

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
quite think they're going to be able to

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.350 
quite think they're going to be able to
put<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.190> fall<00:05:38.400> together<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.910> I<00:05:38.970> do

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
put the fall together and I do

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.090 
put the fall together and I do
personally<00:05:39.690> believe<00:05:40.229> that<00:05:40.410> they're<00:05:40.830> going<00:05:40.919> to

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
personally believe that they're going to

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.159 
personally believe that they're going to
finish<00:05:41.280> third<00:05:41.850> or<00:05:42.120> fourth<00:05:42.510> in<00:05:42.750> that<00:05:42.930> group

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
finish third or fourth in that group

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.719 
finish third or fourth in that group
that<00:05:43.410> is<00:05:43.500> going<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.680> bring<00:05:43.800> this<00:05:44.310> particular
