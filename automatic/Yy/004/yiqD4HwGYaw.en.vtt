00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
reason I just didn't so if a lot of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.119 
reason I just didn't so if a lot of
bananas<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.840> left<00:00:40.050> over<00:00:40.350> right<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129

kitchen<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.879> milk<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.020> I'll<00:00:43.170> probably

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
kitchen and milk that I'll probably

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.180 
kitchen and milk that I'll probably
never<00:00:43.770> drink<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> did<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> lot<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.829> soup

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
never drink but I did have a lot of soup

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.939 
never drink but I did have a lot of soup
and<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:49.320> interesting<00:00:49.770> thing<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.440> heard

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and the interesting thing is so I heard

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.020 
and the interesting thing is so I heard
that<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> soup<00:00:55.140> loses<00:00:55.680> its<00:00:55.890> nutrients<00:00:56.730> or

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that the soup loses its nutrients or

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.529 
that the soup loses its nutrients or
nutrition<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.530> boil<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.539> I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
nutrition the more you boil it or I

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
nutrition the more you boil it or I
don't<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.109> something<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> made

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
don't know something like that so I made

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.670 
don't know something like that so I made
a<00:01:02.309> new<00:01:02.489> batch<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:04.909> figured<00:01:05.909> why<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
a new batch and I figured why not and I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000 
a new batch and I figured why not and I
put<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.869> mushrooms<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.650> carrots

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
put in more mushrooms and more carrots

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
put in more mushrooms and more carrots
this<00:01:11.280> time<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.630> tastes<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> lot<00:01:13.049> better

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
this time and it tastes a lot better

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.070 
this time and it tastes a lot better
apparently<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> keys<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.150> lot<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.810> lot

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
apparently the keys to use a lot a lot

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.929 
apparently the keys to use a lot a lot
of<00:01:16.290> pepper<00:01:18.110> okay<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.830> yeah<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> was

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of pepper okay so yeah that was

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
of pepper okay so yeah that was

yesterday today have a bunch of tomatoes
and<00:01:26.330> meat<00:01:27.530> which<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.650> still<00:01:28.860> need<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> go<00:01:29.250> buy

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and meat which I still need to go buy

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.060 
and meat which I still need to go buy
actually<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> weighed<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.710> weigh

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
actually so I weighed in and I weigh

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
actually so I weighed in and I weigh
exactly<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.119> same<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> started

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
exactly the same as when I started

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.240 
exactly the same as when I started
it's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.939> bit<00:01:39.090> confusing<00:01:39.979> but<00:01:40.979> maybe

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it's a little bit confusing but maybe

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
it's a little bit confusing but maybe
it's<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.810> haven't<00:01:43.140> gone

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it's because I don't know I haven't gone

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.280 
it's because I don't know I haven't gone
to<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> bathroom<00:01:43.500> yet<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:45.170> definitely<00:01:46.170> going
