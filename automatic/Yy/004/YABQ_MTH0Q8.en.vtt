 Here you can either learn more about the origin of the continents 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.720
 Once in the bright, the drive leads past flora and fauna 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.830

 Moves behind us 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.470

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.590
 Get used to hiss without much public traffic 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.000
