00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that's what I did this is a pipe big

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.869 
that's what I did this is a pipe big
cardboard<00:00:55.620> pipe<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.309> had<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.699> cut

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
cardboard pipe that we had that we cut

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.750 
cardboard pipe that we had that we cut
up<00:00:56.910> into<00:00:57.390> three<00:00:58.379> bits<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.520> we

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
up into three bits so when they like we

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
up into three bits so when they like we
impugn<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:00.600> all<00:01:00.780> gross<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.100> just

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
impugn it and make all gross we can just

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.899 
impugn it and make all gross we can just
throw<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.520> away<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.729> they

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
throw it away this is one if they

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.990 
throw it away this is one if they
wouldn't<00:01:06.270> choose<00:01:07.610> there<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> ones

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
wouldn't choose there are the ones

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000 
wouldn't choose there are the ones
somewhere<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:12.060> they've<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.860> there<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
somewhere but they've got off there it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.780 
somewhere but they've got off there it
is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.840> circle<00:01:15.840> wouldn't<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.740> well<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.640> so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
is a circle wouldn't you as well just so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.840 
is a circle wouldn't you as well just so
that<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.270> lots<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.659> time<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:18.960> lots<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
that they get lots of time and lots of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
that they get lots of time and lots of
opportunities<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.409> chop<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:22.710> their<00:01:23.009> teeth

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
opportunities to chop down their teeth

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310 
opportunities to chop down their teeth
simply<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.299> their<00:01:24.780> teeth<00:01:25.020> grow

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
simply because their teeth grow

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.510 
simply because their teeth grow
constantly<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:27.630> them<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.520> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
constantly so you don't want them to you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.120 
constantly so you don't want them to you
don't<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.850> their<00:01:29.970> teeth<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.540> too<00:01:30.720> long

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
don't want their teeth to get too long

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.420 
don't want their teeth to get too long
and<00:01:32.360> next<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.920> hold<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.250> on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and next you go up I just hold this on

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
and next you go up I just hold this on
the<00:01:35.579> tape<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> wasn't<00:01:36.810> staying<00:01:37.020> on

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the tape because it wasn't staying on

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.160 
the tape because it wasn't staying on
properly<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.119> it's<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.540> fleece<00:01:39.869> liner

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
properly and it's just a fleece liner

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.920 
properly and it's just a fleece liner
