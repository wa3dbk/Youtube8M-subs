00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
teaching so I've done a bit of primary

school teaching and works at an autistic

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.510 
school teaching and works at an autistic
school<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:34.260> just<00:01:34.710> find<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> such<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
school and I just find it such a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
school and I just find it such a
rewarding<00:01:36.060> job<00:01:36.120> so<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:37.049> studying<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.590> right

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
rewarding job so I'm studying it right

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.530 
rewarding job so I'm studying it right
now<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.370> that<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.850> something<00:01:39.090> when

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
now so that I have something when

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.300 
now so that I have something when
footballs<00:01:39.900> finished<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.159> that's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
footballs finished but I think that's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450 
footballs finished but I think that's
what<00:01:41.520> I'd<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.670> doing<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.000> sure<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:43.280> think<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
what I'd be doing for sure I think I

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460 
what I'd be doing for sure I think I
just<00:01:44.670> really<00:01:45.119> love<00:01:45.390> interacting<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:46.260> kids

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
just really love interacting with kids

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.380 
just really love interacting with kids
and<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.780> there's<00:01:48.930> much<00:01:49.140> more

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
and I don't think there's much more

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.840 
and I don't think there's much more
that's<00:01:51.390> rewarding<00:01:52.020> watching<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.130> child<00:01:53.340> learn

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that's rewarding watching a child learn

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.130 
that's rewarding watching a child learn
something<00:01:54.390> watching<00:01:54.780> them<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:56.840> mean<00:01:57.840> in
