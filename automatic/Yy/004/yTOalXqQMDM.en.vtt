to<00:05:02.430> do<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.150> edging<00:05:03.539> so<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.720> get<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.930> straight

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
to do this edging so you get a straight

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.340 
to do this edging so you get a straight
line<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.400> when<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.580> get<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:06.000> rag<00:05:06.780> dampepls

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
line is to when you get a rag dampepls

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.460 
line is to when you get a rag dampepls
is<00:05:07.949> to<00:05:08.190> work<00:05:08.430> in<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.759> way<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.479> tape<00:05:09.690> so

is to work in the way of the tape so
that's<00:05:10.770> where<00:05:10.949> your<00:05:11.070> line<00:05:11.250> is<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:11.460> stick<00:05:12.090> so

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
that's where your line is so stick so

you just keep overlapping there there
you<00:05:17.880> go<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.410> get<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.680> straight<00:05:19.949> line<00:05:20.190> and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
you go so you get the straight line and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.689 
you go so you get the straight line and
the<00:05:20.910> advantage<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:23.669> tape<00:05:23.910> not<00:05:24.090> moving<00:05:24.539> so
