00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.400
 hello everyone this video will try to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.379
 introduce you to cortana in a small 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.169
 introduction so you know who 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.630
 they cut who is that what is 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.759
 pretend that they are shortened to cortana 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.599
 pretend to be something different in the world 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:31.009
 of the personal assistants because she 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.009
 apart from having a voice as you have to go 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.910
 Microsoft wants to equip it with a 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.710
 artificial intelligence so that 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.160
 be able to establish a conversation 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.230
 smart with us and you have 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.050
 learning ability is to say that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.440
 the more we use it the more she will know about 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.390
 we 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.129
 at the moment it is in an alpha phase 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.110
 then a little bit I'm going to make them a 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.050
 small demonstration of how they work and 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.820
 then I would give you a tutorial so that 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.270
 you know how to configure it 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.600
 cut starts either with the magnifying glass or 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.890
 with its icon that has you can put 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 on the desk 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 then if we start with the icon 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.960
 what she does automatically is 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.659
 prepare what I have told you that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.930
 I want to have information in view here 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.200
 in those three stripes I can enter 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.470
 what is your notebook where she starts 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.210
 to learn about us here I say 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.590
 that I look for music 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.040
 and the search for codes that we had 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.290
 previously accessible now momentarily 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.770
 you have to do it through the camera 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.220
 photos and camera modes 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.190
 but let's make it appear before 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.870
 we 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.870
 good afternoon short na 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.810
 I want you to keep in mind that now 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 to do it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.350
 in this little presentation 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.660
 and the phone's audio microphones 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.180
 they're here below and I'm like 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.890
 30 centimeters of the microphone with them 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.920
 pointing down with which is a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.140
 added difficulty so that she 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.140
 know my voice but we will try 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.189
 who you are 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.270
 they cut who you are 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.600
 they cut who you are 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.610
 I'm cut your personal assistant 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.610
 you know what is my name 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.409
 what can you do for me 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.100
 and you have a few things with which 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.260
 As you can see we can make it 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.480
 call write a text message 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.370
 add an appointment create a note 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.390
 calendar create a note in the one not 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.610
 remind us of the incorporation to 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.780
 calendar prepared an alarm search 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.780
 music play music 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.940
 but it is also able to get back to 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.130
 a nice little conversation by 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.230
 example 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.230
 cut to wants to be my friend 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.430
 she is nice 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.430
 they cut you can imitate 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.280
 he understood me badly cut you know how to do 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.280
 imitations 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.230
 cut to imitate someone 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.770
 cut to tell me a joke 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.850
 yes one 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.030
 they cut to I'm looking for a pharmacy 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.870
 short na I'm looking for a pharmacy 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.620
 you see for example we are then a moment 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.139
 given indisposed and she the first thing that 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.719
 is to find what are the pharmacies 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.419
 that we have closer and pressing what 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:02.699
 automatically link with the 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.620
 gps program that we have then 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.900
 predefined or if we have several 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.500
 installed would give us to choose what 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:15.640
 program we want to work 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.640
 they cut to I want to look for a bakery 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.630
 here I got stuck 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.630
 cut to I'm looking for a bakery 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.960
 you see now if before I stayed halfway 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.610
 word 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.590
 Y 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.590
 we can say for example 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.199
 short na I'm looking for a restaurant 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.199
 of Japanese food 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.289
 you see 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.790
 now something that I think in vigo 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.850
 there is no 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.020
 they cut to I'm looking for a restaurant 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.020
 of Indian food 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.540
 Well, if I did not know what we had in vigo 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.540
 an Indian food restaurant 2 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.800
 for example for example 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.690
 they cut to I want to eat a fondue of 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.690
 cheese 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.890
 here 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.900
 do not 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.889
 those that match 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.430
 good as you see part of the fault 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.240
 it's also mine because here are the 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.520
 microphones and I'm far away and I have 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.360
 below also playing a little music that 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.430
 is quite high from another neighbor and that 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.100
 is interfering but good a little 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.100
 this is what you see we can have 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.100
 with cut and now what I'm going to pass is 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.610
 do then a tutorial so that what 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.830
 you have and you can take advantage of what 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.060
 which is cortana, keep in mind that 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:25.420
 the more the u6 the better it will work 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.420
 come on so far
