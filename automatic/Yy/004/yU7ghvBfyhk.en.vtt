00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.740
 with beautiful today I have a tutorial 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.240
 of hairstyle for those days in which 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.790
 our hair flat does not want 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 cooperate this reign is very practical 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.660
 because it's very simple to do and it's going 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.460
 to do hairstyles in those days in the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.670
 that we believe that we can not plane 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 do nothing I hope you like it 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.619
 we started so that we would not see ourselves that way first 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.199
 that we use to make this hairstyle 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's a comb with it we're going to separate 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 our hair in half making a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 party to the center and then we're going to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.250
 hold with tweezers to prevent 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.560
 come together again 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.510
 each of the halves that we have the 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.040
 let's separate in two making a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.050
 match approximately two 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.420
 centimeters above our ears and 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.739
 also we held with tweezers one 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.260
 Once we have our hair 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.540
 separated in this way we can start 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.250
 with the hairstyle to hold the parts 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.500
 of this hairstyle we will occupy at least 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.940
 three liguillas 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.860
 we started by releasing one of the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.750
 sections above and we take a lock 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.850
 of not very thin hair from the part of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.550
 in front and up to start 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.170
 braid so that the braids look more 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.600
 We are going to make a braid 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.250
 Dutch with this I mean that every 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.050
 one of the sections of the braid is 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 you have to move from the bottom up 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.190
 and in every movement we make we have 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 to go feeding the braid from 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.420
 in front and from behind 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.300
 you also have to be aware that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.190
 while we are weaving the braid 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.230
 we have to pull it back 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:47.530
 so that when holding it has the form 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:49.540
 correct when we get more or less to 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.430
 the height of the ear we should no longer 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.410
 have hair to continue feeding the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.100
 braid then we will continue weaving 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.100
 to the tip 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.159
 once we finish knitting 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.110
 We hold the braid with one of the leagues 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.680
 and we do the same thing on the other side of the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.570
 head 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.399
 so that the tense ones will be less 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.680
 tight and the hairstyle looks more 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.700
 relaxed let's pull the braid of this 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.650
 form from bottom to top after 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.510
 we take the two braids and the rest of the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.530
 hair and we hold it in the part of 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.530
 back with another guide 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.890
 then we remove the diaz from the braids 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.810
 and undo what is left by 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.459
 below the league that holds the tail of 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.620
 horse 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.299
 then we take a thin lock 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.640
 of hair from the bottom of the 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.459
 horsetail and we use it to cover 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.200
 the league in this way and we hold it with 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.379
 some pins on the bottom 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 to hide them and ready 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.459
 I recommend you do this in front of 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.409
 a mirror unlike me so that 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.599
 make it easier to make sure that everything 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:02.489
 is coming out as it should be what is 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.680
 it seemed simpler than 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.650
 it seems not and that's it and nothing else we see 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.609
 disheveled I hope you liked it 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.230
