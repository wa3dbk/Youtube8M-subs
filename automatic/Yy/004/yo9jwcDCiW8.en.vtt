00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.860 
was magical it was amazing I'd always
say<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.950> never<00:02:19.700> took<00:02:20.000> out<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.420> sword

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
say that I never took out the sword

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.350 
say that I never took out the sword
I<00:02:21.020> think<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.410> sword<00:02:21.650> took<00:02:21.950> me<00:02:22.190> up<00:02:22.370> and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
I think this sword took me up and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.930 
I think this sword took me up and
you<00:02:23.540> did<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.950> from<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.040> sitting<00:02:25.340> position<00:02:25.490> he

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
you did this from a sitting position he

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.360 
you did this from a sitting position he
never<00:02:26.120> got<00:02:26.330> up<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:27.440> know<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.740> he<00:02:27.860> was<00:02:28.010> able<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
never got up you know and he was able to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.940 
never got up you know and he was able to
do<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.910> can't<00:02:29.270> do<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.570> on<00:02:29.660> my<00:02:29.780> own<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.410> can't

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
do that I can't do it on my own I can't

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.460 
do that I can't do it on my own I can't
attack<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.640> run<00:02:31.970> round<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.330> barrier<00:02:32.900> then<00:02:33.200> come

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
attack a run round the barrier then come

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.010 
attack a run round the barrier then come
back<00:02:33.500> again<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:34.220> got<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.240> two<00:02:35.510> people<00:02:35.750> at

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
back again you got to have two people at

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.470 
back again you got to have two people at
least<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.760> wasn't<00:02:37.970> always<00:02:38.210> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
least and so it wasn't always the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.130 
least and so it wasn't always the
obvious<00:02:39.700> thing<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.880> he<00:02:41.000> would<00:02:41.150> do<00:02:41.360> he<00:02:41.660> liked

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
obvious thing that he would do he liked

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.670 
obvious thing that he would do he liked
a<00:02:42.170> very<00:02:42.590> good<00:02:42.800> teacher<00:02:43.540> always<00:02:44.540> does<00:02:44.780> he<00:02:45.170> he

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
a very good teacher always does he he

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.740 
a very good teacher always does he he
adapted<00:02:46.160> he<00:02:46.430> adapts<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.970> situation<00:02:47.570> and

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
adapted he adapts to the situation and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.570 
adapted he adapts to the situation and
to<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.080> person<00:02:48.560> he's<00:02:48.710> speaking<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.490> you

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
to the person he's speaking to and you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.550 
to the person he's speaking to and you
always<00:02:49.700> feel<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.180> he's<00:02:50.959> speaking<00:02:51.200> directly

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
always feel like he's speaking directly

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.400 
always feel like he's speaking directly
to<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:53.150> not<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.630> condescending<00:02:53.990> way

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
to you and not in a condescending way

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.650 
to you and not in a condescending way
but<00:02:54.709> in<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.920> he's<00:02:55.700> trying<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.000> get<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.240> best<00:02:56.450> out

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
but in a he's trying to get the best out

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.970 
but in a he's trying to get the best out
of<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.990> that's<00:02:57.290> his<00:02:57.500> goal

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
of you that's his goal

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.810 
of you that's his goal
I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.560> sword<00:03:00.560> was<00:03:00.740> put<00:03:01.010> there<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.640> me

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
I think the sword was put there for me

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.570 
I think the sword was put there for me
to<00:03:02.150> fall<00:03:02.600> over<00:03:03.050> keep<00:03:03.350> falling<00:03:03.830> over<00:03:03.950> until<00:03:04.430> I

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
to fall over keep falling over until I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:13.050 
to fall over keep falling over until I
picked<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.120> up<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.570> did<00:03:06.500> something<00:03:06.770> with<00:03:07.130> it

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.970 

and<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.150> had<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.420> given<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.900> me<00:03:15.080> thrust<00:03:15.500> upon<00:03:15.770> me

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
and I had it given to me thrust upon me

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:27.559 
and I had it given to me thrust upon me
if<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.430> like<00:03:16.670> that's<00:03:17.450> how<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.780> happened

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.629
