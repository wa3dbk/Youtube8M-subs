to your other fields so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.310 
to your other fields so
they<00:03:29.700> can<00:03:29.850> slow<00:03:30.150> down<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.420> digestion<00:03:31.020> of

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
they can slow down the digestion of

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.470 
they can slow down the digestion of
those<00:03:31.890> other<00:03:32.190> foods<00:03:32.490> as<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.670> whole<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:32.940> again

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
those other foods as a whole so again

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.180 
those other foods as a whole so again
that<00:03:33.930> energy<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.290> leaking<00:03:34.740> into<00:03:34.950> your<00:03:35.070> body

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
that energy is leaking into your body

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.190 
that energy is leaking into your body
slowly<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.850> I'm<00:03:36.210> in<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> harder<00:03:36.750> time<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
slowly is I'm in a harder time to the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.980 
slowly is I'm in a harder time to the
broken<00:03:37.590> down<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.940> sense<00:03:39.180> your<00:03:39.660> body<00:03:39.870> is

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
broken down and in a sense your body is

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.720 
broken down and in a sense your body is
usually<00:03:40.350> not<00:03:40.470> much<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.950> those<00:03:41.040> calories<00:03:41.550> and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
usually not much of those calories and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.690 
usually not much of those calories and
energy<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.780> actually<00:03:43.140> make<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.040> nutrition

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
energy to actually make that nutrition

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.820 
energy to actually make that nutrition
available<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.780> your<00:03:45.960> body<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.530> there<00:03:46.710> you<00:03:46.740> have

available to your body so there you have

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.560 
available to your body so there you have
it<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.220> effect<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.730> can<00:03:47.760> really<00:03:48.090> have<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.270> food

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
it in effect you can really have a food

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.440 
it in effect you can really have a food
with<00:03:48.810> no<00:03:49.050> calories<00:03:49.830> but<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.580> become<00:03:50.850> and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
with no calories but it can become and

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.900 
with no calories but it can become and
be<00:03:51.840> turned<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.410> zero<00:03:52.950> or<00:03:53.100> colorful<00:03:53.430> just

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
be turned a zero or colorful just

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.500 
be turned a zero or colorful just
because<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:55.280> effect<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.880> hope<00:03:57.330> this

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
because of that effect so I hope this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.570 
because of that effect so I hope this
