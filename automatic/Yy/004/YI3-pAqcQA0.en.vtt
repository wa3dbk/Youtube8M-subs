00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.580
 with us the sarah is loud coach 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.590
 from the cheerleaders we have today 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.930
 General rehearsal but for what have 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.030
 you even rehearsed it we have today 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.300
 actually makes a dress rehearsal for 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.250
 the chilling national championship in nrw 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.320
 and for the corresponding presentation 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.830
 cup the third time now 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.830
 takes place 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.140
 We will start with a total of five 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.570
 teams 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.719
 that means the streetpass states 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 in the presentation cup in the team 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.059
 we chose it for that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.760
 Presentation cup decided because the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 just have a lot of new and have 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 we think that they are actually quite 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.559
 are in good hands now shown 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.510
 what they already know 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.170
 continue to start quite regular 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.899
 the juniors we saw today as well 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.539
 have the states with 14 girls in the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.519
 category junior holczer and have there 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.290
 a relatively large number of participants 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.110
 ten competitors 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.970
 we hope that there is at least room 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.530
 Maybe there is enough already 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.530
 among the first three or four 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.479
 We also saw a few guys 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.939
 is yes but probably the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.670
 ask more often untypical for cheerleading 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.500
 that guys are in there 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.770
 which category start because the boys 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.990
 With 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.509
 We start in the category senior 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.619
 comment that means there can be more than 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.649
 two so it must be at least one 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.060
 mettmann be there and I think so 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.740
 to ten men are allowed otherwise 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.890
 we have to be there too the relative 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.570
 there the competition is quite strong 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.040
 first second place would be 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 but can not achieve security 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.450
 we hope that we also midfield 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.340
 he will land a new group today 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.789
 Seen the diamonds now with those 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.759
 yes from the diamonds sit down 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.640
 four teams together 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.440
 are already advanced and have 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.569
 wished you could have this year 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.579
 complete again 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.730
 the focus on the dance so on the 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.189
 and you can put them in there 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.650
 the category but at least five 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.430
 Participants suddenly the seniortrainerin 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.019

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.250
