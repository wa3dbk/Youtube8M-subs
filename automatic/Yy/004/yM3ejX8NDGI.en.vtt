00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 hi to all of previous days I have 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.230
 prepared the text so today I decided 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 to combine it with a regional Ligurian drunk 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.890
 these are the three networks we are now passing 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.570
 immediately in withdrawal 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:32.570
 you need these are 3 400 g of green beans 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.480
 with these two potatoes already washed 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.120
 washed and cut all to small 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 you see bettini 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.960
 you need a duce pesto programs 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:52.950
 recipe the tower of you on the blog and for 4 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.540
 people 320 grams of co already on the 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.030
 fire the water is already boiling and now 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.489
 we begin to throw the potatoes and correct 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.149
 a few minutes before turning the pasta 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.149
 feeling 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 according to moretti all cut 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.650
 small equipment a before the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.990
 pasta than pasta and leave two minutes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.300
 then we add reconnect state which 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.400
 potatoes 18 minutes 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.710
 cut small and I recommend it 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:34.260
 we put the beans in the boil 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 together for another 5 minutes 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.619
 at that point we will vote for the pasta 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 important that it is cooked that between the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.440
 same way 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.860
 when the dough will be kept once 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.619
 that the croissants are so few al dente 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.619
 we are not trains 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.869
 that you have to calculate that then there is some 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 reason for pasta first 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.880
 you must leave it slightly al dente 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.689
 if potatoes don't matter to potatoes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.979
 then they will form a kind of coral but 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:12.489
 more green beans with 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.790
 ticket and has gone ahead that in 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:20.080
 dough spends the stove I have 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.000
 got some cooking water if that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 we had to go after 5 tatami is called 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.030
 as requested 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.030
 now we all hope together 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:43.980
 let's say I think he had led 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.980
 the oil comes out the garlic 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.390
 we show you luck 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:02.390
 let's see let's not put in place 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 this 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.430
 now we must mix neither the green beans 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.010
 you want them inter and the games too 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:25.520
 chop the honey potatoes into small pieces 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:29.660
 dissolve to a species 17 ok, take account 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.660
 of trenette with pesto 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.200
 if you want you can put a little oil 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.560
 or a bit of grain but for me it 's fine 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.000
 so 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.000
