cinnamon<00:00:34.329> stick<00:00:34.600> now<00:00:35.170> I<00:00:35.199> let<00:00:35.769> these<00:00:36.039> sit<00:00:36.339> in

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
cinnamon stick now I let these sit in

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.029 
cinnamon stick now I let these sit in
here<00:00:36.699> for<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:36.969> couple<00:00:37.179> of<00:00:37.359> hours<00:00:37.749> and<00:00:38.079> there's

here for a couple of hours and there's

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.910 
here for a couple of hours and there's
thought<00:00:39.339> they've<00:00:39.640> softened<00:00:39.940> up<00:00:40.269> a<00:00:40.359> bit<00:00:40.570> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
thought they've softened up a bit and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.619 
thought they've softened up a bit and
the<00:00:41.920> next<00:00:42.249> step<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.760> do<00:00:42.820> is<00:00:43.149> they<00:00:43.269> turn<00:00:43.329> the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
on we're gonna have to turn it off

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.329
