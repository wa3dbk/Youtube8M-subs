00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.870
 OMG 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.410
 perez to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.410
 do not 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.410
 Y 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.090
 the opera workshops of the university 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.890
 of the conservatory valley in tone 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.869
 Maria Valencia addressed in the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.720
 present by the teacher silver ordóñez 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.430
 they will assume the scenographic montage of the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.430
 famous opera 'the cat in boots' 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.090
 yes 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.280
 but not only the singing students 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.290
 have worked in this assembly as the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.640
 design department joined the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.890
 draft 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.040
 it is an interdisciplinary project and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.530
 We are the project course of 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.600
 graphic design 2 of the sixth semester of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.570
 design department then what 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.180
 we did was to support from the image of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 cat with boots' visual identity 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 the scenography going through the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.900
 costumes and lighting already 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.490
 coordinated here let's say with the whole process 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.490
 scenographic that made silvio speak 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.360
 usually in workshops 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.390
 projects we do more jobs 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.950
 of intervention and we make a process a 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.530
 little else that has to do with 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.450
 qualitative ethnography research 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.670
 things of that type then in this case 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.580
 particular we wanted to do more are a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.700
 laboratory experimentation plastic 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.350
 and the methodology varies a lot because 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.170
 what you do is that you work in the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.870
 design concepts as the symbol by 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.580
 example within the same laboratory no 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.990
 he goes out to the field to say it of some 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.750
 way but it does a job of 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.260
 experimentation including testing and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.800
 error we work more than all as 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.800
 laboratory 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.120
 thus this assembly has been developed as 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.470
 a practice space that generates 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.260
 cooperation creation and learning 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.980
 collective and that promotes work 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.080
 interdisciplinary between schools and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.210
 Faculty of Arts departments 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.210
 Integrated University of the Valley 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.319
 all right 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.410
 for students it is very important 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.570
 for the singing students because 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.550
 let's say it's like a stage for 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.680
 show your work to show the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.510
 results for a whole semester and for 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.130
 show also a bit then all the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.560
 scenographic work that has been done 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.210
 for the design ones, I think it's 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.940
 first time also that they see their work 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.130
 from the beginning to the end finished 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.750
 mounted they are even on the scene 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.420
 in the back driving the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.740
 set design and then it's also key 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.440
 because they appear in all 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.930
 credits are showing what is it 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.120
 that what they are doing in a 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.780
 event because we have important to weigh 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.780
 which is academic is very very important 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.780
