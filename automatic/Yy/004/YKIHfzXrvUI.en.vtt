00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
series and it's an awesome replica made

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.470 
series and it's an awesome replica made
by<00:00:21.600> moto<00:00:21.900> tank<00:00:22.260> high<00:00:23.100> quality<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.789> usual

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
by moto tank high quality as usual

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.170 
by moto tank high quality as usual
expected<00:00:25.199> from<00:00:25.350> him<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:27.029> well<00:00:27.150> done

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
expected from him just really well done

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
expected from him just really well done
it's<00:00:27.900> based<00:00:28.080> off<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> track<00:00:28.590> map<00:00:28.830> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it's based off of the track map so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.439 
it's based off of the track map so
there's<00:00:29.220> some<00:00:29.340> changes<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.000> beginning

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
there's some changes in this beginning

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.350 
there's some changes in this beginning
start<00:00:30.929> part<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.380> kind<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.590> goofy<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.610> overall

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
start part is kind of goofy but overall

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
start part is kind of goofy but overall
it's<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.780> really<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.530> well-done

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it's just a really really well-done

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.910 
it's just a really really well-done
track<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> fun<00:00:36.710> you'll<00:00:37.710> kind

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
track and it's a lot of fun you'll kind

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740 
track and it's a lot of fun you'll kind
of<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.040> some<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:38.910> knit<00:00:39.120> picks<00:00:39.360> throughout

of see some of my knit picks throughout
the<00:00:39.840> video<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> guess<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.309> got<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> kind<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the video I guess but you got to kind of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
the video I guess but you got to kind of
hit<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> big<00:00:42.780> lines<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.800> make<00:00:43.950> sense

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
hit the big lines to really make sense

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639 
hit the big lines to really make sense
of<00:00:44.430> things<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> weird<00:00:46.050> way<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.230> connect

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of things kind of a weird way to connect

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.810 
of things kind of a weird way to connect
the<00:00:46.739> track<00:00:47.010> through<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> beginning

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the track through here at the beginning

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.160 
the track through here at the beginning
but<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.090> you're<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.360> onto<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.899> start

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
but then you're back onto the start

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.750 
but then you're back onto the start
straight<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:50.039> you're<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> back<00:00:50.550> on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
straight and then you're kind of back on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.950 
straight and then you're kind of back on
to<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> normal<00:00:52.050> circuit<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:53.719> this<00:00:54.719> corner

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to the normal circuit here this corner

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020 
to the normal circuit here this corner
is<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.320> cool<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.670> keep<00:00:56.879> up

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
is really cool you really got to keep up

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.430 
is really cool you really got to keep up
a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.390> speed<00:00:57.750> through<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.289> see

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
a lot of speed through there you can see

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340 
a lot of speed through there you can see
it's<00:00:58.590> actually<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.190> easy<00:00:59.309> to<00:01:00.350> swap

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it's actually really easy to swap

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.810 
it's actually really easy to swap
through<00:01:01.739> these<00:01:01.890> loops<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.340> don't<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
through these loops I don't know what it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.640 
through these loops I don't know what it
is<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.210> keep<00:01:03.420> swapping<00:01:03.690> through<00:01:04.110> actually

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
is but I keep swapping through actually

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.300 
is but I keep swapping through actually
the<00:01:04.799> end<00:01:05.010> part<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> whoops<00:01:07.159> love<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the end part of the whoops love that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890 
the end part of the whoops love that
triple<00:01:08.580> back<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:08.939> nice<00:01:09.390> triple<00:01:09.689> triple

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
triple back there nice triple triple

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.660 
triple back there nice triple triple
here<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> land<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> corner

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
here you can kind of land in the corner

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420 
here you can kind of land in the corner
I<00:01:11.820> usually<00:01:12.180> try<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.570> jump<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.049> far<00:01:13.430> makes

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
I usually try to not jump that far makes

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.840 
I usually try to not jump that far makes
a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.610> bit<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:14.909> realistic<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:17.640> cool

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
a little bit more realistic really cool

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.429 
a little bit more realistic really cool
triple<00:01:18.299> through<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.840> easy<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.200> cut

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
triple through here it's easy to cut

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.780 
triple through here it's easy to cut
over<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
over like that you see how it kind of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.960 
over like that you see how it kind of
drifted<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> left<00:01:21.570> happens<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> lot<00:01:22.970> it's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
drifted to the left happens a lot it's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.039 
drifted to the left happens a lot it's
just<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> way<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> corner<00:01:24.600> set<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.990> think

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
just the way the corner set up I think

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.990 
just the way the corner set up I think
so<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.100> drift<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.490> left<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.970> just

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
so if you drift to the left it just

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
so if you drift to the left it just
makes<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.479> farther<00:01:28.229> distance<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.950> know

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
makes it like farther distance you know

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
makes it like farther distance you know
what<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> mean<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:29.670> jumping<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
what I mean when you're jumping so it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.060 
what I mean when you're jumping so it
makes<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.960> where<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> don't<00:01:31.290> really<00:01:31.320> don't

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
makes it where you don't really don't

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
makes it where you don't really don't
triple<00:01:32.430> out<00:01:32.750> kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> strange<00:01:34.170> spot<00:01:34.409> here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
triple out kind of a strange spot here

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
triple out kind of a strange spot here
you<00:01:34.799> cut<00:01:35.159> nice<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> little

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you cut nice in you can just do a little

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
you cut nice in you can just do a little
tire<00:01:37.409> tap<00:01:37.740> type<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.880> can't<00:01:39.570> hit<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
tire tap type thing you can't hit it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.289 
tire tap type thing you can't hit it
with<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:39.990> rear<00:01:40.140> wheel<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:41.299> but

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
with your rear wheel if you want but

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
left just a little bit but I controlled

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.539 
left just a little bit but I controlled
it<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.470> little<00:02:17.620> bit<00:02:17.769> more<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.129> you<00:02:18.190> do<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.340> nice

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
it a little bit more so you do a nice

triple triple triple little case there
and<00:02:21.370> double<00:02:21.790> out<00:02:22.170> that's<00:02:23.170> kind<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.799> way<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and double out that's kind of the way to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.039 
and double out that's kind of the way to
go<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.549> like<00:02:24.849> this<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.209> can<00:02:25.299> do<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> nice<00:02:25.690> scrub

go I like this you can do a nice scrub

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.140 
go I like this you can do a nice scrub
on<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.410> first<00:02:26.680> double<00:02:26.860> works<00:02:27.430> out<00:02:27.610> perfect

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
on that first double works out perfect

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.780 
on that first double works out perfect
very<00:02:28.420> nice<00:02:28.720> spacing<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.500> scaling<00:02:29.920> there<00:02:30.129> by

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
very nice spacing and scaling there by

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.970 
very nice spacing and scaling there by
Moto<00:02:31.330> tank<00:02:31.629> same<00:02:32.440> way<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.709> come<00:02:32.829> out<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
Moto tank same way you can come out a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.400 
Moto tank same way you can come out a
little<00:02:33.160> bit<00:02:33.430> farther<00:02:33.819> do<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.690> nice<00:02:34.870> double

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
little bit farther do a nice double

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.220 
little bit farther do a nice double
double<00:02:36.040> here<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.519> maybe<00:02:37.209> faster<00:02:37.870> it's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
double here and it's maybe faster it's

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.839 
double here and it's maybe faster it's
definitely<00:02:38.829> a<00:02:38.860> hell<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.099> a<00:02:39.250> lot<00:02:39.370> smoother<00:02:39.819> than

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
definitely a hell of a lot smoother than

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.930 
definitely a hell of a lot smoother than
what<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.180> took<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> first<00:02:40.690> time<00:02:40.930> Oh

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
what I took the first time Oh

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.180 
what I took the first time Oh
so<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.840> reason<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.200> did<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.410> there's<00:02:45.069> a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
so the reason I did that there's a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.830 
so the reason I did that there's a
reason<00:02:45.579> there's<00:02:45.849> there's<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.329> reason<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.690> just

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
reason there's there's a reason I just

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.559 
reason there's there's a reason I just
got<00:02:47.140> all<00:02:47.230> Guney<00:02:47.590> there<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:48.299> these<00:02:49.299> tough

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
got all Guney there but these tough

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.229 
got all Guney there but these tough
locks<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.049> actually<00:02:50.379> can't<00:02:50.680> hit<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:52.060> kind<00:02:52.209> of

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
locks you actually can't hit you kind of

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.819 
locks you actually can't hit you kind of
just<00:02:52.390> go<00:02:52.540> through<00:02:52.780> them<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.590> really

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
just go through them so you can really

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.430 
just go through them so you can really
use<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.269> get<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.540> gas<00:02:55.660> really<00:02:56.049> early

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
use you can get on the gas really early

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.259 
use you can get on the gas really early
and<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.650> put<00:02:56.890> drift<00:02:57.190> wide<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.760> use<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.090> to

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
and just put drift wide and use this to

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.699 
and just put drift wide and use this to
zuki<00:02:58.540> tough<00:02:58.720> block<00:02:58.989> where<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.260> can<00:02:59.470> kind<00:02:59.650> of

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
zuki tough block where you can kind of

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.830 
zuki tough block where you can kind of
hit<00:02:59.829> it<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.220> got<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> be<00:03:00.489> careful<00:03:00.640> but<00:03:01.420> if

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
hit it but you got to be careful but if

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.059 
hit it but you got to be careful but if
you<00:03:01.900> go<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.019> little<00:03:02.170> too<00:03:02.379> far<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.860> Kawasaki

sketchy<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:27.010> kind<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.220> had<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.459> go<00:03:27.609> with<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:28.000> you

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
sketchy it kind of had to go with it you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.819 
sketchy it kind of had to go with it you
can<00:03:28.239> see<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.450> can<00:03:28.569> hit<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.720> lip<00:03:29.319> on<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.620> left

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
can see you can hit that lip on the left

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.680 
can see you can hit that lip on the left
and<00:03:30.099> you<00:03:30.160> jump<00:03:30.370> over<00:03:30.579> that's<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.389> different

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and you jump over that's a different

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.940 
and you jump over that's a different
rhythm<00:03:31.810> through<00:03:32.079> there<00:03:32.260> but<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.680> think<00:03:32.829> you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
rhythm through there but I think you

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.430 
rhythm through there but I think you
have<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.459> go<00:03:33.549> outside<00:03:33.790> here<00:03:34.389> this<00:03:34.959> triple

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
have to go outside here this triple

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.879 
have to go outside here this triple
triple<00:03:35.650> triple<00:03:36.040> or<00:03:36.340> whatever<00:03:36.609> this<00:03:36.910> combo<00:03:37.299> is

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
triple triple or whatever this combo is

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.740 
triple triple or whatever this combo is
way<00:03:38.889> faster<00:03:39.310> than<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.819> alternative<00:03:40.329> so

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
way faster than the alternative so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.030 
way faster than the alternative so
that's<00:03:40.989> kind<00:03:41.169> of<00:03:41.260> one<00:03:41.349> of<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.560> lines<00:03:41.769> where

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that's kind of one of the lines where

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.339 
that's kind of one of the lines where
you<00:03:42.130> just<00:03:42.280> have<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.639> hit<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.910> again<00:03:43.810> love<00:03:44.109> that

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
you just have to hit it again love that

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.800 
you just have to hit it again love that
scrub<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.069> double<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.299> actually<00:03:46.540> a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
scrub on that double and I actually a

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.140 
scrub on that double and I actually a
lot<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.049> times<00:03:47.169> just<00:03:47.440> launched<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.340> case<00:03:48.910> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
lot of times just launched this case the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.759 
lot of times just launched this case the
quad<00:03:49.419> usually<00:03:50.109> works<00:03:50.260> out<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> little<00:03:50.590> bit

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
quad usually works out a little bit

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.190 
quad usually works out a little bit
better<00:03:50.919> and<00:03:51.190> then<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.599> do<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> nice<00:03:52.930> tire

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
better and then I just do a nice tire

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.360 
better and then I just do a nice tire
tap<00:03:53.500> only<00:03:53.950> because<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.280> looks<00:03:54.459> cool

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
tap only because it looks cool

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.270 
tap only because it looks cool
so<00:03:56.270> that's<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.540> line<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:56.900> do<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.350> lot<00:03:57.470> maybe

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
so that's a line that I do a lot maybe

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.220 
so that's a line that I do a lot maybe
out<00:03:58.640> of<00:03:58.760> bad<00:03:58.970> habit<00:03:59.480> I'm<00:03:59.600> not<00:03:59.750> sure<00:03:59.900> which<00:04:00.050> one

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
out of bad habit I'm not sure which one

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.500 
out of bad habit I'm not sure which one
is<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.470> fastest<00:04:00.920> once<00:04:01.730> again<00:04:02.030> getting<00:04:02.300> on

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
is the fastest once again getting on

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.540 
is the fastest once again getting on
nice<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.290> early<00:04:03.620> they're<00:04:06.100> easy<00:04:07.100> to<00:04:07.310> have<00:04:07.400> your

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
nice and early they're easy to have your

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.610 
nice and early they're easy to have your
back-end<00:04:07.730> come<00:04:08.180> out<00:04:08.360> on<00:04:08.600> this<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.200> corner<00:04:09.590> so

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
back-end come out on this that corner so

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.930 
back-end come out on this that corner so
it's<00:04:09.920> all<00:04:10.130> about<00:04:10.340> trying<00:04:10.550> to<00:04:10.640> keep<00:04:10.820> it

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
it's all about trying to keep it

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.550 
it's all about trying to keep it
together<00:04:11.060> just<00:04:11.360> get<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.750> power<00:04:11.930> down<00:04:12.050> lean

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
together just get the power down lean

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.930 
together just get the power down lean
back<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:13.040> get<00:04:13.220> all<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.459> way<00:04:13.490> over<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.850> the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
back and get all the way over to the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.030 
back and get all the way over to the
right<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.510> can<00:04:14.660> just<00:04:14.840> carve<00:04:15.620> through<00:04:15.890> this

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
right so you can just carve through this

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.400 
right so you can just carve through this
corner<00:04:16.459> nice<00:04:16.670> and<00:04:16.850> smoothly<00:04:17.120> again<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.049> love

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
corner nice and smoothly again I love

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.620 
corner nice and smoothly again I love
scrubbed<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.920> direction<00:04:19.070> through<00:04:19.519> there

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.220 

I<00:04:24.550> almost<00:04:25.550> got<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:25.940> sweet<00:04:26.300> scrub<00:04:26.810> there<00:04:27.080> but

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
I almost got that sweet scrub there but

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.960 
I almost got that sweet scrub there but
I<00:04:27.290> wanted<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.590> hit<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:27.800> inside<00:04:28.310> line<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:28.880> we

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
I wanted to hit this inside line so we

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.340 
I wanted to hit this inside line so we
can<00:04:29.090> kind<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.300> play<00:04:29.510> with<00:04:29.540> this<00:04:29.900> see<00:04:30.110> what<00:04:30.140> the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
can kind of play with this see what the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.170 
can kind of play with this see what the
deal<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.980> think<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.760> might<00:04:31.910> be<00:04:32.000> able<00:04:32.060> to

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
deal is I think you might be able to

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.370 
deal is I think you might be able to
triple<00:04:32.390> there<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.840> know<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.050> can<00:04:33.230> land

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
triple there but I know you can land

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.440 
triple there but I know you can land
this<00:04:33.680> triple<00:04:34.190> stretch<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.910> out<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.060> little<00:04:35.270> bit

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
this triple stretch it out a little bit

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.020 
this triple stretch it out a little bit
maybe<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:36.020> little<00:04:36.800> double<00:04:37.370> double<00:04:37.640> or<00:04:37.790> triple

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
maybe a little double double or triple

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.540 
maybe a little double double or triple
single<00:04:38.510> house<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.020> not<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.890> best<00:04:40.100> way<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.340> do

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
single house so not the best way to do

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.220 
single house so not the best way to do
things<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.970> again<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.330> can<00:04:41.480> triple<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.930> too

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
things and again you can triple that too

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.900 
things and again you can triple that too
you<00:04:42.410> see<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.650> didn't<00:04:43.340> really<00:04:43.430> hit<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.670> corner

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
you see I didn't really hit the corner

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.120 
you see I didn't really hit the corner
before<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.300> very<00:04:44.480> nicely<00:04:44.720> but<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:45.530> can<00:04:45.800> triple

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
before it very nicely but you can triple

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.710 
before it very nicely but you can triple
it<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.550> makes<00:04:46.760> for<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:47.030> pretty<00:04:47.060> nice<00:04:47.360> line

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
it and it makes for a pretty nice line

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.630 
it and it makes for a pretty nice line
through<00:04:47.960> there<00:04:48.140> but<00:04:48.800> it's<00:04:48.920> a<00:04:49.010> hard<00:04:49.220> triple<00:04:49.550> to

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
through there but it's a hard triple to

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.400 
through there but it's a hard triple to
make<00:04:49.790> every<00:04:50.060> lap<00:04:50.240> obviously<00:04:50.570> I've<00:04:51.020> messed<00:04:51.260> it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
make every lap obviously I've messed it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
make every lap obviously I've messed it
up<00:04:51.500> there<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:53.380> again<00:04:54.380> consistency<00:04:55.070> is<00:04:55.160> always

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
up there so again consistency is always

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.120 
up there so again consistency is always
important<00:04:55.790> in<00:04:55.820> this<00:04:55.910> game<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.690> it's<00:04:56.960> like<00:04:57.170> some

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
important in this game so it's like some

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.830 
important in this game so it's like some
things<00:04:58.370> aren't<00:04:58.700> worth<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.150> if<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.540> sketchy

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
things aren't worth it if it's sketchy

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.020 
things aren't worth it if it's sketchy
you're<00:05:00.650> almost<00:05:00.890> better<00:05:01.040> off<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.460> hit<00:05:01.640> a<00:05:01.790> line

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
you're almost better off to hit a line

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.510 
you're almost better off to hit a line
that<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.390> hit<00:05:02.510> consistently<00:05:03.230> so<00:05:03.590> anyway

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
that you can hit consistently so anyway

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.550 
that you can hit consistently so anyway
I<00:05:04.880> know<00:05:05.420> I'm<00:05:05.600> talking<00:05:05.750> a<00:05:05.990> lot<00:05:06.020> through<00:05:06.410> this

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
I know I'm talking a lot through this

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.620 
I know I'm talking a lot through this
video<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.100> there's<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.340> lot<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.600> little<00:05:08.600> things

video but there's a lot of little things
that<00:05:09.080> make<00:05:09.350> this<00:05:09.500> track<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.890> lot<00:05:10.040> of<00:05:10.160> fun

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
that make this track a lot of fun

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.260 
that make this track a lot of fun
it<00:05:11.420> may<00:05:11.870> come<00:05:12.230> across<00:05:12.320> rather<00:05:12.830> simple<00:05:13.400> but<00:05:13.700> in

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
it may come across rather simple but in

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.660 
it may come across rather simple but in
the<00:05:14.420> end<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:15.110> has<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.410> lot<00:05:15.620> of<00:05:15.740> things<00:05:15.920> that<00:05:16.310> you

kind<00:05:16.850> of<00:05:16.880> got<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.030> think<00:05:17.240> about<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.690> have<00:05:17.810> a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
kind of got to think about and have a

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.260 
kind of got to think about and have a
little<00:05:17.990> bit<00:05:18.170> of<00:05:18.230> fun<00:05:18.410> with<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.940> there's<00:05:20.150> some

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
little bit of fun with and there's some

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.970 
little bit of fun with and there's some
nice<00:05:20.420> kind<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.750> floaty<00:05:21.110> jumps<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.800> things

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
nice kind of floaty jumps and things

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.450 
nice kind of floaty jumps and things
like<00:05:22.160> that

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
like that

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.500 
like that
some<00:05:22.730> big<00:05:22.910> triples<00:05:23.390> makes<00:05:24.380> it<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.590> lot<00:05:24.740> of<00:05:24.830> fun

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
some big triples makes it a lot of fun

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.970 
some big triples makes it a lot of fun
now<00:05:26.510> again<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.780> want<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.140> slow<00:05:27.410> up<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.680> little<00:05:27.830> bit

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
now again I want to slow up a little bit

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.070 
now again I want to slow up a little bit
hit<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.340> step<00:05:28.580> on<00:05:28.730> step<00:05:29.060> on<00:05:29.210> step<00:05:29.570> off<00:05:29.780> I<00:05:29.990> think

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
hit the step on step on step off I think

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.980 
hit the step on step on step off I think
that<00:05:30.470> might<00:05:30.710> be<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.010> fastest<00:05:31.340> flying<00:05:31.550> today

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
that might be the fastest flying today

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.720 
that might be the fastest flying today
nice<00:05:32.990> there<00:05:33.530> we<00:05:33.620> go<00:05:33.770> so<00:05:34.010> then<00:05:34.130> you<00:05:34.220> can<00:05:34.340> scrub

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
nice there we go so then you can scrub

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.760 
nice there we go so then you can scrub
the<00:05:34.880> middle<00:05:35.120> triple<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:36.170> can<00:05:36.290> see<00:05:36.530> how<00:05:36.740> I

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
the middle triple you can see how I

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.740 
the middle triple you can see how I
landed<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.370> just<00:05:37.820> about<00:05:38.030> perfect<00:05:38.570> there

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
landed it just about perfect there

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.470 
landed it just about perfect there
really<00:05:39.020> cool<00:05:39.790> and<00:05:40.790> I<00:05:40.880> really<00:05:41.150> want<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.420> hit

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
really cool and I really want to hit

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.750 
really cool and I really want to hit
this<00:05:41.630> triple<00:05:42.020> but<00:05:42.410> sometimes<00:05:43.220> you<00:05:43.340> can<00:05:43.490> case

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
this triple but sometimes you can case

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.760 
this triple but sometimes you can case
it<00:05:43.970> double<00:05:44.450> dang<00:05:44.930> it<00:05:45.050> kind<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.380> messed<00:05:45.560> it<00:05:45.680> up

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
it double dang it kind of messed it up

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.410 
it double dang it kind of messed it up
there<00:05:45.980> and<00:05:46.130> it<00:05:46.250> end<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.580> with<00:05:46.760> a<00:05:46.790> where<00:05:47.330> you

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
there and it end you with a where you

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.660 
there and it end you with a where you
end<00:05:47.660> with<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:47.930> triple<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:49.130> land<00:05:49.400> right<00:05:49.640> here

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
end with a triple you land right here

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.670 
end with a triple you land right here
and<00:05:50.330> that<00:05:50.510> works<00:05:50.660> really<00:05:50.750> well<00:05:50.990> because<00:05:51.410> it's

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
and that works really well because it's

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.930 
and that works really well because it's
just<00:05:51.800> really<00:05:51.980> smooth<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.340> can<00:05:52.520> drift<00:05:52.790> out<00:05:52.910> a

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
just really smooth you can drift out a

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.570 
just really smooth you can drift out a
little<00:05:53.180> wide<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:53.920> and<00:05:54.920> have<00:05:55.190> a<00:05:55.220> few<00:05:55.460> options

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
little wide and and have a few options

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.000 
little wide and and have a few options
through<00:05:56.150> there<00:05:56.300> so<00:05:56.720> anyway<00:05:57.080> last<00:05:57.440> lap<00:05:57.740> let's

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
through there so anyway last lap let's

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.890 
through there so anyway last lap let's
try<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.220> make<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.640> a<00:05:58.910> smooth<00:05:59.330> one<00:05:59.570> I<00:05:59.600> really

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
try to make it a smooth one I really

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.200 
try to make it a smooth one I really
haven't<00:06:00.080> had<00:06:00.320> one<00:06:00.710> complete<00:06:01.490> good<00:06:01.670> lap<00:06:01.940> yet

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
haven't had one complete good lap yet

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.780 
haven't had one complete good lap yet
and<00:06:02.480> I<00:06:03.410> can't<00:06:03.650> promise<00:06:03.860> I<00:06:04.100> can<00:06:04.250> make<00:06:04.400> it<00:06:04.520> happen

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
and I can't promise I can make it happen

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.580 
and I can't promise I can make it happen
on<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:04.940> last<00:06:04.970> lap<00:06:05.420> but<00:06:05.660> I'm<00:06:06.050> gonna<00:06:06.170> focus<00:06:06.410> a

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
on the last lap but I'm gonna focus a

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.920 
on the last lap but I'm gonna focus a
little<00:06:06.830> bit<00:06:07.070> more<00:06:07.280> here

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.450 

could<00:06:10.320> carried<00:06:10.590> a<00:06:10.650> little<00:06:10.800> bit<00:06:11.039> more<00:06:11.220> speed

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
could carried a little bit more speed

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.020 
could carried a little bit more speed
through<00:06:11.729> there<00:06:11.940> again<00:06:13.639> want<00:06:14.639> to<00:06:14.729> stay<00:06:14.850> to<00:06:14.910> the

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
through there again want to stay to the

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.050 
through there again want to stay to the
right

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.730 

jinx<00:06:18.690> myself<00:06:20.330> so<00:06:21.330> no<00:06:21.750> good<00:06:21.990> lap<00:06:22.169> time<00:06:22.440> on<00:06:22.620> this

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
jinx myself so no good lap time on this

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.170 
jinx myself so no good lap time on this
one<00:06:23.009> but<00:06:23.610> I'm<00:06:24.539> not<00:06:24.690> too<00:06:24.870> worried<00:06:25.199> about<00:06:25.259> it

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
one but I'm not too worried about it

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.070 
one but I'm not too worried about it
instead<00:06:27.180> of<00:06:27.270> a<00:06:27.330> different<00:06:27.570> rhythm<00:06:27.750> through

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
instead of a different rhythm through

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:40.379 
instead of a different rhythm through
here<00:06:33.889> really<00:06:34.889> cool<00:06:35.190> track

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.439 

like<00:06:40.930> I<00:06:40.960> said<00:06:41.320> I<00:06:41.770> was<00:06:42.610> hoping<00:06:42.820> for<00:06:42.880> a<00:06:43.030> hot<00:06:43.210> lap

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
like I said I was hoping for a hot lap

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.420 
like I said I was hoping for a hot lap
on<00:06:43.630> this<00:06:43.780> last<00:06:43.990> lap<00:06:44.260> but<00:06:44.590> it's<00:06:45.040> just<00:06:45.250> turned

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
on this last lap but it's just turned

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.400 
on this last lap but it's just turned
into<00:06:45.550> a<00:06:45.810> terrible<00:06:46.810> one<00:06:47.139> but<00:06:47.590> no<00:06:48.100> worries

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410
