00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.700 

trailer<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:41.970> an<00:01:42.210> instep

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
trailer is an instep

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.670 
trailer is an instep
to<00:01:45.400> child<00:01:45.700> trailer<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.990> her<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.470> she

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
to child trailer I put her in it she

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.800 
to child trailer I put her in it she
probably<00:01:50.920> weighs<00:01:51.220> she's<00:01:51.940> three<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:52.750> she

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
probably weighs she's three so she

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.710 
probably weighs she's three so she
weighs<00:01:53.229> 30<00:01:54.190> 40<00:01:54.640> pounds<00:01:55.030> something<00:01:55.330> like<00:01:55.450> that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
weighs 30 40 pounds something like that

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.380 
weighs 30 40 pounds something like that
and<00:01:56.369> yesterday<00:01:57.369> actually<00:01:57.790> we<00:01:58.090> went<00:01:58.270> to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and yesterday actually we went to

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.560 
and yesterday actually we went to
library<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.020> loaded<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.440> with<00:01:59.590> books<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.509> i

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
library and loaded it with books so i

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.359 
library and loaded it with books so i
bet<00:02:02.020> i've<00:02:02.140> had<00:02:02.380> close<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.979> hundred<00:02:03.040> pounds

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
bet i've had close to a hundred pounds

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.690 
bet i've had close to a hundred pounds
in<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:05.560> that's<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.920> weight<00:02:06.190> rating

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
in it I think that's the weight rating

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.790 
in it I think that's the weight rating
is<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.880> hundred<00:02:07.210> pounds<00:02:07.390> which<00:02:10.470> I'd<00:02:11.470> like<00:02:11.680> to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
is a hundred pounds which I'd like to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.140 
is a hundred pounds which I'd like to
beef<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.190> up<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.610> could<00:02:12.730> hold<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.030> little

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
beef it up so it could hold a little

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.720 
beef it up so it could hold a little
more<00:02:13.480> weight<00:02:17.130> also<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.160> was<00:02:18.340> thinking<00:02:18.670> about

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
more weight also I was thinking about

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.020 
more weight also I was thinking about
maybe<00:02:19.410> somehow<00:02:20.410> making<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:21.010> platform<00:02:21.790> may<00:02:21.970> be

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
maybe somehow making a platform may be

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.830 
maybe somehow making a platform may be
on<00:02:22.239> top<00:02:22.510> or<00:02:23.400> something<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.820> when<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.540> go<00:02:25.660> bow

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
on top or something for when I go bow

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.190 
on top or something for when I go bow
hunting<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.239> shoot<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.570> deer<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.870> could<00:02:29.080> put<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
hunting if I shoot a deer I could put a

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.420 
hunting if I shoot a deer I could put a
deer<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.480> haven't<00:02:31.480> really<00:02:31.630> thought<00:02:32.430> into

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
deer on it haven't really thought into

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.780 
deer on it haven't really thought into
that<00:02:33.459> too<00:02:33.820> much<00:02:33.850> but<00:02:34.830> anyways<00:02:36.810> let's<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:38.790> one
