00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
to learn I'm going to make this really

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.240 
to learn I'm going to make this really
easy<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.390> using<00:00:18.960> scrolling<00:00:19.770> tablature

easy for you using scrolling tablature

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
easy for you using scrolling tablature
and<00:00:20.460> also<00:00:21.330> some<00:00:21.539> button<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.260> speed<00:00:22.470> up

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and also some button so you can speed up

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.050 
and also some button so you can speed up
and<00:00:22.740> slow<00:00:22.859> down<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.130> video<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.850> learn

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
and slow down the video so you can learn

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060 
and slow down the video so you can learn
at<00:00:24.180> your<00:00:24.269> own<00:00:24.420> pace<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.960> would<00:00:25.320> ask<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> you'd

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
at your own pace I would ask that you'd

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
at your own pace I would ask that you'd
start<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> slowest<00:00:27.029> speed<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.449> then<00:00:27.779> work

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
start at the slowest speed and then work

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.150 
start at the slowest speed and then work
your<00:00:28.140> way<00:00:28.260> back<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> normal<00:00:29.070> speed

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
your way back up to the normal speed

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.700 
your way back up to the normal speed
until<00:00:29.519> you've<00:00:29.640> got<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.939> down<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:31.050> also<00:00:31.470> going

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
until you've got it down I'm also going

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.080 
until you've got it down I'm also going
to<00:00:31.769> give<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.130> explanation<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> chord

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to give you an explanation of the chord

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
to give you an explanation of the chord
breakdown<00:00:33.450> at<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> end<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.260> let's<00:00:34.739> go

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
breakdown at the end of it but let's go

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.630 
breakdown at the end of it but let's go
ahead<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.340> start<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> song

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
ahead and start the song

[Music]

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.710 

okay<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.700> hopefully<00:01:06.090> you've<00:01:06.210> had<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.390> chance<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
okay so hopefully you've had a chance to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.880 
okay so hopefully you've had a chance to
play<00:01:06.930> through<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> couple<00:01:07.470> times<00:01:07.560> at

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
play through that a couple times at

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
play through that a couple times at
different<00:01:08.220> speeds<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> now<00:01:08.729> you're<00:01:08.909> somewhat

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
different speeds and now you're somewhat

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
different speeds and now you're somewhat
comfortable<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.289> it<00:01:10.440> I<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.710> want<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:11.100> give

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
comfortable with it I just want to give

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.440 
comfortable with it I just want to give
you<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> few<00:01:11.550> guidelines<00:01:11.940> there<00:01:12.179> I<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you a few guidelines there I know you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
you a few guidelines there I know you
can<00:01:12.690> see<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.020> hand<00:01:13.259> um

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
can see the hand um

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.730 
can see the hand um
the<00:01:14.520> cords<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.720> simple<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.229> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the cords are really simple that's it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.149 
the cords are really simple that's it's
kind<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.340> traditional<00:01:18.179> G<00:01:18.450> into<00:01:18.929> a<00:01:19.170> C<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.740> two

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
kind of a traditional G into a C in two

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.120 
kind of a traditional G into a C in two
and<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> half<00:01:20.550> into<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.179> D<00:01:21.539> and<00:01:21.810> then<00:01:22.440> back<00:01:22.470> into<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and a half into a D and then back into a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
and a half into a D and then back into a
G<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:23.940> just<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.539> walk<00:01:24.720> down<00:01:24.929> into<00:01:25.289> an<00:01:25.409> F<00:01:25.590> II

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
G and then just a walk down into an F II

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.609 
G and then just a walk down into an F II
minor<00:01:26.819> although<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.539> tend<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.050> make<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.409> major

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
minor although I tend to make it a major

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.200 
minor although I tend to make it a major
just<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.369> finger<00:01:29.819> is<00:01:29.940> getting

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
just because this finger is getting

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.990 
just because this finger is getting
ready<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.569> come<00:01:30.869> down<00:01:31.069> here<00:01:32.069> for<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.729> minor

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
ready to come down here for the a minor

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.320 
ready to come down here for the a minor
and<00:01:33.899> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> tricky<00:01:34.679> part<00:01:35.210> you're<00:01:36.210> going

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
and this is a tricky part you're going

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.880 
and this is a tricky part you're going
to<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.630> check<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.710> few

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to want to check that one out a few

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.370 
to want to check that one out a few
times<00:01:38.039> if<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.399> haven't<00:01:38.640> already<00:01:39.380> because

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
times if you haven't already because

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.249 
times if you haven't already because
it's<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> traditional<00:01:41.340> quarter<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.700> there

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
it's not a traditional quarter in there

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.559 
it's not a traditional quarter in there
right<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> regular<00:01:43.979> C<00:01:44.340> major<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.030> then

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
right back to a regular C major and then

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.210 
right back to a regular C major and then
you're<00:01:45.959> basically<00:01:46.170> starting<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.770> solve<00:01:46.920> over

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you're basically starting to solve over

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.869 
you're basically starting to solve over
again<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.550> this<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.879> second<00:01:48.179> section<00:01:48.330> uh

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:49.879 
again but this is the second section uh

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:52.520 
again but this is the second section uh
this<00:01:50.879> is<00:01:51.030> kind<00:01:51.330> of<00:01:51.509> tricky<00:01:51.660> but<00:01:52.050> not<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this is kind of tricky but not really

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.990 
this is kind of tricky but not really
this<00:01:53.039> is<00:01:53.190> probably<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.489> trickiest<00:01:53.610> part<00:01:53.970> of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
this is probably the trickiest part of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.690 
this is probably the trickiest part of
