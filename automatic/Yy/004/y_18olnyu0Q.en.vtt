 Well, we are ready and we are going to start 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.630
 making a chick for the bathroom so it's 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.220
 that we are already with the material but 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.450
 you do not know it, so take 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.180
 note 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.270
 for the bathroom game we need fabric 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.750
 of blanket goodness to pass ribbon ribbon of 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:24.070
 Coffee color ribbon spreading to paints 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.780

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.640

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.560
 Well, we are ready with all the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.040
 materials and this is father because it is 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.770
 as it commands but the exact one is the fabric 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.750
 pumped and here we are going to mark 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.810
 obviously you take the measure because 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.150
 There are different stages for bathing then 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.370
 some have more width the part of 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.809
 above and air because then there are some 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.520
 up to half with irregular shapes 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.790
 but good let's do the traditional 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.230
 let's say we're going to do we already have the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.410
 mold can mark it on a cardboard 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.160
 and what we're doing basically is something 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.230
 A) Yes 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.449
 good more redondito is that here we have 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.449
 a little walk 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.320
 the view is more or less and here I am going to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.320
 mark 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.719
 the afternoons better with if the pencil 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.360

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.730
 plus 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.260
 I have 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.260
 let me cut this stick 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.260
 and there it is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.580
 we're 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.920
 Friday friday you feel in 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.490
 the air the freedom like that like 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.300
 Relaxed green has processed a Friday 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.880
 Social 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.880
 and the scissors that are here 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.890
 today it is cut very well this web is 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.890
 very good is a quilt vita 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.610
 terrific I already have here the form of the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.610
 bathroom cover 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 and what I'm going to do is start moving 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.760
 here they see the design has already 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.760
 rolls to go through there he 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.469
 the nation then this we have to 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.310
 do that first and then we will use the 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:38.640
 discovery this 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.340
 with which we only ironed maybe and 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.410
 we save the cross and we have the kitchen 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.260
 hear someone who is going to come is coming 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.810
 teach how to sew how you should if you join 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.420
 you can lose the program to her the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.280
 we have completely set aside so that 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.260
 come and give us an appointment class because 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.170
 then we get stuck in that kitchen 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.580
 some tips that do not know and apart some 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.100
 things he does wow 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.960
 even mascot costumes imagine 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.690
 well then basically that would be what 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.400
 that will cover the stage and will be the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.640
 same 6 that I really like these colors 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 in raw martín remains as very neutral 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.900
 very very clean it looks very good very neutral 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.820
 and I like it as singular of the part that 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.850
 It is a color that makes us dirty because 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.490
 if you put white towels and that comes to the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.480
 child from school or I washed the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.480
 hands school to the I 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.990
 Oh, how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.950
 the craft 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:50.070
 really entertains and gives him now yes 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.990
 that everything for us for each 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.990
 room for everyone 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.470
 the areas of the house we have something for 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.690
 do is the same let's do and we're going to 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.250
 go thinking what idea we can think of to 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.320
 make him some painted design 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.120
 with the same fabric stuck some then 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.670
 it occurs to me we can make a flower here 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.569
 great as we were taught to for example 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.539
 it is 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.669
 I think it could not be but in this 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.169
 case I think I prefer to paint look 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:28.009
 that also does something very discreet very 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:31.389
 discreet and those circles can be and what 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:34.389
 we filled with spirals something like this very 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.389
 simple 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.889
 he likes purple also always 

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:41.110
 it looks good 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.240
 we can combine the two at best 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.319
 make common 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.599
 you can not be like matching with 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:53.080
 soon if the towels have any 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.550
 figure some pattern or we can copy 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.470
 use 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.390
 the best we can do first the ones 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.790
 spirals and then we make some 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.710
 purple or so I like too I think 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.040
 that the blanket combines very well with that 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.040
 colour 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.429
 first I want to say hello to those of us 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.739
 they send a thousand good with the 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:14.019
 congratulations and comments on networks 

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:16.300
 social and of course also to 

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:18.830
 who see us through the various 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.110
 cable channels 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.850
 from end to end of our beautiful 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.730
 Mexican Republic and of course of 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.270
 tves more Latin than by the way the other 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.449
 day send me a joke out there that was going 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.360

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.610
 to the daughter who was the mom and today is 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.409
 like everything more chubby than pregnancy 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:46.849
 not nothing with pregnancy explanation no 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:51.580
 requested requested accusation received yes or no 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.580
 I was wrong, not as is 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.420

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.680

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.130
