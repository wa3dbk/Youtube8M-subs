 bull so today I 'm going to you 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.500

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 compatible cartridges compatible 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 cannes 550 550 and 1 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.270
 and the different so that we 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.509
 then use the ink kits are from 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.020
 the senado brand as could see 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:30.869
 then there is the yellow the blue the magenta 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.830
 and black and our recruitments we do not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.080
 do not worry about the two blacks I 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.930
 you were explaining lenoir pigments that's 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.430
 for the big cartridge and the black all 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.019
 simple is by the little cartridge that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.680
 only for photos 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.800
 now i will explain to you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 how to reload ink cartridges 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.190
 then know that for today is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.850
 persuading you to remove the cap 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 here I'm going to do that and thanks to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.359
 a syringe inserted the loan in these 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.259
 little fights he anchors will spill 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.640
 in the pages 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.100
 next door you must know that it was bages 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.310
 and very thick so it takes 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.259
 30 to 40 minutes for you to speak 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.420
 spills and to go faster it takes 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:20.869
 withdraw this monday 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.869
 so now i'm going to inserted the anc 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 here 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.200
 once the inked time tight you 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:47.580
 close with the little cap that you 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.649
 have removed and as you can see that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.479
 takes a while so I'm going 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.040
 leave a little and it takes a certain 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.799
 time to recharge 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.399
 here to dump in the pages so we 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.420
 remove the little tongue enormously 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.420
 see that goes much faster 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.410
 so once all the tool between 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.739
 spent in the pages we must draw 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.510
 the orange cash you see here for 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.310
 able to put it in the printer 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.190
 but do not hide 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.650
 orange down but rather to the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.260
 high because otherwise if you remove 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.380
 down ben it's okay there are risks 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.530
 that the ink flows through the pages 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.760
 so when you shoot them 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.220
 you have to have your hands on both 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.170
 sides because if you have it safe here 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.959
 you practice exercising pressure 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.070
 on the punches what can prove this 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.500
 who can pour the inked 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.110
 so you see how we know 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.790
 that we remove the orange cash and once 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.400
 that you crave orange cash you the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.400
 put like these in the printer 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.180
 so thanks it was the pc boom assistance 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.180
 goodbye
