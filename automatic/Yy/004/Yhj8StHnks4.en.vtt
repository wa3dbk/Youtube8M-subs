00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.849
 we will make an origami so the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.920
 arrow so this folding that is realized 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 waiting for a two thousand leaves a4 is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.330
 conducive to all games to organize 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.640
 for example, a toboggan run 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.260
 on each arrow a coded message or 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.869
 simply indications that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 allow you to go to the next step 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.750
 it's also a good way to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.300
 way to access a place where you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.960
 make your birthday and our fact 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.960
 So here we begin to bend 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 this crazy in two and you to them 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.739
 cut out the middle line that will us 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.020
 give 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.329
 this after when we arrive here we 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.690
 let's take the end of the half 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 A4 sheet the euro folded a triangle like 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:59.969
 these well smooth the edges have 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:05.129
 looked that's perfect like that we are 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:12.450
 well here we do the same thing 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:18.659
 the other side one fills as a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 triangle that's it right on the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.700
 edge which gives us that a whole fold 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.680
 this then we will bend the what 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 seems that you see with free va 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:41.780
 against me the cut by the master the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:45.079
 half like that having well he likes to do 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.159
 I think this is shoddy work 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.159
 that's perfect 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.420
 so our first part is over 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.429
 in the second part of art to the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.429
 the realization of this organ friends us 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.390
 let's go bent it's gone like that 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.340
 on the other side then spoon to pay himself 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.879
 triangle like these as well as this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.349
 little triangle like this here in 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.160
 this third and last part 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.819
 I'll show you therefore the operation 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.329
 more delicate 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:32.260
 we were like these we will open there 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:36.790
 and here we will bend the interior pretty much 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:45.700
 at half of the fact so pretty much 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:47.129
 like that quite complicated there we try 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.120
 that it is well anyway 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:55.239
 even if it's not perfect it's not 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.970
 serious then we will bend like that you 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.239
 see how this finally has the same 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.720
 this side so we were like that we take 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.720
 inside we take the part 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:24.459
 interior has therefore retracted the small 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:29.560
 tip and see all this looks good to me 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.470
 who gives us this there is now 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.319
 more than any other creations and 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.940
 we have another arrow could 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.599
 then marked the indications that you 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.650
 want now 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.090
 alas to color if it makes me happy 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.019
 I hope you enjoyed this video and I 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.769
 tell you very soon 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.769
 goodbye
