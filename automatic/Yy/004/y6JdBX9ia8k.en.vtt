 we are deviating from the subject and last the 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.270
 first step of your rehabilitation is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.140
 the reason is 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.860
 define the reason 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.710

 for the benefit of my mental health 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.210

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.320
 who will end up seeing this on their own 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.320
