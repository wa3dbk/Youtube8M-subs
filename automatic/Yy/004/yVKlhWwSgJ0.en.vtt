then<00:00:18.600> there<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> iPhone<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> there<00:00:20.460> are

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
then there was the iPhone so there are

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.509 
then there was the iPhone so there are
right<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:21.949> think<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:22.980> any<00:00:23.130> others<00:00:23.369> right

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
right there think of any others right

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.590 
right there think of any others right
now<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:23.910> sure<00:00:23.939> there<00:00:24.269> must<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.510> been

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
now but I'm sure there must have been

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.450 
now but I'm sure there must have been
something<00:00:24.960> between<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.430> you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
something between can you get can you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859 
something between can you get can you
get<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.789> phone<00:00:26.970> app<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.599> toast

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
