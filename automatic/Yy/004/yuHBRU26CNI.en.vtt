motion<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:30.119> helps<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.720> terms<00:01:30.930> of

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
motion and it helps you in terms of

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.230 
motion and it helps you in terms of
reducing<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> cliq<00:01:32.460> amounts<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> really

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
reducing the cliq amounts all you really

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.020 
reducing the cliq amounts all you really
have<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.020> press<00:01:34.740> buttons<00:01:35.220> versus

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
have to do is press buttons versus

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.429 
have to do is press buttons versus
having<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> coordinate<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.200> hand

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
having to coordinate your right hand

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.810 
having to coordinate your right hand
left<00:01:37.650> hand<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.729> your

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
left hand it's all pretty much in your

left hand it's all pretty much in your
life<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.299> being<00:01:42.299> able<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> war<00:01:42.689> jump<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
life you so being able to war jump is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
life you so being able to war jump is
very<00:01:43.170> vital<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.619> i<00:01:43.710> said<00:01:43.920> smart<00:01:44.250> casting<00:01:44.729> is

just want to have my ultimate so I get

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.270 
just want to have my ultimate so I get
this<00:02:24.510> practice<00:02:25.080> these<00:02:25.230> inside<00:02:25.770> combos<00:02:26.130> from

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
this practice these inside combos from

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.800 
this practice these inside combos from
yourself<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.670> actually<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.060> using<00:02:27.330> payments

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
yourself and actually get using payments

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.090 
yourself and actually get using payments
to<00:02:27.930> actually<00:02:28.200> demonstrate<00:02:28.380> what<00:02:28.830> they<00:02:28.860> look

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
to actually demonstrate what they look

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.390 
to actually demonstrate what they look
like<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.940> those<00:02:30.300> are<00:02:30.330> those<00:02:30.570> three<00:02:30.810> things<00:02:31.400> for

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
like so those are those three things for

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.560 
like so those are those three things for
the<00:02:32.460> record<00:02:32.610> when<00:02:32.850> you're<00:02:32.940> practicing<00:02:33.090> them

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
the record when you're practicing them

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.360 
the record when you're practicing them
when<00:02:33.810> each<00:02:33.990> individual<00:02:34.590> concept<00:02:35.130> becomes

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
when each individual concept becomes

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.460 
when each individual concept becomes
easy<00:02:35.610> for<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.240> should<00:02:36.330> try<00:02:36.660> chaining<00:02:37.200> two

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
easy for you you should try chaining two

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.960 
easy for you you should try chaining two
of<00:02:37.620> them<00:02:37.770> together<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.640> should<00:02:38.820> be<00:02:38.850> able

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
of them together so you should be able

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150 
of them together so you should be able
to<00:02:39.180> work<00:02:39.390> jump<00:02:39.690> into<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.990> queue<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.980> should<00:02:41.100> be

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
to work jump into a queue you should be

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160 
to work jump into a queue you should be
able<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.400> ward<00:02:41.640> jump<00:02:41.910> into<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.300> flash<00:02:42.570> initiate

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
able to ward jump into a flash initiate

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.760 
able to ward jump into a flash initiate
and<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.710> should<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:43.890> able<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:46.530> should<00:02:46.560> be

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
and you should be able to you should be

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.550 
and you should be able to you should be
able<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:47.100> q<00:02:47.910> into<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.450> war<00:02:48.720> jump<00:02:48.990> as<00:02:49.140> well<00:02:49.380> like

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
able to q into a war jump as well like

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.930 
able to q into a war jump as well like
if<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.800> need<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.040> queue<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> someone<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.730> close

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
if you need to queue to someone to close

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.300 
if you need to queue to someone to close
distance<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.480> war<00:02:51.660> jump<00:02:51.900> over<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> wall<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:53.100> of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
distance of war jump over a wall just of

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.710 
distance of war jump over a wall just of
being<00:02:53.550> able<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.790> utilize<00:02:54.120> your<00:02:54.300> double<00:02:54.570> gap

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
being able to utilize your double gap

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.480 
being able to utilize your double gap
closers<00:02:55.140> them<00:02:55.350> into<00:02:55.560> super<00:02:55.890> necessary<00:02:56.370> on

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
closers them into super necessary on

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.890 
closers them into super necessary on
race<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.030> once<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.270> practice<00:02:57.420> all<00:02:57.720> those

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
race and so once you practice all those

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.480 
race and so once you practice all those
things<00:02:58.140> practice<00:02:58.860> chanting<00:02:59.190> all<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.370> them

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
things practice chanting all of them

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.710 
things practice chanting all of them
together<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.970> once<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.270> get<00:03:00.420> good<00:03:00.570> at

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
together and once you get good at

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.140 
together and once you get good at
chaining<00:03:01.080> all<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.320> them<00:03:01.440> together<00:03:02.150> you're

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
chaining all of them together you're

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.480 
chaining all of them together you're
ready<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.600> try<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.080> perform<00:03:04.740> some<00:03:05.130> insect

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
ready to try and perform some insect

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.470 
ready to try and perform some insect
eyes<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.940> i'm<00:03:06.090> going<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.300> try<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
eyes and i'm going to try and

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.940 
eyes and i'm going to try and
demonstrate<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.230> couple<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.560> insects

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
demonstrate to you a couple of insects

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.170 
demonstrate to you a couple of insects
place<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.400> could<00:03:08.550> use<00:03:08.730> his<00:03:08.850> recipe

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
place that you could use his recipe

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.460 
place that you could use his recipe
here's<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> example<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.470> an<00:03:10.680> insect<00:03:11.040> play<00:03:15.470> so

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
here's the example of an insect play so

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.370 
here's the example of an insect play so
that's<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> example<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.190> one<00:03:17.340> inside<00:03:17.610> play

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.600 

so<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.410> was<00:03:26.530> another<00:03:26.710> example<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.220> an<00:03:27.370> insect

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
so I was another example of an insect

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.040 
so I was another example of an insect
play<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.000> could<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.540> basically

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
play that you could do I basically

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.900 
play that you could do I basically
kicked<00:03:29.590> over<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.830> wall<00:03:30.070> knowing<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.520> I<00:03:30.550> eat

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
kicked over the wall knowing that I eat

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.880 
kicked over the wall knowing that I eat
I<00:03:31.060> had<00:03:31.240> sight<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.660> him<00:03:31.780> over<00:03:32.020> here<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.740> just

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
I had sight of him over here and I just

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.080 
I had sight of him over here and I just
wore<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.310> kick<00:03:33.490> them<00:03:33.640> into<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.910> team

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
wore it and kick them into the team

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.160 
wore it and kick them into the team
which<00:03:34.240> would<00:03:34.420> have<00:03:34.480> been<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.870> side<00:03:35.080> of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
which would have been on this side of

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.830 
which would have been on this side of
the<00:03:35.290> wall<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.890> is<00:03:36.070> like<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> functionary

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the wall this is like a functionary

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.250 
the wall this is like a functionary
purpose

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.750 

because<00:03:44.260> that's<00:03:44.470> another<00:03:44.680> example<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:45.550> an

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
because that's another example of an

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.940 
because that's another example of an
insect<00:03:46.060> play<00:03:46.270> that<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.510> could<00:03:46.660> pull<00:03:46.840> off

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
insect play that you could pull off

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.320 
insect play that you could pull off
where<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:47.980> junglers<00:03:48.430> near<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.880> wall<00:03:49.030> and

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
where the junglers near the wall and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.210 
where the junglers near the wall and
they're<00:03:49.780> preparing<00:03:50.170> for<00:03:50.260> band<00:03:50.560> or<00:03:50.860> they

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
they're preparing for band or they

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.010 
they're preparing for band or they
actually<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:51.820> sight<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.210> you<00:03:52.330> well<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.840> can

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
actually have sight of you well you can

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.600 
actually have sight of you well you can
actually<00:03:53.170> kick<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.620> jungler<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.190> try<00:03:54.400> and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
actually kick the jungler and try and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:05.190 
actually kick the jungler and try and
get<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.760> feel<00:03:54.910> for<00:03:55.060> unity<00:03:55.540> security<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:05.110> that's

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
get a feel for unity security so that's

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.780 
get a feel for unity security so that's
an<00:04:05.350> example<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.860> an<00:04:05.980> insect<00:04:06.310> clay<00:04:06.490> that<00:04:06.700> you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
an example of an insect clay that you

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.450 
an example of an insect clay that you
would<00:04:06.940> use<00:04:07.180> when<00:04:07.540> you're<00:04:08.530> seeing<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.160> enemy

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
would use when you're seeing the enemy

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.270 
would use when you're seeing the enemy
team<00:04:09.700> under<00:04:10.030> their<00:04:10.180> mid<00:04:10.360> lane<00:04:10.510> turret<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:10.990> you

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
team under their mid lane turret and you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.130 
team under their mid lane turret and you
want<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.430> actually<00:04:12.660> find<00:04:13.660> an<00:04:13.750> opening<00:04:14.020> to

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
want to actually find an opening to

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.570 
want to actually find an opening to
actually<00:04:14.500> initiate<00:04:14.860> lence<00:04:15.040> on<00:04:15.190> them<00:04:15.340> of

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
actually initiate lence on them of

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.949 
actually initiate lence on them of
course<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.030> wouldn't<00:04:16.150> be<00:04:16.270> initiating<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
course you wouldn't be initiating on the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.840 
course you wouldn't be initiating on the
tank<00:04:17.200> which<00:04:17.410> grandmas<00:04:18.010> would<00:04:18.310> be<00:04:18.520> in<00:04:18.700> the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
tank which grandmas would be in the

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.850 
tank which grandmas would be in the
sense<00:04:19.120> but<00:04:19.720> I'm<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.110> would<00:04:20.230> be<00:04:20.350> initiating<00:04:20.739> on

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
sense but I'm you would be initiating on

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.920 
sense but I'm you would be initiating on
the<00:04:20.920> carrier<00:04:21.220> sure<00:04:21.520> just<00:04:22.180> for<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.810> record

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.000 

alright<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:28.990> that's<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.260> example<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.710> inside

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
alright so that's the example the inside

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.460 
alright so that's the example the inside
combo<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.790> would<00:04:30.940> use<00:04:31.320> when<00:04:32.320> you're

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
combo that you would use when you're

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.080 
combo that you would use when you're
just<00:04:33.010> trolling<00:04:33.190> around<00:04:33.370> their<00:04:33.670> base<00:04:33.820> or

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
just trolling around their base or

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.640 
just trolling around their base or
you're<00:04:34.270> actually<00:04:34.420> trying<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.870> find<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.410> point

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you're actually trying to find a point

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.980 
you're actually trying to find a point
of<00:04:35.800> initiation<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.550> mr.<00:04:36.850> its<00:04:37.000> up<00:04:37.150> or<00:04:37.720> when

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
of initiation and mr. its up or when

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.960 
of initiation and mr. its up or when
this<00:04:38.140> turns<00:04:38.350> up<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.830> you're<00:04:39.580> trying<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:39.910> find

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
this turns up and you're trying to find

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.680 
this turns up and you're trying to find
a<00:04:40.090> way<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.240> keep<00:04:40.360> them<00:04:40.510> in<00:04:40.600> DC<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:42.540> it's<00:04:43.540> just

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
a way to keep them in DC and it's just

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.150 
a way to keep them in DC and it's just
it's<00:04:43.750> kind<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.050> a<00:04:44.140> troll<00:04:44.320> initiation<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.980> very

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
it's kind of a troll initiation you very

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.320 
it's kind of a troll initiation you very
seldom<00:04:45.310> ever<00:04:45.460> use<00:04:45.670> this<00:04:45.790> one<00:04:46.000> more<00:04:46.210> or<00:04:46.300> less

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
seldom ever use this one more or less

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.910 
seldom ever use this one more or less
you'd<00:04:46.780> be<00:04:46.900> only<00:04:47.020> using<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.410> ones<00:04:47.560> look<00:04:47.680> around

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
you'd be only using the ones look around

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.650 
you'd be only using the ones look around
dragon<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.550> ones<00:04:49.030> around<00:04:49.120> band<00:04:49.450> and

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
dragon and the ones around band and

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.240 
dragon and the ones around band and
other<00:04:49.750> objectives<00:04:50.320> but<00:04:50.530> if<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:50.950> looking<00:04:51.130> for

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
other objectives but if you looking for

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.070 
other objectives but if you looking for
an<00:04:51.340> all-purpose<00:04:51.670> initiation<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.930> enemy

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
an all-purpose initiation on the enemy

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.870 
an all-purpose initiation on the enemy
base<00:04:53.260> that's<00:04:53.860> definitely<00:04:54.280> really<00:04:54.490> solid<00:04:54.790> if

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
base that's definitely really solid if

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.870 
base that's definitely really solid if
they<00:04:54.970> don't<00:04:55.150> have<00:04:55.240> work<00:04:55.420> ever<00:04:55.660> around<00:04:55.930> here

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
they don't have work ever around here

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.830 
they don't have work ever around here

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
video this video is actually kind of a

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.680 
video this video is actually kind of a
long<00:05:00.610> time<00:05:00.850> in<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.030> making<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.450> took<00:05:01.570> me<00:05:01.660> a

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
long time in the making it took me a

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.090 
long time in the making it took me a
while<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.900> actually<00:05:02.080> get<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.530> in<00:05:02.680> sick<00:05:02.890> place

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
while to actually get this in sick place

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.100 
while to actually get this in sick place
down<00:05:03.340> originally<00:05:04.030> but<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.540> hope<00:05:04.690> they<00:05:04.810> gave<00:05:04.960> you

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
down originally but I hope they gave you

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.960 
down originally but I hope they gave you
guys<00:05:05.260> some<00:05:05.290> ideas<00:05:06.130> as<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.370> where<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.760> could

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
guys some ideas as to where you could

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.370 
guys some ideas as to where you could
initiate<00:05:07.270> with<00:05:07.630> them<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.990> just<00:05:08.020> an<00:05:08.230> example

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
initiate with them and just an example

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.380 
initiate with them and just an example
or<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:08.920> template<00:05:09.430> for<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:09.730> to<00:05:09.850> reference<00:05:10.210> as<00:05:10.360> to

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
or a template for you to reference as to

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.460 
or a template for you to reference as to
how<00:05:10.570> they<00:05:10.750> look<00:05:10.960> so<00:05:11.640> basically<00:05:13.290> insect<00:05:14.290> plays

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
how they look so basically insect plays

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.890 
how they look so basically insect plays
are<00:05:14.620> very<00:05:14.800> impractical<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.670> they<00:05:16.660> really

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
are very impractical and they really

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.940 
are very impractical and they really
should<00:05:17.050> only<00:05:17.170> be<00:05:17.290> used<00:05:17.320> with<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.680> highest

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
should only be used with the highest

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.530 
should only be used with the highest
level<00:05:18.190> of<00:05:18.280> play<00:05:18.490> but<00:05:18.790> if<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.030> release<00:05:19.330> in

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
level of play but if you release in

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.900 
level of play but if you release in
player<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.440> can<00:05:20.470> bit<00:05:20.740> at<00:05:20.830> ease<00:05:21.040> you<00:05:21.670> could

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
player and you can bit at ease you could

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.340 
player and you can bit at ease you could
definitely<00:05:22.090> carry<00:05:22.540> some<00:05:22.720> low<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.990> ELO

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
definitely carry some low the ELO

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.720 
definitely carry some low the ELO
situations<00:05:23.920> you<00:05:24.040> can<00:05:24.190> basically<00:05:24.340> make<00:05:24.580> a

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
situations you can basically make a

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.480 
situations you can basically make a
flash<00:05:25.000> initiation<00:05:25.750> how<00:05:25.990> did<00:05:26.170> anything<00:05:26.490> leeson

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
flash initiation how did anything leeson

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.100 
flash initiation how did anything leeson
definitely<00:05:27.970> has<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.150> highest<00:05:28.570> skill<00:05:28.750> cap<00:05:28.960> in

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
definitely has the highest skill cap in

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.380 
definitely has the highest skill cap in
the<00:05:29.140> game<00:05:29.350> that<00:05:29.530> he's<00:05:29.650> definitely<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.580> here

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
the game that he's definitely be here

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.450 
the game that he's definitely be here
with<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:31.720> most<00:05:31.900> potential<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.560> I<00:05:33.070> really<00:05:33.340> do

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
with the most potential and I really do

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.280 
with the most potential and I really do
think<00:05:33.670> that<00:05:34.140> display<00:05:35.910> nation<00:05:37.050> gives<00:05:38.050> everyone

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
think that display nation gives everyone

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.450 
think that display nation gives everyone
like<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.530> whole<00:05:38.830> new<00:05:39.040> world<00:05:39.220> of<00:05:39.400> possibilities

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
like a whole new world of possibilities

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.160 
like a whole new world of possibilities
in<00:05:40.180> terms<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.540> trying<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.870> learn<00:05:40.990> how<00:05:41.050> to

in terms of trying to learn how to

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.690 
in terms of trying to learn how to
initiate<00:05:41.500> with<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:41.950> I've<00:05:42.280> seen<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.490> lot<00:05:42.550> of
