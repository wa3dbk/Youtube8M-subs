looks it looks quite thick this looks
cool<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.160> think<00:04:14.700> you're<00:04:14.910> honest<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:17.100> this

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
cool I think you're honest this and this

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.390 
cool I think you're honest this and this
lip<00:04:17.549> liner<00:04:17.820> might<00:04:18.090> work<00:04:18.329> together<00:04:18.539> because<00:04:19.400> it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
lip liner might work together because it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.310 
lip liner might work together because it
kind<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.940> complements<00:04:21.659> each<00:04:21.720> other<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.140> not

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
kind of complements each other it's not

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.230 
kind of complements each other it's not
that<00:04:22.530> much<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.890> big<00:04:23.070> difference<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.030> might

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
that much of a big difference so I might

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.270 
that much of a big difference so I might
try<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.539> out<00:04:24.780> for<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.140> guys<00:04:25.349> but<00:04:26.039> it's<00:04:26.190> a

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
try that out for you guys but it's a

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.260 
try that out for you guys but it's a
really<00:04:26.520> gorgeous

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270

other I have a lipstick in this shade

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.200 
other I have a lipstick in this shade
but<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.440> think<00:04:31.770> even<00:04:31.979> to<00:04:32.310> put<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:32.669> on<00:04:32.910> top<00:04:33.150> of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
but I think even to put this on top of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.210 
but I think even to put this on top of
the<00:04:33.419> lipstick<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:33.960> its<00:04:34.110> iron<00:04:34.289> with<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:34.919> little

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
the lipstick on its iron with a little

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.730 
the lipstick on its iron with a little
bit<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.490> X<00:04:35.759> no<00:04:36.000> gloss<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.599> shine<00:04:36.659> look<00:04:37.379> very

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740
