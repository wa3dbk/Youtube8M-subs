00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.510

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.330
 we have since 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.060
 long the second of oneself 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.960
 the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.470
 micro usb that is hidden 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.470
 the device 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.890
 volume 1 jack and of these things between 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.850
 the camera so 5 megapixels 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.630
 legault 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.460
 go there if it's the little flash led this 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.409
 side a little bit round you see here there 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.250
 with these elements required to connect a 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.810
 slightly raised 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.500
 it makes think anyway had to buy 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.569
 it's a kind one x etc and the top 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.069
 speaker here at there 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.180
 look at these beautiful fingerprints 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.749
 we will turn on the screen to make them 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.090
 disappear 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:21.090
 ok so that's what we have here we have 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.599
 we have windows phone 8 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.430
 which looks from what I could see 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.930
 pretty basic ie that as much 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.640
 at nokia we will have some 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.959
 people so some customization 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.129
 does not have customization 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.160
 to have a lot of features in 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.130
 more 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.420
 at samsung is a little bit too 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.810
 let go huawei I have the impression that there is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.459
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.170
 suddenly offered a very fast turn because 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.739
 that we have already tested determination of 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.599
 eight care 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.720
 what will be interesting is to test 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.770
 to see the features 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.690
 especially the performances 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.600
 for rest supported of course that change 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.860
 the size of a tile 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.350
 but that's it I think we can in 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.940
 add on the kit this corner that the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.860
 children's area I know that's called 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.480
 the area where they are children the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.510
 world of information 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.370
 to protect this information is 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.030
 reserved an area for his children or 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.190
 other people 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.069
 all applications and if not 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.440
 what is the calendar 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.940
 here 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.420
 I will show the camera all to 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.569
 time but I'm going 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.569
 black 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.069
 it is 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.069
 4 megapixel 4 megapixel single 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.450
 here are some 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.629
 netissime there is not much of 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.629
 him 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.380
 that's about all we can say 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.850
 awaits 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.010
 the contact import so that's 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.300
 more features besides it's not going 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.400
 to walk here I saw that in the specs 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.130
 is written that it is compatible which 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.030
 allows you to import contacts from 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.810
 android terminals via bluetooth 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.209
 I do not know if it's something 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.530
 of exclusive huawei maubon so here you are 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.540

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.540
 switch from android to w 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.540

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.620
 ok there we have everything that is music 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.150
 there is nothing at all 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.790
 you have access to all 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.379
 features against on windows phone 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.410

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.070
 multitasking coming out of here one or two 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.690

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.840
 features or not any case it's a 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.040
 device that in my opinion will not be sold 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.110
 dearly who is available in 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.930
