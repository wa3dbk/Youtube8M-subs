00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.330
 carlos filipe camelo noche 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 and so people, beauty so fluid number not 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.619
 read and in today's video I watch the video 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.619
 There are five books I would 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 gift to someone because you believe in the book 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.880
 always a good gift request 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 especially for those who like to receive 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 books and for those who like to read logically 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.980
 even more in this time that is coming 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.320
 the Christmas 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.230
 sometimes if there are complicating 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.809
 complicated sometimes it gets difficult for you 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
 hit the like who you want to give 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.920
 present mainly when it comes to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.140
 of books so I selected five 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.450
 books I would give away without 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.610
 problem and depending on the taste of the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.340
 person of course the first book is good 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 would be a book by a national author 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.980
 author who really surprised me a lot 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.780
 that raphael draccon author of the series 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.520
 of jetta dragons books is more 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.039
 specifically this is the first 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.920
 book of the series witches hunters 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.670
 this book that he does a re-reading of the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.970
 fairy tales of our childhood, what 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 It's very cool but it brings a lot of tone. 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.990
 interesting these fairy tales of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.119
 a slower more adult form the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 adult so I knew how to merge 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.950
 very well that even quoted from writing 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.560
 Because he made me like him. 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.390
 very much the first book in the series I 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
 I did not read the others but I'm sure 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.100
 that they are as good as the first 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.409
 even more so because this is the version 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.970
 old I even commented on the video I made 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.310
 about him I did not like that much 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.040
 but the new editions released by 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.049
 publisher then read a very fucking cover 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.930
 much mass even tried by the same 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.630
 artist making the covers who french there 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.970
 that make the covers of the series the chronicles 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.290
 of ice and fire then ends up being a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.200
 very interesting book mainly 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.320
 for those who like the fantasy genre and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.320
 Juvenile but including adults 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.229
 good and they will like it a lot, get medical 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.130
 water jetter hunters process 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.909
 witches 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.909
 the second book 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.459
 The second book on my list is the book 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.520
 for people who are curious and want 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.580
 know everything about the world and why the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.459
 things because they happen in the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.070
 The way that happens is the short book. 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.230
 story of almost everything from the author bill 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.600
 bryson this book he tries 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.730
 really tell the story of almost 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.150
 everything but mainly as the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.819
 scientists have arrived at these findings 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.520
 as whatever scientists la danse 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.790
 long ago discovered 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.140
 the size of land at distance from land 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.720
 with the moon 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.690
 I do not know what is formed the core of 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.220
 land as the species emerged as 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.959
 species will evolve 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.650
 This kind of thing is very interesting. 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.050
 because it shows all the backstage 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.390
 scientific discoveries by the vision of a 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.190
 a journalist who studied hard for 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.290
 write this book you interviewed 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.150
 several scientists then the suggestion 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.760
 quite interesting mainly 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.090
 for those who are curious or 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.110
 They live there in the academic world and I do not know 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.430
 want to become scientists in the future. 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.500
 especially for college students, he is 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.070
 a great alternative for 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.720
 studying and having fun and 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.070
 at the same time because the narrative is 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.049
 very exciting 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.030
 very funny sometimes with the 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.549
 that happens between the 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 scientists is a good story then 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.540
 cool brief history of almost everything from 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.519
 actor bill bryson brazil october 21 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.680
 Brazil is my third tip is a 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.709
 a little better known than the book 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.840
 point of impact of actor dan brown a 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.060
 who the lycee with help 21 is the symbol 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.269
 lost no hell the last 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.280
 his book because I personally liked it 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.470
 much of this book that he was one of the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.260
 first books in the early 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.799
 best sellers written by dan brown and 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.299
 he has a really nice tone and talks about 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.340
 government conspiracies which is a 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.530
 thing that I really like about a 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.620
 possible life 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.840
 the girl here on earth so I think well 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.239
 interesting even more native protocol 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.630
 of the champion who is always very fast 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.320
 and gives a lot of desire to read and not stop 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.750
 more 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.520
 impact point for those 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.150
 people who enjoy more than one reading 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.310
 south started with nothing much 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.280
 deep just a plot holding 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.030
 to the end and with this point of 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.250
 impact 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.800
 dan brown the fourth book he follows more 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.310
 or less style of the point of 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.710
 impact of the bronx you read from the beginning to the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.600
 end without wanting to stop for a minute without 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.750
 want to stop to breathe even though 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.240
 the book states from johnny chan 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.010
 this book was really cool even 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.810
 There is a bug today. 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.910
 He is a very famous author. 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.880
 especially in the United States 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.450
 some of his books have movies have 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.260
 effects bombs of the 90s more 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.200
 or less 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.130
 including the book states that it has a 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.540
 movie starring the km get away the name 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.000
 tone with a cult brad pitt there is not 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.250
 starring Tom Cruise who did 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.290
 very successful in the 90's 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.770
 unlike the book by dan brown 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.830
 political conspiracy involving some 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.410
 science fiction itself here a tri 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.090
 law as if it were a police officer he tells 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.190

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.979

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.550
 desire to devour the book in a few 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.160
 days 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.890
 so if you know someone who likes 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.160

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.590
 law thematic area claims is 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.630
 a great suspense thriller will be 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.780
 present and last book is a book
