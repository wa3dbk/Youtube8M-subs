played the first two games and I loved
them<00:00:42.100> but<00:00:42.460> they<00:00:42.579> are<00:00:42.610> definitely<00:00:43.030> not<00:00:43.210> a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
them but they are definitely not a

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.420 
them but they are definitely not a
prerequisite<00:00:44.050> for<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.290> third<00:00:44.470> one<00:00:44.649> in<00:00:44.829> fact

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
prerequisite for the third one in fact

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.010 
prerequisite for the third one in fact
the<00:00:45.579> only<00:00:45.730> thing<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.090> Max's<00:00:46.480> character<00:00:46.840> has

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
really carried over from the previous

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.940 
really carried over from the previous
games<00:00:48.970> are<00:00:49.270> his<00:00:49.600> drinking<00:00:50.020> problem<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.649> his

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
games are his drinking problem and his

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.610 
games are his drinking problem and his
drug<00:00:51.340> addiction<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.170> story<00:00:53.410> basically

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
drug addiction so the story basically

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.680

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:49.949 
docks some graveyards there are even
levels<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.609> there<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.880> give<00:01:49.060> nobs<00:01:49.389> two

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
levels in there that give nobs two

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.569 
levels in there that give nobs two
levels<00:01:50.289> from<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.560> original<00:01:50.979> Max<00:01:51.189> Payne<00:01:51.399> that

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
levels from the original Max Payne that

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.129 
levels from the original Max Payne that
you<00:01:51.669> can<00:01:51.789> see<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:51.969> clear<00:01:52.299> reconstruction<00:01:53.049> of

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
you can see a clear reconstruction of

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.830 
you can see a clear reconstruction of
the<00:01:53.259> level<00:01:53.499> which<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.740> very<00:01:53.979> cool

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the level which is very cool

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.449 
the level which is very cool
presentation-wise<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:56.499> is<00:01:56.799> pretty<00:01:57.310> much

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
presentation-wise that is pretty much

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.489 
presentation-wise that is pretty much
what<00:01:57.520> Rockstar<00:01:58.240> does<00:01:58.450> best<00:01:58.749> in<00:01:58.929> games<00:01:59.139> and

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
what Rockstar does best in games and

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.139 
what Rockstar does best in games and
this<00:01:59.679> is<00:01:59.829> no<00:01:59.950> different<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.609> set<00:02:00.880> up<00:02:00.969> a<00:02:01.029> lot

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
this is no different it set up a lot

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.539 
this is no different it set up a lot
like<00:02:01.389> a<00:02:01.419> movie<00:02:01.869> or<00:02:02.169> rather<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.709> mix<00:02:03.039> between<00:02:03.279> a

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
like a movie or rather a mix between a

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.940 
like a movie or rather a mix between a
movie<00:02:04.029> and<00:02:04.239> a<00:02:04.389> comic<00:02:04.779> book<00:02:04.810> which<00:02:05.529> is<00:02:05.649> similar

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
movie and a comic book which is similar

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.010 
movie and a comic book which is similar
to<00:02:06.009> what<00:02:06.159> I<00:02:06.310> imagined<00:02:06.849> Remedy<00:02:07.239> had<00:02:07.419> envisioned

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
to what I imagined Remedy had envisioned

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.749 
to what I imagined Remedy had envisioned
in<00:02:08.200> their<00:02:08.349> heads<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:08.800> they<00:02:08.950> created<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.580> Max

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
in their heads when they created the Max

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.250 
in their heads when they created the Max
Payne<00:02:09.970> series<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.509> think<00:02:10.720> Rockstar<00:02:11.110> has

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
Payne series and I think Rockstar has

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.500 
Payne series and I think Rockstar has
done<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.890> really<00:02:12.340> good<00:02:12.580> job<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.850> recreating

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
done a really good job of recreating

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.200 
done a really good job of recreating
that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
that

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.370 
that
they've<00:02:14.510> made<00:02:14.660> completely<00:02:15.080> seamless

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
they've made completely seamless

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.530 
they've made completely seamless
transitions<00:02:16.070> between<00:02:16.280> cutscenes<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
transitions between cutscenes and the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.420 
transitions between cutscenes and the
action<00:02:17.870> sequences<00:02:18.440> which<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.070> really<00:02:19.310> good

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
action sequences which do a really good

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.100 
action sequences which do a really good
job<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.730> blending<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.330> story<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:20.960> still

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
job of blending the story but still

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.840 
job of blending the story but still
keeping<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.770> inside<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.340> action<00:02:22.700> rather

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
keeping you inside of the action rather

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.370 
keeping you inside of the action rather
than<00:02:23.060> feeling<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.600> you're<00:02:23.780> viewing<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.200> from

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
than feeling like you're viewing it from

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.380 
than feeling like you're viewing it from
the<00:02:24.470> outside

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
the outside

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.420 
the outside
gameplay<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.750> fantastic<00:02:27.410> what<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.280> say

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
gameplay is fantastic what can I say

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.770 
gameplay is fantastic what can I say
about<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.820> whole<00:02:28.940> game<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.330> pretty<00:02:29.570> much

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
about it the whole game is pretty much

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.290 
about it the whole game is pretty much
pure<00:02:30.350> action<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.070> an<00:02:31.190> action<00:02:31.580> movie<00:02:31.790> it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
pure action it's like an action movie it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.880 
pure action it's like an action movie it
varies<00:02:32.570> between<00:02:32.720> cover<00:02:33.140> based<00:02:33.350> shooting<00:02:33.710> and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
varies between cover based shooting and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.470 
varies between cover based shooting and
short<00:02:34.280> sequences<00:02:34.850> where<00:02:35.060> they<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.300> you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
short sequences where they have you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.180 
short sequences where they have you
doing<00:02:35.690> things<00:02:35.930> like<00:02:36.050> sniping<00:02:36.740> from<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.040> top

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
doing things like sniping from the top

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.220 
doing things like sniping from the top
of<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> stadium<00:02:37.610> or<00:02:38.060> shooting<00:02:38.510> people<00:02:38.750> on<00:02:39.200> a

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
of the stadium or shooting people on a

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.980 
of the stadium or shooting people on a
moving<00:02:39.770> boat<00:02:40.100> both<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.090> combat<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
moving boat both the combat and the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.900 
moving boat both the combat and the
implementation<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.860> bullet<00:02:43.130> time<00:02:43.310> feel<00:02:43.640> great

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
implementation of bullet time feel great

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.970 
implementation of bullet time feel great
and<00:02:44.090> they've<00:02:44.240> got<00:02:44.450> free<00:02:44.780> aim<00:02:45.020> or<00:02:45.290> softlock

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
and they've got free aim or softlock

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.820 
and they've got free aim or softlock
options<00:02:46.460> in<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.730> menu<00:02:46.880> if<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.300> prefer<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.320> use

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
options in the menu if you prefer to use

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.040 
options in the menu if you prefer to use
those<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.180> definitely<00:02:50.180> use<00:02:50.270> softlock<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.930> my

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
those I definitely use softlock in my

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.570 
those I definitely use softlock in my
playthrough<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.710> lot<00:02:51.890> easier<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:52.370> free

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
playthrough it's a lot easier but free

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.850 
playthrough it's a lot easier but free
aim<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.970> very<00:02:53.210> fun<00:02:53.420> also<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.650> course

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
aim is very fun also and of course

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.080 
aim is very fun also and of course
they've<00:02:54.980> got<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.220> bullet<00:02:55.550> cam<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.940> there

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
they've got the bullet cam in there

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.000 
they've got the bullet cam in there
which<00:02:56.270> adds<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.660> healthy<00:02:57.080> dose<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.440> gore<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
which adds a healthy dose of gore to the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.980 
which adds a healthy dose of gore to the
game<00:02:58.220> my<00:02:58.790> only<00:02:58.970> niggling<00:02:59.390> complaint<00:02:59.810> with<00:02:59.930> the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
game my only niggling complaint with the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.600 
game my only niggling complaint with the
gameplay<00:03:00.290> was<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.800> felt<00:03:01.100> like<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> vet

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
gameplay was that I felt like the vet

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.520 
gameplay was that I felt like the vet
lack<00:03:01.820> of<00:03:02.030> variation<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.050> enemy<00:03:03.380> AI

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
lack of variation and the enemy AI

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.680 
lack of variation and the enemy AI
caused<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.460> shooting<00:03:04.790> sequences<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.510> get<00:03:05.660> a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
caused the shooting sequences to get a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.570 
caused the shooting sequences to get a
little<00:03:05.990> stale<00:03:06.530> near<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.100> end<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.430> game

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
little stale near the end of the game

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.580 
little stale near the end of the game
towards<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> last<00:03:08.690> two<00:03:08.900> or<00:03:08.930> three<00:03:09.050> hours<00:03:09.410> it

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
towards the last two or three hours it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.810 
towards the last two or three hours it
started<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.040> seem<00:03:10.160> like<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.430> lot<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
started to seem like a lot of the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.670 
started to seem like a lot of the
previous<00:03:11.210> action<00:03:11.480> scenes<00:03:11.960> were<00:03:12.260> basically

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
previous action scenes were basically

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.310 
previous action scenes were basically
just<00:03:12.800> reskin<00:03:13.520> dand<00:03:13.790> repackaged<00:03:14.360> for<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:15.110> sake

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
just reskin dand repackaged for the sake

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.710 
just reskin dand repackaged for the sake
of<00:03:15.350> completing<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.160> story<00:03:16.460> it<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.480> little

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
of completing the story it is a little

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.730

well and implemented and something that
