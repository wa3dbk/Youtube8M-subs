to<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.770> something<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.600> lot<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.780> sports

drinks<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.530> between<00:02:21.970> normally<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.060> believe

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510

proof<00:02:23.810> may<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:25.690> long<00:02:26.690> match<00:02:26.990> yeah<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.440> think

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
proof may be a long match yeah I think

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.300 
proof may be a long match yeah I think
