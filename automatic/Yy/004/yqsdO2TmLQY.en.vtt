it<00:01:59.850> directly<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.420> graphics<00:02:00.750> card<00:02:00.810> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it directly over your graphics card so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.190 
it directly over your graphics card so
quite<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.939> biggest<00:02:04.729> fan<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
quite like that the biggest fan in the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.140 
quite like that the biggest fan in the
case<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.459> down<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.700> which<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
case is this one down here which is the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.410 
case is this one down here which is the
230<00:02:12.150> min

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
230 min

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.620 
230 min
yeah<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> cover<00:02:14.580> most<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.030> these<00:02:15.150> fans

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
yeah that as a cover most of these fans

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.750 
yeah that as a cover most of these fans
have<00:02:15.870> alpha<00:02:16.590> F<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.950> wasn't<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.250> quite<00:02:17.430> easy<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
have alpha F it wasn't a quite easy to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.540 
have alpha F it wasn't a quite easy to
access<00:02:18.690> i'll<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.200> take<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.250> off<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.489> you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
access i'll just take that off for you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.949 
access i'll just take that off for you
so<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.819> an<00:02:20.910> idea<00:02:23.270> basically<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.930> just

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
so you get an idea basically it just

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.070 
so you get an idea basically it just
flips<00:02:25.470> out<00:02:25.709> from<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> bottom<00:02:26.959> what<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
flips out from the bottom what so and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.150 
flips out from the bottom what so and
basically<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.260> there's<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.500> mesh<00:02:31.680> an<00:02:32.010> air

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
basically and there's a mesh an air

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.199 
basically and there's a mesh an air
filter<00:02:32.340> match<00:02:32.610> there's<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.569> huge<00:02:33.810> fan<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
filter match there's a huge fan and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.320 
filter match there's a huge fan and
basically<00:02:36.470> two<00:02:37.470> tabs<00:02:37.739> at<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:37.980> top<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:39.120> click

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
basically two tabs at the top just click

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.360 
basically two tabs at the top just click
that<00:02:39.360> back<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.970> clips<00:02:41.970> back<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.300> simple<00:02:42.690> Sam

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
that back up in clips back on simple Sam

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.150 
that back up in clips back on simple Sam
these<00:02:44.370> droid<00:02:44.640> x<00:02:44.790> drive<00:02:45.239> bays<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.950> basically

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
these droid x drive bays it basically

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.800 
these droid x drive bays it basically
like<00:02:47.580> any<00:02:47.760> other<00:02:47.940> women<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.360> grab<00:02:48.660> the

reset button so pretty basic buns and
little<00:03:40.109> novel<00:03:40.380> thing<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.650> don't<00:03:40.739> normally

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
little novel thing you don't normally

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.819 
little novel thing you don't normally
see<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:43.130> shroud<00:03:44.130> on<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.400> top<00:03:44.690> basically

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
see is the shroud on the top basically

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.569 
see is the shroud on the top basically
because<00:03:46.829> that's<00:03:46.980> horizontal<00:03:47.670> things<00:03:48.390> can

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
because that's horizontal things can

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.180 
because that's horizontal things can
touch<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.989> for<00:03:51.989> example<00:03:52.350> my<00:03:52.470> cats<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.010> amount

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
touch it for example my cats the amount

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.330 
touch it for example my cats the amount
of<00:03:53.220> times<00:03:53.430> my<00:03:53.609> cats<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.090> my<00:03:54.450> other<00:03:55.160> case<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
of times my cats is my other case the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.039 
of times my cats is my other case the
cash<00:03:56.519> used<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.850> walk<00:03:56.970> along<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.569> turn<00:03:57.840> off

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
cash used to walk along and turn off

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.170 
cash used to walk along and turn off
them<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.590> handful<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.980> times<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.340> done<00:03:59.489> man<00:03:59.609> so

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
them a handful of times it done man so

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.520 
them a handful of times it done man so
basically<00:04:00.540> you've<00:04:00.750> got<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> little<00:04:01.049> shred<00:04:01.350> that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
basically you've got a little shred that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.500 
basically you've got a little shred that
just<00:04:01.709> covers<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.130> it's<00:04:02.850> very<00:04:03.060> simple<00:04:03.329> and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
just covers that it's very simple and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.840 
just covers that it's very simple and
effective<00:04:04.220> but<00:04:05.220> they're<00:04:05.430> nice<00:04:05.579> little

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
effective but they're nice little

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.849 
effective but they're nice little
touches<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.540> close<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:06.989> up<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:09.500> rise<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.799> so

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859
