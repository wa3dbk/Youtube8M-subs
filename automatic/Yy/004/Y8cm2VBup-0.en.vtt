00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 the staff today i'm in the center 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.680
 university of fei that here in são 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.240
 bernardo do campo 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.130
 one of the most famous colleges of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.389
 Engineering from Brazil today I'll talk 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.050
 with the guys who play soccer with 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.130
 theft 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:19.320
 the same football as the robot as the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 Professor flávio is he is coordinator 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 project is to encourage the idea of ​​capital 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.830
 It's both good, we started selling. 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 the international rocamp competitions 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 and we decided to set up a team of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 students at the fair have already begun to 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 design the electronic part 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 mechanical part of programming as a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.110
 extra class activity 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.370
 we got carried away and it was 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.989
 building more and more robots 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.300
 interesting and today we have a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.680
 successful team and both in 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.680
 national and international levels 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.560
 is there any similarity between football 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.710
 and football there are enough 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.570
 similarities the game was based on the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
 Of course football, we have 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.770
 rules a little simpler because 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.510
 still has a development but still the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.489
 base has to do goal has to 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.060
 defender has the goalkeeper has an attacker 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.310
 in tribes have encounter coverage is who 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 goal from outside the goal area that way 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:21.660
 then the maximum week if possible with a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 football that someday is that the robots 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.140
 can play with humans 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.210
 we have been evolving a lot in the area 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 robot and the target for 2050 robots 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.540
 play with humans, right? 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.540
 and then we'll see what's going to happen 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.500
 what you find easier to command the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.360
 robots to landis 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.520
 For sure the robots give you a 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.380
 specific order they do exactly 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.270
 what we told you to do 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.030
 students always have that stubbornness 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 that one that Brazilian ginga that the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:02.090
 robots do not yet have a pic least 70 days 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.830
 for the world cup here in Brazil but 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.720
 for that personal focus is another are 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.760
 connected in the robocup world cup of 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.790
 robotics that will feel the staff here 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.710
 in Brazil from July 19 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.260
 Robocup Largest Robotics Event 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.180
 various categories 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.190
 autonomous robots means that they do not 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.170
 has human controlling the robot does not 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.690
 has both robot football and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 rescue has robots for assistance 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.740
 indoors as games are 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.750
 disputed 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.730
 we put six robots for each tub 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.209
 a field field is six meters by 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.430
 four of them can not hit the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.959
 goalkeeper if you hit the ball it's foul it's everything 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.080
 controlled by the computer 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.910
 then the judge gives the beginning of the game and each 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.770
 robot is already going to his position there will give 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.770
 kick off and start the game 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.600
 already had a robot that already stopped 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.330
 work half of the share we already had 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.870
 some in a few years so sometimes 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.840
 happens an unforeseen break in the wheel or 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.460
 burn some component and what people 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.250
 have to make the robot change faster 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.620
 possible we waste time take away the robot 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:24.920
 of the field places the substitute and continues 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:26.660
 the game is what works this 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.750
 program is the following is that our 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.610
 interface is not where we train 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.170
 we see what is happening in the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.690
 field that we already the basic commands 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.209
 to him that ball came out that was good that 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.590
 was not a goal and plans to continue playing and 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.270
 He's going to do it all by himself. 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.660
 It's the one that hangs on the good ceiling. 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.640
 There are neon cameras that we use to 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.010
 detect one of each color shot robot 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.230
 it has a meaning together 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.590
 they say which team is the robot and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.660
 What's google 's number is you but? 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.780
 make soccer command robots 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.269
 Look although I play badly It's much more 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 easy to play football than we program 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.709
 robots to play for sure 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.220
 can you promise a guy looks the first 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.570
 time we play at home we 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.580
 here that the robots are not 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.200
 influenced by the crowd but thought 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.090
 if you have a good crowd and the two 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.130
 started to get carried away with this energy 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.990
 positive of the fans we can not 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.630
 reach the final at least and who knows 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.630
 surprise there with the violent impact 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.100
 that they do well with the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.720
 the robberies we already know 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.190
 now I want to see what they send 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.870
 with the ball let's see if they know how to do 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.870
 a little something like that 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.900
 Theophilus Rodolfo 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:03.050
 from here I go because the robots can 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.580
 play and all this the personal collection 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.580
 I always have a university today
