00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 as to the simple and delicious salt 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.350
 second dish to prepare the tenderloin 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.690
 Salt 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.840
 We need a piece of pork tenderloin 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.780
 of 800 grams a jet of oil of 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 olive black pepper to taste a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.369
 essence of thyme and rosemary 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.150
 white hen 2 kilos of coarse salt 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.760
 marina and 50 milliliters of cognac with a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.519
 sharp knife we â€‹â€‹make incisions 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.980
 in the outer part of the meat we take 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.200
 only the skin or fat and we extract them 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 re following the surface of the spine with 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.470
 the knife with care to leave the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.320
 intact meat 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.890
 We put to heat a strong fire 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.140
 large pan with olive oil 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.470
 we browned the tenderloin taco for all 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.930
 sides and season with pepper 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.760
 donate what we intend to teach the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.470
 piece and keep it inside 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.320
 all your juices for later 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.150
 cooking so it is important that we 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.500
 let's make sure we brown all the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.500
 sides of the piece equally 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.380
 then we put on top the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.320
 essence of thyme and rosemary 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.020
 white hen to give us flavor 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.990
 to the plate and when it has melted we 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.950
 we reserve 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.470
 We preheat the oven to 250 degrees in 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.080
 up and down mode and with the fan 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.540
 activated 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.730
 we have a layer of salt on a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.430
 tray suitable for the oven and for serving 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.700
 on the table we place the loin taco 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.560
 above and can cover salt 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 add a few drops of water on top of the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 salt to make it generate a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.120
 crust that allows the perfect cooking 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120
 of the flesh 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.720
 We cooked the loin in the oven for 20 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.970
 minutes 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.340
 when it is ready we serve it in the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.950
 same oven tray when you reach the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.430
 table we plan the salt with the cognac and what 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.900
 We light with a kitchen torch 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.390
 usually plan to achieve a 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.070
 spectacular presentation at the table and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.399
 also to burn the content of 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.320
 alcohol of a dish then we break the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.800
 salt with the help of a pestle 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.600
 or with the handle of a thick knife 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.820
 we change the container meat and the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.340
 We cut into thin sheets for each 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.340
 diner and ready to eat
