volumes that a tuba can convey and in

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
volumes that a tuba can convey and in
many<00:01:27.180> ways<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.320> sort<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.890> mentioned

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
many ways as I think I sort of mentioned

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.480 
many ways as I think I sort of mentioned
earlier<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.110> playing<00:01:31.470> softly<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.369> in

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
earlier on was that playing softly is in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
earlier on was that playing softly is in
a<00:01:32.520> lot<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> ways<00:01:33.030> more<00:01:33.390> difficult<00:01:33.930> than

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
a lot of ways more difficult than

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.929 
a lot of ways more difficult than
playing<00:01:34.380> loud<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> big

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
playing loud because this is a big

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.719 
playing loud because this is a big
instrument<00:01:36.540> playing<00:01:37.110> delicately<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:38.579> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
instrument playing delicately what you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
instrument playing delicately what you
want<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.329> sure<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.840> play<00:01:40.049> softly

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
want to just make sure to play softly

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
want to just make sure to play softly
that<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.159> keep<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.610> Airstream<00:01:42.240> going

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that you keep your Airstream going

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.050 
that you keep your Airstream going
because<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.009> said<00:01:44.070> also<00:01:44.399> before<00:01:44.790> some

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
because as I said also before some

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.460 
because as I said also before some
people<00:01:45.240> might<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.810> well<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> don't<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
people might think well I don't have to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.080 
people might think well I don't have to
play<00:01:46.680> too<00:01:46.740> loud<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.430> don't<00:01:47.610> need<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> breathe

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
play too loud so I don't need to breathe

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.420 
play too loud so I don't need to breathe
that<00:01:48.360> much<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.140> flatly<00:01:49.560> wrong<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that much that's just flatly wrong you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.639 
that much that's just flatly wrong you
need<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:50.970> air<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.869> support<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
need your air for support so the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.520 
need your air for support so the
stronger<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.060> feel<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.479> diaphragm<00:01:54.869> taking

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
stronger you feel your diaphragm taking

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.289 
stronger you feel your diaphragm taking
in<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> air<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.610> pressure<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
in that air and the more pressure and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.260 
in that air and the more pressure and
the<00:01:58.020> better<00:01:58.290> air<00:01:58.530> stream<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.549> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the better air stream you got going the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910 
the better air stream you got going the
better<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.020> play<00:02:01.200> soft<00:02:01.590> stuff

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
better you're going to play soft stuff

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
better you're going to play soft stuff
and<00:02:02.130> still<00:02:02.399> keep<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.909> nice<00:02:03.180> big<00:02:03.810> round<00:02:04.170> sound

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and still keep that nice big round sound

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.399
