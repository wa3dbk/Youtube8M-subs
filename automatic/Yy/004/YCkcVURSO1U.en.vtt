it off even water around this this is
one<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> best<00:02:01.979> parts<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.390> basement

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
one of the best parts of this basement

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.679 
one of the best parts of this basement
as<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.380> could<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.709> here<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:06.000> hole<00:02:06.239> is<00:02:06.450> not

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
as you could see here this hole is not

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.650 
as you could see here this hole is not
filled<00:02:06.959> with<00:02:07.020> water<00:02:09.619> but<00:02:10.619> yet<00:02:10.829> the<00:02:11.069> line<00:02:11.660> all

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
filled with water but yet the line all

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.130 
filled with water but yet the line all
around<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.140> perimeter<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.540> channel<00:02:15.959> is

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
around the perimeter the channel is

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.619 
around the perimeter the channel is
clogged<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:16.890> filled<00:02:18.620> keep<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.890> around<00:02:20.010> here

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
clogged or filled keep going around here

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.979 
clogged or filled keep going around here
this<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> best<00:02:22.140> work<00:02:22.379> ever

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
this is the best work ever

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.590 
this is the best work ever
as<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.170> could<00:02:25.319> see<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.420> corrugated<00:02:27.420> tubing

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
as you could see the corrugated tubing

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.190 
as you could see the corrugated tubing
is<00:02:30.600> not<00:02:31.970> submersed<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.720> way<00:02:33.810> it's<00:02:33.959> supposed

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
is not submersed the way it's supposed

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.840 
is not submersed the way it's supposed
to<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.560> not<00:02:34.620> channeling<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> water<00:02:35.489> over

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
to be it's not channeling the water over

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.710 
to be it's not channeling the water over
so<00:02:36.090> as<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.299> step<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.870> here<00:02:37.079> you<00:02:37.889> can<00:02:37.950> see<00:02:38.250> that

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
so as I step on it here you can see that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.729 
so as I step on it here you can see that
there's<00:02:39.720> water<00:02:39.959> all<00:02:40.079> around<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.530> perimeter

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
there's water all around the perimeter

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.000 
there's water all around the perimeter
of<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.160> drain<00:02:41.430> system<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.380> it's<00:02:43.560> nothing
