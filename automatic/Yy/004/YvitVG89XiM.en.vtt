 depending on its natural we are on 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.050
 Tribut well and beautiful ult who

 morph rife great hero that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.550
 concerns linga then she still has to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 play methods I already talked about this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 Nuke initiation lower armor good 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.840
 aujeski bow exhale some bald me 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 even very good vodka if it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.539
 there was some kind of circular eu e yes how 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 it was arranged was help not well 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.840
 less and I'm straight 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.820
 kicks are pretty good too i have 2 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.860
 Skill just his very strange I wrote well 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.540
 and wenge is a very good third skill 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.390
 Respectively damage is always useful. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 therefore rollers depended on people and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 completely what is a hero in principle 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.450
 equal and it all depends on skill 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 play one character or another usually 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.380
 guys who play updates all the same 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.970
 more still better to play new items 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 than on morphine marfa many are lost 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.540
 begin to collect and tyrell dagon that in 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.189
 methods are basically a mistake so what 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.750
 passed it is very expensive to collect 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.490
 from facts to team first 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.770
 should be going to meet the ends of the reels 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.130
 some kind and then ears dogon yes this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.600
 the fire 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 methods one of the most useless 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.770
 artifacts that is if i played for 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.180
 marfa I certainly fell for you probably in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.579
 power was boiled in the cult of the radik given 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.149
 money again this is not so fast possible 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.430
 to wet 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.040
 general experience and the Crimea data on 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.590
 two years already almost experience can 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.009
 say that the best artifacts in this 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.049
 this is probably midas stacks and something 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.240
 team yes well and again radik but it 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.280
 torus to speak in the case of a smartphone can 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.109
 dump radik and at the expense of strength just yes 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.090
 actually almost all their agility 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.530
 drank rest to the force and just for 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.120
 bills that strong living mmorpg 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.790
 blade mail anti-rating principle can 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.349
 drink rollers here but in this rollers wenge 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.060
 bend and very much communication 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.090
 very beginning began to dominate 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.799
 bingley of course insulators flew into 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.890
 Some like it collected very successful 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.750
 worked and so the score of the day 43 benefit march 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.370
 of basically equal forces therefore us 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.049
 just luckier guys who 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.370
 played the market thanks for watching 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.370
