00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
SIM card in case we ever want to use the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.809 
SIM card in case we ever want to use the
e71<00:02:21.650> again<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:24.920> we've<00:02:25.280> cut<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
e71 again so now that we've cut the

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.030 
e71 again so now that we've cut the
micro<00:02:26.120> sim<00:02:26.360> let's<00:02:26.780> put<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.410> micro<00:02:27.769> SIM

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
micro sim let's put it in the micro SIM

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
micro sim let's put it in the micro SIM
card<00:02:28.310> slot<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.000> we'll<00:02:29.660> insert<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.260> into<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
card slot and we'll insert it into the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:44.940 
card slot and we'll insert it into the
iPhone<00:02:30.799> 4<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:34.120> voila<00:02:35.500> give<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.709> few<00:02:36.920> more

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.290 

so<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.220> we've<00:02:46.520> cut<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> micro-sim

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
so now that we've cut the micro-sim

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.140 
so now that we've cut the micro-sim
let's<00:02:48.110> place<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> Micro<00:02:49.670> SIM<00:02:49.700> card

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
let's place it in the Micro SIM card

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.140 
let's place it in the Micro SIM card
slot<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.750> we'll<00:02:51.140> insert<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> into<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.010> iPhone

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
slot and we'll insert it into the iPhone

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.910 
slot and we'll insert it into the iPhone
and<00:02:54.550> voila<00:02:55.550> now<00:02:56.420> your<00:02:56.900> iPhone<00:02:57.319> will<00:02:57.560> be<00:02:57.680> able
