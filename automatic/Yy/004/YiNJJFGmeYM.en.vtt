00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.240
 I do not know how to do it myself 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.060
 the whole thing really looks like now 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.890
 I've just got the computer design 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170

 pay for it and so on 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.960
 but I do not know how it is expressed 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.610
 looks like and that 's what I'm on right now 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.380
 I'm really curious about that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 just live with you now 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.390
 These pack here once in a single 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.820
 the packaging is very good so here 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.110
 can bend a little bit or otherwise 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.970
 turned down so very good 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.399
 already packed at the place 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.629
 ever 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:25.900
 An absolute low, I just do it 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:27.519
 Let 's see it's there and it looks like 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.079
 at first glance practice still 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.909
 foil wrapped axis from the earlier 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.579
 quickly out so cool 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.519
 So the colors are really like me 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.150
 she introduced me to her as she was 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.689
 should 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.879
 put on the ever great praise 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.989
 to the company of sturgeons and I wanted 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.370
 now want a scissors because it 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.989
 I even do not even get it up 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:59.139
 but here you just click 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:02.349
 unpack properly erl look has so 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.769
 So we have the sticker itself 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.120
 also i am totally happy because of it 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.659
 looks really out of water and had hoped 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.269
 it will now be on my macbook 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.780
 I still packed so much here 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.910
 simple instruction of the order with it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 yes, I'll just go 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.690
 make this guide and you 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.430
 dedicate and then you can see how that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.829
 whole end up so i wish 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.050
 you have fun I start now with 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.540
 a microfiber cloth 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.310
 macbook to clean from dirt too 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.530
 free and also grease stains too 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.450
 remove it so we can do it later 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.700
 we have a clean surface on it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.090
 Apply glue to the adhesive 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.430
 can 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.760
 so that there are no bubbles underneath 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.760
 form 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.470
 Now I start filming this 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.720
 enlighten macbook is above all 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.450
 take care that you with the corners 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.459
 the beginning for these corners are a very 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.230
 good reference point and then you stand there 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.040
 really accurate this slide 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.959
 to stick 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.720
 So look that the corners are right 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.420
 then look at the edges between 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.800
 specify the corners exactly and the rest 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.800
 this then results from all alone 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.889
 you should have a corner of eurotopics 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.229
 then you can correct that 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.960
 we again before and again new 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.130
 put it on film also something stretchy and 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.280
 she might as well do something 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.440
 Together they pull very elastic 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.800
 and according to life really 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.830
 then fitting andrea device to install 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.830
 is 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.390
 Finally, I'll take it now 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.490
 a microfiber cloth for sure 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.640
 make sure that all the bubbles under the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.440
 foil are gone and then that's it 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.520
 already finished and I hope you like it 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.520
 it's as good as mia 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.720
 so people that 's it with the video 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.860
 I hope you liked it and me 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.890
 I hope I could also give you a few 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.810
 create creative incentives that yourself 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.170
 So try out your cell phone too 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.220
 beautify or laptop depending on 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.200
 and of course I would be very happy 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.340
 if you do something like that when I am 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.500

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.540

 and yes, if you see more videos on 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.510

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.590

 So get in vista 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.780
 your mobile phone or laptop sometimes too convenient 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:14.460
 to individualize a bit 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.460
 of course, keep on extremely sorry
