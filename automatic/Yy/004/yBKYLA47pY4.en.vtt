00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
begin this is your main screen and this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.209 
begin this is your main screen and this
is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> screen<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.980> seeing

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
is a screen you're going to be seeing

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.819 
is a screen you're going to be seeing
for<00:00:32.669> pretty<00:00:32.880> much<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.059> whole<00:00:33.329> time<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> see

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
for pretty much a whole time now you see

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.709 
for pretty much a whole time now you see
a<00:00:34.860> bunch<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.370> different<00:00:35.760> buttons<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> they

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
a bunch of different buttons and they

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
a bunch of different buttons and they
can<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:37.050> pretty<00:00:37.260> confusing<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.010> so

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
can be pretty confusing at first so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.889
