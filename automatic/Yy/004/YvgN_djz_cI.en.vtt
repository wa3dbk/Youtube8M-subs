 Hurray Hurray Hurray Sochi Olympiad 2014 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:13.700
 coca cola is a worldwide partner 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 super flag i think many will recognize it 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 recently there I have shorter in the city 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.769
 if olympic fire and handed out 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 any such pribluda flags 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.279
 coca-cola handed out to be in a jar 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.929
 offering snatched only 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 it gave me such a flag as a devious 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.480
 and that's the kind of thing blowing but I think 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.730
 many people know the streets are littered and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.399
 so on he can even video at the end 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.940
 Naduya shorter and here I have it all lay 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 lay 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.030
 but in general the video is not about all these things 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 I just decided to start with this 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:00.329
 start means all this video is supposed to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.019

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.369
 bill 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 so decided to make such a video show 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.759
 Well, who did not see at all so here we have 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 such a 100 ruble note 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.830

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.140

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.530

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.789
 magic coins 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.599

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:18.569
 Iâ€™ll print them one by one now and 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:31.299

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:39.790
 first we have so now get pancake 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:46.829
 snapped as you go no probably everything is not 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:53.730
 wants to leverage everything like 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.730
 it says horror 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:20.480
 since we are here we have the first coin 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:21.610
 This is what Sochi 2014 looks like this 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.590
 behind us 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:32.590
 what is there let's see what 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.590
 there is a back of 25 rubles 2000 2014 and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.790
 it doesn't focus here 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.120
 focused the Russian Federation 25 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.760
 rubles 2014 but shorter tutorial and front 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.140
 we have 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.209
 Sochi 2014 so the coin seems to be new in 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.640
 the blister was kind of scratched nothing 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.540
 so the focus so here in general it looks like 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.370
 first coin 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.209
 awful hands me okay 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.450
 Okay, it was not the hands that looked at both coins. 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.890
 arms 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.890
 it's not mine now 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:25.430
 so look now to the next now 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:29.300
 coin in principle 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.580
 back as there is an eagle and tails do not remember 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.810
 especially what is the same here as in front 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.340
 we are depicted here such 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:45.030
 olympic if not kicking 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:50.070
 code who is there hare and bear sochi 2014 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.419
 such a coin in denominations of 25 rubles 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.020
 there is one more 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.320
 The ear coin is also very interesting and 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.630
 funny and i'll put it all 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.380
 I have a lot of my coin collection 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.250
 coins i'm all 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:11.970
 promised to make a video about his coins in 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:13.800
 video unpacking this cover album for 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.410
 Coin's odd but now everything is hands 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.259
 reach but I will definitely do because 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.330
 that coins are added to me all sorts 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.580
 interesting old and who are interested 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.909
 numismatics and so on are very coins 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.330
 Well, I wonder so much that I took 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:34.590
 well don't look there just are there any coins i 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.720
 I decided to collect them like this little by little and 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.909
 here is a shorter last coin 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:44.900
 here some girl and boy that if 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:47.280
 like some kind of incomprehensible 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.349
 cool here there is still some thing 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.669
 behind that same for 2013 here 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:57.720
 not 2014 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:02.130
 I wonder what is interesting depends on so 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.460
 here and here is the plan now all 3 x 3 coin 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.259
 only three of them, too, I will put them in my 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.150
 album 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:17.760
 monetary 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:24.840
 so in general, all three here so they all 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:28.440
 It looks all three coins so let's 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:35.460
 ok, I'll put it here and take 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:38.340

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.850
 coca cola bailiffs representing 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.190
