00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 the right foot and spare ability 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:11.309
 ball and agility ball on left foot and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.000
 the domain is the same way acrobatics and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.359
 pure freestyle talent known as 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.539
 street football is like that with little 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.859
 show gets even better 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.170
 anywhere is a place to train 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.320
 anytime anywhere 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.520
 just having a ball in your hands is the tennis that 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 today is obligatory and I think in the background 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 There are a lot of demands on this. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.430
 existed said he did the freestyle 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.620
 it's really black style the two-time champion 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.280
 Brazilian goes in search of tri in são 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 Paulo is also eyeing the championship 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.890
 Latin American 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 already in the world that came the two 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.379
 the first four steps and it is the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.260
 fifth place in the overall standings 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.600
 some other play other notes 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.940
 they judge only by the person's performance 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 You know then, you're out of here today. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.739
 less so the system of evaluation by the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.500
 street soccer prioritize skill 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.850
 creativity style the goal does not mean 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.890
 anything 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.330
 what matters is to combine the largest 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.210
 number of juggling possible for this 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.159
 nothing to get away from that round 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.220
 if the goal is achieved the first 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.970
 place where the ball is there will be the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.150
 Little does it matter if it's in the gym. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.400
 also because the new 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.720
 preparation will serve to improve 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.369
 even more had column problem had 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.799
 ankle problem had problem 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.329
 I need a lot of personal balance 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.979
 He needs a lot of his work. 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.409
 trunk all stabilized 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 they will happen arrival without salt 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.070
 if one day then his work is a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.380
 integrated hand-to-hand 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 we talk so much through movements 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.759
 I can already work all over it. 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 the drills take place from Monday to Saturday 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.659
 in both environments 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.619
 approximately two and a half hours of 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.930
 ration 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.640
 today I really feel fit for 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.890
 continue my physical conditioning comes 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.200
 improving with each passing day 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.190
 anyone who thinks that sport is 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.810
 for men 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.720
 Look at Marisa Sintra. 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 Brazilian champion showing talent to the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.400
 side of our champion 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.690
 she and other freestyle stars 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.239
 Living in São Paulo 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.489
 but it does not matter, Pedro guarantees being in the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.230
 best career fitness 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.569
 I figured I could reach a plateau 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.130
 a little higher than it was before 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.560
 I thought I had already reached the apex 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.959
 but not the home time every day that is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.920
 Come on, I'm getting older and I'm coming. 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.540
 feeling better 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.540
 that's the good part of the functional
