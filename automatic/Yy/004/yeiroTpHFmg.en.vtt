00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.379 

evaluate<00:00:01.170> three<00:00:01.469> and<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> half<00:00:01.650> minus<00:00:02.310> X<00:00:02.700> when<00:00:03.179> X

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
evaluate three and a half minus X when X

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.780 
evaluate three and a half minus X when X
is<00:00:03.510> equal<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.810> 5<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.140> X<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.920> equal<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.400> negative

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
is equal to 5 and X is equal to negative

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.110 
is equal to 5 and X is equal to negative
5<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.379> let's<00:00:07.589> start<00:00:07.890> with<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.519> situation

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
5 so let's start with the situation

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.930 
5 so let's start with the situation
where<00:00:09.300> x<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.900> equal<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.620> five<00:00:10.950> then<00:00:11.340> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
where x is equal to five then this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.410 
where x is equal to five then this
expression<00:00:12.230> becomes<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.679> becomes<00:00:14.460> let<00:00:15.179> me<00:00:15.299> do

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
expression becomes it becomes let me do

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.740 
expression becomes it becomes let me do
it<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.750> three<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.800> half<00:00:17.090> minus<00:00:18.090> instead<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it so three and a half minus instead of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.269 
it so three and a half minus instead of
writing<00:00:18.930> an<00:00:19.080> X<00:00:19.230> there<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.650> know<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.949> x<00:00:20.160> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
writing an X there we know that x is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.700 
writing an X there we know that x is
equal<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.550> five<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.029> i'll<00:00:21.150> put<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.570> 5<00:00:22.020> right<00:00:22.470> over

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
equal to five so i'll put a 5 right over

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.830 
equal to five so i'll put a 5 right over
here<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.519> let's<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
here now let's think about it on the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.429 
here now let's think about it on the
number<00:00:25.230> line<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.160> let<00:00:26.310> me<00:00:26.340> draw<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.480> number<00:00:28.230> line

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
number line so let me draw a number line

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
number line so let me draw a number line
I<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> straighter<00:00:29.699> number<00:00:30.090> line<00:00:30.240> than

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I can do a straighter number line than

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.150 
I can do a straighter number line than
that<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.570> number<00:00:34.140> line<00:00:34.170> right

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that so that's my number line right

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
that so that's my number line right
there<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.670> 0<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:38.629> three<00:00:39.680> four

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
there is 0 and I have one two three four

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.280 
there is 0 and I have one two three four
three<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.700> half<00:00:41.730> sits<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:42.989> between

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
three and a half sits right in between

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
three and a half sits right in between
three<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.520> three<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> half<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
three and four so three and a half is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740 
three and four so three and a half is
right<00:00:45.809> over<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.620> three<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.000> half<00:00:48.030> i'm

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
right over there three and a half i'm

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479 
right over there three and a half i'm
going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> subtract<00:00:49.530> five<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> before<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> do

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
going to subtract five and before I do

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
going to subtract five and before I do
that<00:00:50.579> let<00:00:50.730> me<00:00:50.879> draw<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.180> spaces<00:00:51.870> below<00:00:52.140> zero

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that let me draw some spaces below zero

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
that let me draw some spaces below zero
because<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> obviously<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.180> larger

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
because this is obviously a larger

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
because this is obviously a larger
number<00:00:54.870> than<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.620> we're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> drop

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
number than that so we're going to drop

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
number than that so we're going to drop
below<00:00:56.340> zero<00:00:56.460> where<00:00:57.030> three<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> half<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
below zero where three and a half to the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.750 
below zero where three and a half to the
right<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> we're<00:00:58.469> gonna<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.680> 5<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> left

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
right and we're gonna go 5 to the left

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.010 
right and we're gonna go 5 to the left
so<00:00:59.910> we're<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> end<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> left<00:01:00.870> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so we're going to end up to the left of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.850 
so we're going to end up to the left of
zero<00:01:01.379> let<00:01:02.070> me<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.309> negative<00:01:02.520> 1<00:01:03.000> negative<00:01:03.350> 2<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
zero let me do negative 1 negative 2 and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.020 
zero let me do negative 1 negative 2 and
negative<00:01:06.140> 3<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.770> we're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> move<00:01:08.189> 5<00:01:08.520> over

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
negative 3 so we're going to move 5 over

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.240 
negative 3 so we're going to move 5 over
to<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> left<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.110> let's<00:01:10.260> move<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to the left so let's move one to the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.580 
to the left so let's move one to the
left<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> left<00:01:12.689> let<00:01:13.350> me<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.470> then

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
left two to the left let me do then

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
left two to the left let me do then
another<00:01:13.740> color<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> left<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
another color so one to the left to the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.370 
another color so one to the left to the
left<00:01:16.110> three<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.220> left<00:01:17.280> four<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> left

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
left three to the left four to the left

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
left three to the left four to the left
five<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.890> left<00:01:20.250> brings<00:01:20.820> us<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.150> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
five to the left brings us right there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
five to the left brings us right there
when<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.380> look<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
when we just look at it when you just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.289 
when we just look at it when you just
look<00:01:24.270> at<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.479> visually<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:27.090> get

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
look at it visually you get to you get

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.330 
look at it visually you get to you get
to<00:01:27.450> negative<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> half<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.159> is

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to negative one and a half so this is

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.789 
to negative one and a half so this is
negative<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> half<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:31.079> will<00:01:31.439> be

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
negative one and a half which will be

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.899 
negative one and a half which will be
the<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.130> answer<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.520> let's<00:01:32.700> think<00:01:32.729> about

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the right answer but let's think about

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
the right answer but let's think about
it<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> think<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it a little more to think about how to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
it a little more to think about how to
come<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.270> mathematically<00:01:36.450> instead

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
come up with it mathematically instead

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.600 
come up with it mathematically instead
of<00:01:37.259> having<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> draw<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> number<00:01:38.130> line<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
of having to draw the number line so

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.850 
of having to draw the number line so
three<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> half<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.990> literally<00:01:40.409> three

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
three and a half it's literally three

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
three and a half it's literally three
and<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> half<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> right<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.820> zero<00:01:42.150> its

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and a half to the right of zero its

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
and a half to the right of zero its
absolute<00:01:42.750> value<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.320> three<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.890> half<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
absolute value is three and a half and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
absolute value is three and a half and
of<00:01:44.280> course<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> positive<00:01:45.090> number<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
of course it's a positive number so the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
of course it's a positive number so the
length<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:47.070> distance<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
length this distance right here is the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
length this distance right here is the
absolute<00:01:48.600> value<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> three<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> half<00:01:49.549> that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
absolute value of three and a half that

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.600 
absolute value of three and a half that
length<00:01:50.990> right<00:01:51.990> over<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.460> are

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
length right over there then we are

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.179 
length right over there then we are
subtracting<00:01:53.899> 5<00:01:54.899> from<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.920> we're<00:01:56.070> going

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
subtracting 5 from that so we're going

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.160 
subtracting 5 from that so we're going
to<00:01:56.250> move<00:01:56.399> 5<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.969> left<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.960> point

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to move 5 to the left from this point

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
to move 5 to the left from this point
over<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.490> we're<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.969> move<00:02:00.149> 5<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
over here so we're going to move 5 to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.850 
over here so we're going to move 5 to
the<00:02:01.020> left<00:02:01.350> from<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> point<00:02:02.670> over<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.860> let

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the left from that point over there let

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.740 
the left from that point over there let
me<00:02:04.950> draw<00:02:05.130> an<00:02:05.219> arrow<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.299> went<00:02:06.420> 5

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
me draw an arrow here just so we went 5

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.219 
me draw an arrow here just so we went 5
to<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> left<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> length<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.989> this

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
to the left so the length of this

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.309 
to the left so the length of this
magenta<00:02:11.039> part<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.580> 5<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.800> fine

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
magenta part is 5 that is fine

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.619 
magenta part is 5 that is fine
five<00:02:14.409> so<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.129> number<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.609> absolute<00:02:16.120> value<00:02:16.599> of

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
five so the number the absolute value of

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.089 
five so the number the absolute value of
the<00:02:16.840> number<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.379> care<00:02:17.620> about<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.829> going

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
the number that we care about is going

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.250 
the number that we care about is going
to<00:02:18.159> be<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.489> difference<00:02:18.969> over<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.659> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
to be this difference over here the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.899 
to be this difference over here the
absolute<00:02:20.769> value<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.280> number<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.670> care

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
absolute value of the number we care

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.020 
absolute value of the number we care
about<00:02:21.999> is<00:02:22.150> going<00:02:22.719> to<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:23.049> this<00:02:23.819> number<00:02:24.819> right

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
about is going to be this number right

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.809 
about is going to be this number right
over<00:02:25.090> here<00:02:25.689> which<00:02:26.109> is<00:02:26.290> really<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.670> just

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
over here which is really if you just

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.309 
over here which is really if you just
think<00:02:27.849> about<00:02:28.030> its<00:02:28.239> absolute<00:02:28.659> value<00:02:29.019> it's<00:02:29.170> just

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
think about its absolute value it's just

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.860 
think about its absolute value it's just
the<00:02:29.439> difference<00:02:29.829> between<00:02:29.950> five<00:02:30.609> and<00:02:31.030> three

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the difference between five and three

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.449 
the difference between five and three
and<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.019> half<00:02:32.049> but<00:02:32.799> since<00:02:33.010> we<00:02:33.129> are<00:02:33.159> subtracting

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
and a half but since we are subtracting

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.390 
and a half but since we are subtracting
the<00:02:34.090> larger<00:02:34.629> number<00:02:35.019> it's<00:02:35.260> going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.950> be

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the larger number it's going to be

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.940 
the larger number it's going to be
negative<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.719> so<00:02:38.109> if<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.260> were<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.409> just<00:02:38.680> so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
negative and so if you were to just so

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.339 
negative and so if you were to just so
you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.189> literally<00:02:39.489> view<00:02:39.939> this<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.989> can<00:02:41.169> say

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
you can literally view this you can say

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.110 
you can literally view this you can say
that<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.889> the<00:02:42.010> same<00:02:42.280> thing<00:02:42.310> as<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
that this is the same thing as the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.580 
that this is the same thing as the
negative<00:02:43.629> of<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.079> know<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.319> going<00:02:44.439> to<00:02:44.499> be

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
negative of and we know it's going to be

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.319 
negative of and we know it's going to be
a<00:02:44.650> negative<00:02:45.099> number<00:02:45.159> because<00:02:45.700> we're

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
a negative number because we're

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.759 
a negative number because we're
subtracting<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.930> larger<00:02:47.230> number<00:02:47.349> from<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
subtracting a larger number from a

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.970 
subtracting a larger number from a
smaller<00:02:47.799> number<00:02:48.310> it's<00:02:48.939> the<00:02:49.209> negative<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:50.049> its

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
smaller number it's the negative of its

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.530 
smaller number it's the negative of its
the<00:02:51.189> negative<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:52.060> take<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.329> larger

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the negative of you take the larger

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.509 
the negative of you take the larger
number<00:02:53.049> five<00:02:54.719> minus<00:02:55.719> three<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.349> half<00:02:56.519> five

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
number five minus three and a half five

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.459 
number five minus three and a half five
minus<00:02:58.150> three<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> half<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.319> there's

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
minus three and a half and there's

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.050 
minus three and a half and there's
multiple<00:02:59.949> ways<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.340> can<00:03:00.489> do<00:03:00.639> this<00:03:00.669> you<00:03:00.939> could

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
multiple ways you can do this you could

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.360 
multiple ways you can do this you could
you<00:03:01.269> do<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:02.109> could<00:03:02.260> probably<00:03:02.469> do<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.159> in

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
you do you could probably do this in

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.179 
you do you could probably do this in
your<00:03:03.609> head<00:03:03.819> if<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.359> was<00:03:04.510> 5-3<00:03:05.439> you<00:03:05.680> would<00:03:05.769> get<00:03:05.919> to

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
your head if it was 5-3 you would get to

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.339 
your head if it was 5-3 you would get to
but<00:03:06.969> if<00:03:07.060> you're<00:03:07.150> if<00:03:07.419> you're<00:03:07.629> you<00:03:08.109> have<00:03:08.230> to

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
but if you're if you're you have to

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.780 
but if you're if you're you have to
subtract<00:03:08.680> three<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.489> then<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:09.639> have<00:03:09.760> to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
subtract three and then you have to

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.339 
subtract three and then you have to
subtract<00:03:10.120> another<00:03:10.269> half<00:03:10.599> so<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.079> would<00:03:11.260> get

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
subtract another half so you would get

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.659 
subtract another half so you would get
to<00:03:11.469> two<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.829> then<00:03:11.949> subtract<00:03:12.250> another<00:03:12.400> half

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
to two and then subtract another half

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.550 
to two and then subtract another half
you<00:03:12.849> would<00:03:12.969> get<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.269> one<00:03:13.689> and<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.900> half<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.349> 5

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
you would get to one and a half so 5

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.809 
you would get to one and a half so 5
minus<00:03:14.739> 3<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.129> half<00:03:15.159> is<00:03:15.370> one<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.699> a<00:03:15.760> half

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
minus 3 and a half is one and a half

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.509 
minus 3 and a half is one and a half
stick<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.780> negative<00:03:17.139> out<00:03:17.290> front<00:03:17.519> negative

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
stick the negative out front negative

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.179 
stick the negative out front negative
one<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.120> half<00:03:19.500> let's<00:03:20.500> do<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.709> second<00:03:21.159> part

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
one and a half let's do the second part

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.780 
one and a half let's do the second part
x<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:22.269> equal<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.629> negative<00:03:22.659> 5x<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:24.159> equal<00:03:24.220> to

x is equal to negative 5x is equal to

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.839 
x is equal to negative 5x is equal to
negative<00:03:24.819> 5<00:03:25.419> then<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:25.989> expression<00:03:26.169> up<00:03:26.680> here

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
negative 5 then this expression up here

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.780 
negative 5 then this expression up here
becomes<00:03:27.849> three<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.049> half<00:03:29.340> minus<00:03:30.340> and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
becomes three and a half minus and

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.909 
becomes three and a half minus and
instead<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.180> X<00:03:31.449> we<00:03:31.780> have<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.049> negative<00:03:32.470> 5<00:03:33.479> minus

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
instead of X we have a negative 5 minus

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.770 
instead of X we have a negative 5 minus
negative<00:03:35.919> 5<00:03:36.400> now<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.030> lot<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.239> ways<00:03:37.419> this<00:03:37.599> is

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
negative 5 now a lot of ways this is

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.119 
negative 5 now a lot of ways this is
easier<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.500> this<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.859> kind<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.069> just

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
easier and this is kind of just

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.759 
easier and this is kind of just
something<00:03:39.579> that<00:03:39.729> hopefully<00:03:40.090> you'll<00:03:40.419> start

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
something that hopefully you'll start

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.469 
something that hopefully you'll start
I'll<00:03:41.769> almost<00:03:41.979> be<00:03:42.189> a<00:03:42.310> knee-jerk<00:03:42.609> reaction<00:03:43.329> if

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
I'll almost be a knee-jerk reaction if

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.379 
I'll almost be a knee-jerk reaction if
you<00:03:43.629> subtract<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.620> negative<00:03:44.650> number<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:46.209> is

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
you subtract a negative number that is

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.479 
you subtract a negative number that is
the<00:03:46.569> exact<00:03:46.989> same<00:03:47.319> thing<00:03:47.680> as<00:03:47.859> adding<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
the exact same thing as adding the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.759 
the exact same thing as adding the
number<00:03:48.909> you<00:03:49.090> these<00:03:49.359> are<00:03:49.620> addition<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
number you these are addition and

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.330 
number you these are addition and
subtraction<00:03:51.340> are<00:03:51.549> inverse<00:03:52.239> operations

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
subtraction are inverse operations

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.619 
subtraction are inverse operations
subtracting<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.519> negative<00:03:54.609> number<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.509> the

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
subtracting a negative number is the

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.349 
subtracting a negative number is the
same<00:03:55.870> thing<00:03:55.930> as<00:03:56.319> adding<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:57.009> now<00:03:57.219> let<00:03:58.120> me<00:03:58.150> put

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
same thing as adding it now let me put

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.969 
same thing as adding it now let me put
it<00:03:58.449> this<00:03:58.540> way<00:03:58.719> subtracting<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.379> negative<00:03:59.409> is

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
it this way subtracting a negative is

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.709 
it this way subtracting a negative is
the<00:04:00.009> same<00:04:00.310> thing<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:00.879> is<00:04:01.030> equal<00:04:01.269> to<00:04:01.299> three

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
the same thing this is equal to three

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.990 
the same thing this is equal to three
and<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.870> half<00:04:02.189> plus<00:04:03.189> you<00:04:03.489> can<00:04:03.609> view<00:04:03.759> these

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
and a half plus you can view these

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.709 
and a half plus you can view these
negatives<00:04:04.509> cancelling<00:04:04.959> out<00:04:05.109> plus<00:04:05.680> five<00:04:06.719> three

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:07.719 
negatives cancelling out plus five three

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.559 
negatives cancelling out plus five three
and<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.930> half<00:04:07.959> plus<00:04:08.829> 5<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.699> this<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.329> pretty

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
and a half plus 5 and this is pretty

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.670 
and a half plus 5 and this is pretty
straightforward<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:11.169> don't<00:04:11.289> have<00:04:11.439> to<00:04:11.530> draw<00:04:11.650> a

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
straightforward you don't have to draw a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.050 
straightforward you don't have to draw a
number<00:04:11.859> line<00:04:12.009> here<00:04:12.310> three<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.669> half<00:04:12.699> plus

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
number line here three and a half plus

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.119 
number line here three and a half plus
five<00:04:13.329> you<00:04:14.139> could<00:04:14.259> view<00:04:14.379> this<00:04:14.560> well<00:04:14.799> that's

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
five you could view this well that's

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.620 
five you could view this well that's
just<00:04:15.219> going<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.549> be<00:04:15.609> eight<00:04:15.759> and<00:04:15.909> a<00:04:15.939> half<00:04:15.969> we

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
just going to be eight and a half we

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.909 
just going to be eight and a half we
just<00:04:16.810> added<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.109> whole<00:04:17.229> number<00:04:17.590> parts<00:04:17.859> they

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
just added the whole number parts they

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.140 
just added the whole number parts they
don't<00:04:18.039> even<00:04:18.099> have<00:04:18.219> to<00:04:18.370> write<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.669> as<00:04:18.759> improper

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
don't even have to write it as improper

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.529 
don't even have to write it as improper
fraction<00:04:19.719> it's<00:04:20.409> eight<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:21.009> a<00:04:21.759> half<00:04:21.789> anyway

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
fraction it's eight and a half anyway

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.260 
fraction it's eight and a half anyway
hopefully<00:04:22.719> you<00:04:22.840> found<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.139> helpful
