00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.910
 and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.270
 the theme of empathy I joke it 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:06.650
 but it is serious and as there are people who do not know 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.400
 motivates if it is not with some fear or some 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.980
 I'm scared, so I'm going to give them a nano scare 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.940
 which is the one that I took when I saw in 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.140
 a partner what had happened to him in 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.720
 his life because he was made 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:30.870
 an analytical and this is what came out 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.870
 of his work gown 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.440
 if the camera transmits well the one 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.740
 morrÃ³n 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.120
 from this health colleague 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.470
 I think you can see 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.470
 what the boyfriend 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.469
 that was burning 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.170
 everyone smelled around him 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.860
 you're burning - bearer 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:11.860
 that is part of the burn not 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.860
 find out that you are already or carrau 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.320
 yes 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.590
 if you want to laugh 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.980
 but like when the blind lead 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.980
 others go all to the ravine 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.670
 when a healer 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.620
 it has burned 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.620
 sets fire around 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.890
 so I've brought this issue of the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.020
 empathy here very motivated by my 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.650
 life experience in hospitals 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.990
 with health professionals 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.630
 to those who 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.700
 It costs a lot to care because they themselves 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.780
 now we will see why they have been neglected 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.690
 progressively and when they come to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.400
 learn that no longer do well not 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.340
 there is more than dying 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.530
 that it has become clear that it is an arrangement 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.069
 but man if we could do something 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.069
 before 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 one 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.280
 love
