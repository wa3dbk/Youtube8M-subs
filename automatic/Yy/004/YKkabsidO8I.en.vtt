00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.280 
being very careful not to get any on the
lenses<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:28.300> should<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.600> protected<00:03:28.960> those

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
lenses and I should have protected those

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:41.690 
lenses and I should have protected those
first<00:03:29.650> from<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.190> get-go

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:51.110 

and<00:03:42.700> there's<00:03:42.879> this<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.359> last<00:03:43.569> little<00:03:43.840> section

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.819 

and<00:03:52.120> there<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.140> go<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:54.400> glasses<00:03:54.640> are<00:03:55.180> done

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
and there you go the glasses are done

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.860 
and there you go the glasses are done
these<00:03:56.829> take<00:03:57.189> no<00:03:57.219> time<00:03:57.909> to<00:03:58.060> dry<00:03:58.269> since<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.689> use<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
these take no time to dry since I use a

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.069 
these take no time to dry since I use a
hot<00:03:59.049> glue<00:03:59.079> gun<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.709> I<00:04:00.129> will<00:04:00.189> show<00:04:00.609> you<00:04:00.670> them<00:04:01.420> on

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
hot glue gun and I will show you them on

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.660 
hot glue gun and I will show you them on
me<00:04:02.469> in<00:04:02.769> just<00:04:03.189> one<00:04:03.370> month

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
me in just one month

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.610 
me in just one month
I<00:04:03.700> think<00:04:04.180> these<00:04:04.450> glasses<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:05.139> be<00:04:05.170> worn<00:04:05.439> in<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
I think these glasses can be worn in a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.819 
I think these glasses can be worn in a
few<00:04:05.889> ways<00:04:06.069> actually<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.150> first<00:04:07.389> way

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
few ways actually this is the first way

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.740 
few ways actually this is the first way
with<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:09.189> chain<00:04:09.489> behind<00:04:09.969> your<00:04:10.180> neck<00:04:10.329> like

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
with the chain behind your neck like

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:22.080 
with the chain behind your neck like
this

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.339 

you

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.110 

now<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.440> second<00:04:25.949> way<00:04:26.099> these<00:04:26.340> can<00:04:26.580> be<00:04:26.699> worn<00:04:26.729> is

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
now the second way these can be worn is

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:42.450 
now the second way these can be worn is
just<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.479> chain<00:04:27.900> dangling<00:04:29.569> like<00:04:30.569> so

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.670 

and<00:04:42.550> last<00:04:43.539> thing<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:43.960> can<00:04:44.110> be<00:04:44.229> worn<00:04:44.410> as<00:04:44.620> a

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
and last thing this can be worn as a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:56.990 
and last thing this can be worn as a
sunglass<00:04:45.370> necklace

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.060
