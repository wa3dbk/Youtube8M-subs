00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.480 
happens and you mess them up you can get
them<00:01:55.920> fixed<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:57.299> real<00:01:57.570> easy<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:58.490> it's

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
them fixed but it's real easy to do it's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.609 
them fixed but it's real easy to do it's
better<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.090> take<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> pin<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:03.619> other

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
better to just take the pin out other

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
better to just take the pin out other
than<00:02:04.920> destroying<00:02:05.460> your<00:02:05.670> flash<00:02:05.909> hider<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.420> not

the<00:02:13.020> inner<00:02:13.140> barrel

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the inner barrel

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.729 
the inner barrel
out<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:14.790> there<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.180> no<00:02:15.420> hole<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.470> knock

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
out but there is no hole to just knock

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.839 
out but there is no hole to just knock
the<00:02:17.099> pin<00:02:17.340> out

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
the pin out

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.610 
the pin out
you<00:02:18.209> can't<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.569> knock<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.989> no<00:02:19.200> fall<00:02:19.439> into

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
you can't just knock it in no fall into

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.360 
you can't just knock it in no fall into
the<00:02:19.709> barrel<00:02:20.450> uh-huh<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.140> had<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.829> destroy

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the barrel uh-huh so I had to destroy

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.539 
the barrel uh-huh so I had to destroy
the<00:02:23.610> flash<00:02:23.790> hider<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.840> anyway<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.370> get

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
the flash hider but anyway if you get

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.119 
the flash hider but anyway if you get
past<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.030> pet<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> pen<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.049> you<00:02:28.860> have<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
past the pet of the pen and you have the

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.240 
past the pet of the pen and you have the
hex<00:02:29.280> screw<00:02:30.000> out<00:02:30.120> then<00:02:30.840> what<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.349> do<00:02:31.500> is

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
hex screw out then what you can do is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.830 
hex screw out then what you can do is
you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.489> do<00:02:32.670> what<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.879> did<00:02:32.939> put<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> screwdriver

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
you can do what I did put a screwdriver

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.420 
you can do what I did put a screwdriver
through<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.439> birdcage<00:02:34.849> then<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:36.000> twist<00:02:36.299> it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
through the birdcage then you twist it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.929 
through the birdcage then you twist it
counter<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.760> weight<00:02:40.549> all<00:02:41.549> right<00:02:41.730> just

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
counter all the weight all right just

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.880 
counter all the weight all right just
look<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.359> don't<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.689> I<00:02:43.019> really<00:02:43.530> don't<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.859> don't

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
look I don't know I really don't I don't

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.050 
look I don't know I really don't I don't
know<00:02:44.099> if<00:02:44.129> it's<00:02:44.280> counterclockwise<00:02:44.670> or

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
know if it's counterclockwise or

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.809 
know if it's counterclockwise or
clockwise<00:02:45.090> I've<00:02:45.930> heard<00:02:46.079> counterclockwise<00:02:46.819> I

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
clockwise I've heard counterclockwise I

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.430 
clockwise I've heard counterclockwise I
think<00:02:48.269> they're<00:02:48.389> counterclockwise<00:02:48.810> negative

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
think they're counterclockwise negative

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.339 
think they're counterclockwise negative
threads<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.909> look<00:02:51.090> at<00:02:51.209> my<00:02:51.299> gun<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
threads but just look at my gun if you

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.839 
threads but just look at my gun if you
have<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> gun<00:02:52.799> light<00:02:52.980> laying<00:02:53.250> down<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.459> this

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
have the gun light laying down like this

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.479 
have the gun light laying down like this
you<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> flash<00:02:54.959> hider<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:56.010> turn<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.340> that

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
you have a flash hider just turn it that

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.149 
you have a flash hider just turn it that
way<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:57.230> mean<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.349> keep<00:02:58.620> turning<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
way I mean you just keep turning it that

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.970 
way I mean you just keep turning it that
way<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.269> have<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.659> off<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.620> if<00:03:01.859> you

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
way and so you have it off now if you

end of your gun into a pot of boiling
water<00:03:17.189> labor<00:03:17.970> there<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:18.329> about<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> minute<00:03:18.900> and

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
water labor there for about a minute and

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.110 
water labor there for about a minute and
a<00:03:19.079> half<00:03:19.169> two<00:03:19.440> minutes<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.400> take<00:03:20.609> it<00:03:20.699> out<00:03:20.849> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a half two minutes and take it out and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.349 
a half two minutes and take it out and
wrap<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.109> electrical<00:03:22.829> tape<00:03:23.090> now<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.150> duct

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
wrap it in electrical tape now the duct

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.879 
wrap it in electrical tape now the duct
tape<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.750> know<00:03:24.870> totally<00:03:25.230> what's<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.530> residue

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
tape you know totally what's a residue

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.680 
tape you know totally what's a residue
wanna<00:03:26.069> wrap<00:03:26.669> it<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.849> electrical<00:03:27.269> tape<00:03:27.449> and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
wanna wrap it in electrical tape and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.539 
wanna wrap it in electrical tape and
then<00:03:28.530> put<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:29.010> towel<00:03:29.280> over<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.900> take<00:03:31.139> a

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
then put a towel over it and then take a

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.640 
then put a towel over it and then take a
wrench<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:33.629> put<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.900> over<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.169> towel<00:03:34.379> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
wrench and put it over the towel and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.979 
wrench and put it over the towel and
then<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.250> keep<00:03:35.430> turning<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.180> you

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
then just keep turning it and you

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.099 
then just keep turning it and you
eventually<00:03:37.260> you'll<00:03:37.819> get<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.970> loose<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:39.989> the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
eventually you'll get it loose but the

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.509 
eventually you'll get it loose but the
reason<00:03:40.409> why<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.560> put<00:03:40.620> electrical<00:03:41.069> tape<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.459> a

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
reason why you put electrical tape and a

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.640 
reason why you put electrical tape and a
towel<00:03:41.730> over<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.780> don't<00:03:43.049> miss<00:03:43.199> a<00:03:43.229> bank

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
towel over it so you don't miss a bank

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.180 
towel over it so you don't miss a bank
that<00:03:43.909> cares<00:03:44.909> so<00:03:45.379> it's<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.440> lot<00:03:46.620> easier<00:03:46.979> if<00:03:47.010> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
that cares so it's a lot easier if you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.800 
that cares so it's a lot easier if you
don't<00:03:47.370> care<00:03:47.639> what<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.180> could<00:03:48.359> probably<00:03:48.540> do

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
don't care what you could probably do

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.869 
don't care what you could probably do
you<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:49.799> probably<00:03:49.949> get<00:03:50.159> a<00:03:50.190> flash<00:03:50.400> hider<00:03:50.609> real

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
you can probably get a flash hider real

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.640 
you can probably get a flash hider real
cheap<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.540> recommend<00:03:51.989> doing<00:03:52.109> what<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.349> did

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
cheap so I recommend doing what I did

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.369 
cheap so I recommend doing what I did
and<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:54.090> yeah<00:03:54.239> I'm<00:03:54.329> messing<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.290> get

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
and just yeah I'm messing it up to get

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.129 
and just yeah I'm messing it up to get
the<00:03:55.500> pin<00:03:55.680> out<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.069> then<00:03:56.879> getting<00:03:58.010> it<00:04:00.049> it's<00:04:01.049> a

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
the pin out and then getting it it's a

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.199 
the pin out and then getting it it's a
lot<00:04:01.290> easier<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:01.919> buy<00:04:02.159> another<00:04:02.549> flash

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
lot easier to just buy another flash

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.140 
lot easier to just buy another flash
hider<00:04:03.479> instead<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.049> buying<00:04:04.859> a<00:04:05.099> whole<00:04:05.310> another

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
hider instead of buying a whole another

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.009 
hider instead of buying a whole another
end<00:04:06.419> of<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.569> barrel
