00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
usually they sound a little bit darker

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.399

but<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:22.970> guitar<00:01:23.330> with<00:01:23.479> stock<00:01:23.720> pickups<00:01:24.110> in<00:01:24.259> it

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
but this guitar with stock pickups in it

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.560 
but this guitar with stock pickups in it
sounds<00:01:24.710> really<00:01:25.070> fantastic<00:01:25.880> out<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.150> box

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
sounds really fantastic out of the box

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.330 
sounds really fantastic out of the box
the<00:01:26.840> only<00:01:26.990> complaint<00:01:27.229> I've<00:01:27.560> got<00:01:27.770> on<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
the only complaint I've got on it is the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.890 
the only complaint I've got on it is the
pickups<00:01:28.670> are<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> little<00:01:28.970> bit<00:01:29.210> low<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.570> output

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
pickups are a little bit low in output

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.450 
pickups are a little bit low in output
so<00:01:30.170> those<00:01:30.320> will<00:01:30.470> be<00:01:30.500> being<00:01:30.770> replaced<00:01:31.189> pretty

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
so those will be being replaced pretty

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.310 
so those will be being replaced pretty
