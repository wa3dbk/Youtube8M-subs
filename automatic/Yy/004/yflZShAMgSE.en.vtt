00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.880
 warm and welcome to one 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.150
 new video 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.089
 I have not made a crime for a long time 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.429
 and that's why there are advantages to june 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:30.810
 autumn and drugstore nations because pope 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.880
 I could and could about that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 Products market so there is a make-up 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 a hairstyle and also a small one 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.260
 outfit I hope you enjoy it and we 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.100
 start and I look at it 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.960
 I just black that I start 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
 today everyone with formation because 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.870
 but the last two three times like me 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.240
 somehow I had so much 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.310
 disappointed I read it first with the 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.040
 drivers and that's the make it now 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.370
 nation in the color is circulating and the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.050
 fits in the moment very well to emphasize 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.570
 then I could carry on and that is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 first, long lasting concealer I wear 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.020
 the now simple and henning eyes 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 and by the first with the fingers in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 the skin and then a bit with 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.870
 the noble wine and as a next step 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.300
 I wear brother that is the g2 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.500
 nearly new compact power I will really 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.659
 very nice also has a great 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.100
 packaging with the mirror and such and 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.100
 be fulfilled in any case 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.430
 then we come to those and have 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.870
 I shadow a really great review 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.940
 not always from Manhattan 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.280
 can recommend the quality just like that 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.980
 awesome that just so a bit 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.390
 light pink shiny but I think the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.800
 keeps shadow then is so simple and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.160
 shadow that's the one I short today 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.320
 from loup the same palette and 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.420
 i just want to like these women and 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.730
 green color together and again 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.970
 move your eyes and eyelids and such 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.740
 then I take out the bright color 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.540
 the palette and put this as 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.390
 highlight under the eyes and in the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:11.530
 look inward eye and my favorite 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.030
 but did not apply all but apply 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.850
 which I can highly recommend that the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.260
 unfortunately food is very cheap 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.630
 and already receives over two months 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.060
 with me so I do not like him 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.970
 I have my one wants only 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.120
 put forward and then pushed I use 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.400
 space today a bit superfluous 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.370
 because he loves me 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.630
 and because this leaves white film 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.540
 I use a black one now 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.610
 mask so that the max factor lampi 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.440
 foul and I like the fact where 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.050
 not alone but I like it 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.040
 she's a bit like that with the base 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.220
 I also try it too 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.220
 to buy 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.530
 and so say I've got that 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.970
 my eyebrows filled in wolf as 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.760
 last seen the video 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.410
 Eyebrows are the word to possible and 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.880
 because my eyebrows like that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.650
 I still have the form 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.420
 a fixing jay uses it comes from 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.250
 patrice down a bit that is 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.950
 my favorite browser from albert that 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.720
 it's this baked bronze in the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.810
 brighter colors of the two of it 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.810
 gives 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.930
 and then a little rouge to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.890
 conclude that it's such a great color 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.600
 from essens but I write you 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.610
 again call all colors in the infobox 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.610
 if you are interested 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.760
 and then the last step came 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.500
 Apply makeup lipstick 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.180
 I have a color that I already have 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.060
 I really liked wearing it last year 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.690
 ausgekramt is 374 and but it is 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.730
 such a nice dark intense red 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.690
 while something this ox blood red 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.220
 I think which one I ask very nicely 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.830
 you have my sweatshirt little after 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.910
 but have taken off regardless of compensation 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.470
 Not 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.210
 First of all, I wanted to show what I am 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.040
 Everybody did it with my hair 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.570
 pattern is supposedly called waterfall way 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.540
 no idea how it is called in German 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.140
 but that's how it works and turns on 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.060
 Then take a spider in three 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.610
 parts and weaves itself only once in 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.769
 box pass entirely to collect and 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.049
 then you make a kind of French 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.430
 zoff so take this computational games 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.520
 I still have a bit of hair now 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.880
 from the outside and then I leave the but 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.190
 whole strand of hair falling next to hair 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:38.200
 next to it and maybe quite normal 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:41.110
 And I explained that I am like that 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.880
 So it's really easy to become bad 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.730
 just jump from the outside in a few 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.220
 to take hair quite normally braid the 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.830
 Let go of the left strand 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.600
 take a few hairs and that's how it works 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.850
 then on and it's really a lot 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.630
 pretty pattern there are better too 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.210
 tutorials on youtube and others 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.180
 just pinned and son to the 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.790
 hair from it of course you can only 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.950
 hide because nail polish on full it 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.840
 lies that is the color paint 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.120
 and then I have my quick one 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.410
 Filmed outfit for you and every photo 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.919
 I'm sure you'll recognize me when you wake me up 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.130
 instagram follows a scarf comes unfortunately 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.720
 already from the last year but I am 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.970
 I still think it's still shaking 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.150
 he comes from gina jersey and i believe 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.270
 at that time 15 euro cost my advice is from 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.010
 mango and that is still up to date 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.130
 the shoes but I always show you 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.490
 again I have them there can something like 70 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.630
 but at times I wear also like 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.630
 why not completely honest 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.610
 and then I still have this blouse and 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.580
 how comes from how around or if it does 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.560
 boring and you definitely robert 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.330

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.770
