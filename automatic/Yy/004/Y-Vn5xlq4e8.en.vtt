00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
like you haven't read put that much

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
effort but it's still quite put together

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.930 
effort but it's still quite put together
at<00:00:40.289> the<00:00:40.379> same<00:00:40.530> time<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.979> that<00:00:41.100> makes<00:00:41.280> sense<00:00:41.489> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
at the same time if that makes sense so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.309 
at the same time if that makes sense so
this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> sort<00:00:42.539> of<00:00:42.600> finished<00:00:42.870> effect<00:00:43.170> that
