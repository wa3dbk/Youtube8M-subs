let's<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:37.020> reviewing<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.620> bait<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> pros

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
let's get reviewing this bait the pros

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.639 
let's get reviewing this bait the pros
and<00:00:39.360> cons<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.710> pearls<00:00:41.010> are<00:00:42.649> these

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and cons of it the pearls are these

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
and cons of it the pearls are these
ridges<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:46.129> how<00:00:47.129> would<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.399> explain<00:00:47.480> like

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
ridges like how would I explain like

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
ridges like how would I explain like
their<00:00:48.660> flaps<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> water<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.760> would

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
their flaps and in the water they would

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
their flaps and in the water they would
give<00:00:51.030> off<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.300> vibration<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.770> that's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
give off of vibration because that's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.840 
give off of vibration because that's
lower<00:00:53.340> than<00:00:54.260> these<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.530> goes<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:55.890> farther<00:00:56.219> so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
lower than these it goes down farther so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.939 
lower than these it goes down farther so
it's<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> catch<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.510> water<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.559> these

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it's going to catch more water but these

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
it's going to catch more water but these
are<00:00:59.070> still<00:00:59.219> gonna<00:00:59.309> catch<00:00:59.579> water<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> head

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
are still gonna catch water and the head

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
are still gonna catch water and the head
design<00:01:00.989> its<00:01:01.109> aerodynamic<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
design its aerodynamic so it's going to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.420 
design its aerodynamic so it's going to
cut<00:01:02.460> through<00:01:02.640> water<00:01:02.820> faster<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.129> tail

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
cut through water faster and this tail

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.770 
cut through water faster and this tail
it's<00:01:05.790> super<00:01:06.299> thin

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it's super thin

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
it's super thin
the<00:01:06.900> thinner<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> tail<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> better<00:01:08.000> I'll

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the thinner the tail the better I'll

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.780 
the thinner the tail the better I'll
show<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> stick<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:13.369> compare<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.640> how

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
show you a stick to compare to how

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.770 
show you a stick to compare to how
quickly<00:01:15.470> though<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.530> sizes<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.659> different

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
quickly though the sizes are different

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.420 
quickly though the sizes are different
this<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:22.549> 3<00:01:23.549> 4<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.030> 5<00:01:24.299> inches<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.430> Bannock

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this here is 3 4 to 5 inches and Bannock

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.810 
this here is 3 4 to 5 inches and Bannock
apparent<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.970> 4<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> different<00:01:29.640> but

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
apparent is 4 so not that different but

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.710 
apparent is 4 so not that different but
thickness<00:01:30.720> let's<00:01:31.350> compare<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.630 

comparing<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.810> thickness<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.439> it<00:01:38.640> yeah

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
comparing the thickness of it yeah

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.149 
comparing the thickness of it yeah
they're<00:01:39.850> both<00:01:40.000> then<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.600> start<00:01:40.900> out<00:01:41.159> but

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
they're both then you start out but

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.889 
they're both then you start out but
that's<00:01:42.340> thicker<00:01:42.670> it<00:01:42.820> gets<00:01:43.030> wider<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:43.659> just

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
that's thicker it gets wider this just

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.340 
that's thicker it gets wider this just
states<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.439> it's<00:01:45.189> a<00:01:45.250> little<00:01:45.460> bit<00:01:45.580> thicker<00:01:45.820> as

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
states then it's a little bit thicker as

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.830 
states then it's a little bit thicker as
it<00:01:47.350> goes<00:01:47.500> towards<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.060> link<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.330> tail<00:01:49.600> and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
it goes towards the link of the tail and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.320 
it goes towards the link of the tail and
the<00:01:50.649> pro<00:01:50.920> at<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.250> con<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
the pro at the con of this is that the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.440 
the pro at the con of this is that the
tails<00:01:52.570> thin<00:01:52.960> but<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.920> better<00:01:54.210> these<00:01:55.210> baits

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
tails thin but the better these baits

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.710 
tails thin but the better these baits
are<00:01:55.630> reasonable<00:01:56.110> where<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.470> bought<00:01:56.799> them<00:01:57.720> 369

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
are reasonable where I bought them 369

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.620 
are reasonable where I bought them 369
can't<00:01:59.439> see<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.710> but<00:01:59.890> 369<00:02:00.670> which<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.090> really

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
can't see it but 369 which is really

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.730 
can't see it but 369 which is really
reasonable<00:02:01.840> for<00:02:02.409> soft<00:02:03.100> plastic<00:02:03.610> it's<00:02:03.700> like

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
reasonable for soft plastic it's like

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.009 
reasonable for soft plastic it's like
like<00:02:05.909> straight<00:02:06.909> King<00:02:07.149> on<00:02:07.330> geureon<00:02:07.750> tomorrow

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
like straight King on geureon tomorrow

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.419 
like straight King on geureon tomorrow
you're<00:02:08.200> paying<00:02:08.440> for<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.679> name<00:02:08.890> not<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.220> bait

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
you're paying for the name not the bait

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.460 
you're paying for the name not the bait
soft<00:02:10.149> plastics<00:02:10.569> do<00:02:10.690> not<00:02:10.899> take<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.290> much

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
soft plastics do not take that much

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.449 
soft plastics do not take that much
money<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.800> me<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:13.709> figure<00:02:14.709> you're<00:02:15.100> not<00:02:15.220> using

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
money to me you figure you're not using

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.530 
money to me you figure you're not using
that<00:02:15.610> much<00:02:15.790> plastic<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:17.410> probably<00:02:17.799> close<00:02:17.950> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that much plastic it's probably close to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.660 
that much plastic it's probably close to
10<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.780> 30<00:02:20.019> cents<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.470> make<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.860> single<00:02:21.340> soft
