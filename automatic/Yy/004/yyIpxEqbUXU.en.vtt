00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.769
 very good to all to all friends and 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.429
 friends 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:20.460
 today reporting 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:23.680
 again progression 2015 because this time 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.890
 like vÃ©lez showing what stadiums are 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.360
 since they have confirmed that there will be 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.120
 again editors of stadiums and we 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.879
 had given clues in the gameplays as 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.129
 come there the good cameras in the star 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.970
 they had given us another good news is 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.970
 that the coaches come if the 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.980
 trainers serious for the first time if not 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:53.540
 I'm wrong the coaches arrive 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.260
 in the light of production soccer finally 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.140
 the coaches arrive to show 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.220
 how and when they enter the court with their 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.980
 good players among other things 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.050
 Well, I really do not know what they were 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.090
 exactly just with what several of 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.560
 the most prominent coaches 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 thinking about how how to get them to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.540
 you this message and we see again 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.650
 I put the stadium stadiums 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.430
 of Spain that are the most important 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.140
 back with what was the counter because 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 It has always been and therefore already in the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.540
 three and have already taken pictures of said 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.980
 stadium 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 well we see some of the coaches 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.690
 and that I wanted to give each feedback 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.750
 what were some clues that we got 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.960
 let's say what is here in the the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.180
 trailer we see the stadium if I'm not bad 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.150
 is the one with me that I always create for 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.460
 each saga of going to produce his soccer but 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.560
 we see if as the courts dictate 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.430
 what else can we see here we go for the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.979
 second part we see there we like how 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.050
 this list is made up with the same 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.600
 2014 valdepero and very different we see there 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.040
 It has some similarities but good 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.750
 have nothing else was that I wish they had 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.690
 liked the information I hope 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.490
 find me with more information and then 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.210
 I do not wish you liked the 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.870
 information the video they have 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.440
