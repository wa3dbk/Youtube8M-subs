00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Good day with you deagle 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.090
 Today I would like to show you the most 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.660
 powerful weapon in counter strike 1 6 i 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.839
 chose counter-terrorists because 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 it is they who have it all the strongest 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.130
 weapon and so let's start with a gun this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.750
 gun just now I tell you 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.750
 I will demonstrate how he shoots 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 at long range it is if you are 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 will shoot at the enemy which 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.830
 you will be imperishable you have little chance 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
 get there 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:53.989
 average distance is much better 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:58.710
 efficiency close range 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.430
 perfect shoots all point crosshairs 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.989
 hit 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.850
 clearly gun possess silencer 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:11.820
 muffles the sound and in my opinion and scatter 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:18.259
 see less distance even further 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.259
 there was now going to the next gun 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 this gun I did not pay attention to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.270
 I do not remember the name b-228 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.980
 distances 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.890
 if one patron is enough 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.920
 performed well on the middle 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 distance is also not bad shoots and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.950
 observe but scatter on medium and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.880
 close range he has more than that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.680
 Esther is such a secret that when you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.570
 are sitting 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.420
 the spread decreases that is in such 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.840
 tempe nastrelyat proceed to the next 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.510
 the last coolest pistol 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.510
 this game is you all guessed it 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.350
 desert eagle 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.350
 bought patrol here 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.050
 This is the most destructive pistol in this game. 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:36.300
 the longest distance of course is lame 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.330
 but if you can wait right in the head 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.620
 bathe of such a secret in this gun 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:49.560
 the first bullet always flies exactly target 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:55.350
 how would you about to go and I will 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.980
 aim drawn texture or 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.970
 the logo will now see the first cartridge 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.970
 will definitely not fall 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:19.240
 but this is only the first season all the following 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:25.200
 I think this is the first one that's all 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.200
 follow so now let's go to arms 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.030
 rifles so i would like to point out 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.630
 m41 is the most modern rifle 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:50.200
 has a silencer players love 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.970
 shoot me she is also my very 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:04:09.010
 favorite rifle now tell you why 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:10.780
 it has very little scatter on 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.190
 long and short range 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.800
 this weapon is very effective and killer 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.250
 damage decent scorpion with good then 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:26.790
 there is even if the damage was small 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:30.280
 would be enough to kill the enemy 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.140
 move on to the same time ends 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.140
 wait an hour more 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:49.889
 it's in Kiev 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.199
 and forehead or counter strike source 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.009
 there was a bottom bullpup that's just 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:59.039
 the system is the same good enough 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.690
 the rifle you all know why i exactly 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:06.720
 she chose her with a telescopic sight 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.819
 this rifle is good as a medium one 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.910
 distance 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:14.160
 such natal well on my neighbor I would not 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.250
 said that it is very good because 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.370
 she has scatter if you like her 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.180
 better shoot one bullet 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.750
 or take turns ok very fast all 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:33.300
 this is how you see on sight 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:35.479
 good rifle possesses aiming so 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.970
 move on to the next rifle and 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.210
 final as you already understood it but 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.210
 So 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.330

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.450
 showed how to not shoot if you do not 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.960
 know see why i marked this 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.410
 Sulfuric rifles big lethal force then 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.170
 eat from one shot to the head 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:14.680
 calm you can hit on my 70 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:18.230
 percent in life it is immediately peculiar 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.270
 aim she hasdock rifle fine 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.550
 someone 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:35.300
 ideally always hits the target but 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:38.030
 Now I'm in the main percentage of the bone 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:47.540
 there is accuracy with her but I do not become 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:50.210
 that in general already but very good all
