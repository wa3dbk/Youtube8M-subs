ago<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> notice<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> don't

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
ago and now I notice that when I don't

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.990 
ago and now I notice that when I don't
use<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.180> my<00:01:57.509> skin<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.439> feels<00:01:59.000> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
use it it my skin really just feels you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.380 
use it it my skin really just feels you
know<00:02:00.030> dry<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.990> doesn't<00:02:01.290> look<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.649> bright<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
know dry and doesn't look as bright so I

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
know dry and doesn't look as bright so I
really<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.469> something<00:02:05.399> else

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
really think it's this something else

really think it's this something else
that<00:02:05.700> I've<00:02:05.820> noticed

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620

I've also gone back to using primers for

eyeshadow<00:04:31.699> primer<00:04:32.330> potion<00:04:32.810> um<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.800> couple<00:04:34.039> I

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
eyeshadow primer potion um a couple I

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.909 
eyeshadow primer potion um a couple I
think<00:04:34.910> earlier<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.539> month<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.080> this

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
think earlier in the month and this

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.800 
think earlier in the month and this
isn't<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.280> color<00:04:37.490> Eden<00:04:38.000> which<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.479> just<00:04:38.660> like

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
isn't the color Eden which is just like

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.100 
isn't the color Eden which is just like
a<00:04:38.840> really<00:04:39.220> light<00:04:41.620> skin<00:04:42.620> color<00:04:43.750> at<00:04:44.750> first<00:04:44.990> I

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
a really light skin color at first I

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.810 
a really light skin color at first I
thought<00:04:45.229> it<00:04:45.289> was<00:04:45.440> really<00:04:45.710> too<00:04:46.160> light<00:04:46.550> for<00:04:46.580> me

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
thought it was really too light for me

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.600 
thought it was really too light for me
but<00:04:47.590> once<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.710> smooth<00:04:48.949> it<00:04:49.039> out<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.400> kind<00:04:49.580> of

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
but once you smooth it out it kind of

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.060 
but once you smooth it out it kind of
just<00:04:49.789> ones<00:04:50.060> out<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.509> then<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:50.900> really<00:04:51.440> does

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
just ones out and then this really does

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.589 
just ones out and then this really does
make<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.400> difference<00:04:52.669> in<00:04:52.970> your<00:04:53.000> eyeshadow

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
make a difference in your eyeshadow

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.659 
make a difference in your eyeshadow
especially<00:04:54.289> since<00:04:54.710> now<00:04:54.979> I've<00:04:55.160> kind<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.520> been

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
especially since now I've kind of been

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.100 
especially since now I've kind of been
going<00:04:56.000> back<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.360> using<00:04:56.630> more<00:04:56.930> eyeshadow

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
going back to using more eyeshadow

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.230 
going back to using more eyeshadow
whereas<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:58.039> little<00:04:58.639> bit<00:04:58.759> before<00:04:58.910> it<00:04:59.150> was

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
whereas a little bit before it was

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.740 
whereas a little bit before it was
really<00:04:59.419> just<00:04:59.570> um<00:05:00.400> liner<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.789> mascara<00:05:02.090> and

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
really just um liner and mascara and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.820 
really just um liner and mascara and
that<00:05:03.349> was<00:05:03.470> it<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.430> I've<00:05:04.789> been<00:05:05.270> really<00:05:05.830> using

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
that was it but I've been really using

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.740 
that was it but I've been really using
things<00:05:07.370> like<00:05:07.460> my<00:05:07.669> makeup<00:05:08.030> palette<00:05:08.419> a<00:05:08.509> little

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
things like my makeup palette a little

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.620 
things like my makeup palette a little
bit<00:05:08.870> more<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:10.370> know<00:05:10.460> just<00:05:10.699> other<00:05:11.150> shadows

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
bit more and you know just other shadows

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.040 
bit more and you know just other shadows
and<00:05:11.900> using<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:12.949> primer<00:05:13.190> really<00:05:13.639> helps<00:05:14.090> before<00:05:15.020> I

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
and using a primer really helps before I

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.900 
and using a primer really helps before I
started<00:05:15.410> using<00:05:15.620> this<00:05:15.860> again<00:05:16.160> I<00:05:16.310> noticed<00:05:16.669> that

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
started using this again I noticed that

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.370 
started using this again I noticed that
when<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.210> would<00:05:17.419> look<00:05:17.509> in<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.720> mirror<00:05:17.930> halfway

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
when I would look in the mirror halfway

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.990 
when I would look in the mirror halfway
through<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.680> day<00:05:18.710> my<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.099> show<00:05:19.460> is<00:05:19.610> just<00:05:19.729> either

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
through the day my I show is just either

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.779 
through the day my I show is just either
completely<00:05:20.510> gone<00:05:20.780> or<00:05:21.169> it's<00:05:21.770> moved<00:05:22.159> and<00:05:22.699> it

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
completely gone or it's moved and it

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.399 
completely gone or it's moved and it
just<00:05:22.940> doesn't<00:05:23.270> look<00:05:23.360> anything<00:05:23.659> like<00:05:23.870> it<00:05:24.050> did

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
just doesn't look anything like it did

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.620 
just doesn't look anything like it did
when<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.860> first<00:05:25.130> put<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.699> on<00:05:25.820> so<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.150> s<00:05:26.330> why<00:05:26.599> I

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
when I first put it on so it s why I

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.439 
when I first put it on so it s why I
pick<00:05:26.900> this<00:05:27.110> up<00:05:27.349> and<00:05:27.620> you<00:05:28.550> really<00:05:28.849> can<00:05:29.120> tell<00:05:29.419> a

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
pick this up and you really can tell a

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.060 
pick this up and you really can tell a
difference<00:05:29.539> between<00:05:30.260> when<00:05:30.380> you<00:05:30.470> use<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.740> primer

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
difference between when you use a primer

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.480 
difference between when you use a primer
potion<00:05:31.370> or<00:05:31.789> any<00:05:32.570> sort<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:32.900> primer<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:33.500> then

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
potion or any sort of primer and then

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.250 
potion or any sort of primer and then
when<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:34.820> don't<00:05:35.090> it<00:05:35.360> just<00:05:35.659> gives<00:05:35.810> your

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
when you don't it just gives your

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.200 
when you don't it just gives your
eyeshadow<00:05:36.889> like<00:05:37.099> a<00:05:37.130> good<00:05:37.400> base<00:05:37.669> to<00:05:37.909> cling<00:05:38.180> to

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
eyeshadow like a good base to cling to

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.689 
eyeshadow like a good base to cling to
and<00:05:38.840> it<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.860> ends<00:05:40.099> up<00:05:40.130> looking<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.490> lot
