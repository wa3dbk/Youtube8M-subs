and we're off into a boost okay well one

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
and we're off into a boost okay well one
thing<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.910> do<00:01:42.149> is<00:01:42.179> we<00:01:43.050> can<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
thing I like to do is we can use the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.900 
thing I like to do is we can use the
speed<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> baton<00:01:44.250> bill<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.759> get

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
speed of the baton bill to really get

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.320 
speed of the baton bill to really get
massive<00:01:45.780> glide<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:47.030> retain<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.179> that

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
massive glide off retain all that

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.240 
massive glide off retain all that
forward<00:01:48.600> momentum<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.560> massive<00:01:50.039> height

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
forward momentum and get massive height

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.149 
forward momentum and get massive height
of<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.289> go<00:01:52.380> fast<00:01:52.710> or

have here which is like a 180

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.980 
have here which is like a 180
graph-based<00:02:04.610> does<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> flip<00:02:06.329> 180<00:02:06.630> keep

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
graph-based does that to flip 180 keep

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.690 
graph-based does that to flip 180 keep
on<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.890> changing<00:02:08.190> direction<00:02:08.310> quickly
