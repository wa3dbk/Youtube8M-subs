00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
tower it's quite a enclosed area where

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.190 
tower it's quite a enclosed area where

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
t-bolt spawn location this now what's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.790 
t-bolt spawn location this now what's
going<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.660> start<00:02:36.930> getting<00:02:37.170> into<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> middle

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
going to start getting into the middle

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.890 
going to start getting into the middle
of<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.250> map<00:02:38.640> there's<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.450> lot<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.630> fighting

normally going on around here especially
around<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.670> m32<00:02:42.240> hammer<00:02:42.630> area<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:44.190> has<00:02:44.370> got

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
around the m32 hammer area it has got

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.490 
around the m32 hammer area it has got
more<00:02:44.760> poor<00:02:45.060> side<00:02:45.360> routes<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.380> as<00:02:46.470> well

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
more poor side routes to it as well

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.670 
more poor side routes to it as well
here's<00:02:47.160> one<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.520> example<00:02:48.030> come<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.680> from

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
here's one for example come in from

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.140 
here's one for example come in from
underneath<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.430> turret<00:02:50.760> area<00:02:52.610> basically<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
underneath the turret area basically the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.440 
underneath the turret area basically the
center<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> map<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.530> building<00:02:56.010> here

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
center of the map is this building here

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.480 
center of the map is this building here
it's<00:02:57.450> central<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.260> map<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.680> most

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
it's central to the map and most

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.760 
it's central to the map and most
fighting<00:02:59.940> happens<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.810> around<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.470> area

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
fighting happens in and around this area

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.520 
fighting happens in and around this area
the<00:03:02.490> only<00:03:02.700> trouble<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.150> although<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:04.050> has<00:03:04.260> got

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
the only trouble is although it has got

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.770 
the only trouble is although it has got
cover<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.520> not<00:03:05.790> completely<00:03:06.150> protected

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
cover it is not completely protected

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.920 
cover it is not completely protected
from<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.800> snipers<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.330> underneath<00:03:09.720> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
from the snipers this is underneath the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.200 
from the snipers this is underneath the
building<00:03:10.050> inside<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:11.310> very<00:03:11.700> cramped<00:03:12.120> an

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
building inside it is very cramped an

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.860 
building inside it is very cramped an
enclosed<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.500> team<00:03:14.130> objectives<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
enclosed and in team objectives a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.560 
enclosed and in team objectives a
shotgun<00:03:15.870> spawns<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.380> here<00:03:17.240> this<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
shotgun spawns in here this is the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.200 
shotgun spawns in here this is the
courtyard<00:03:19.020> next<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.680> building<00:03:20.210> another

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
courtyard next to the building another

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.150 
courtyard next to the building another
place<00:03:21.570> full<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.200> fighting<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.890> rocket

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
place full of fighting the rocket

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.250 
place full of fighting the rocket
launcher<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.640> also<00:03:24.060> spawning<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.080> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
launcher is also spawning in this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.350 
launcher is also spawning in this
location<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.980> people<00:03:26.370> tend<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.790> go<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.030> that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
location so people tend to go to that

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.520 
location so people tend to go to that
again<00:03:28.290> as<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:29.100> can<00:03:29.250> see<00:03:29.490> there<00:03:29.970> are<00:03:30.000> numerous

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
again as you can see there are numerous

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.060 
again as you can see there are numerous
side<00:03:31.530> passages<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.360> allows<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:34.070> people

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
side passages so this allows for people

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.830 
side passages so this allows for people
who<00:03:35.220> prefer<00:03:35.520> close-range<00:03:36.060> combat<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.600> break

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
who prefer close-range combat to break

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.410 
who prefer close-range combat to break

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
guns and snipers these areas are also

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.480 
guns and snipers these areas are also
quite<00:03:42.990> useful<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:43.740> people<00:03:43.890> wanting<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.310> get

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
quite useful for people wanting to get

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.330

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
the order stealth kill if you're lucky

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.400 
the order stealth kill if you're lucky
enough<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.130> get<00:03:53.250> them<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:54.810> little<00:03:55.110> area<00:03:55.230> here

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
enough to get them this little area here

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
it's that is the most
