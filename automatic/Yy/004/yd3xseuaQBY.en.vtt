right<00:00:00.149> alright<00:00:00.719> what<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.170> do<00:00:01.380> is

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
right alright what we're going to do is

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.550 
right alright what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.770> start<00:00:03.170> separating<00:00:04.170> and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
we're going to start separating and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.769 
we're going to start separating and
processing<00:00:05.279> some<00:00:05.819> fibers<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> yucca

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
processing some fibers of the yucca

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.640 
processing some fibers of the yucca
plant<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:07.859> we<00:00:07.919> can<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.189> some<00:00:08.370> soap<00:00:09.650> I'm

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
plant so that we can have some soap I'm

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.589 
plant so that we can have some soap I'm
using<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.130> wood<00:00:11.429> base<00:00:11.849> because<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.480> is

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
using a wood base because this is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.490 
using a wood base because this is
basically<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.259> same<00:00:13.769> principle<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:15.500> cordage

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
basically the same principle as cordage

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.650 
basically the same principle as cordage
processing<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.520> really<00:00:18.330> don't<00:00:18.480> want<00:00:18.600> to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
processing and you really don't want to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.609 
processing and you really don't want to
disturb<00:00:19.199> or<00:00:19.619> damage<00:00:20.779> your<00:00:21.779> internal<00:00:22.199> fibers

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
disturb or damage your internal fibers

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.900 
disturb or damage your internal fibers
because<00:00:22.800> kind<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.189> beats<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.519> purpose

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
because kind of just beats the purpose

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
because kind of just beats the purpose
if<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> plan<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.570> making<00:00:24.900> cord<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.410> this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.690 

you<00:00:59.930> see<00:01:00.140> how<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.320> outer<00:01:00.710> shape<00:01:01.160> is<00:01:01.370> coming

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
you see how the outer shape is coming

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.580 
you see how the outer shape is coming
off<00:01:01.880> and<00:01:03.339> we've<00:01:04.339> got<00:01:04.519> this<00:01:04.790> area<00:01:05.000> here<00:01:05.590> that

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
off and we've got this area here that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.140 
off and we've got this area here that
all<00:01:06.710> we<00:01:06.830> have<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.100> really<00:01:07.340> do<00:01:07.490> is<00:01:07.580> just<00:01:07.610> scrape

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
all we have to really do is just scrape

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:20.530 
all we have to really do is just scrape
it<00:01:08.330> off<00:01:08.450> just<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.780> little<00:01:08.810> bit<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:18.520> nice<00:01:19.540> there

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
it off just a little bit and nice there

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.040 
it off just a little bit and nice there

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.330 

all<00:01:27.050> right<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:27.530> we're<00:01:27.710> just<00:01:27.860> going<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.040> scrape

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
all right now we're just going to scrape

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:40.660 
all right now we're just going to scrape
off<00:01:28.580> that<00:01:28.880> outer<00:01:29.060> shape<00:01:39.250> see<00:01:40.250> this<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.550> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
off that outer shape see this is the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.969 
off that outer shape see this is the
same<00:01:40.910> steps<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.950> take<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.009> process<00:01:43.520> cordage

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
same steps you take to process cordage

00:01:44.979 --> 00:02:18.210 
same steps you take to process cordage
except<00:01:45.979> we're<00:01:46.399> just<00:01:46.610> getting<00:01:46.880> soaked

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.650 

cutting<00:02:19.060> rock<00:02:19.240> looks<00:02:19.540> pretty<00:02:19.810> good<00:02:20.200> yep

cutting rock looks pretty good yep
wanted<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.050> tip<00:02:23.320> off<00:02:23.500> there<00:02:23.830> because

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
wanted to get that tip off there because

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.340 
wanted to get that tip off there because
you<00:02:24.220> see<00:02:24.370> how<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.730> there<00:02:25.120> too<00:02:25.360> bound

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
you see how that is there too bound

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.470 
you see how that is there too bound
together<00:02:29.670> okay<00:02:30.670> now<00:02:30.850> we<00:02:30.910> take<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.200 

you<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.370> work<00:02:42.610> them<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.880> your<00:02:43.030> hand<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.940> see

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
you just work them in your hand you see

00:02:46.210 --> 00:03:16.039 
you just work them in your hand you see
them<00:02:46.300> lathering<00:02:46.750> up<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:50.680> soap

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.449 

but<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.170> use<00:03:17.349> this<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:17.860> soap<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.220> work

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
but to use this for soap you just work

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.380 
but to use this for soap you just work
up<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.790> lather<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.360> wash<00:03:23.140> yourself<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:23.739> it

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
up a lather and wash yourself with it

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.309 
up a lather and wash yourself with it
see<00:03:25.390> how<00:03:25.480> much<00:03:25.629> is<00:03:25.810> in<00:03:25.989> there

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
see how much is in there

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.390 
see how much is in there
so<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.079> keep<00:03:29.349> working<00:03:29.590> up<00:03:29.920> more<00:03:30.189> and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
so you just keep working up more and

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:47.770 
so you just keep working up more and
more

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.430 

oh<00:03:47.870> by<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.680> way<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.340> also<00:03:49.490> a<00:03:49.670> fish<00:03:49.940> poison

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
oh by the way this is also a fish poison

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:00.280 
oh by the way this is also a fish poison
fish<00:03:51.440> poison<00:03:51.860> yes

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.839 

is<00:04:00.830> that<00:04:01.010> good<00:04:01.310> or<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:02.450> can<00:04:02.629> use<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.049> for

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
is that good or that you can use it for

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.910 
is that good or that you can use it for
for<00:04:04.849> fishing<00:04:05.299> but<00:04:06.230> you'd<00:04:06.379> actually<00:04:06.500> have<00:04:06.799> to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
for fishing but you'd actually have to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.539 
for fishing but you'd actually have to
block<00:04:07.280> off<00:04:07.579> an<00:04:07.790> entire<00:04:08.090> area<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:09.470> just<00:04:09.549> this

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
block off an entire area and just this

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:18.750 
block off an entire area and just this
much<00:04:10.849> isn't<00:04:11.090> enough<00:04:11.420> for<00:04:11.569> her<00:04:11.689> anything

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.730 

you'd<00:04:19.300> take<00:04:19.540> literally<00:04:19.870> hundreds<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.620> these

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:20.740 
you'd take literally hundreds of these

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:34.659 
you'd take literally hundreds of these
to<00:04:21.010> be<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.250> job

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.420 

you<00:04:35.240> see<00:04:35.780> how<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.080> just<00:04:36.199> lathers<00:04:36.710> up<00:04:36.740> just<00:04:37.280> like

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
you see how it just lathers up just like

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.050 
you see how it just lathers up just like
soap<00:04:38.979> you've<00:04:39.979> actually<00:04:40.159> got<00:04:40.520> several

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
soap you've actually got several

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:59.250 
soap you've actually got several
washings<00:04:41.539> in<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:44.650> cool

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:11.420 

so<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.890> just<00:05:00.100> keeps<00:05:00.280> coming

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:27.700 

and<00:05:12.430> it<00:05:12.580> does<00:05:12.820> work

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:36.520 

getting<00:05:28.460> down<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.910> end<00:05:29.090> of<00:05:29.240> it<00:05:29.330> here

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:46.719 

but<00:05:37.160> yeah<00:05:37.370> now<00:05:37.580> we're<00:05:37.730> ready<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.030> make<00:05:38.240> poured

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.789 

Oh
