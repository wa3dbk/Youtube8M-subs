00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
later on after unlocking there quite a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.179 
later on after unlocking there quite a
lot<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.490> its<00:01:20.729> attachments<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.689> wasn't<00:01:21.930> all

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
lot of its attachments and it wasn't all

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.620 
lot of its attachments and it wasn't all
quite<00:01:23.189> later<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> tried<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.330> yet

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
quite later on that I tried out the yet

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600 
quite later on that I tried out the yet
the<00:01:24.659> ACR<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.070> amazed<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the ACR and I was amazed at the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.760 
the ACR and I was amazed at the
difference<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:28.140> actually<00:01:28.290> damaged

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
difference that that actually damaged

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.999 
difference that that actually damaged
damage<00:01:29.670> makes<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.470> notice<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
damage makes you do you don't notice the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.230 
damage makes you do you don't notice the
yet<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> slightly<00:01:33.950> slightly<00:01:34.950> more<00:01:35.250> recoil<00:01:35.670> in

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
yet the slightly slightly more recoil in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
yet the slightly slightly more recoil in
comparison<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> m4<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.130> main<00:01:38.310> thing

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
comparison to the m4 but the main thing

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 
comparison to the m4 but the main thing
you<00:01:38.970> notice<00:01:39.329> when<00:01:39.630> switching<00:01:40.110> from<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> m4<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
you notice when switching from the m4 to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.240 
you notice when switching from the m4 to
the<00:01:41.009> ACR<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.180> higher<00:01:42.720> damage<00:01:43.079> output<00:01:43.290> he

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the ACR is that higher damage output he

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.620 
the ACR is that higher damage output he
seems<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.549> drop<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> from<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> lot

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
seems to drop you from a lot more a lot

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.800 
seems to drop you from a lot more a lot
quicker<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.439> takes<00:01:46.740> kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.520> less<00:01:47.700> less<00:01:48.479> shots

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
quicker it takes kind of less less shots

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
quicker it takes kind of less less shots
to<00:01:48.990> kill<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.860> firefights<00:01:50.399> against<00:01:50.729> people<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to kill in firefights against people so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
to kill in firefights against people so
that's<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.710> probably<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.220> main<00:01:53.369> reason

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that's that's probably the main reason

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.490 
that's that's probably the main reason
why<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.240> my

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
than the m4 they study aim perk just

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.930 
than the m4 they study aim perk just
decreases<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.830> recoil<00:04:07.220> when<00:04:07.370> when

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
decreases the recoil when when

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.540 
decreases the recoil when when
down<00:04:08.210> site<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.870> makes<00:04:09.100> makes<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.250> Rico<00:04:10.520> a

down site so it makes makes the Rico a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.730 
down site so it makes makes the Rico a
lot<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:11.060> lot<00:04:11.300> less<00:04:11.510> intrusive<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.350> helps

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
lot a lot less intrusive it helps

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.980 
lot a lot less intrusive it helps
connect<00:04:13.670> your<00:04:13.760> targets<00:04:14.120> when<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:14.420> kind<00:04:14.840> of
