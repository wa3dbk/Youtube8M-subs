00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.790 
this is my old hotter so this aluminium
part<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:45.030> goes<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> bottom<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.739> the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
part it goes to the bottom and on the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.380 
part it goes to the bottom and on the
top<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:48.690> fix<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.140> cheat<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:50.670> think<00:02:51.209> I

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
top you you fix that cheat I think I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.410 
top you you fix that cheat I think I
guess<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.260> protect<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
guess it's just to protect it and the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.009 
guess it's just to protect it and the
cable<00:02:54.810> goes<00:02:55.019> in<00:02:55.230> here<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:57.019> put

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
cable goes in here and you just put

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.170 
cable goes in here and you just put
everything<00:02:58.320> back<00:02:58.739> together<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.600> should<00:03:00.600> work

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
everything back together and should work

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.940 
everything back together and should work
in<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.810> minute<00:03:03.989> okay

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
