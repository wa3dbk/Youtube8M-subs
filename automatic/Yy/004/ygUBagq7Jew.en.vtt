opportunity<00:02:12.320> for<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> Dorjan<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:14.120> then<00:02:14.239> comes

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
opportunity for a Dorjan and then comes

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.740 
opportunity for a Dorjan and then comes
kind<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.660> Cody<00:02:15.050> Oh<00:02:16.120> real<00:02:17.120> chance<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
kind of Cody Oh real chance of the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.630 
kind of Cody Oh real chance of the
skipper<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.140> equalize<00:02:18.590> well<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
skipper to equalize well I think the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.220 
skipper to equalize well I think the
angle<00:02:19.970> was<00:02:20.180> just<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.630> little<00:02:20.870> bit<00:02:20.989> too<00:02:21.200> tight

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
angle was just a little bit too tight

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.160 
angle was just a little bit too tight
from<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.830> pick<00:02:22.100> out<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.459> corner<00:02:22.989> Brian<00:02:23.989> move

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
from to pick out that corner Brian move

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.490 
from to pick out that corner Brian move
