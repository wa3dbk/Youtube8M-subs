00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello then review of the lipsticks mule me 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.429
 if you have 12 large assortment of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:17.039
 colors you go from judo to these skins to the 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.220
 opa green obviously couldn't have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 a better name than what I have 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.500
 applied now what I have on 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.570
 lips is flamingo the number 09 at the end 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.420
 of the video and I would find paice elves that I have 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.270
 made with lipsticks because I have to say 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.600
 that I tried them chiti is why we are there 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.440
 I also spent a while to do this 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 review 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.510
 first I want to congratulate the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.879
 dinner because finally there are in Italy 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.730
 there is the possibility of taking that already 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 having the chance is a great thing 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 buy lipsticks other than the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 usually red that is not the usual news 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.119
 there are also those, however, there are colors 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 even less portable in quotation marks 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.270
 because in the end everything is really 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.500
 subjective here it seems superfluous to say that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 a green is not as portable as a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.409
 red but I repeat already have the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.040
 possibility of taking a lipstick 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.520
 green if i want it is a me 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.210
 great thing and must be must 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.189
 be appreciated because risk with 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.640
 make up is not for everyone 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.700
 let's move on to mine 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.159
 to my review on these aspects are 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:53.490
 all matte lipsticks see that free 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:56.850
 tv now that the classic red of 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.060
 then applying it collection has a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 very particular effect the consistency 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 creamy by applying them you have to stay a while 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.670
 more careful don't just slip 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.320
 very good on the lips but this is the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.140
 consistency and the n 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.390
 depends very much on the formulation from 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.410
 fact, however, that they are few 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.150
 a little more full-bodied and compared to many 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.850
 others support lipsticks to many others 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.940
 formulations are not true or seven between 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.239
 so much to keep this in mind 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 does not mean that they dry their lips if 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.230
 let them be dry lips 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.269
 you have to pay attention because 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.430
 surely they are not lipsticks that 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.230
 they give hydration that moisturize the lips 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.060
 but I always recommend always in 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.190
 these cases with these types of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.590
 lipsticks to scrub if you are 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.799
 they want to apply and are not the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.230
 lips are a problem of of lips 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.360
 dried or with the passing of the 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.790
 hours feels anyway lips start to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.160
 pull apply a very light mo 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.690
 really light lip balm 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.239
 and of course the finish changes though 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.430
 at least they remain pleasant on the lips 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.790
 matte lipsticks 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.519
 they are really very beautiful also because 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.570
 even in this case it is not always easy 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.820
 find dull lipsticks like that 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.780
 of such vibrant collaborations that 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.859
 are opaque and are covering because 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.350
 these lipsticks are really opaque 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:46.740
 what I like least but 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.770
 you will be surprises and think maybe oh well 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:55.650
 knowing me maybe I don't have to say that 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:04:00.030
 lily this here that a lot lilac 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:07.460
 clear is that then go see the 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.460
 photo the one I think gives less 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.990
 to complexions and I must say that I have it 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.840
 tried on mine and i really am 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.320
 very clear makes me the effect precisely the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.640
 typical eighties lipstick effect no 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.740
 super clear lips serves and I do it 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:32.160
 I'd call that a lot of salmon too 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.820
 particular as color there is no 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.780
 other color than right now 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.780
 least I can think of 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.150
 and that it can approach this color 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.550
 as for news 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:54.060
 I must say that I personally prefer a 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:58.290
 skin skin and is a little more like rosÃ© 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.470
 as a shade therefore more suitable 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.810
 girls very blonde girls 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.960
 clearer still clearer than me instead 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:12.450
 I find that mou is a good universal with 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.120
 this fishing undertone 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.030
 I really like the niod very much 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.640
 they prefer others like pretty woman 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:29.040
 like marilyn they are colors anyway 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:34.310
 most common are the most common colors 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.289
 definitely not to be found 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.160
 compared to other shades I have 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.460
 showed 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:48.509
 I find that the duration is indeed very much 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:53.070
 good i used don't remember if i remember 6 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:56.729
 marilyn maybe marilyn and I went alone 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.509
 from the outside I practically used it 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.699
 all day I ate drank 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.979
 and at the end of the day you could see 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:09.030
 again this is a particular thing 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:13.740
 obviously it wasn't perfect but later 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.110
 those those five six hours and after 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.370
 to have especially after eating 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:23.250
 drunk was still there so I wanted it 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.539
 just try this so yes you are 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.669
 hours 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.160
 a 6 hours obviously I repeat it was not 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.900
 perfect though it was still compared to 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.620
 many other colors, many other lipsticks 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.479
 that go away much faster and it is 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.889
 I hope that the review was useful 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:42.889
 I leave to the self with the set 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.889
 Hello
