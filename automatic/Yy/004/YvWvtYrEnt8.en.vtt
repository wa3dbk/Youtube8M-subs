00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone with you and mayor today i 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
 I would like to talk about simulator battles 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.929
 as you should be aware of airplanes 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.969
 we have a similar mode where there is no 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.700
 familiar to us aiming with the mouse 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.770
 or just pm people fly there new you 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.369
 on the joystick oh and some on the mouse 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.500
 gioia 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.689
 but then something I went deep into the planes 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.359
 still this video will be 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.119
 about tanks and a simulator us battle mode 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.310
 it is in them so let's start consider 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.309
 all the same what is remarkable given 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.840
 mode in the tanks and what new sensations he 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.820
 can we bring 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.879
 Naturally I would like to start with 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.379
 appearance as we know in rb mode 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.660
 we are a third-person view 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.360
 but here we have another thing after all this 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 Simulator and this type can not be in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.190
 In this case, as you could see, 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 video cameras located above the tank 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.410
 this way we get the view from 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 commander's eye well, and the second kind of course 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.239
 This is a view from the sniper scope, but also once 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.670
 so touched sight it is worth mentioning that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 at the sight of so to speak from the eyes of the commander 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 we see a marker in front of us 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 aiming probably many with me 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.340
 would agree that this is somewhat wrong 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.040
 have this aiming marker i hope 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.710
 in the future it will be removed all the same, we must 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.110
 understand that this is a test and that in the future 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.689
 may all change the next item 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610
 our review is a minimap like you 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.100
 see it is located on the bottom right 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.680
 she is not lost on her 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.110
 displayed as a marker of allies and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.869
 marker enemies however it is worth noting that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.600
 enemy markers are marked but it is personally 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.759
 it feels too early for me 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.040
 have you seemed to notice the enemy 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 Yes, and like with the team no one had time 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 notice on the minimap it is already displayed 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 on the other hand there is a place 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 pumping the crew itself but we have something 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.220
 still simulator battles and here the main 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.530
 the role must be played by the player himself therefore I 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.469
 would suggest removing the display altogether 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.990
 markers on the minimap namely markers 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.090
 enemies but instead add function 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 when an enemy is found in any 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.710
 the square on the minimap it starts 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.410
 displayed in red which means that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.300
 there is an enemy so it turns out 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.200
 that light tanks that are not particularly 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.420
 in demand 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.000
 he is in Arcadia or in realistic fights 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.550
 seeing their thin armor and weak gun 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.290
 will be demanded in simulators for 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.319
 intelligence or for a quick attack 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.360
 opponent in the flank or stella now 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.430
 what about management in this 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.800
 moment with it all just we press 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.959
 button forward the tank goes ahead and also 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.840
 back to side left generally as in r &amp; b 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.269
 mode in my opinion for simul 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.819
 fighting is somewhat casual but we know 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.280
 that the gear shift function is already 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.069
 is in the game and I hope that soon 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.980
 time and and add to this mode so what 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.540
 are like the most important thing I told you that 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.329
 there is a simulator 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.880
 heaven and now and what could be in them 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.739
 improve late would like to add that u 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.260
 we are now still a test and 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.720
 I repeat in the future may be all on 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.180
 much better and maintaining this mode 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.440
 let and in a somewhat casual way already 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.840
 can not but rejoice 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.269
 on this i had everything with you mr and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.489
 I hope you like the video set 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.329
 likes subscribe to the channel and see you 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.329
 in sight
