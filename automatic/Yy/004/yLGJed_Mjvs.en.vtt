hi<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.260> session<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.680> gonna<00:00:01.800> cover<00:00:01.920> how<00:00:02.190> to

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hi in a session I'm gonna cover how to

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.760 
hi in a session I'm gonna cover how to
create<00:00:02.460> some<00:00:02.850> custom<00:00:03.090> number<00:00:03.810> formatting<00:00:04.350> for

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
create some custom number formatting for

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.130 
create some custom number formatting for
your<00:00:04.950> chart<00:00:05.250> axes<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.899> was<00:00:07.109> a

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
your chart axes and this was a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.379 
your chart axes and this was a
suggestion<00:00:07.620> from<00:00:07.859> one<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.490> my<00:00:08.550> subscribers<00:00:08.610> so

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
suggestion from one of my subscribers so

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.169 
suggestion from one of my subscribers so
I<00:00:09.420> thought<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.990> would<00:00:10.349> look<00:00:11.070> into<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.670> put

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
I thought I would look into it and put

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.629 
I thought I would look into it and put
together<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.570> short<00:00:12.990> video<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:14.250> let's<00:00:14.490> say<00:00:14.610> for

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
together a short video so let's say for

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.890 
together a short video so let's say for
example<00:00:15.109> you<00:00:16.109> wanted<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.800> highlight<00:00:17.690> when<00:00:18.690> one

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
example you wanted to highlight when one

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.830 
example you wanted to highlight when one
of<00:00:18.990> these<00:00:19.080> bars<00:00:19.410> exceeded<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.699> went<00:00:21.480> below<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
of these bars exceeded or went below a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
of these bars exceeded or went below a
certain<00:00:22.380> threshold<00:00:22.529> let's<00:00:23.340> say<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.580> example

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
certain threshold let's say for example

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640 
certain threshold let's say for example
you<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> target<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.230> almost<00:00:25.380> like

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
you have a target and it's almost like

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.650 
you have a target and it's almost like
conditional<00:00:26.130> formatting<00:00:26.609> where<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.060> maybe

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
conditional formatting where if maybe

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.779 
conditional formatting where if maybe
you<00:00:27.930> had<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.220> example<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.640> this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you had it for example in this

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.060 
you had it for example in this
particular<00:00:30.480> example<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.289> had<00:00:31.470> sales<00:00:31.800> that

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
particular example if we had sales that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.250 
particular example if we had sales that
exceeded<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.790> certain<00:00:32.820> amount<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.480> want<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
exceeded a certain amount you want the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.250 
exceeded a certain amount you want the
color<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.370> green<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> went

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
color here to be green and if it went

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
color here to be green and if it went
below<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> target<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> want<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> color<00:00:38.850> here

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
below a target you want the color here

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
below a target you want the color here
to<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.300> red<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.750> let's<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.290> ahead<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.980> how

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to be red so let's go ahead and see how

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
to be red so let's go ahead and see how
that<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.520> done<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.510> basically

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that can be done and this is basically

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.520 
that can be done and this is basically
done<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:44.480> format<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.899> custom<00:00:46.230> number

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
done with a format the custom number

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
done with a format the custom number
format<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> want

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
format what you want to do is you want

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
format what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:48.780> click<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.770> axis<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:50.969> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
to click on the axis and so now it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.150 
to click on the axis and so now it's
highlighted<00:00:51.719> I'll<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.680> right-click<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
highlighted I'll go and right-click it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.970 
highlighted I'll go and right-click it
and<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:53.670> format<00:00:54.000> access<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.800> comes

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and go into format access and it comes

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
and go into format access and it comes
up<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> format<00:00:56.670> access<00:00:57.239> dialog<00:00:57.780> box<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
up with the format access dialog box you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
up with the format access dialog box you
want<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> number<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.879> want<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
want to go to number and you want to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.650 
want to go to number and you want to
create<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> select<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> custom

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
create a you want to select the custom

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.859 
create a you want to select the custom
category<00:01:03.920> now<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> adjust

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
category now in here we want to adjust

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.190 
category now in here we want to adjust
the<00:01:07.260> formatting<00:01:07.500> code<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:09.020> let's<00:01:10.020> say<00:01:10.170> for

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the formatting code and let's say for

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the formatting code and let's say for
example<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:11.159> want<00:01:11.369> anything<00:01:12.229> above<00:01:13.229> 600<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:14.100> be

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
example we want anything above 600 to be

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
example we want anything above 600 to be
green<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.909> anything<00:01:15.270> below<00:01:15.509> 600<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.320> red

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
green and anything below 600 to be red

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.310 
green and anything below 600 to be red
so<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.430> use<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.299> conditional<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so I can just use some conditional it's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.600 
so I can just use some conditional it's
almost<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.680> conditional<00:01:20.040> formatting<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
almost like conditional formatting and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 
almost like conditional formatting and
there's<00:01:21.150> some<00:01:21.390> special<00:01:21.600> format<00:01:22.049> codes<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
there's some special format codes that

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
there's some special format codes that
you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.650> use<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.430> let's<00:01:23.520> say<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.850> example<00:01:24.240> we

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you can use so let's say for example we

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.319 
you can use so let's say for example we
have<00:01:24.710> we'll<00:01:25.710> say<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.600> red<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:28.850> green<00:01:29.850> we'll

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
have we'll say for red or green we'll

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
have we'll say for red or green we'll
say<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.140> can't<00:01:31.560> type<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> number

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
say we just can't type in the number

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640 
say we just can't type in the number
Green<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> under<00:01:33.119> square<00:01:33.299> brackets<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.930> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
Green in under square brackets and this

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.530 
Green in under square brackets and this
is<00:01:34.799> where<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> conditional<00:01:36.150> formatting

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
is where the conditional formatting

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.850 
is where the conditional formatting
comes<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.229> almost<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.700> next<00:01:39.650> value<00:01:40.650> when

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
comes in almost so the next value when

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.389 
comes in almost so the next value when
put<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> anything<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:43.399> greater

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
put in there is anything that is greater

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.300 
put in there is anything that is greater
than<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:44.970> equal<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:46.490> 600<00:01:48.680> that's<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> be

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
than or equal to 600 that's going to be

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
than or equal to 600 that's going to be
green<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.479> anything<00:01:52.380> else<00:01:54.140> that's<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
green now anything else that's going to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
green now anything else that's going to
be<00:01:55.590> red<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.460> put<00:01:59.670> those<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.119> square

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
be red and we put those in square

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.530 
be red and we put those in square
brackets<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> colors

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
brackets now there it with the colors

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
brackets now there it with the colors
there's<00:02:04.439> different<00:02:04.799> colors<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.250> can

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
there's different colors that you can

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.630 
there's different colors that you can
you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.509> use<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.110> there's<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> list<00:02:08.369> over<00:02:08.520> here

you can use and there's a list over here

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.669 
you can use and there's a list over here
that<00:02:09.149> will<00:02:09.330> show<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> different<00:02:10.440> colors

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that will show you the different colors

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.410 
that will show you the different colors
you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.890> use<00:02:10.920> now<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.790> still<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.300> have

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
you can use now you still have to have

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.800 
you can use now you still have to have
it<00:02:12.599> with

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
it with

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.100 
it with
in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.380> brackets<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.730> operators<00:02:15.300> those

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
in the brackets and the operators those

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.860 
in the brackets and the operators those
those<00:02:16.920> still<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.000> within<00:02:18.239> brackets

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
those still have to be within brackets

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.199 
those still have to be within brackets
and<00:02:19.050> here's<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.650> list<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:20.970> the

and here's a list of some of the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.260 
and here's a list of some of the
operators<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.989> can<00:02:22.170> use<00:02:22.410> here<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.120> here

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
operators that you can use here so here

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.960 
operators that you can use here so here
are<00:02:24.330> some<00:02:24.560> information<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:26.250> hash<00:02:26.640> sign

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
are some information about the hash sign

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.809 
are some information about the hash sign
and<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.420> zeros<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.920> format<00:02:29.250> code<00:02:29.489> here

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and the zeros so the format code here

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.880 
and the zeros so the format code here
the<00:02:30.209> hash<00:02:30.450> sign<00:02:30.720> or<00:02:30.930> pound<00:02:31.170> sign<00:02:31.319> indicates

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the hash sign or pound sign indicates

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.550 
the hash sign or pound sign indicates
that<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.760> placeholder<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.540> digits<00:02:33.959> but

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that it's a placeholder for digits but

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.790 
that it's a placeholder for digits but
if<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.340> nothing<00:02:35.580> in<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.060> 1000<00:02:36.800> digits

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
if there is nothing in the 1000 digits

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.479 
if there is nothing in the 1000 digits
and<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:39.150> zero<00:02:39.390> indicates<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
and the zero indicates that it's a

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.150 
and the zero indicates that it's a
placeholder<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> number<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.500> there<00:02:43.890> is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
placeholder for a number but if there is

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.850 
placeholder for a number but if there is
no<00:02:44.940> number<00:02:45.090> there<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.600> will<00:02:45.780> put<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.200> zero<00:02:46.560> so

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
no number there it will put a zero so

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.660 
no number there it will put a zero so
for<00:02:47.130> example<00:02:47.549> we<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.940> if<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:49.319> had<00:02:49.500> zero<00:02:49.950> comma

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
for example we have if we had zero comma

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
for example we have if we had zero comma
zero<00:02:50.850> zero<00:02:51.590> for<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.739> 200<00:02:53.250> value<00:02:53.580> it's<00:02:54.239> going

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
zero zero for this 200 value it's going

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.860 
zero zero for this 200 value it's going
to<00:02:54.810> show<00:02:54.989> zero<00:02:55.230> comma<00:02:56.160> two<00:02:56.640> zero<00:02:57.120> zero<00:02:57.209> so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
to show zero comma two zero zero so

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.000 
to show zero comma two zero zero so
that's<00:02:57.959> kind<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.290> how<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> works<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.920> you

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that's kind of how it works and you

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.490 
that's kind of how it works and you
separate<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.989> separate<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.880> different

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
separate the separate the different

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.729 
separate the separate the different
format<00:03:04.500> codes<00:03:04.849> with<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:05.880> semicolon<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.959> there

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
format codes with a semicolon so there

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.620 
format codes with a semicolon so there
is<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.370> section<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.450> then

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
is here is one section here and then

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.949 
is here is one section here and then
here's<00:03:09.870> another<00:03:09.930> section<00:03:10.650> there<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.959> believe

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
here's another section there I believe

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.410 
here's another section there I believe
with<00:03:13.319> these<00:03:13.849> custom<00:03:14.849> for<00:03:15.000> my<00:03:15.090> calls<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.390> can

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
with these custom for my calls I can

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.750 
with these custom for my calls I can
only<00:03:15.690> get<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.049> three<00:03:16.560> different<00:03:16.760> format

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
only get up to three different format

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.430 
only get up to three different format
codes<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.299> but<00:03:18.510> I'm<00:03:18.600> only<00:03:18.690> adding<00:03:18.930> two<00:03:19.200> here

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
codes so but I'm only adding two here

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.009 
codes so but I'm only adding two here
for<00:03:20.010> our<00:03:20.130> example<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.299> if<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.450> add<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.810> in

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
for our example so if I add this in

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.289 
for our example so if I add this in
there<00:03:22.230> you're<00:03:23.010> going<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.250> see<00:03:23.459> now<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.670> I

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
there you're going to see now that I

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.210 
there you're going to see now that I
close<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.200> you're<00:03:25.769> going<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:25.920> see<00:03:26.040> now<00:03:26.190> that

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
close this you're going to see now that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.699 
close this you're going to see now that
if<00:03:26.519> anything<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.180> 600<00:03:28.109> above<00:03:28.319> it's<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.650> to

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
if anything is 600 above it's going to

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.800 
if anything is 600 above it's going to
be<00:03:28.799> green<00:03:29.010> anything<00:03:29.519> below<00:03:29.790> 600<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.660> going

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
be green anything below 600 it's going

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.720 
be green anything below 600 it's going
to<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:31.049> red<00:03:31.530> or<00:03:31.769> anything<00:03:32.010> else<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.519> going<00:03:32.700> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
to be red or anything else is going to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.509 
to be red or anything else is going to
be<00:03:32.850> red<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.329> that's<00:03:34.049> how<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.709> format<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
be red so that's how you can format the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.210 
be red so that's how you can format the
access<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.260> it's<00:03:37.410> kind<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.920> little

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
access so it's kind of just a little

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.000 
access so it's kind of just a little
neat<00:03:38.400> little<00:03:38.549> trick<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.750> do<00:03:39.870> some<00:03:40.109> almost<00:03:40.890> like

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
neat little trick to do some almost like

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.490 
neat little trick to do some almost like
conditional<00:03:41.549> formatting<00:03:42.000> for<00:03:42.750> your<00:03:43.109> charts

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
conditional formatting for your charts

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.380 
conditional formatting for your charts
so<00:03:44.370> hope<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.579> helps<00:03:44.760> thanks<00:03:45.750> for<00:03:46.049> watching
