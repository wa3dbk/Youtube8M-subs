00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 series though you like it because anyway 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.789

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.830
 but the sausage is born then it seems to me 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 also something quite beautiful there 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.340
 precisely so as not to always see the package 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.109

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.719
 tactical minute a day so one thing 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.149
 really pretty enough then at least 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.040
 boys may first of all not know 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.390
 if you also have the xbox you have 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 will solve this problem precisely with 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.440
 a face so if you just feel it 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.010

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.600
