00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.490
 portocolom largest natural harbor mallorca 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.270
 and we show some here 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:43.090
 new products for 2013 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.570
 and when the guys heard about turn 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.020
 what we have said here for 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.790
 2013 new eclipse and whether we do not 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.230
 can show here again because it 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.610
 then we were really chic 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.809
 sent and we are very surprised 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:06.180
 a very sporty advice, narrow tires 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.360
 trend 20 course very easy 10.7 kilograms 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.820
 and of course completely wrong otherwise 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.460
 it would not be a turn rat and that makes 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.200
 of course, in our beautiful harbor 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.790
 If a target audience is with security 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.520
 Yacht owner maybe a few 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.940
 Details on this as the straight said 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.479
 20 gang group is on it very much 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.729
 good brake system ergonomic handles 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.270
 very comfortable even on longer trips 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.320
 jobcenter kilometer behind me and what 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.799
 I really like it 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.409
 It is very flexible 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.710
 Alone what already the size of the frame 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.130
 or the height of the seat post in 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.229
 the case is that almost 60 centimeters 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.270
 seatpost and thus suitable up to 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.369
 a body size of 1 95 and smallest 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.750
 measure think you would have to be such a meter 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.750
 fifty height 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:15.150
 the turnkey in the harbor of porto colom 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.400
 I would like to show how quickly the out 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.890
 to fold into each other and how fast 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.940
 you can also fold the it 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.160
 At first, maybe it's time to get ready for driving 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.950
 you can use the pedals that is one piece 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.769
 pedal system i can do that with few 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.510
 handle the pedals undress it 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.209
 then have more compact afterwards 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.340
 I would also let the pedals 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.450
 always so vertical and take your goal 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.450
 Quick release from the saddle and pulls 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.579
 the seat post once completely down that 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.319
 the saddle at the bottom is that's all 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.810
 nicely done at turn so have the 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.000
 below the seat post is behind it 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.370
 that the bike is also on the prop 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.829
 stands and thus the support not so 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.680
 Scratched rubber down here 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:06.299
 So nothing can be done on that 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.750
 happen after the very pure and 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.880
 Actually, I only need the advice 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.660
 two handles there are two joints 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.880
 here once on stem that is from turn 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:24.450
 The physis 3d stem very much 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.910
 stable system and very compact size 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.000
 while but it was also relatively easy 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.920
 come completely aluminum is around the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.870
 I actually have to open it up 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.569
 only one thing makes this safe 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.160
 Pull up the lever and then the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.560
 quick release fold forward 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.380
 By doing so I have in whole stem 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.000
 unit ever down 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.310
 then I go to this one 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.260
 quick release on the central joint makes 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.790
 here too the small safety lever 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.280
 to the front and from there I have one now 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.139
 so-called emv technology you can see 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.650
 Now I can ride this bike 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:04.200
 so fold up and have it 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.370
 already as a compact mars must now 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.670
 put on this rubber strip here on it 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.239
 so that the stem is something secured and 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.889
 can then take the bike so high and 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.430
 For example, in the trunk do 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.830
 by the weight of just 10 7 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.810
 So it's almost eleven kilo for 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.120
 Women extremely easy in the trunk 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.020
 or to put in the caravan 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.150
 really well done that again 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.229
 it's just the same thing 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.030
 just how it works together 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:45.380
 I'm doing this first front 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.380
 comic strip then record the handlebar 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.740
 does that make us the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.250
 seat post to the correct measure am 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.250
 done with it 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.100
 1899 euro very well equipped very 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.889
 light bike very fast bike 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.100
 and extremely stiff 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.110
 just for this geometry 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.690
 We wish much fun especially a 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.690
 Test drive at your dealer
