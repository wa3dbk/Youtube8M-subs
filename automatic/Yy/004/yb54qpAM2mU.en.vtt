00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 watch this episode of the game and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.710
 contains images that may shock 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.000
 the youngest of you I 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.069
 therefore advise against this episode of at least 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 16 years older this video to the unique 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.400
 purpose of analyzing images from a point of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.900
 aesthetic and plastic view and not of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.370
 enter into an eternal debate and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.360
 sterile on this or that practice 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.039
 alimentary 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.670
 so thanks for understanding and good 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.670
 viewing to all 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.230
 and that's his stitch we find ourselves 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.550
 for this second issue of the aside 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.990
 today we are going to tackle 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.970
 a hunk a big piece of 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.380
 meat with its human beat in the form of 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.720
 performances the animal collective 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 equality has exhibited on March 20, 2013 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.690
 entitled meatless day of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.220
 people sweeping trays 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 so the most learned of you 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 will immediately understand the meaning 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 provocateur du bouzin but we will see 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.070
 together a little more detail than this 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.660
 is not necessarily just something 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.520
 feminists bobo big mouth without 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 brains and eaters where the meat 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.790
 it's above all food a way 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 to come to an end in order to survive and 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.270
 transform something already dead 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.530
 in vital force it may seem to you a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.820
 little bios said like that but it's not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.500
 for nothing but this physiological need 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.940
 who's eating is part of the base 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 basic needs of the pyramid 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.580
 of maslow without food you are 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.810
 weak you no longer have all your 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.400
 physical abilities and you will die 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.060
 stable tons is one of the best 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.290
 examples 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.970
 and for those who played you must 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.110
 know what's fucking food 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.759
 of muddy blood what do I 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.320
 hate this gauge the title dance has 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.550
 precisely does not mean to be 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 hungry if that's not about the setting 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.680
 condition but let's go a little further 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.300
 in the analysis 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.380
 with this staging especially with 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.850
 the giant trays we have a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.290
 direct anchoring in our time 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.910
 finished hunting in the steppes do not 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.830
 find our game at the supermarket 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.270
 cellophane and our meat 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.100
 is ready for use for the sake of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.509
 of immediacy of consumption bah yes 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.830
 when we are hungry we are impatient you 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.479
 understand it you have to go fast it's 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.500
 the call of the belly does not wait and then 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.030
 that in the game we start 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 gatherers before creating our first 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.000
 weapons for hunting meat first 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.590
 in our present society we do not 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 know more about hunting just 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.440
 now to reach out for 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.000
 to take our food we are 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.830
 pickers in the supermarket it goes more 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.910
 quickly we are quickly satiated and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.440
 that's where the second 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.759
 part of that performance we were going 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.110
 the beginnings of a form of cannibalism 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.979
 with the label of the tray 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 we now have the certainty 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.030
 these young, lifeless inanimate women are 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.590
 finally ready to be consumed as 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.000
 example this idea is also conveyed 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.099
 by the jannah meat dress 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.940
 starbucks meaty dress has tan who 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.080
 embarrassment to starbucks 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.300
 I believe that in Rome meat came 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.130
 from Lady Gaga to poor crazy we go there 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.569
 come back later wearing with me in 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.010
 meat that brings us back to our nature 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.720
 physiological we are made of 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.250
 flesh muscles we are also from the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 meat finally imagine it's like 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.770
 if you remove the skin and we do not see 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.720
 more than muscle that's what we 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.130
 call the skinned and first 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.750
 anatomical drawings where leonardo goes there 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.730
 risking your skin and that's saying a little 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.140
 observed corpses dissect up 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.760
 our good women in trays there 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.409
 there is only one step are shown the material 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.090
 in itself like jana sterbak this is the 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.420
 situation of the bodies with the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.069
 trays that symbolizes meat 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.330
 ah bah hold question in your opinion in 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.010
 silent hill why pyramid head 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.900
 skin these poor women in this 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.190
 scene some having seen the film there 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.750
 have seen a warning sign 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.800
 addressed to survivors but I think 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.140
 now that you understand that 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.580
 Visually there another interest it 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.080
 here is to remove the slightest 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.610
 symbol of protection and this to all 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.350
 ladder by first removing his clothes 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.790
 symbol of protection of the external body 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.470
 facing the environment and then removing 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.610
 its skin protection symbol of 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.170
 the inside of the human being 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.150
 the woman is lost if they stay 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.860
 out as unprotected inside 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.450
 the church and let it be said it is in 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.489
 the same lineage of jannah sterbak that 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.720
 Lady Gaga wears her dress in good meat 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.370
 knowing the character we are no longer 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.840
 to a thoughtful facetious stylists of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.310
 the singer but what why this dress 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.989
 marked the spirits in the united states comes 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.030
 especially his message to a helena 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.650
 pro vegetarian with a mouth of 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.650
 three feet long during the ellen show 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.880
 to be not be a piece of meat 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.740
 literally where figure and that does not 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.510
 remains no less a sense taken at first 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.980
 degree super meat boy too is a stub 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.030
 of skinny legs there without skin and he 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.500
 is it true that it takes full 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.030
 mouth to save his girlfriend he is 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.230
 tossed from table to table like a 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.670
 vulgar butt of meat but that's where 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.440
 that the gameplay of this game that remains 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.670
 All in all, young lady in 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.280
 distress finds in his character 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.470
 design a perfect justification the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.420
 meat herd boy who is in the game 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.070
 ben eager the 800 who like his name 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.380
 the indicated can give him protection 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.760
 and safety thanks to his bandages to their 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.080
 way the girls in the trays in 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.790
 showing himself as vulgar end of 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.290
 vacuum denuded meat denounces 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.910
 exactly all the inverted 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.800
 these women are also skinned 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.690
 vivid debates both their shroud without 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.490
 protection and defenseless against a 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.870
 public who can consume them easily 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.980
 and it's nothing with the eyes 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.330
 and that's what gives us a 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.190
 wonderful opening for a neighbor 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.990
 subject mesdemoiselles as said on 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.210
 old age will tarnish your 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.410
 beauty and yes nothing is immutable and 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.450
 like meat at an expiration date 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.400
 beauty is not eternal it's this 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.260
 which is called a vanity or even a rate 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.060
 maury which means in Latin remember 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.200
 you die to remember this 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.120
 coma task in ghost in the shell 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.120
 stand alone complex pronouncing these words 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.930
 we are alone in the face of death
