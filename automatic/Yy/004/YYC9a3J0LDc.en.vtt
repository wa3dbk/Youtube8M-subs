them first of all here is a mystic looks
very<00:00:17.400> similar<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.119> Mojave<00:00:19.130> being<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
very similar to a Mojave being kind of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
very similar to a Mojave being kind of
bashful<00:00:20.930> just<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.199> bit<00:00:22.289> different

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
bashful just a little bit different

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.200 
bashful just a little bit different
color<00:00:22.740> than<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> normal<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.730> although<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.970> did<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
color than a normal but although I did a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.900 
color than a normal but although I did a
pretty<00:00:24.420> normal<00:00:24.570> looking<00:00:24.900> snake<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
pretty normal looking snake this is a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.509 
pretty normal looking snake this is a
Mojave<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.410> comparison<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> little<00:00:29.429> bit

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
Mojave just for comparison a little bit

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.900 
Mojave just for comparison a little bit
of<00:00:29.609> difference<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.090> color<00:00:31.579> really<00:00:32.579> really

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
of difference in color really really

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639 
of difference in color really really
similar<00:00:33.180> though<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.200> kind<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.440> hard<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
similar though so it's kind of hard to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
similar though so it's kind of hard to
tell<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> difference<00:00:35.309> between<00:00:35.430> them<00:00:35.820> when

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
tell the difference between them when

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
tell the difference between them when
you're<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.239> looking<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.200> now

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
came from two different clutches so this

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880 
came from two different clutches so this
is<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> breed<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
is what you get when you breed this to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.819 
is what you get when you breed this to
this<00:01:32.130> pretty<00:01:32.820> unexpected<00:01:33.540> outcome<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this pretty unexpected outcome but a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.609 
this pretty unexpected outcome but a
really<00:01:35.579> cool<00:01:36.090> outcome<00:01:36.570> -<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.049> don't<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.439> why

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
really cool outcome - I don't know why

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.740 
really cool outcome - I don't know why
they've<00:01:37.860> got<00:01:38.009> such<00:01:38.220> an<00:01:38.340> attitude<00:01:38.490> today<00:01:38.970> it's

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
they've got such an attitude today it's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.359 
they've got such an attitude today it's
kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.170> young<00:01:40.439> ball<00:01:40.680> pythons<00:01:41.159> do

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
combinations on the way the other thing

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.730 
combinations on the way the other thing
with<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.900> Mystics<00:02:05.260> that<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.410> wanted<00:02:05.680> to

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
with the Mystics that I wanted to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.109 
with the Mystics that I wanted to
mention<00:02:05.920> we<00:02:06.190> don't<00:02:06.340> have<00:02:06.490> any<00:02:06.670> here<00:02:06.850> yet<00:02:07.000> but

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
mention we don't have any here yet but

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.790 
mention we don't have any here yet but
there's<00:02:07.240> also<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.540> super<00:02:07.900> mystic<00:02:08.320> which<00:02:08.649> is

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
there's also a super mystic which is

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.770 
there's also a super mystic which is
really<00:02:09.070> similar<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.670> mystic<00:02:10.090> potions<00:02:10.570> a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
really similar to the mystic potions a

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.840 
really similar to the mystic potions a
little<00:02:11.140> bit<00:02:11.260> darker<00:02:11.650> colored<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:12.550> what

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
little bit darker colored and it's what

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.070 
little bit darker colored and it's what
you<00:02:12.880> get<00:02:13.090> when<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.300> breed<00:02:13.570> two<00:02:13.750> different

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
you get when you breed two different

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.440 
you get when you breed two different
mystics<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.590> each<00:02:14.740> other

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
mystics to each other

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.060 
mystics to each other
now<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.510> downside<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.200> producing<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.770> mystic

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
now the downside to producing the mystic

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.090 
now the downside to producing the mystic
potions<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.270> when<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.290> breed<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.709> Mojave

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
potions is that when you breed a Mojave

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.220 
potions is that when you breed a Mojave
to<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.310> mystic<00:02:21.640> together<00:02:21.940> you'll<00:02:22.209> get<00:02:22.420> normals

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
to a mystic together you'll get normals

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
to a mystic together you'll get normals
which<00:02:23.410> are<00:02:23.560> pretty<00:02:23.739> easy<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.160> identify<00:02:24.400> you'll

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
which are pretty easy to identify you'll

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.390 
which are pretty easy to identify you'll
also<00:02:25.120> get<00:02:25.450> mystics<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.620> my<00:02:26.800> hobbies<00:02:27.220> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
are really difficult these snakes are so

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.199 
are really difficult these snakes are so
similar<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.010> there's<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.370> much<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.610> variation

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
similar and there's so much of variation

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.660 
similar and there's so much of variation
even<00:02:37.330> within<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:38.230> morphs<00:02:38.590> with<00:02:38.920> these<00:02:39.160> that

even within the morphs with these that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.640 
even within the morphs with these that
it's<00:02:39.970> really<00:02:40.300> hard<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.630> identify<00:02:40.750> which<00:02:41.410> one

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
it's really hard to identify which one

problem with doing that but to me the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.960 
problem with doing that but to me the
the<00:02:46.870> challenge<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.800> trying<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.370> identify<00:02:48.550> the
