00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 on here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.420
 here is the beginning of everything brother 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.090
 understanding the police demonstrated 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 a horrible thing agglomeration 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 over a thousand people brothers that thing 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:04.910
 horrible useful is horrible horrible and there 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.910
 nobody does anything right 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.820
 if you had a sense of what the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.820
 cracow 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.950
 and then where's someone on the authorities to 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.020
 do something someone to care for 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.929
 these people brothers 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.340
 where is the money who unites this 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:32.289
 money could be applied 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.640
 graham hospitalization, these persons can not 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:40.709
 be a compulsory hymn at best 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.970
 horrible horrible thing 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:47.380
 I think now you have a notion 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.950
 of what happens to the reality of the crack was 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 that's where the 4th cuckold happens 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.850
 there on that block 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.679
 the police do not do anything nobody does anything 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.679
 the public power has no 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.979
 how to do anything hum 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.260

 is a socially unsolved case 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.630
 but that's where we show the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.630
 bare reality of business 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.810
 we have to do is think of something 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.810
 by these people in the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:13.580
 one thing needs to be done because 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:15.650

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.020

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.960
 block of São Paulo on the third or 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:35.500
