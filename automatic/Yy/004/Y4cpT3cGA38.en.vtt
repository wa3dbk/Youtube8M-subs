 this video I bring you 2 dessertcitos and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.470
 a super cute and super easy idea 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.350
 make for a gift then if they want 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.720
 know how to make these three ideas follow 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.939
 watching the video for the first dessert 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.150
 sanitary more me those of these great 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.220
 also a chocolate 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.050
 of those that melt and use in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.210
 this white case has to say that it's 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.550
 to melt and make it for baking 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.430
 also use dye in this case 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.800
 the red color to make a pink and 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.320
 some sprinkles these are hearts 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.829
 super cute and is that they are redonditos 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.019
 normal 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.719
 you can also use these 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.450
 rainbow color letters and it's super cute 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.400
 how can you see that just to decorate 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.900
 and a knife to cut the chocolate 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.210
 before let's start cutting this 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.830
 chocolate come on let's use a 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.290
 little amounts so you do not get 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.270
 go hardening this is what I do is 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.400
 that he cut a strip and then I'm going to 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.020
 cut into small pieces leads 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.210
 melt the chocolate in that little gem 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.160
 they are good others that is to make rice 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.750
 super tiny but I know that in 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.970
 moments of final nutrition was doing it 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.050
 water bath while melts the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.270
 chocolate I will separate our 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.610
 instincts and here you see how the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.610
 proposing to then move on to make them 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.890
 is the texture that the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.420
 chocolate with a stick we will help 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.759
 finish melting what 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.590
 and then add only one drop 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.780
 of the red color to make the pink ass 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.400
 is with the same stick we are going to mix 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.880
 super super good 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880
 Y 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.979
 that they are already seeing how the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.990
 pink and now let's catch more 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.539
 me more me we were going to put down 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.829
 chocolate only up to half 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.299
 initially then I put it on the 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.899
 dish but I heard it was very difficult because 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.899
 they fell 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.200
 so what I decided to do to 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.759
 put it safe of the silver and simply 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.829
 he put the painters with the good 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.719
 what I did first was then cover 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.789
 all the most beautiful and then with the 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.709
 hands put the spring elbows 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.030
 in this way we can be more in control 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.030
 about where to go to stay 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.620
 here from another angle they see as those who 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.180
 They are redonditos like tiraditos to be able 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.180
 that well on the sides too 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.030
 with a help stick to put the 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.530
 little hearts 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.060
 stick point in a little bit of 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.200
 chocolate and then I put the sprint with 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.200
 about the magnetic 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.819
 this is how you have to do 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.989
 is to put it in the fridge about 10 minutes 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.810
 to finish hardening the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.939
 chocolate and ready for the second let's 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.680
 to use some strawberries what he's going to do 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.810
 is to split them in half 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.370
 after this and with a lot of care of 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.500
 do not cut we're going to remove it like the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.599
 part of the half as the heart of the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.200
 strawberry to make as a cavity 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.819
 little 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.310
 and this we are going to do in all 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.480
 halves in cut once cut 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.489
 all the centrals what I'm going to do 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.349
 is that I'm going to turn the strawberries 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.970
 upside down so to speak and he's going to 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.400
 put in a heart shape and with the help 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.860
 of the stick I will go through to 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.270
 put together we have them seeing how is one 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.220
 super super cute heart shape 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.510
 when we turn it over it will be like that and 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.090
 then with the help of a knife we go 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.090
 to put nutella in the middle as 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.190
 in that visible hole 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.099
 it's time to remove the strawberry first to avoid 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.599
 that is watered by moisture once 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.910
 done this let's take the chocolate 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.069
 but this white once we will pass 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.989
 as to seal the fabric that is going to 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.530
 I'm going to water, I'm going to do it because all 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.530
 Strawberries 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.450
 I put them in the fridge anyway and so 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.909
 they are going to fit us and now we turn them 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.950
 to cover equally chocolate 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.569
 all the pages the more you have left 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.900
 better because it's going to cover a lot more 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.069
 uniformly on the strawberry 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.959
 but good has to be 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.599
 completely covered as it goes 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.519
 to be delicious and again I put them to the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.810
 This is how we are going to be left with 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.269
 the help of a knife we remove it for 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.549
 that we are not going to leave and then 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.340
 we remove the chopsticks and ready only 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.720
 to place and so they are delicious I think 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.789
 that was the dessert that I liked the most 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.440
 of the two for a next video 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.479
 I bring many more desserts too 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.280
 I'm going to do a hairstyle towards the outfit and 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.780
 I'm going to do makeup then either 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.570

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.600
 there you see the strawberry with that you see 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.590
 delicious the truth is that I was 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.870

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.970

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.110
 let them know how rich he is but now 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.610
 for the gift what they do is 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.169
 use any white box and 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.600

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.060

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.570
 that we are going to give this box to that 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.949
 person loves these jellies 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.360
 then he bought a whole bag 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.800
 ghilas skin 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.539

 mosley 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.080
 now with this tape that is called washi 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.789
 tape that comes with heart designs 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.010
 because we're going to use it to paste 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.150
 these pumps that I'm going to 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.150
 write the word I love you 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.590
 I'm going to decorate the little bombs a little bit 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.940
