00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello people welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.950
 bluetooth keeps inspiration 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.799
 I 've had a few lately 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.440
 try made all a bit more difficult 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 with braids on head in st 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 and I think that was still for some 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.650
 Something difficult that's why I show you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.000
 today a very simple hairstyle there 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.850
 you do not need to braid and you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.869
 still really great and turn for it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.150
 I one the hair 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.090
 I'm making a Scheitl came again 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.789
 go through the hair well and then start here 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.079
 Just turn the hair on in front 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.969
 take and keep spinning on 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 head along to getting a few harada 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.460
 take and turn the whole with 1 if 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.570
 I arrived here I read the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 Throw off the head and turn the whole thing 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.469
 I take this much further now 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.469
 still behind and put it easy 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.190
 you have fallen down what I think it 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.040
 It's best to have two hackers with it 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.119
 really good and doing the same 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.119
 I'm here on the other side 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.670
 if the resin on both sides 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:47.000
 I have turned parts have turned so 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.590
 bit and two parts so right and 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.030
 left in a strand and then 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.030
 I just turn it on too 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.019
 and make these a twisted stricter 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.940
 I just go back to the 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.940
 behind the head and stuck a lot 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.260
 I do the same with this strand 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.260
 simply first one want a turn 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.820
 feel backwards and once so 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.040
 somehow put a loop behind 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.040
 and this sleep or a capture 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.890
 you have seen that is really complete 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.630
 easy so you just have to be up here 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.730
 curl up and then the two back 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.500
 make strands up and stuck on 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.210
 when it comes to you with such a small hacker 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.700
 You can not keep it then either 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.610
 Here's why we do it in the back and 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.230
 then, for example, hypertension or the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.250
 then brains and talk 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.780
 stuck 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.380
 So there are different ones 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.450
 you can find ways to design 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.980
 but I'm fine if 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.300
 I just turn it up and then 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.050
 easy with too small needles 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.850
 stuck 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.220
 but if it's a bit of you 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.420
 is different then that is just times 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.160
 try as best 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.209
 maybe with the hair tie just 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.560
 save a little bigger that way 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.560
 Looks definitely now 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.400
 if you like the hairstyle then look forward 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.560
 I thumb my thumb upwards 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.540
 write me in the comments 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.519
 you the simple one will find if we are you 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.599
 just imitate if you want 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.950
 have to imitate 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.959
 you can actually synonymous with relative 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.519
 So short hairs make it easy 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.019
 and then you can do that 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.790
 Of course not like me for so long 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.350
 roll and bring up, but then 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.850
 you just make yourself in little braids 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.919
 That always looks fancy I think 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.720
 if you see it rolling in front of it 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.600
 just a bit more interesting 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.190
 as if you make yourself in the normal braid 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.720
 maybe you would like to do it 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.280
 I have times in the comments like 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.380
 you like the hairstyle if he still 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.639
 want to see more hairstyles and then 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.760
 Let's see you next time 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.760
 again
