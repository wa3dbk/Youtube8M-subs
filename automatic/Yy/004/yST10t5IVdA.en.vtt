00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
whatever reason Sony turned the program

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.560 
whatever reason Sony turned the program
down<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.520> Microsoft<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.940> ran<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
program now I know the reason I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
program now I know the reason I
mentioning<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.610> lot

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
mentioning this is because I know a lot

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.689 
mentioning this is because I know a lot
of<00:00:54.120> people<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.629> upset<00:00:54.809> about<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.430> when

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of people are upset about it but when

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.720 
of people are upset about it but when
people<00:00:57.120> upload<00:00:57.570> early<00:00:57.960> access<00:00:58.140> gameplay<00:00:58.890> just

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
people upload early access gameplay just

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
people upload early access gameplay just
remember<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.660> Sony's<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.949> turned

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
remember that Sony's the one that turned

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.390 
remember that Sony's the one that turned
it<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.480> ps4<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:05.220> whatever

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it down for the ps4 and for whatever

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.350 
it down for the ps4 and for whatever
reason<00:01:06.619> EA<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.040> hasn't<00:01:08.400> put<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.640> onto<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> pc

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
reason EA just hasn't put it onto the pc

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
reason EA just hasn't put it onto the pc
i'm<00:01:09.570> pretty<00:01:09.780> sure<00:01:09.960> it'd<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.409> easy<00:01:10.530> for

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
i'm pretty sure it'd be pretty easy for

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.399 
i'm pretty sure it'd be pretty easy for
them<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> integrate<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.630> origin<00:01:13.290> or

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
them to integrate it with origin or

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.899 
them to integrate it with origin or
whatever<00:01:13.680> they're<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> call<00:01:14.400> origin

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
whatever they're about to call origin

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.570 
whatever they're about to call origin
now<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:16.020> sure<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:17.040> could<00:01:17.100> integrate

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
now I'm pretty sure they could integrate

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.539 
now I'm pretty sure they could integrate
EA<00:01:18.060> access<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.840> origin<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.920> easily<00:01:20.250> if

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
EA access with origin pretty easily if

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
EA access with origin pretty easily if
they<00:01:20.820> wanted<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.780> whatever<00:01:22.140> reason

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
they wanted to but for whatever reason

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.280 
they wanted to but for whatever reason
it<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.680> doesn't<00:01:23.159> seem<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.700> want<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
it just doesn't seem like they want to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.590 
it just doesn't seem like they want to
but<00:01:25.290> yeah<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.040> makes<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.369> lot<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.729> pc<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
but yeah I know it makes a lot of pc and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
but yeah I know it makes a lot of pc and
ps4<00:01:27.869> players<00:01:28.350> upset<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.490> have

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
ps4 players upset that they don't have

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
ps4 players upset that they don't have
early<00:01:30.119> access<00:01:30.409> like<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.590> players<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
early access like the players on the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.020 
early access like the players on the
xbox<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.960> but<00:01:33.960> yeah<00:01:34.439> EA<00:01:34.979> did<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.610> reach

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
xbox one but yeah EA did actually reach

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.649 
xbox one but yeah EA did actually reach
out<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.540> Sony<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> Sony<00:01:37.950> turned<00:01:38.340> them<00:01:38.490> down

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
out to Sony and Sony turned them down

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
out to Sony and Sony turned them down
for<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.869> reason<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.320> another<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.130> really

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
for one reason or another I'm not really

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480 
for one reason or another I'm not really
sure<00:01:41.640> why<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:43.290> EA<00:01:43.470> access<00:01:44.040> program

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
sure why because the EA access program

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.670 
sure why because the EA access program
is<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> pretty<00:01:45.479> decent<00:01:45.570> program<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
is actually a pretty decent program you

know 60 bucks into a game and stuff like
that<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.300> personally<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> think<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.740> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
that so personally I think that the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.910 
that so personally I think that the
program<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:39.540> really<00:02:40.020> good<00:02:40.170> program<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.680> I'm

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
program is a really good program and I'm

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.590 
program is a really good program and I'm
not<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:41.280> sure<00:02:41.400> why<00:02:41.790> somebody<00:02:42.210> turned<00:02:42.450> it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
not really sure why somebody turned it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.780 
not really sure why somebody turned it
down<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> did<00:02:43.830> want<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.250> mention<00:02:44.430> that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
down but I did want to mention that

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.270 
down but I did want to mention that
because<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.210> know<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.390> lot<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.660> people<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.890> hate

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
because I know a lot of people just hate

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.260 
because I know a lot of people just hate
on<00:02:47.630> early<00:02:48.630> access<00:02:48.840> gameplay<00:02:49.650> footage<00:02:50.270> simply

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
on early access gameplay footage simply

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.850 
on early access gameplay footage simply
because<00:02:51.600> they're<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:52.170> getting<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.590> play<00:02:52.740> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
because they're not getting to play the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.650 
because they're not getting to play the
game<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.250> early<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.700> stuff<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.209> so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
game as early and stuff like that so

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.230 
game as early and stuff like that so
that<00:02:54.810> does<00:02:55.140> kind<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.470> suck<00:02:55.880> but<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:57.180> remember

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
that does kind of suck but just remember

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.070 
that does kind of suck but just remember
that<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:57.870> not<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.290> player<00:02:58.760> it's<00:02:59.760> actually

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080
