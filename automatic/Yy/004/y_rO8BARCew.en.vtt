okay

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.990 
okay
there's<00:04:23.230> also<00:04:23.320> peanut<00:04:23.860> so<00:04:24.310> how<00:04:24.460> do<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.610> cut<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
there's also peanut so how do we cut the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
just the one breast great it looks like

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:46.190 
just the one breast great it looks like
an<00:04:37.660> expert<00:04:38.110> Malia<00:04:38.410> obviously<00:04:38.830> is<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.070> expert

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200 

so<00:04:47.200> why<00:04:47.410> does<00:04:47.620> he<00:04:47.650> actually<00:04:47.950> slice<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.060> like

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
so why does he actually slice it like

so why does he actually slice it like
that<00:04:49.480> what<00:04:50.410> about<00:04:50.560> how<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:50.950> I'll<00:04:51.130> change<00:04:51.310> it

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
that what about how so I'll change it

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.840 
that what about how so I'll change it
and<00:04:51.730> then<00:04:51.850> go<00:04:51.970> one<00:04:52.120> ruling<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:54.280> flavor<00:04:54.520> gets

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
and then go one ruling the flavor gets

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.970 
and then go one ruling the flavor gets
he<00:04:55.060> also<00:04:55.720> in<00:04:55.840> order<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.200> get<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.470> flavor<00:04:56.740> out

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
on both sides in order to get the flavor

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.020 
on both sides in order to get the flavor
inside<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.310> think<00:05:06.490> he<00:05:06.550> also<00:05:06.700> said<00:05:06.940> the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
inside and I think he also said the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.090 
inside and I think he also said the
texture<00:05:07.540> will<00:05:07.690> be<00:05:07.720> very<00:05:08.050> tender<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:08.620> also<00:05:08.980> the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
texture will be very tender and also the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.160 
texture will be very tender and also the
texture<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:09.580> before<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.120> actually<00:05:10.150> dice<00:05:10.780> the

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
texture so before you actually dice the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.350 
texture so before you actually dice the
chicken<00:05:11.200> we've<00:05:11.890> actually<00:05:12.010> slice<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.240> into

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
chicken we've actually slice it into

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.460 
chicken we've actually slice it into
small<00:05:14.190> crisscross<00:05:15.330> before<00:05:16.330> you<00:05:16.630> cut<00:05:17.350> the

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
small crisscross before you cut the

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.770 
small crisscross before you cut the
chicken<00:05:17.650> into<00:05:17.890> dices<00:05:18.400> so<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.730> flavor<00:05:19.030> under

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
chicken into dices so the flavor under

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.420 
chicken into dices so the flavor under
the<00:05:19.900> sources<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.680> peppercorn<00:05:21.250> could

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
the sources and peppercorn could

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.320 
the sources and peppercorn could
actually<00:05:21.730> soak<00:05:22.030> into<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.419> chicken

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
actually soak into the chicken

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.990 
actually soak into the chicken
great<00:05:23.960> so<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:24.919> should<00:05:25.250> we<00:05:25.310> open<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.669> into<00:05:25.879> the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
great so you should we open it into the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200 
great so you should we open it into the
walk<00:05:27.430> but<00:05:28.430> people<00:05:28.729> go<00:05:28.849> to<00:05:28.909> Chinese

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210

restaurants<00:05:29.509> they<00:05:30.080> often<00:05:30.349> wonder<00:05:30.680> why<00:05:30.889> the

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
restaurants they often wonder why the

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.670 
restaurants they often wonder why the
meat<00:05:31.460> is<00:05:31.669> so<00:05:31.879> tender<00:05:32.139> it's<00:05:33.139> because<00:05:33.470> of<00:05:33.590> the

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
meat is so tender it's because of the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.520 
meat is so tender it's because of the
cooking<00:05:34.009> method<00:05:34.210> as<00:05:35.210> we<00:05:35.509> see<00:05:35.720> here<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.289> chef
