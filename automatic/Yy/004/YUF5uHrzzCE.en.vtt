hi my name is Mack Berg and I'm here to
tell<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.370> today<00:00:02.490> about<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.850> few<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.270> the

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
tell you today about a few of the

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.090 
tell you today about a few of the
notions<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:03.929> you're<00:00:04.110> going<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.380> need<00:00:04.560> if<00:00:04.740> you

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
notions that you're going to need if you

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.650 
notions that you're going to need if you
want<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.339> make<00:00:05.430> your<00:00:05.520> own<00:00:05.670> patterns<00:00:06.089> or<00:00:06.210> copy<00:00:06.480> a

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
want to make your own patterns or copy a

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.080 
want to make your own patterns or copy a
garment<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.290> already<00:00:07.440> have<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.090> first

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
garment that you already have the first

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.940 
garment that you already have the first
thing<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.450> use<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> lot<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.559> pattern

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
thing I use a lot is this pattern

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.310 
thing I use a lot is this pattern
tracing<00:00:11.400> interfacing<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.960> nice<00:00:13.139> if

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
tracing interfacing and this is nice if

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.079 
tracing interfacing and this is nice if
you<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.559> multi<00:00:13.889> size<00:00:14.130> pattern<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:15.059> this

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
you have a multi size pattern like this

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.369 
you have a multi size pattern like this
one<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.750> don't<00:00:15.990> want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> cut<00:00:16.350> into

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
one that you don't want to cut into

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.290 
one that you don't want to cut into
especially<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.279> children's<00:00:17.699> patterns<00:00:18.119> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
especially for children's patterns that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.779 
especially for children's patterns that
will<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.600> more<00:00:18.900> than<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.260> size<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> like

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
will have more than one size what I like

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150 
will have more than one size what I like
to<00:00:20.939> do<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.420> place<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.140> pattern<00:00:22.800> tracing

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to do that is place this pattern tracing

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.460 
to do that is place this pattern tracing
interfacing<00:00:23.760> over<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.240> pattern<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.840> trace

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
interfacing over my pattern and trace

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
interfacing over my pattern and trace
around<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.980> appropriate<00:00:26.430> size<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:27.300> also

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
around the appropriate size it's also

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.169 
around the appropriate size it's also
nice<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.140> you're<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> size<00:00:28.769> 10<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.340> top<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> 14

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
nice if you're a size 10 on top and a 14

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.880 
nice if you're a size 10 on top and a 14
on<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> bottom<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.109> I'm<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> multi<00:00:31.679> size

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
on the bottom because I'm the multi size

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.620 
on the bottom because I'm the multi size
patterns<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.579> fade<00:00:32.850> out<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> correct

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
patterns you can fade out to the correct

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.410 
patterns you can fade out to the correct
cutting<00:00:34.020> lines<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.910> also<00:00:36.210> nice<00:00:36.360> because

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
cutting lines this is also nice because

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.209 
cutting lines this is also nice because
you<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.050> sew<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> together<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.890> try<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.100> on

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you can sew it together and try it on

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.250 
you can sew it together and try it on
when<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:38.610> finished<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
when you're finished but what if you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
when you're finished but what if you
happen<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.829> garment<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.520> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
happen to have a garment that you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
happen to have a garment that you
purchased<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
purchased or that you don't have a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.479 
purchased or that you don't have a
pattern<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.040> want<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> make<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
pattern for that you want to make a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
pattern for that you want to make a
pattern<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.289> you're<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.739> to

because<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> points<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.000> sharp<00:01:15.270> they

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
because the points are so sharp they

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.640 
because the points are so sharp they
will<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.720> through<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> government<00:01:16.320> seam

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
will go through the government seam

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980
