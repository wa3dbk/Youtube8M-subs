00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
that my hair is not getting matted at

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.439 
that my hair is not getting matted at
the<00:01:03.829> roots<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.400> if<00:01:04.879> you're<00:01:05.000> having<00:01:05.330> this

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
the roots and if you're having this

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.230 
the roots and if you're having this
problem<00:01:05.540> then<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.409> can<00:01:06.590> tell<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.010> shingling<00:01:07.909> is

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
problem then I can tell you shingling is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.140 
problem then I can tell you shingling is
the<00:01:08.540> solution<00:01:08.870> what<00:01:09.800> shingling<00:01:10.250> is<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:10.940> pretty

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
the solution what shingling is is pretty

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.930 
the solution what shingling is is pretty
much<00:01:11.470> just<00:01:12.470> going<00:01:12.920> through<00:01:12.979> your<00:01:13.159> hair<00:01:13.400> raking

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
much just going through your hair raking

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.270 
much just going through your hair raking
through<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:15.140> you're<00:01:15.320> coating<00:01:16.040> each

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
through it so that you're coating each

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.880 
through it so that you're coating each
and<00:01:16.549> every<00:01:16.820> curl<00:01:17.060> with<00:01:17.509> product<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.710> all

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
and every curl with product so that all

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.980 
and every curl with product so that all
the<00:01:19.040> curls<00:01:19.280> are<00:01:19.460> separated<00:01:20.060> you're<00:01:20.540> using<00:01:20.719> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
the curls are separated you're using a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.539 
the curls are separated you're using a
little<00:01:21.170> bit<00:01:21.380> more<00:01:21.530> product<00:01:21.799> but<00:01:22.159> it<00:01:22.340> does<00:01:22.520> a

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
little bit more product but it does a

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.609 
little bit more product but it does a
better<00:01:22.820> job<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.659> I'm<00:01:23.990> going<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.170> teach<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.500> how

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
that you had in the first method but

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.270 
that you had in the first method but
without<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.480> matting<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:46.930> it'll<00:04:47.620> last<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:48.100> lot

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280
