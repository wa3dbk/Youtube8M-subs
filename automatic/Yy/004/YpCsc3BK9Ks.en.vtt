00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
all the islands on this seed now I did

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.210 
all the islands on this seed now I did
pop<00:03:03.329> up<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.600> map<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.019> map<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.470> fact<00:03:05.040> I

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
pop up the map of the map and in fact I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.400 
pop up the map of the map and in fact I
didn't<00:03:05.609> am<00:03:05.880> save<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.480> game<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:06.840> I've<00:03:06.930> lost<00:03:07.170> it

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
didn't am save the game so I've lost it

has an amazing structural cave system I

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.220 
has an amazing structural cave system I
was<00:03:26.700> pretty<00:03:27.000> shocked<00:03:27.209> right<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.630> finally<00:03:27.900> so

each other about 100 block
you've<00:03:34.390> got<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> jungle<00:03:34.990> biome<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.710> have<00:03:35.860> a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
you've got a jungle biome you have a

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
also have a sand biome so you've got the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.250 
also have a sand biome so you've got the
luxury<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.610> sea<00:03:42.880> now<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.300> also<00:03:43.660> like<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.080> see

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
luxury in the sea now I also like to see

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.810 
luxury in the sea now I also like to see
for<00:03:44.470> many<00:03:44.650> reasons<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.340> I'm<00:03:45.400> going<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.580> start

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
for many reasons and I'm going to start

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.480 
for many reasons and I'm going to start
off<00:03:45.910> by<00:03:45.970> saying<00:03:46.210> and<00:03:47.140> directly<00:03:47.800> underneath<00:03:48.190> me

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
off by saying and directly underneath me

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.880 
off by saying and directly underneath me
here<00:03:48.520> if<00:03:49.330> you<00:03:49.450> keep<00:03:49.690> mining<00:03:50.170> all<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.500> way<00:03:50.590> down

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
here if you keep mining all the way down

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.290 
here if you keep mining all the way down
so<00:03:51.160> that's<00:03:51.250> pretty<00:03:51.520> much<00:03:51.610> head<00:03:51.910> all<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.240> way

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
so that's pretty much head all the way

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.600 
so that's pretty much head all the way
down<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:53.140> will<00:03:53.290> come<00:03:53.500> across<00:03:53.830> some<00:03:54.280> diamonds

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
down you will come across some diamonds

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.820 
down you will come across some diamonds
now<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.120> cannot<00:03:55.600> go<00:03:55.810> wrong<00:03:55.840> with<00:03:56.590> finding

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
now you cannot go wrong with finding

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.110 
now you cannot go wrong with finding
some<00:03:57.310> diamonds

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
some diamonds

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.660 
some diamonds
straight<00:03:58.780> off<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.080> start<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.890> your<00:04:00.100> game<00:04:00.370> also

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
straight off the start of your game also

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.400 
straight off the start of your game also
you'll<00:04:01.300> notice<00:04:01.510> here<00:04:01.780> there's<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.110> small

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
you'll notice here there's like a small

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.710 
you'll notice here there's like a small
cave<00:04:02.710> system<00:04:03.130> which<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.340> can<00:04:03.580> explore<00:04:04.150> so

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
cave system which you can explore so

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.240 
cave system which you can explore so
let's<00:04:04.870> just<00:04:05.020> head<00:04:05.170> all<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.500> way<00:04:05.590> down<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.130> do

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
let's just head all the way down you do

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.980 
let's just head all the way down you do
have<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.490> go<00:04:06.640> towards<00:04:07.030> bedrock<00:04:07.480> before<00:04:07.870> you

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
have to go towards bedrock before you

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.080 
have to go towards bedrock before you
come<00:04:08.230> across<00:04:08.470> these<00:04:08.770> I<00:04:09.040> believe<00:04:09.610> it's<00:04:09.760> four

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
come across these I believe it's four

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.510 
come across these I believe it's four
diamonds<00:04:10.390> you've<00:04:10.750> got<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.050> two<00:04:11.500> three<00:04:11.800> four

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
diamonds you've got one two three four

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.690 
diamonds you've got one two three four
you<00:04:13.330> have<00:04:13.450> four<00:04:13.720> diamonds<00:04:14.050> in<00:04:14.560> total<00:04:15.160> from

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
you have four diamonds in total from

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.340 
you have four diamonds in total from
this<00:04:15.970> point<00:04:16.299> which<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.630> thought<00:04:16.840> was<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.019> great

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
this point which I thought was a great

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.229 
this point which I thought was a great
idea<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.799> start<00:04:17.980> off<00:04:18.430> with<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:18.970> show<00:04:19.180> you

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
idea to start off with and to show you

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.570 
idea to start off with and to show you
now<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:19.720> also<00:04:20.080> know<00:04:20.260> there's<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.620> lot<00:04:20.769> of<00:04:20.950> surface

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
now I also know there's a lot of surface

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.970 
now I also know there's a lot of surface
lava<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.450> around<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.870> world<00:04:23.110> I'm<00:04:23.440> saying

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
lava in and around this world I'm saying

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.010 
lava in and around this world I'm saying
this<00:04:24.070> lava<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.610> definitely<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.180> good<00:04:25.390> idea<00:04:25.780> in

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
this lava is definitely a good idea in

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.530 
this lava is definitely a good idea in
any<00:04:26.200> Minecraft<00:04:27.010> world<00:04:27.250> for<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.000> reason<00:04:28.360> that

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
any Minecraft world for the reason that

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.390 
any Minecraft world for the reason that
it<00:04:28.900> saves<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:29.380> having<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.680> go<00:04:29.920> down<00:04:29.950> and
