track<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.299> really<00:00:16.080> had<00:00:16.260> fun<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
track I really had fun with it and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.090 
track I really had fun with it and
before<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.240> solo<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:18.990> well

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
before I solo with it as well

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.279 
before I solo with it as well
I<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.699> want<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> say<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.689> live<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.140> how

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I just want to say that I live with how

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.070 
I just want to say that I live with how
I<00:00:22.320> work<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.310> put<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.570> solo<00:00:24.869> with

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
I work with it I put it and I solo with

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.950 
I work with it I put it and I solo with
it<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.859> without<00:00:26.580> thinking<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> scales<00:00:27.599> just

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it just without thinking of scales just

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
it just without thinking of scales just
running<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.920> scales<00:00:29.250> though<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.269> sound<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
running on the scales though to sound a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.240 
running on the scales though to sound a
little<00:00:30.779> bit<00:00:30.990> legal<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.980> don't<00:00:32.130> know<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
little bit legal because I don't know a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
little bit legal because I don't know a
lot<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.489> theory<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.300> through<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> many<00:00:34.320> times

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
lot of theory but through the many times

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
lot of theory but through the many times
I<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.760> basic<00:00:36.480> pattern<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I do it there is one basic pattern that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.830 
I do it there is one basic pattern that
emerges<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.950> comes<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.820> often<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
emerges that comes out more often so I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260 
emerges that comes out more often so I
take<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.350> pattern<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.489> repeated<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.239> few

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
take that pattern and I repeated a few

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
take that pattern and I repeated a few
times<00:00:42.450> within<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> melody<00:00:43.710> within<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
times within the melody within the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.330 
times within the melody within the
rhythm<00:00:44.850> melody<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.710> own<00:00:46.890> melody

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
rhythm melody and I have my own melody

00:00:47.340 --> 00:01:11.630 
rhythm melody and I have my own melody
so<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.270> something<00:00:48.510> like

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.850 

this<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.000> experimenting<00:01:13.810> now<00:01:13.990> now<00:01:14.590> I<00:01:14.619> did

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
this is just experimenting now now I did

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.679 
this is just experimenting now now I did
it<00:01:14.950> on<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.159> baseline<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:16.000> was<00:01:16.270> something

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
it on the baseline that was something

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.060 
it on the baseline that was something
that<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:16.900> was<00:01:17.080> going<00:01:17.259> through<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.740> was<00:01:17.860> still

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
that I was going through and I was still

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.950 
that I was going through and I was still
paying<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.520> was<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.820> didn't<00:01:19.479> practice<00:01:19.930> it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
paying and I was I didn't practice it

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.830 
paying and I was I didn't practice it
this<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:20.560> now<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:21.130> just<00:01:21.430> posted<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.360> and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
this is just now I just posted it and

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.389 
this is just now I just posted it and
then<00:01:22.990> I'm<00:01:23.110> trying<00:01:23.229> by<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.680> way<00:01:23.830> my<00:01:24.100> keytar

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
then I'm trying by the way my keytar

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.399 
then I'm trying by the way my keytar
because<00:01:24.700> it's<00:01:24.850> two<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.180> half<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.479> tonne

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
because it's two and a half a tonne

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.660 
because it's two and a half a tonne
lower<00:01:27.190> I<00:01:27.490> have<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:28.080> capo<00:01:29.080> on<00:01:29.229> it<00:01:29.409> so<00:01:30.039> that's<00:01:30.430> why

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
lower I have a capo on it so that's why

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.700 
lower I have a capo on it so that's why
when<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:30.909> see<00:01:31.000> me<00:01:31.240> press<00:01:31.509> on<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.350> left<00:01:32.560> hand

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
when you see me press on the left hand

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.830 
when you see me press on the left hand
somewhere<00:01:33.159> just<00:01:33.729> remember<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.210> have<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.390> cup<00:01:34.659> on

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
somewhere just remember I have a cup on

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.109 
somewhere just remember I have a cup on
it<00:01:34.869> so<00:01:35.080> I'm<00:01:35.170> always<00:01:35.320> one<00:01:35.590> frame<00:01:35.799> or<00:01:35.979> down<00:01:36.190> okay

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
it so I'm always one frame or down okay

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:58.320 
it so I'm always one frame or down okay
so<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.930> try<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.200> imitate<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:41.920> melody<00:01:57.330> and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
so I can try to imitate that melody and

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.600 
so I can try to imitate that melody and
playing<00:01:58.810> with<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.170> now<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.830> have<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:00.190> melody

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
playing with it now you have this melody

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.969 
playing with it now you have this melody

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.520
