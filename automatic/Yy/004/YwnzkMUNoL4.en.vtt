00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 shanty shanty rf and fleece jacket bliss 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.010
 she camouflage colors and immediately 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.650
 it's worth noting that the collar is here 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.710
 double fabric is twisted sewn therefore 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 He is warm there is a tag it is visible from the inside 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.750
 if you suddenly have something to cling to 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.960
 it is also important the size is m and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.859
 or European or 48 all 177 6 and I 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 5052 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.210
 182 188 but as I found out when 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.080
 take clothes for me often for some reason 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.570
 fits 170 and size as this time 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.870
 she is fine with me 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.340
 We look at how lightning works with one 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.770
 side opens with a zipper a little bit 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.390
 offices 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.879
 hear that a little cling then 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.590
 drives it shouldn't become some 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.860
 A critical problem I would suggest was 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.440
 a little smear may burst 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.000
 close so the throat closes high 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.219
 a bit more free than I would like 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.109
 here will blow but personally to me I 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.940
 I love when the throat is very tightly tied 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.980
 that someone is short - lived but you can 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 hide that if you are actively moving 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 this solution is a good even better scarf 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.570
 you can pry quite space there 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.890
 our sleeves are completely free 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.630
 insert space for ventilation by 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 no blood too 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 there is nowhere on the shoulders model omega 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 there are pockets pockets inside also 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.060
 fleece that is, you can open at all 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.600
 do not close turns double 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.810
 insulation in this place 10 utyazhki side 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.200
 they are like that we grab for 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.530
 tips to speak should stop a little bit 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.360
 I can not see here carriage 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.729
 not sewn so pull so here 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.770
 as in the jacket Kamchatka will not work need 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 pull by hand everything in that sense 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 Kamchatka is better than onega 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.950
 also happens this is part of a series there are models 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.659
 with ripstop mind with gain have anoraks 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.640
 which only stretch from above 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.340
 see the corresponding review read 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.110
 description but this model is such a transition 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.630
 basically classical i would prefer 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.090
 Kamchatka got a model for 2 but 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.049
 if you need disguise here is a model 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.720
 Kamchatka by the way 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.610
 it looks like material can be made 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.709
 the same even to shanty shanty rf 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.580
