guys a way that I sort of cheat at
ZBrush<00:00:05.430> when<00:00:05.819> I'm<00:00:06.440> exporting<00:00:07.440> an<00:00:07.649> alpha

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
ZBrush when I'm exporting an alpha

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.310 
ZBrush when I'm exporting an alpha
channel<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.210> can<00:00:09.360> do<00:00:09.480> some<00:00:09.719> post<00:00:10.080> work

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
channel so that I can do some post work

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.410 
channel so that I can do some post work
in<00:00:10.469> Photoshop<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.610> far<00:00:11.880> as<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.090> could<00:00:12.150> tell

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
in Photoshop as far as I could tell

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.959 
in Photoshop as far as I could tell
through<00:00:13.230> ZBrush<00:00:13.710> itself<00:00:14.160> there's<00:00:14.429> not<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> way

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
through ZBrush itself there's not a way

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.300 
through ZBrush itself there's not a way
to<00:00:15.030> export<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.990> perfect<00:00:16.410> alpha<00:00:16.710> channel<00:00:17.070> so

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
to export the perfect alpha channel so

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.890 
to export the perfect alpha channel so
that<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.699> would<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:18.090> working<00:00:18.690> right

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that it would be working right

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.929 
that it would be working right
immediately<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:20.070> Photoshop<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.670> kind<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
immediately into Photoshop you kind of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.490 
immediately into Photoshop you kind of
got<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.090> play<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> little<00:00:21.600> bit<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.900> Photoshop<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
got to play a little bit in Photoshop to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.859 
got to play a little bit in Photoshop to
get<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> work<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.100> way<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.670> it

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
get it to work the way that you want it

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.210 
get it to work the way that you want it
so<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> thought<00:00:25.199> maybe<00:00:25.380> it'd<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.650> useful<00:00:25.859> tip

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
so I thought maybe it'd be useful tip

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
so I thought maybe it'd be useful tip
for<00:00:26.400> somebody<00:00:26.699> else<00:00:26.820> who's<00:00:27.090> trying<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.529> do

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
for somebody else who's trying to to do

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.580 
for somebody else who's trying to to do
that<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.570> stupid<00:00:30.929> object

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that so I just have this stupid object

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.139 
that so I just have this stupid object
here<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.949> regular<00:00:32.340> default<00:00:32.520> brush<00:00:32.969> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
here this regular default brush that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.330 
here this regular default brush that
ZBrush<00:00:33.570> gives<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> bat<00:00:35.309> just

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
ZBrush gives you right off the bat just

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.180 
ZBrush gives you right off the bat just
so<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> how<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.870> works<00:00:37.190> it's

it makes it a PSD for you save and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
it makes it a PSD for you save and
that's<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.490> basically<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:45.149> done<00:01:45.299> with

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that's that's basically you're done with

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.569 
that's that's basically you're done with
ZBrush<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.560> point<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.189> minimize

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
ZBrush at this point so you can minimize

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.880 
ZBrush at this point so you can minimize
it<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.750> bring<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.500> Photoshop<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.259> we're

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it and bring up Photoshop here and we're

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.999 
it and bring up Photoshop here and we're
gonna<00:01:52.979> go<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.659> file<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.290> we're<00:01:55.500> gonna<00:01:55.590> open<00:01:55.770> up

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
gonna go to file and we're gonna open up

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
gonna go to file and we're gonna open up
the<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> alpha<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.719> exported

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the first the alpha that we exported

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.280 
the first the alpha that we exported
which<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.560> Z<00:01:58.740> grab<00:01:59.009> o1<00:01:59.750> okay<00:02:00.750> now<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.020> see

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
which is Z grab o1 okay now you can see

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.870 
which is Z grab o1 okay now you can see
it's<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.590> gradient<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.670> never

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it's a gradient here so this would never

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.569 
it's a gradient here so this would never
make<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> good<00:02:03.180> selection<00:02:03.600> at<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.020> point<00:02:04.579> so

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
make a good selection at this point so

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.639 
make a good selection at this point so
simple<00:02:06.570> fix<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
simple fix to this is just go up to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.199 
simple fix to this is just go up to
image<00:02:08.390> adjustments<00:02:09.390> levels

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
image adjustments levels

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
and you're gonna take this slider here

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.559 
and you're gonna take this slider here
these<00:02:13.040> two<00:02:13.310> slider<00:02:13.610> bars<00:02:13.849> just<00:02:13.970> gonna<00:02:14.299> pull

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
these two slider bars just gonna pull

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.789 
these two slider bars just gonna pull
them<00:02:14.659> all<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> way<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.110> left<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.650> can

that<00:03:32.620> when<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.919> Photoshop<00:03:34.459> from<00:03:34.699> something

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
that when in Photoshop from something

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.879 
that when in Photoshop from something
you've<00:03:35.150> copied<00:03:35.389> an<00:03:35.780> alpha<00:03:36.079> Channel<00:03:36.409> it<00:03:36.590> might

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
you've copied an alpha Channel it might

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.439 
you've copied an alpha Channel it might
actually<00:03:37.159> shift<00:03:37.699> it<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.909> little<00:03:37.940> bit<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.359> the

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
actually shift it a little bit to the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.059 
actually shift it a little bit to the
left<00:03:38.690> or<00:03:38.930> right<00:03:38.959> or<00:03:39.139> up<00:03:39.319> or<00:03:39.530> down<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.949> you're

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
left or right or up or down and you're

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.030 
left or right or up or down and you're
gonna<00:03:40.159> have<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.370> nudge<00:03:40.669> it<00:03:40.699> into<00:03:41.030> place<00:03:41.239> but<00:03:41.479> a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
gonna have to nudge it into place but a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.879 
gonna have to nudge it into place but a
95%<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.159> time<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.609> this<00:03:44.060> works

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
95% of the time this this works

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.990 
95% of the time this this works
sometimes<00:03:45.889> you<00:03:46.069> have<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.549> little<00:03:46.699> bit<00:03:46.909> of

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
sometimes you have to do a little bit of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.509 
sometimes you have to do a little bit of
moving<00:03:47.269> around<00:03:47.449> but<00:03:47.690> in<00:03:48.169> this<00:03:48.709> case<00:03:48.949> it<00:03:49.280> did

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
moving around but in this case it did

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.629 
moving around but in this case it did
work<00:03:49.639> perfect<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.720> Alpha<00:03:51.079> Channel<00:03:51.440> is<00:03:51.639> pasted

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
work perfect the Alpha Channel is pasted

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.719 
work perfect the Alpha Channel is pasted
exactly<00:03:53.239> over<00:03:53.540> our<00:03:53.659> original<00:03:54.079> object<00:03:54.609> so<00:03:55.609> at

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:55.729 
exactly over our original object so at

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.670 
exactly over our original object so at
this<00:03:55.849> point<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.269> just<00:03:56.299> need<00:03:56.479> to<00:03:56.810> reorder<00:03:57.440> this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
this point you just need to reorder this

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.689 
this point you just need to reorder this
put<00:03:58.099> your<00:03:58.370> alpha<00:03:58.819> behind<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.389> and<00:04:00.699> you're

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:01.699

little jaggies around here if there is a

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.059 
little jaggies around here if there is a
but<00:05:17.599> that's<00:05:17.779> kind<00:05:18.199> of<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.379> way<00:05:18.529> I<00:05:18.560> go<00:05:19.039> about

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
but that's kind of the way I go about

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.300 
but that's kind of the way I go about
using<00:05:19.520> an<00:05:19.789> alpha<00:05:20.180> through<00:05:20.990> from<00:05:21.259> ZBrush<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:22.279> I

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
using an alpha through from ZBrush so I

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.040 
using an alpha through from ZBrush so I
can<00:05:22.699> make<00:05:22.789> a<00:05:22.819> selection<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.419> do<00:05:23.539> some<00:05:23.719> editing

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
can make a selection to do some editing

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.200 
can make a selection to do some editing
if<00:05:24.800> anybody<00:05:25.129> else<00:05:25.279> has<00:05:25.460> any<00:05:25.490> other<00:05:25.669> way<00:05:25.969> to<00:05:26.029> do

if anybody else has any other way to do
