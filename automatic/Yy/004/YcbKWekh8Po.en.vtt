00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 so welcome to a new edition of 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.080
 jackos bakery after I'm already in 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.220
 heat as you uploaded look 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.830
 Let 's have a look at how to get that today 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 matching dough makes the whole thing 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 actually quite simply we need 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.170
 to a kitchen machine in children's days 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 and to have a few 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.520
 the ingredients are now in the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.410
 video are displayed and are also in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.939
 the description 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.039
 we begin the first order to a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.400
 half cube yeast in a cup with 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.619
 lukewarm water dissolve some sugar 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.950
 to do this around the yeast bacteria food too 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.540
 Give and then set the cup aside 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.630
 Make and the yeast dissolve 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630
 to let 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.390
 Now we take the bowl of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.640
 dough mixer add one kilo of flour 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 I'll take four of the five others here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.420
 I swear on 550 but I have to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 confess I noticed little difference 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.960
 We now weigh 15 grams of salt off and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 Put these in the bowl 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:23.230
 then come four tablespoons of oil 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:25.090
 Keeps the yeast even more stirring and 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:40.000
 then in the mass beer here with 300 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 Milliliters of water give the measuring cup 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.090
 then we fill up to 500 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.680
 Milliliter with milk on you can do that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.090
 but only with water 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.140
 I'm with the milk can be the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.140
 process dough better 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.620
 The bowl is now in the machine 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.180
 then the liquid is poured in addition 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.180
 the machine is switched on 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.920
 Do not wonder about the machine I 've got 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.160
 I think the worst is this 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160
 gives 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.410
 as in his around the hook and the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.470
 bowl back out of the machines and 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.630
 cover this the dough must go now 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.630
 ideally two days in the refrigerator 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.760
 when the dough has gone extreme 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.750
 we in 80 bowls and beside them 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.750
 again briefly through 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.290
 then we cut them the five to 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 six pieces of these will be and ike 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.950
 formed balls 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.590
 Before baking it is important that the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.260
 ball again 20 to 30 minutes 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.700
 go and warm up then lets yourself go 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.890
 the dough is better processed by me 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.750
 hope you like sparingly imitate 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.750
 and have fun in other videos
