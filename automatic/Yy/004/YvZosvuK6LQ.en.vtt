this is a more appropriate price for a
fer-de-lance<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:30.659> opinion<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.500> should

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
fer-de-lance in my opinion it should

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
fer-de-lance in my opinion it should
never<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:33.030> expensive<00:01:33.390> than<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> Python

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
never be more expensive than the Python

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260 
never be more expensive than the Python
since<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.400> all<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.790> activities

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
since it can do all the activities

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.289 
since it can do all the activities
Python<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.159> excellent<00:01:38.939> fighter

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
Python can this is an excellent fighter

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.050 
Python can this is an excellent fighter
but<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> combat<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.880> hope
