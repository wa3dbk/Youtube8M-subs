00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.720 

so<00:00:01.079> moving<00:00:01.380> on<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.829> last<00:00:01.949> commander<00:00:02.520> that

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
so moving on to the last commander that

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.610 
so moving on to the last commander that
the<00:00:02.970> Aeon<00:00:03.330> commander<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.049> some<00:00:04.200> pretty

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
the Aeon commander and some pretty

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.730 
the Aeon commander and some pretty
interesting<00:00:04.920> commander<00:00:05.839> because<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:07.710> have

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
interesting commander because you have

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.799 
interesting commander because you have
completely<00:00:08.700> different<00:00:08.940> upgrades<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.630> another

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
completely different upgrades on another

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.540 
completely different upgrades on another
commander<00:00:10.260> first<00:00:10.530> upgrading<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> left<00:00:11.309> arm

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
commander first upgrading the left arm

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.020 
commander first upgrading the left arm
is<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.910> enhanced<00:00:12.389> sensor<00:00:13.290> systems<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.030> that

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
is the enhanced sensor systems and that

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.359 
is the enhanced sensor systems and that
will<00:00:15.299> increase<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.490> Omni<00:00:17.490> range<00:00:17.900> by<00:00:18.900> like

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
will increase your Omni range by like

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.250 
will increase your Omni range by like
three<00:00:20.369> times<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.260> will<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:23.010> five<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:24.240> 5<00:00:24.510> X<00:00:25.019> 5

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
three times so you will on five on 5 X 5

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.410 
three times so you will on five on 5 X 5
maps<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.070> will<00:00:26.279> basically<00:00:26.820> cover<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> whole

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
maps you will basically cover the whole

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720 
maps you will basically cover the whole
map<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.900> normally<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:28.590> use<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.099> again<00:00:29.429> but

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
map I normally don't use it again but

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
map I normally don't use it again but
it's<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.380> typing

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
it's really if you have the typing

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.319 
it's really if you have the typing
commander<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.309> example<00:00:32.700> standing<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
commander for example standing in the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.410 
commander for example standing in the
water<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.010> an<00:00:35.130> enemy<00:00:35.420> pulling

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
water or if you have an enemy pulling

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
water or if you have an enemy pulling
stuff<00:00:36.690> front<00:00:37.050> basis<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:37.980> really

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
stuff front basis that's a really really

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
stuff front basis that's a really really
cool<00:00:38.250> counter<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:40.200> should<00:00:40.440> all

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
cool counter so you should all

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.430 
cool counter so you should all
definitely<00:00:41.040> keep<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.700> mind<00:00:42.260> then<00:00:43.260> we

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
definitely keep this in mind then we

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
definitely keep this in mind then we
have<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.980> first<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:45.090> upgrade<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> e<00:00:45.780> on

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
have the first can upgrade for the e on

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.830 
have the first can upgrade for the e on
the<00:00:46.170> quantum<00:00:47.210> whatever<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> called<00:00:48.690> an

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the quantum whatever it is called an

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.400 
the quantum whatever it is called an
English<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> difference<00:00:51.750> between<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
English and the difference between that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.600 
English and the difference between that
and<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> gun<00:00:52.890> upgrades<00:00:53.039> from<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> other

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and the gun upgrades from the other

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.650 
and the gun upgrades from the other
commander<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.770> basically<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.660> fiber

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
commander is that basically the fiber

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.490 
commander is that basically the fiber
speed<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.879> range<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.210> splitted<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.350> if

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
speed and the range is splitted so if

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
speed and the range is splitted so if
you<00:01:01.590> upgrade<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.190> upgrade<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.120> will<00:01:03.300> get

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you upgrade this upgrade you will get

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.740 
you upgrade this upgrade you will get
the<00:01:03.780> double<00:01:04.470> fire<00:01:04.710> rate<00:01:05.030> but<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> won't<00:01:06.479> get

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the double fire rate but you won't get

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.840 
the double fire rate but you won't get
the<00:01:06.900> improved<00:01:07.260> range<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> won't<00:01:08.670> get

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the improved range and if you won't get

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
the improved range and if you won't get
the<00:01:09.060> improved<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.510> ain't<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> go<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the improved you ain't you have to go to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
the improved you ain't you have to go to
the<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.430> arm<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.020> upgrade<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the right arm and upgrade it there and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.330 
the right arm and upgrade it there and
then<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> enhanced<00:01:15.210> range<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
then you have the enhanced range and the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
then you have the enhanced range and the
enhanced<00:01:18.000> fire<00:01:18.210> rate<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.140> should<00:01:19.290> also

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
enhanced fire rate and you should also

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
enhanced fire rate and you should also
know<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.460> range<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> young

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
know that the range of the young

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
know that the range of the young
commander<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.070> upgrade<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
commander if you have that upgrade is a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.140 
commander if you have that upgrade is a
big<00:01:24.210> bigger<00:01:24.509> than<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.369> range<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> other

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
big bigger than the range of the other

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.850 
big bigger than the range of the other
commanders<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.200> basically<00:01:28.380> cut<00:01:28.710> if

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
commanders so you can basically cut if

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.499 
commanders so you can basically cut if
you<00:01:28.920> come<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.159> about<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.670> much<00:01:30.150> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you come and about it not that much so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
you come and about it not that much so
once<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.170> ranged<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.829> difficult

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
once you get in ranged really difficult

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.740 
once you get in ranged really difficult
to<00:01:33.950> hide<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.390> five

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to hide with it I think it's like five

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.789 
to hide with it I think it's like five
more<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.350> something<00:01:38.180> then<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
more or something then we have this the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.819 
more or something then we have this the
shield<00:01:41.460> first<00:01:42.299> shield<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.930> exact<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.649> more

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
shield first shield is exact it's more

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.260 
shield first shield is exact it's more
or<00:01:43.890> less<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> same<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
or less the same like you if you get a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.030 
or less the same like you if you get a
bit<00:01:45.479> more<00:01:45.689> shield<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.350> comes<00:01:46.530> down<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
bit more shield but it comes down to the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.819 
bit more shield but it comes down to the
same<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.450> tech<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> upgrade<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.500> second

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
same it's a tech to upgrade the second

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.840 
same it's a tech to upgrade the second
shield<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.720> also<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> personal<00:01:51.930> shield<00:01:52.850> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
shield is also a personal shield and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.840 
shield is also a personal shield and
more<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.119> less<00:01:54.210> doubles<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.549> original<00:01:56.549> shield

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
more or less doubles the original shield

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.800 
more or less doubles the original shield
not<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.990> completely<00:01:59.030> you<00:02:00.030> shouldn't<00:02:00.420> upgrade

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
not not completely you shouldn't upgrade

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.230 
not not completely you shouldn't upgrade
that<00:02:01.079> unless<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.399> sniped<00:02:02.729> so

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that unless you think you get sniped so

you if i get in range of that units
every<00:02:37.310> few<00:02:37.700> seconds<00:02:38.269> all<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:39.230> these<00:02:39.440> units

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
every few seconds all of these units

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.559 
every few seconds all of these units
will<00:02:39.920> gets<00:02:40.280> done<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:43.819> works<00:02:44.090> will<00:02:44.299> take

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
one take two and take three units and it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.630 
one take two and take three units and it
will<00:02:47.299> really<00:02:47.720> make<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.200> commander<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.890> combat

defusing<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.090> team<00:03:02.269> gains<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.780> ask

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
defusing this and team gains and ask

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.170 
defusing this and team gains and ask
your<00:03:03.970> allies<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.470> give<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.739> his<00:03:07.130> units<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.120> you
