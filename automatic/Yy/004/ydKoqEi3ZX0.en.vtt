the heroes health bars are a little off
as<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.129> were<00:00:41.220> stars<00:00:41.519> for<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
as well as there were stars for the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.670 
as well as there were stars for the
troop<00:00:42.329> levels<00:00:43.050> instead<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> actual

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
troop levels instead of the actual

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.319

something like oh you know I just as an

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
something like oh you know I just as an
example<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.970> said<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> had<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.630> ten

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
finger or something like that or want to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.089 
finger or something like that or want to
see<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.280> hog<00:02:08.970> riders<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.619> only<00:02:10.739> rate

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
see all hog riders but you can only rate

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.720 
see all hog riders but you can only rate
for<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:12.420> minute<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.439> a<00:02:13.530> half<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.040> try<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.580> get

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
for a minute and a half and try to get

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.149 
for a minute and a half and try to get
one<00:02:14.879> star<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:16.890> we're<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.069> to

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
one star so I think what we're going to

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.559 
one star so I think what we're going to
have<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.580> one<00:02:17.819> box<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.299> army

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
have is like one box for army

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.020 
have is like one box for army
compositions<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.409> well<00:02:19.739> as<00:02:19.860> one<00:02:20.099> box<00:02:20.340> for

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
compositions as well as one box for

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.360 
compositions as well as one box for
restrictions<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.980> kind<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.220> see

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
restrictions and so I can kind of see

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.100 
restrictions and so I can kind of see
something<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.909> know<00:02:23.939> even<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:24.870> mass

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
something like you know even like mass

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.990 
something like you know even like mass
Valkyries<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.920> must<00:02:26.099> get<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.489> star<00:02:26.760> in

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
Valkyries but you must get one star in

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.140 
Valkyries but you must get one star in
one<00:02:27.209> minute<00:02:27.540> something<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:29.150> kind

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
one minute something like that and kind

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.050

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
restriction and I might not use both of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
restriction and I might not use both of
them<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.019> again<00:02:49.290> I'm<00:02:49.349> just<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.620> put<00:02:49.830> the

army comp in one box restriction in
another<00:02:52.950> box<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:54.090> what<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.330> can

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
another box and then see what we can

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.270
