00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.340
 handsome all-terrain vehicle chetra tm 140 drives in 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.240
 on the roman tundra in the vicinity of hope 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.469
 This powerful machine weighs more than 10 tons and 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.590
 250 strong engine easy 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.439
 overcomes almost any obstacles 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 whether it be slopes or water obstacles 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.769
 it is therefore not surprising that chad is glad n 140 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.359
 recognized as one of the best in the world 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.670
 all-terrain vehicles in all terrain 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.859
 They are easy to operate and convenient to use. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.579
 operating unlike machines 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.820
 classmates are significantly different 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.320
 the only comfort 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 poured there all control 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.510
 with this drive food 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.780
 naturally on older cars 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.780
 tiredness felt 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.980
 to overcome such off-roads 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.050
 machines must have high 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.870
 agility and survival even on 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.370
 low load bearing soil 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.960
 power reserve with additional fuel 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.170
 tanks it allows him without refueling 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.339
 cover a distance of 300 kilometers 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.810
 hydromechanical transmission 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.210
 independent suspension and 6 speeds 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.430
 ahead on a snowy crust such an all-terrain vehicle 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.590
 can accelerate to 50 kilometers per hour 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.330
 such outstanding characteristics and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.640
 served as the main argument for choosing 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.740
 New technology for Ricky Taimyr 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.450
 energy company all-terrain vehicles 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.520
 daily go to the tundra to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.009
 deliver to remote and hard to reach 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.649
 brigade repairmen high-voltage 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.380
 power lines are now on your 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.380
 eyes before the insulator was replaced 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.110
 power lines that is, it runs and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.960
 by using this technique or 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.789
 cross-country or zero present 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.789
 work time performed 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.890
 to see with my own eyes how 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.600
 all-terrain vehicle tm 140 cope with work in 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.370
 harsh polar conditions in on the rail 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.230
 arrived representative Kurgan 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.090
 machine factory chief 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.100
 editor of corporate magazine chetra 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.110
 Alexey Kozhanov for a good shot 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.630
 technology that produces his name 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.790
 traveled almost all of Russia but still 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.250
 as he himself admits literally amazed 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.890
 how easy tm 140 overcomes 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.710
 tundra and off-road of the Taimyr one thing 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.959
 most write or interest our brothers 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.610
 of consumers who Nasihat dresses 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.220
 other do yourself a sit cab 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.480
 ride on this boulders this here 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.430
 the waters are so steep descents I rode and thought 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.220
 you know, I have such pride 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.810
 pride in their company swear that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.330
 Well done working kurganmashzavod 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.400
 make this technique a thought, God forbid 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.190
 that the engine or the tracks break 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.170
 merge and yes no, you yourself today 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.190
 have seen some normal conditions 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.170
 operation 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.000
 all collected during this expedition 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.890
 The material will form the basis for reporting on 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.930
 our city cutting taimyr 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.780
 energy company and of course 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.459
 ATV cheaters tm 140 observation and 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.620
 remarks on roman mechanical engineers 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.900
 and drivers will be transferred to 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.790
 constructors mound machine factory and in 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.769
 next time Inteco experts have 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.290
 every chance of getting your order 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.290
 even more reliable and convenient technique
