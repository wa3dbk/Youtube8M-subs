probably really happening all at the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.730 
probably really happening all at the
same<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:21.600> they<00:00:22.050> can't<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.590> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740

be<00:00:22.859> both<00:00:23.720> like<00:00:24.720> vehicle<00:00:25.320> than<00:00:25.800> some<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
be both like vehicle than some of the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
other one this is probably going to be a
