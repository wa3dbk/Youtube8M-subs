hi vs me Jimmy eight so the question is
that<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.290> computer<00:00:04.859> science<00:00:04.890> what<00:00:05.730> that

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
that is computer science what that

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.000 
that is computer science what that
amazing<00:00:06.450> computers<00:00:06.870> are<00:00:07.020> what<00:00:07.200> degree<00:00:07.560> taking

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
amazing computers are what degree taking

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.879 
amazing computers are what degree taking
in<00:00:08.150> 2015<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.780> everything<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.410> stunning<00:00:10.769> at

my<00:00:45.840> IQ<00:00:46.200> cite<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.500> pressure<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
my IQ cite of pressure is what that we

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.020 
my IQ cite of pressure is what that we
do<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> ik<00:00:49.649> degree<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.460> need<00:00:50.730> backing

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
do so ik degree really need backing

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
do so ik degree really need backing
which<00:00:51.360> certifies<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.199> mean<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.920> to

mean<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> Strand<00:01:15.840> life<00:01:16.020> oh<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.409> till<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
mean with the Strand life oh I till it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.880 
mean with the Strand life oh I till it
is<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:17.400> low<00:01:17.850> compared<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.840> IT<00:01:19.140> degree<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
is really low compared to IT degree and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.280 
is really low compared to IT degree and
may<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.280> T<00:01:20.400> basically<00:01:21.119> change<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> rapid<00:01:22.259> pace

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
may I T basically change on a rapid pace

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.460 
may I T basically change on a rapid pace
compared<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.509> computer<00:01:24.509> science<00:01:24.540> computers

compared to computer science computers

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.080 
compared to computer science computers
are<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.189> change<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> precise

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
are really do not change up the precise

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.050 
are really do not change up the precise
i<00:01:27.119> mean<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.659> c<00:01:27.810> programming<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.500> more<00:01:28.770> than<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
i mean the c programming is more than a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
i mean the c programming is more than a
writing<00:01:30.060> 40<00:01:30.479> years<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:30.900> 50<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.439> i<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.710> more

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
writing 40 years or 50 is i think more

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
writing 40 years or 50 is i think more

than 40 years of c programming level

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.200 
than 40 years of c programming level
still<00:01:34.439> c<00:01:34.680> programming<00:01:35.159> liam<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.610> most<00:01:35.970> the

still c programming liam is most the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
still c programming liam is most the
same<00:01:36.390> programming<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.530> person<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
same programming if a person get a

computer science degree back in ninety

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.219 
computer science degree back in ninety
seventy<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.340> 98<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.299> still<00:01:42.540> worth<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> mean

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
seventy or 98 is still worth that I mean

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.980 
seventy or 98 is still worth that I mean
note<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.189> much<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.909> still<00:01:45.030> water<00:01:45.509> damage

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
note that much but still water damage

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.870 
note that much but still water damage
bust<00:01:46.350> money<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.799> become<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.070> web<00:01:47.280> developer<00:01:47.460> or

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
bust money can become a web developer or

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030 
bust money can become a web developer or
it<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.270> become<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.479> data<00:01:48.720> analyst<00:01:49.259> he<00:01:49.740> have

really<00:02:58.140> i<00:02:58.379> mean<00:02:58.470> what<00:02:59.370> there<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.700> really

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
really i mean what there is really
