00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
up okay now we're going to draw the

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.120 
up okay now we're going to draw the
Dragons<00:04:20.579> back<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.269> it's<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.840> long<00:04:22.200> curvy<00:04:22.919> line

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
Dragons back and it's a long curvy line

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.120 
Dragons back and it's a long curvy line
it's<00:04:23.490> going<00:04:23.639> to<00:04:23.700> go<00:04:23.849> all<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.320> way<00:04:25.320> around<00:04:25.650> and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
it's going to go all the way around and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.190 
it's going to go all the way around and
swing<00:04:26.520> up<00:04:26.669> for<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.970> tail<00:04:27.180> okay<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:27.810> we're

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
swing up for the tail okay so we're

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.390 
swing up for the tail okay so we're
going<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.349> draw<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.889> long<00:04:29.190> curvy<00:04:30.180> line<00:04:31.400> goes

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
going to draw this long curvy line goes

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.540 
going to draw this long curvy line goes
round<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.180> then<00:04:33.830> swings<00:04:34.830> up<00:04:35.070> for<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> tail

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.010 

now<00:04:39.550> we're<00:04:39.669> going<00:04:39.759> to<00:04:39.820> draw<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.330> Dragons

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
now we're going to draw the Dragons

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.900 
now we're going to draw the Dragons
wings<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.979> Dragons<00:04:42.430> wings<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.820> can

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
wings and the Dragons wings you can

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.490 
wings and the Dragons wings you can
either<00:04:43.090> put<00:04:43.360> them<00:04:43.479> up<00:04:43.690> here<00:04:44.050> like<00:04:44.199> we've<00:04:44.350> done

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
either put them up here like we've done

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.140 
either put them up here like we've done
on<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.770> past<00:04:45.039> for<00:04:45.729> some<00:04:45.850> of<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.030> other

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
on the past for some of the other

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150 
on the past for some of the other
dragons<00:04:46.600> we've<00:04:46.690> drawn<00:04:46.900> or<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.680> can<00:04:47.830> draw<00:04:48.070> it

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
dragons we've drawn or you can draw it

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.260 
dragons we've drawn or you can draw it
here<00:04:48.310> on<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.520> side<00:04:48.729> I'm<00:04:48.910> going<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.060> show<00:04:49.180> how

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
here on the side I'm going to show how

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.520 
here on the side I'm going to show how
to<00:04:49.360> do<00:04:49.449> that<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:49.750> looks<00:04:50.020> like<00:04:50.139> where<00:04:50.380> the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
to do that this looks like where the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.010 
to do that this looks like where the
dragon<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.100> in<00:04:51.400> flight<00:04:51.820> it's<00:04:52.180> kind<00:04:52.389> of<00:04:52.419> wings

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
dragon is in flight it's kind of wings

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.460 
dragon is in flight it's kind of wings
folded<00:04:53.560> into<00:04:53.770> its<00:04:54.070> body<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:56.139> what<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.380> would

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
folded into its body so what you would

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.800 
folded into its body so what you would
do<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:57.220> you<00:04:57.400> start<00:04:58.560> draw<00:04:59.560> a<00:05:01.110> line<00:05:02.110> like<00:05:02.320> this

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
do is you start draw a line like this

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.860 
do is you start draw a line like this
next<00:05:04.810> we're<00:05:05.320> going<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.560> draw<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.830> line<00:05:09.070> here

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
next we're going to draw the line here

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.370 
next we're going to draw the line here
and<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.930> line<00:05:10.990> there<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:12.990> there's<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.050> term<00:05:14.289> of

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
and a line there so there's a term of

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.350 
and a line there so there's a term of
our<00:05:14.470> wing<00:05:14.650> we<00:05:15.520> need<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.729> connect<00:05:16.150> these<00:05:16.300> lines

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
our wing we need to connect these lines

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.610 
our wing we need to connect these lines
together<00:05:16.780> with<00:05:17.139> curved<00:05:17.500> lines<00:05:18.099> here<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:18.820> here

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
together with curved lines here and here

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.779 
together with curved lines here and here
I'm<00:05:20.620> going<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.800> draw<00:05:20.919> one<00:05:21.160> more<00:05:21.190> curved<00:05:21.550> line

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
I'm going to draw one more curved line

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.550 
I'm going to draw one more curved line
but<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.270> does<00:05:22.449> not<00:05:22.599> connect<00:05:22.990> over<00:05:23.229> here<00:05:23.380> what

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
but it does not connect over here what

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.969 
but it does not connect over here what
it<00:05:23.680> does<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.280> goes<00:05:24.430> around<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:25.690> curves<00:05:26.110> go

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
it does is it goes around it curves go

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.490 
it does is it goes around it curves go
right<00:05:27.190> to<00:05:27.310> there<00:05:27.840> there's<00:05:28.840> our<00:05:28.990> dragon's<00:05:29.320> wing

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
right to there there's our dragon's wing

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.400 
right to there there's our dragon's wing
okay<00:05:30.400> now<00:05:31.240> we're<00:05:31.389> going<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:31.570> draw<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.780> legs

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
okay now we're going to draw the legs

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.610 
okay now we're going to draw the legs
and<00:05:32.740> feet<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.280> it's<00:05:33.400> all<00:05:33.520> one<00:05:33.880> shape<00:05:34.389> and<00:05:34.690> I'm

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
and feet and it's all one shape and I'm

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.890 
and feet and it's all one shape and I'm
gonna<00:05:35.770> say<00:05:35.949> they<00:05:36.070> kind<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.310> look<00:05:36.460> like<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:37.030> tree

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
gonna say they kind of look like a tree

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.560 
gonna say they kind of look like a tree
trunk<00:05:37.930> shape<00:05:38.860> of<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.160> palm<00:05:39.460> tree<00:05:39.699> if<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:40.270> think

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
trunk shape of a palm tree if you think

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.230 
trunk shape of a palm tree if you think
about<00:05:40.870> it<00:05:41.169> so<00:05:41.590> it's<00:05:41.949> like<00:05:42.099> the<00:05:42.669> bottom<00:05:43.060> of<00:05:43.180> a

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
about it so it's like the bottom of a

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.050 
about it so it's like the bottom of a
tree<00:05:43.270> trunk<00:05:43.720> of<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:43.930> palm<00:05:44.139> tree<00:05:44.789> there's<00:05:45.789> one

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
tree trunk of a palm tree there's one

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.790 
tree trunk of a palm tree there's one
leg<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:46.630> then<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.870> back<00:05:47.080> leg<00:05:47.380> we're<00:05:47.650> going<00:05:47.680> to

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
leg and then the back leg we're going to

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.330 
leg and then the back leg we're going to
do<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:48.010> same<00:05:48.280> thing

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.430 

okay<00:05:54.340> there's<00:05:54.550> our<00:05:54.670> legs<00:05:54.910> now<00:05:55.450> let's<00:05:55.990> work<00:05:56.230> on

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
okay there's our legs now let's work on

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.750 
okay there's our legs now let's work on
the<00:05:56.560> tail<00:05:56.590> we're<00:05:57.520> going<00:05:57.670> to<00:05:57.730> draw<00:05:57.940> a<00:05:58.180> triangle

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
the tail we're going to draw a triangle

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.150 
the tail we're going to draw a triangle
here<00:06:00.760> on<00:06:00.910> the<00:06:01.030> tip<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.540> our<00:06:01.630> Dragons<00:06:02.080> tail<00:06:02.320> and

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
here on the tip of our Dragons tail and

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.150 
here on the tip of our Dragons tail and
then<00:06:03.640> we're<00:06:04.270> going<00:06:04.360> to<00:06:04.420> take<00:06:04.660> and<00:06:05.560> draw<00:06:05.770> a<00:06:05.800> line

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
then we're going to take and draw a line

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.980 
then we're going to take and draw a line
that<00:06:06.370> curves<00:06:06.430> around<00:06:07.000> it's<00:06:07.510> going<00:06:07.600> to<00:06:07.690> go<00:06:07.750> all

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
that curves around it's going to go all

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.330 
that curves around it's going to go all
the<00:06:08.260> way<00:06:08.290> to<00:06:08.410> our<00:06:08.860> back<00:06:09.220> leg<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:11.190> don't<00:06:12.190> feel

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
the way to our back leg I don't feel

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.710 
the way to our back leg I don't feel
like<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:12.550> have<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.670> draw<00:06:12.880> any<00:06:13.150> of<00:06:13.330> this<00:06:13.420> really

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
like you have to draw any of this really

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.860 
like you have to draw any of this really
fast<00:06:13.930> if<00:06:14.080> you<00:06:14.170> need<00:06:14.320> to<00:06:14.440> pause<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:15.070> video<00:06:15.220> and

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
fast if you need to pause the video and

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.270 
fast if you need to pause the video and
really<00:06:16.870> spend<00:06:17.170> time<00:06:17.410> I'm<00:06:17.650> drawing<00:06:18.160> these

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
really spend time I'm drawing these

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.400 
really spend time I'm drawing these
lines<00:06:18.480> take<00:06:19.480> your<00:06:19.630> time<00:06:19.810> there's<00:06:20.080> no<00:06:20.170> reason

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
lines take your time there's no reason
