00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.490
 outer lip shape taken 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.480
 qualify also for thin 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.490
 asymmetrical with lowered corners 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.619
 normal classic lip shape 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 considered the so-called venus onion 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.219
 when the upper lip is shaped 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.200
 bent bow and lower slightly 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.730
 swollen 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.710
 okay a little bit asymmetric lips 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.480
 so now we will be drawing in new 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.960
 the form I will tell you how it is correct 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.239
 do if we see asymmetry under in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.610
 In this case, the left side of the kabul is below 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.910
 take a little bit 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.670
 tonal framework we cover the border between 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.460
 skin color and color and blur 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 border to draw new 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.090
 contour now then will not slide 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 very good on pencil and using 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.100
 very natural color pencil ta 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.890
 part cubes that do not require correction 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.960
 right side she is very beautiful she 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.299
 has a very good shape i just 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.900
 I repeated the same for a moment I will not 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.400
 millimeter or magnify me just 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.850
 like this formula that they absolutely 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.509
 don't pull or just repeated the action 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 this part of the cubes which is a little lower 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 right i tried to maximize 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.400
 maximally fit 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.990
 bows bear fix sales through 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.170
 test 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.680
 mansi there ruin make draw 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.770
 large while her bright 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.750
 no contrast is not allocated to study 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.180
 no drink very natural color 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.289
 I maximize I learn to learn lips and 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.370
 trying to make her absolutely 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.770
 right symmetric 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.630
 necessarily rooms of different interest 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.330
 inside the cube here are such a stroke and 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:11.620
 develop that he did not seem very 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:14.020
 unnatural now lower lip 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.740
 Valera's lower lip is so swollen I 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.370
 a little bit 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.410
 removed the accent from the outer corners of the lips 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.800
 that is, here in this place I am against 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.470
 google a little less less and smoothly 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.490
 move smoothly to the center again 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:35.050
 use the other tonal cream it 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.290
 action later whom we cover those places 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.800
 which we are going to adjust 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.350
 a little bit inside protect from rita 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.780
 always convenient start from the center stupid 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.330
 you are . therefore must return 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.940
 now I start from the inside corners 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.490
 you draw won't go no oh 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:00.900
 natural google contour and a little bit 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.900
 higher right pig 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.060
 sure to give gone because inside 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:15.620
 the contour of the pencil will allow the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:18.320
 who is longer for lips i want to mix two 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.840
 lipstick color very much like to mix I have 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.550
 I like getting new shades to me very much 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.560
 I like it quite naturally 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.270
 look almost the color matches with her 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.520
 flowers was very natural 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.620
 natural me in this mitral color 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.070
 a little bit add peach 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.320
 shade 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:40.250
 I mix two colors add a little 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:42.470
 peach and paint over gubkin 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.120
 mix surely lipstick 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.320
 so brush gently mix 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.320
 lipstick with contour not 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.349
 look turned like natural and 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.030
 naturally very beautiful shade in 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.340
 so do lip correction be 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.250
 attentive and careful with type shine 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.840
 mats with mother of pearl and because 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.080
 the place where you yourself drew a new 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.030
 contour nacre or shine can hand over 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.800
 give out our secret and old frontier 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.799
 the old counter lip will be very obvious 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.290
 very very noticeable then 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.810
 you make a very serious correction 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.900
 try to use matte lipstick and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.910
 so for asymmetric bob correction 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.070
 use tonal means which 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.470
 blur the boundaries between the skin Kuban 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.250
 the color we used is perfect 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:37.060
 natural shade beige pencil 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.150
 drew a new form and two very three 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.110
 beautiful colors i'm belly and peach 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.500
 lipstick colors 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.080
 mixed and got natural such 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.080
