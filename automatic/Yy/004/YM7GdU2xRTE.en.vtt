guys when a sprinting get to their point
when<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.450> come<00:01:37.660> straight<00:01:37.870> back<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.260> your<00:01:38.350> time

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
when you come straight back to your time

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.680 
when you come straight back to your time
the<00:01:38.950> map<00:01:39.130> you've<00:01:39.610> got<00:01:39.820> yourself<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.270> point<00:01:40.570> now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
the map you've got yourself a point now

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.720 
the map you've got yourself a point now
I<00:01:40.960> think<00:01:41.230> the<00:01:41.410> build<00:01:41.620> we're<00:01:41.830> playing<00:01:42.130> on<00:01:42.340> there

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
I think the build we're playing on there

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.320 
I think the build we're playing on there
is<00:01:42.940> a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
is a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.810 
is a
the<00:01:43.720> point<00:01:43.990> limit<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.220> switch<00:01:45.550> sides

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
the point limit and you switch sides

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.060 
the point limit and you switch sides
after<00:01:46.270> five<00:01:46.480> minutes<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:46.930> believe<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.920> you're

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
after five minutes I believe so you're

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.980 
after five minutes I believe so you're
having<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.400> son<00:01:48.580> go<00:01:48.970> on<00:01:49.060> either<00:01:49.300> side<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.810> math

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
having a son go on either side in math

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.560 
having a son go on either side in math
but<00:01:50.470> blitz<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:51.040> really<00:01:51.670> really<00:01:52.120> fast

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
but blitz is really really fast

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.630 
but blitz is really really fast

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
there's no word on hardpoint coming back

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.220 
there's no word on hardpoint coming back
I<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.390> know<00:01:55.450> hard<00:01:55.810> points<00:01:56.140> are

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230
