00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
what I did from there this part is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.770 
what I did from there this part is
pretty<00:01:07.409> tricky<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.880> need<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.060> strafe

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
pretty tricky you will need to strafe

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.490 
pretty tricky you will need to strafe
and<00:01:10.110> dolphin<00:01:10.680> dive<00:01:10.890> onto<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.330> barrier<00:01:12.960> yes

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and dolphin dive onto the barrier yes

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.969 
and dolphin dive onto the barrier yes
it's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.700> dolphin<00:01:15.030> Strief<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.770> take<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
it's a dolphin Strief so this can take a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.280 
it's a dolphin Strief so this can take a
while<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.270> mess<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.869> follow<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
while if you mess up you can follow the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.190 
while if you mess up you can follow the
map<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.680> me<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.450> slide<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
map and me down or you can slide off and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.789 
map and me down or you can slide off and
be<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.189> debris<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.390> um<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.290> may<00:01:25.500> take<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
be on the debris so um this may take a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.130 
be on the debris so um this may take a
while<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.330> once<00:01:27.330> you're<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> barrier
