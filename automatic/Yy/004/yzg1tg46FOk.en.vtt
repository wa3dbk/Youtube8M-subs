00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello to your bridlav and in front of us 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.269
 fight on the map of the NSC for the province of Stalingrad 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.630
 between clans with a black mark and a clan 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.000
 the end of a long time something was not vidosikov not 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 from the ends not from demons long ago 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.869
 ensk 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.189
 and in fact that's what we have, and it taxes 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.189
 no more than 6 acres 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 2 khavik from 47 batches and 4 pts 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:40.649
 2 and 3 and 2 and 4 set up quite obvious to us 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.860
 reminds city option why such 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.600
 good Ural city version 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.780
 psyche in European rule usually 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 He plays it easier setup: 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.440
 Ural and the eight-hour prime of course this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.239
 there is no map playing from the city 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 artillery and the city is passed very 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 fast for tag 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.250
 profile card accordingly they what 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 and how do they know e 3 steel in the loophole 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.020
 highlight but many failures for some reason 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.870
 nothing shines but i get the key 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.530
 I think later will express 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.600
 you can shine differently seven your task 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.230
 fully performs it passes forward 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 will try to push up now 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.610
 pay them a little bit 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.990
 she purses she x-ray city 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.470
 walk across the board 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 from afar weave occupy a trapezoid already 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.570
 gone occupy a rectangle basically 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.070
 the whole city has already been pressed to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.460
 something like the old Sarov 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.180
 tactics quickly take this here 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 place then in a large circle to go 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.730
 pick up everything on the base in this case 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.950
 this sleeper 50b ends decided small 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.820
 odds give incomprehensible two ends cops 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.940
 but it is not so important in this case. 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.040
 quotes again the ends are very very 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.530
 heavy pile 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.020
 poteshki weave and begins to capture something 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.900
 there is to understand who the cops but for some reason not 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.019
 can 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.110
 In principle, the standard is not so important. 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.939
 for incko division of part of forces david 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.079
 part of its forces trying to take its base 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:46.849
 enemy and now constantly pause to 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:48.769
 it was all better seen here is part of the forces 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.920
 ends 2 weave 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.530
 e4 what are they doing now they are nothing 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.930
 week because you're in this machine is not 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.340
 can become and creation centered 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.470
 I will not shoot them corny 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.019
 accordingly, these two do not work 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:09.250
 machines at least somehow work account 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:13.099
 remind 20 weights now 11 magic 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.540
 shotny baht but the base area two or three times 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:21.079
 4 5 ends against 1 22 and a half roughly 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.019
 saying three three three and a half that is 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.989
 In principle, most of the scales are enemy 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:31.099
 bases and most ends for enemy 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.019
 base ends acrylic said well 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.440
 that is, the team is focused mainly 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:41.000
 the fact not to give his pierced of 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.650
 enemy base ends decide to go out 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.230
 principle, the right decision is trying 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.569
 take and eat two bosses 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.049
 I am the same third who returned 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.049
 from the loopholes 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.889
 it turns out they take seven 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.669
 It turns out to pick up the same one hundredth 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.879
 and in principle, the score is more or less 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.549
 caught up 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.129
 dou all I see the counting machine but 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.109
 no less and again actually 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.479
 I want to ask questions, yes, I 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.269
 I understand the clans well know how to play NSC 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:14.269
 but why not take arta here 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.880
 fundamentally really now looking 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.380
 at stake here if she'd stood mouth 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.590
 did not throw my 3000 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.849
 so here is the question or if here 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.909
 there was art now 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:28.470
 she would not have thrown in here or 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:31.830
 this machine is open 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.720
 some kind of jumping or 920 on my 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.070
 glance she would have thrown it 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.920
 1000 45 just easy and not 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.260
 would not have to how to attack 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.800
 who has art on ensk can cost 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.860
 in the defa 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.280
 by the enemy in doing so will cover 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.830
 the score is equal 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.020
 and see what the ends did and not for 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.510
 account that own their base can 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.240
 Here are these houses in principle 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.890
 shoot through the tag turn on that sevens 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.120
 x-ray while saves 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:06.240
 from possible art which of course is not 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.020
 now in principle ends in better 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.520
 situation in my opinion than the label at 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.420
 tags don't really work here 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:20.700
 much like something that's surrendered Panofsky 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:23.520
 e4 are visible here in two pt-shki visible 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.360
 was baht and he still went back on 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.690
 got the rear roller and died of course 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.600
 such kosyachkov should not be played 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.030
 plans are not weak therefore such actions 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.540
 can lead to disastrous results 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.570
 like your own that's why on 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.720
 shot weave need vylazit and tower 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.479
 turns to him and the belly of such 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.280
 here are the little moments when 544 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.130
 quite a large number of even 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.620
 tanks can be seen almost in 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.400
 each group 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:01.940
 just about shot out here you are very centurions 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.290
 a lot and now will solve the question as far as 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.570
 shot tanks will not vylazit 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.570
 and how much enemy tanks will be 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:14.180
 to die for example because of such 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.180
 shots 65 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.630
 i 'm fine now you are here 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.490
 get together in mark come out and collect here 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.220
 these two cars are all and through the center you can 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.160
 here it is to disassemble these two two cars 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.630
 not actually tenants 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.600
 as soon as the label does it if 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:37.449
 will do in the end must do 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:40.360
 here until comes out in the end bs 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.620
 this is the right action for my 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.199
 a look could make it a little 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.570
 before and all now they have 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.220
 ability to shoot shot ends and 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.310
 on this in principle 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:54.660
 ends they can't do anything about it 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.660
 have no right to refuse 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:06.760
 accounting machines remain all jokers 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.970
 label does not want to lose cars principle 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.970
 right why lose cars when they 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.210
 frost and can not freeze them 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.210
 11 7 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:27.820
 the ends have mates of artillery I take my 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:31.060
 words for some reason do not see frags 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.290
 but in any case, there is a battle with the nominal on 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:37.560
 skill beat 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.560
 and the score is 15:07 thanks everyone for watching
