connection<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.250> I<00:00:02.910> think<00:00:02.940> one<00:00:03.300> thing<00:00:03.330> that

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
connection and I think one thing that

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.630 
connection and I think one thing that
happened<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.379> me<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.680> my<00:00:04.710> undergrad<00:00:05.190> career

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
happened to me in my undergrad career

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.190 
happened to me in my undergrad career
which<00:00:06.150> probably<00:00:06.390> happens<00:00:06.840> to<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> lot<00:00:07.049> of

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
which probably happens to a lot of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.529 
which probably happens to a lot of
engineers<00:00:07.770> mathematicians<00:00:08.429> people<00:00:09.360> who<00:00:09.419> were

engineers mathematicians people who were

doing the hard sciences chemistry
biology<00:00:11.459> things<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.119> that<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.449> they<00:00:12.570> start

biology things like that is they start

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.810 
biology things like that is they start
to<00:00:12.869> focus<00:00:13.049> very<00:00:13.289> quickly<00:00:13.769> once<00:00:14.489> they<00:00:14.669> got

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to focus very quickly once they got

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880 
to focus very quickly once they got

quote-unquote out of the way I know a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
lot of engineering students that while

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.030 
lot of engineering students that while
they<00:00:21.030> did<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.960> four<00:00:22.290> years<00:00:22.470> straight<00:00:22.860> it<00:00:22.980> was

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
they did for four years straight it was

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.010 
they did for four years straight it was
just<00:00:23.250> hard<00:00:23.700> core<00:00:24.000> engineering<00:00:24.420> studies<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
just hard core engineering studies and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.290 
just hard core engineering studies and
no<00:00:25.320> other<00:00:25.530> extracurricular<00:00:26.100> activities<00:00:27.000> and

no other extracurricular activities and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.260 
no other extracurricular activities and
I<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.110> friend<00:00:28.560> who<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:29.700> old<00:00:29.850> friend<00:00:30.030> who

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
I have a friend who an old friend who

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.550 
I have a friend who an old friend who
did<00:00:30.450> that<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.840> had<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.020> really<00:00:31.200> hard<00:00:31.350> time

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
did that it had a really hard time

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
did that it had a really hard time
finding<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> job<00:00:32.340> once<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.730> graduated

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
finding a job once they graduated

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
finding a job once they graduated
because<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.199> were<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.620> focused<00:00:34.859> on<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.460> but

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
because they were so focused on that but

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.419 
because they were so focused on that but
they<00:00:35.909> didn't<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.570> had<00:00:36.600> developed<00:00:37.429> socially

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
they didn't they had developed socially

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.689 
they didn't they had developed socially
and<00:00:38.699> you<00:00:39.269> know<00:00:39.390> leadership<00:00:40.019> ways<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.399> took

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
and you know leadership ways and it took

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:42.979 
and you know leadership ways and it took
them<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> year<00:00:42.269> and<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.659> find<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.960> job

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
them like a year and have to find a job

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.319 
them like a year and have to find a job
because<00:00:43.409> they<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:46.039> think<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.329> difficult

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because they have I think it's difficult

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
because they have I think it's difficult
when<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.719> 18<00:00:49.109> years<00:00:49.260> old<00:00:49.530> which<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:49.949> how

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
when you're 18 years old which is how

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.459 
when you're 18 years old which is how
old<00:00:50.429> I<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.579> taking<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.449> writing<00:00:51.870> class<00:00:52.019> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
old I was taking my writing class to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.379 
old I was taking my writing class to
think<00:00:52.889> about<00:00:53.159> what<00:00:53.429> you<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:53.609> want<00:00:54.179> out<00:00:54.359> of

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:54.389 
think about what you really want out of

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:59.000 
think about what you really want out of
it<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:55.499> think<00:00:56.690> most<00:00:57.690> technical<00:00:58.199> people<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.769> that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it I think most technical people at that

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
it I think most technical people at that
age<00:01:00.260> do<00:01:01.260> view<00:01:01.739> classes<00:01:02.579> outside<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.299> their

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
age do view classes outside of their

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.270 
age do view classes outside of their
primary<00:01:03.960> interest<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:04.680> something<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.190> they

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
primary interest or something that they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.670 
primary interest or something that they
believe<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.150> very<00:01:06.660> targeted<00:01:07.200> towards<00:01:07.530> their

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
believe is very targeted towards their

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
believe is very targeted towards their
career<00:01:08.040> goals<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.850> view<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> distraction

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
career goals they view as a distraction

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
career goals they view as a distraction
and<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.410> I<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.620> similar<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.160> that<00:01:11.250> regard

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and I think I was similar in that regard

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.080 
and I think I was similar in that regard
I<00:01:12.060> was<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.690> well<00:01:13.470> pleased<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
I was very well pleased with the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.180 
I was very well pleased with the
education<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.180> received<00:01:15.320> as<00:01:16.320> far<00:01:16.620> as<00:01:16.830> how<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
education I received as far as how the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.120 
education I received as far as how the
engineering<00:01:17.640> discipline<00:01:18.030> goes

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
engineering discipline goes

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.660 
engineering discipline goes
unfortunately<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:21.120> seems<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.440> be<00:01:22.620> a<00:01:23.040> small

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
unfortunately that seems to be a small

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 
unfortunately that seems to be a small
set<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> skills<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.170> required<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
set of the skills that I'm required to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.420 
set of the skills that I'm required to
use<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.370> on<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:27.450> daily<00:01:27.630> basis<00:01:28.080> whether<00:01:28.620> you<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
use here on a daily basis whether you to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.970 
use here on a daily basis whether you to
be<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.550> biology<00:01:30.090> major<00:01:30.120> or<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.660> you<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.440> a

I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:35.010> that<00:01:35.910> part<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.600> irrelevant

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
I think that part is actually irrelevant

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.920 
I think that part is actually irrelevant
it's<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.890> learning<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.150> able<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.540> do

it's really learning to be able to do
some<00:01:40.350> core<00:01:40.710> fundamentals<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.940> go<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
some core fundamentals when you go to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.610 
some core fundamentals when you go to
the<00:01:42.240> workforce<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.870> that's<00:01:43.200> being<00:01:43.350> able<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
the workforce and that's being able to

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.350 
the workforce and that's being able to
analyze<00:01:44.100> something<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.150> able<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
communicate something I'd say medicine

if<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> ask<00:01:48.300> me<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> most<00:01:48.780> important
