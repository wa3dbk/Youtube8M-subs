00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
I'm with Terry malade of gardens in the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.089 
I'm with Terry malade of gardens in the
sky<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.879> they<00:00:06.480> do<00:00:06.540> green<00:00:07.049> roof<00:00:07.259> installations

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
sky and they do green roof installations

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.100 
sky and they do green roof installations
but<00:00:08.309> I'm<00:00:08.429> fascinated<00:00:08.700> by<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.360> new<00:00:09.750> one<00:00:09.960> that

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
but I'm fascinated by this new one that

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.290 
but I'm fascinated by this new one that
you<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:10.440> Gary<00:00:10.800> tell<00:00:11.309> me<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:11.550> how<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.120> works

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
you have Gary tell me about how it works

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.089 
you have Gary tell me about how it works
so<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.840> called<00:00:13.110> live<00:00:13.410> roof<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
so this is called live roof and it's a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.640 
so this is called live roof and it's a
modular<00:00:14.580> system<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.450> trays<00:00:15.719> are<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.170> foot<00:00:16.500> by

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
modular system the trays are one foot by

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.410 
modular system the trays are one foot by
two<00:00:16.710> feet<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> put<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.060> these<00:00:18.119> trees

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
two feet can I put one of these trees

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.660 
two feet can I put one of these trees
episode<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> sector<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:19.980> em<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
episode is a sector of em this is a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
episode is a sector of em this is a
smaller<00:00:21.180> profile<00:00:21.779> trade<00:00:22.109> which<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.439> only<00:00:22.590> two

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
smaller profile trade which is only two

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.769 
smaller profile trade which is only two
and<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> half<00:00:23.310> inches<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:23.970> allows<00:00:24.359> us<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and a half inches which is allows us to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.750 
and a half inches which is allows us to
do<00:00:24.930> lighter<00:00:25.199> weight<00:00:25.560> right<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
do lighter weight right this is a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
do lighter weight right this is a
standard<00:00:27.420> tray<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.080> four<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> half

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
standard tray which is four and a half

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880 
standard tray which is four and a half
inches<00:00:29.330> in<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.320> soil<00:00:31.560> composition

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
inches in that this the soil composition

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
inches in that this the soil composition
is<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.489> interesting<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.210> based

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is really interesting because it's based

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
is really interesting because it's based
on<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> european<00:00:34.200> standard<00:00:34.649> which<00:00:35.010> allows<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
on a european standard which allows the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
on a european standard which allows the
plans<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.210> much<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:36.930> more

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
plans to be much much more

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.590 
plans to be much much more
drought-tolerant<00:00:38.000> right<00:00:39.000> completely

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
drought-tolerant right completely

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.510 
drought-tolerant right completely
drought<00:00:40.020> wrong<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.680> no<00:00:40.800> such<00:00:40.860> thing<00:00:41.070> but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
drought wrong there is no such thing but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
drought wrong there is no such thing but
we<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.390> looking<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.170> system<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.649> being

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
we are looking at this system as being

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
we are looking at this system as being
both<00:00:44.070> versatile<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.940> instantaneous<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
both versatile and instantaneous you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.660 
both versatile and instantaneous you
know<00:00:46.320> always<00:00:46.530> people<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.190> always<00:00:47.280> asking<00:00:47.370> for

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
know always people are always asking for

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.729 
know always people are always asking for
instantaneous<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> yeah<00:00:49.410> absolutely

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
instantaneous here it is yeah absolutely

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.350 
instantaneous here it is yeah absolutely
you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> roof<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
you know you put on this roof and it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
you know you put on this roof and it
says<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> brown<00:00:52.230> Roux<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
says it's a brown Roux but that's a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
says it's a brown Roux but that's a
green<00:00:53.129> room<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.489> right<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.360> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
green room that's right what we do that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.750 
green room that's right what we do that
too<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.309> people<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.699> me

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
too but so this is for people like me

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
too but so this is for people like me
with<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> short<00:00:57.329> attention<00:00:57.449> span<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.230> also

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with a short attention span and also

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.049 
with a short attention span and also
people<00:00:58.949> who<00:00:59.100> don't<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.609> any<00:00:59.789> care

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
people who don't want to do any care

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.690 
people who don't want to do any care
this<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> an<00:01:00.960> ultimate

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
this is an ultimate

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.140 
this is an ultimate
in<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.970> last<00:01:02.900> care<00:01:03.320> kind<00:01:03.680> of<00:01:03.800> model<00:01:04.760> why<00:01:05.090> is

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
in the last care kind of model why is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.600 
in the last care kind of model why is
that<00:01:05.330> just<00:01:05.870> because<00:01:05.930> there's<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.980> very<00:01:07.160> densely

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
that just because there's a very densely

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.050 
that just because there's a very densely
packed<00:01:08.710> system<00:01:09.710> here<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.250> nothing<00:01:11.030> really

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
packed system here so nothing really

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.150 
packed system here so nothing really
like<00:01:11.660> no<00:01:11.840> weeds<00:01:12.140> can<00:01:12.380> really<00:01:12.620> get<00:01:12.770> in<00:01:12.950> here

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
like no weeds can really get in here

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.770 
like no weeds can really get in here
because<00:01:13.280> it's<00:01:13.580> all<00:01:13.760> packed<00:01:14.150> out<00:01:14.360> with<00:01:14.510> roots

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
because it's all packed out with roots

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.750 
because it's all packed out with roots
weeds<00:01:15.620> can<00:01:15.830> only<00:01:15.950> penetrate<00:01:16.190> where<00:01:16.610> there's

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
weeds can only penetrate where there's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.820 
weeds can only penetrate where there's
an<00:01:16.910> absence<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.390> plans<00:01:17.690> right<00:01:18.050> this<00:01:18.470> doesn't

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
an absence of plans right this doesn't

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.620 
an absence of plans right this doesn't
have<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.729> instead<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.240> actually<00:01:20.540> having

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
have that so instead of actually having

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.360 
have that so instead of actually having
problems<00:01:21.260> with<00:01:21.440> waiting<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.040> all<00:01:22.130> that

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
problems with waiting and all that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.500 
problems with waiting and all that
you're<00:01:22.700> not<00:01:22.820> going<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.210> because

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
you're not going to have that because

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.530 
you're not going to have that because
it's<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:23.870> densely<00:01:24.380> packed<00:01:24.650> right<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:25.910> this<00:01:26.390> is

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
it's so densely packed right so this is

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.260 
it's so densely packed right so this is
your<00:01:26.690> live<00:01:26.930> roof<00:01:27.320> now<00:01:28.160> one<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.240> problems

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
your live roof now one of the problems

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.180 
your live roof now one of the problems
I'd<00:01:29.690> always<00:01:29.870> heard<00:01:30.110> about<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.590> big<00:01:30.860> problem

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
I'd always heard about the big problem

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.850 
I'd always heard about the big problem
was<00:01:31.280> controlling<00:01:32.150> dirt<00:01:33.020> getting<00:01:33.380> through<00:01:33.620> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
was controlling dirt getting through and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.740 
was controlling dirt getting through and
clogging<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.369> drains<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.180> maintenance

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
clogging the drains and maintenance

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.230 
clogging the drains and maintenance
under<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.320> green<00:01:36.560> relations<00:01:37.369> like<00:01:37.640> guys<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.210> a

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
under the green relations like guys is a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.270 
under the green relations like guys is a
complete<00:01:38.660> system<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:39.229> has<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:40.030> has<00:01:41.030> a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
complete system that has that has a

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.469 
complete system that has that has a
drainage<00:01:43.280> system<00:01:43.610> built<00:01:43.820> into<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.150> tray

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
drainage system built into the tray

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.420 
drainage system built into the tray
right<00:01:44.869> those<00:01:45.259> soil<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.650> going<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.860> escape<00:01:46.100> from

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
right those soil is going to escape from

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.730 
right those soil is going to escape from
here<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.759> can<00:01:46.850> wash<00:01:47.180> into<00:01:47.509> your<00:01:47.810> drains<00:01:48.110> so

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
here you can wash into your drains so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.499 
here you can wash into your drains so
that's<00:01:48.950> that's<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.490> benefit<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.060> right

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
that's that's the benefit of this right

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.970 
that's that's the benefit of this right
whereas<00:01:51.050> when<00:01:51.200> we<00:01:51.350> do

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
whereas when we do

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.800 
whereas when we do
typical<00:01:52.430> green<00:01:52.580> group<00:01:52.820> we're<00:01:53.030> very<00:01:53.450> aware<00:01:53.630> of

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
typical green group we're very aware of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.560 
typical green group we're very aware of
what<00:01:54.530> we<00:01:54.740> have<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:54.980> do<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.280> isolate<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.270> drains

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
what we have to do to isolate the drains

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.990 
what we have to do to isolate the drains
from<00:01:56.750> any<00:01:57.020> kind<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.530> impact<00:01:58.280> from<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.610> soil

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
from any kind of impact from the soil

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.790 
from any kind of impact from the soil
because<00:01:59.510> that<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.870> problem<00:02:00.170> because<00:02:00.620> the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
because that is a problem because the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.220 
because that is a problem because the
soil<00:02:00.950> will<00:02:01.190> blow<00:02:01.370> around<00:02:01.520> when<00:02:02.480> it's<00:02:02.600> dry<00:02:02.870> and

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
soil will blow around when it's dry and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.020 
soil will blow around when it's dry and
it<00:02:03.380> will<00:02:03.500> blow<00:02:03.710> into<00:02:03.890> your<00:02:04.070> drains<00:02:04.370> this<00:02:04.670> it's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
it will blow into your drains this it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.000 
it will blow into your drains this it's
not<00:02:05.120> going<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.420> happen<00:02:05.510> here<00:02:05.840> we've<00:02:06.620> got<00:02:06.650> your
