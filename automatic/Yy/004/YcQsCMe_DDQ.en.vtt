00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.300 
scale comparison so the two pieces here
are<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.699> new<00:00:29.420> rock<00:00:29.720> formations<00:00:30.439> which<00:00:31.039> I

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
are the new rock formations which I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.910 
are the new rock formations which I
originally<00:00:32.180> designed<00:00:32.629> as<00:00:32.930> a<00:00:32.989> custom<00:00:33.440> project

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
originally designed as a custom project

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.520 
originally designed as a custom project
and<00:00:34.070> decided<00:00:34.760> that<00:00:34.790> they<00:00:35.479> really<00:00:36.110> came<00:00:36.350> out<00:00:36.470> so

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
and decided that they really came out so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.799 
and decided that they really came out so
nice<00:00:36.949> and<00:00:37.190> offered<00:00:37.610> such<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.850> nice<00:00:38.089> variation

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
nice and offered such a nice variation

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.660 
nice and offered such a nice variation
from<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.559> rock<00:00:39.920> features<00:00:40.280> that<00:00:40.400> I've<00:00:40.519> been

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
from the rock features that I've been

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.549 
from the rock features that I've been
doing<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.449> would<00:00:41.659> included<00:00:42.049> as<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.170> normal

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
doing that I would included as a normal

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.390 
doing that I would included as a normal
feature<00:00:42.769> in<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> store<00:00:43.400> and<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:45.129> barrels<00:00:46.129> and

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
feature in the store and the barrels and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.939 
feature in the store and the barrels and
crates<00:00:46.760> which<00:00:47.299> are<00:00:47.720> connect<00:00:48.350> as<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.589> supply

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
crates which are connect as a supply

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.109 
crates which are connect as a supply
depot<00:00:48.979> or<00:00:49.549> as<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.600> defensive<00:00:51.170> barricade<00:00:52.089> so<00:00:53.089> a

depot or as a defensive barricade so a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.460 
depot or as a defensive barricade so a
couple<00:00:53.360> things<00:00:53.629> about<00:00:53.839> each<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.320> pieces

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
couple things about each of the pieces

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.840 
couple things about each of the pieces
very<00:00:54.799> quickly<00:00:55.299> the<00:00:56.299> rock<00:00:57.260> formation<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.100> a

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
very quickly the rock formation is a

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.990 
very quickly the rock formation is a
little<00:00:59.210> over<00:00:59.479> four<00:00:59.960> inches<00:01:00.140> y<00:01:00.850> stands<00:01:01.850> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
little over four inches y stands a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.840 
little over four inches y stands a
couple<00:01:02.299> inches<00:01:02.449> tall<00:01:03.309> comes<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.549> you<00:01:04.729> know

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
couple inches tall comes and you know

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.789 
couple inches tall comes and you know
these<00:01:05.000> are<00:01:05.119> all<00:01:05.239> hand-carved<00:01:05.689> I'm<00:01:06.470> not<00:01:06.619> going

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
these are all hand-carved I'm not going

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.200 
these are all hand-carved I'm not going
to<00:01:06.860> make<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:06.979> mold<00:01:07.280> from<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.670> ACE<00:01:07.760> partly

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
to make a mold from the ACE partly

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.900 
to make a mold from the ACE partly
because<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.840> deep<00:01:09.050> crevices<00:01:09.770> in<00:01:10.280> between<00:01:10.760> the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
because the deep crevices in between the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.000 
because the deep crevices in between the
rocks<00:01:11.120> which<00:01:11.540> really<00:01:12.200> kind<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.620> gives<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:12.980> that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
rocks which really kind of gives it that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.700 
rocks which really kind of gives it that
granite<00:01:13.640> feel<00:01:14.030> where<00:01:14.440> granite<00:01:15.440> often

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
granite feel where granite often

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.170 
granite feel where granite often
fractures<00:01:16.220> but<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> rocks<00:01:16.820> don't<00:01:17.030> really

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
fractures but the rocks don't really

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.000 
fractures but the rocks don't really
move<00:01:17.330> far<00:01:17.570> apart<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:18.230> you<00:01:18.290> get<00:01:18.500> these<00:01:18.620> wet

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
move far apart and so you get these wet

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.670 
move far apart and so you get these wet
weathered<00:01:19.490> lines<00:01:20.260> casting<00:01:21.260> that's<00:01:21.440> going<00:01:21.620> to

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
weathered lines casting that's going to

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.230 
weathered lines casting that's going to
be<00:01:21.800> really<00:01:21.950> tricky<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.550> I<00:01:22.580> thought<00:01:22.850> I'd<00:01:23.030> keep

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
be really tricky so I thought I'd keep

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.840 
be really tricky so I thought I'd keep
these<00:01:23.540> as<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.840> hand<00:01:24.320> carved<00:01:24.620> piece<00:01:24.850> they're

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
these as a hand carved piece they're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.070 
these as a hand carved piece they're
mounted<00:01:26.150> on<00:01:26.270> three<00:01:26.480> sixteenth<00:01:26.870> inch
