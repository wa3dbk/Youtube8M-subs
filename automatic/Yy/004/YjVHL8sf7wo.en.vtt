Tampa Bay Buccaneers you know they are a
little<00:02:31.209> short<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:32.019> because<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.470> guys<00:02:32.590> know

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
little short on it because you guys know

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.640 
little short on it because you guys know
keep<00:02:33.190> Talib<00:02:33.459> hell<00:02:33.700> left<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.269> he<00:02:34.780> went<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.320> the

keep Talib hell left and he went to the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.500 
keep Talib hell left and he went to the
New<00:02:35.799> England<00:02:35.920> Patriots<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.329> why<00:02:37.480> I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
New England Patriots so that is why I

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.300 
New England Patriots so that is why I
decided<00:02:37.750> go<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.500> table<00:02:38.769> Buccaneers

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
decided go to the table Buccaneers

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.250 
decided go to the table Buccaneers
because<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:40.000> my<00:02:40.150> opinion<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:40.660> are<00:02:40.690> short<00:02:41.109> on

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
because in my opinion they are short on

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.319 
because in my opinion they are short on
corner<00:02:41.650> backs<00:02:41.859> and<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> great

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
corner backs and that is a great

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.300 
corner backs and that is a great
