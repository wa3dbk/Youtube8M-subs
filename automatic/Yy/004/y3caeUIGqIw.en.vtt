use ljo just because it is a lot harder

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.090 
use ljo just because it is a lot harder
as<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> one-person<00:00:33.809> battle<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> left<00:00:34.890> spin

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
as a one-person battle to do a left spin

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.200 
as a one-person battle to do a left spin
it<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:35.550> spin<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.090> them

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it with the right spin and have them

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
it with the right spin and have them
launch<00:00:36.420> somewhat<00:00:37.079> close<00:00:37.500> together<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.010> time
