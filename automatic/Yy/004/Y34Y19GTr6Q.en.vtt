00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.620

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.790
 worth downloading where once per 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.440
 week bringing nobody here free 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 for us to do a gameplay a review 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.730
 and to know why it's really worth it 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.580
 download this game and the game I bring today 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 brothers in arms, three sons of the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.490
 launch time war and fresh loft 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.660
 left now December 18 simultaneously 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 both for 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.759
 windows phone and android also going 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 be knowing by remembering visit the site 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.190
 from our ford partners.com.au 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.809
 technology speak in Portuguese to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.809
 you who likes related subjects 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.190
 to android technology and everything else and let's 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.010
 It matters to us that we are going to know this 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.750
 Super game that 's really cool, I 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.750
 recommend go carton wheel 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.310
 the game that I bring today and already puts it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.590
 among the main launches of 2014 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.140
 is the launch of gameloft now for 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.300
 end of the year free in the frank style 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.030
 that is, you have purchases within the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.650
 game but I'm here in Chapter 3 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.229
 So far I have not had any problems in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.270
 relation to the advance in the game that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.990
 to make certain purchases for 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.250
 advance 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.649
 so I believe you will succeed 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.479
 play normally without having to invest 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.670
 real money in the game 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.759
 the game is set in the second war 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.910
 world after the attack on Normandy is a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.830
 of the third person style with auto 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.710
 protection, or whenever you 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.619
 approach your character next few 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 vine he has self protects but 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.220
 you have the freedom to make the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.710
 movements with him even leaving 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.899
 I was pleased by this freedom. 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.330
 quite a bit different from those 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.880
 globe games where you do not command 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.160
 character you just command the shot and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.020
 He's going alone in this game, not you. 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.660
 has full freedom to do so 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.209
 moving your character and is 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.370
 The frantic shooting phases are medium 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.069
 around five minutes in the beginning one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.900
 phase for learning just a little 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.940
 shorter but as you go 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
 advancing in the game these make 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.459
 little longer and more challenging 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.170
 are various types of missions such as missions 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.470
 of attacks or omissions you have to 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.020
 stand as snip or even phase you 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.270
 need to have stealthy sachs actions pass 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.400
 totally unnoticed what it is 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.590
 interesting is cool is that you 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.050
 with a battle partner is a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.630
 soldier you are also performing the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.459
 pilates on it improvements and you have a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.200
 list of soldiers that you can be 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.130
 choosing there to accompany you 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.130
 during missions 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.819
 I have the strong point of the game. 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.550
 quote the chart that I think is right 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.650
 cool it does not have a configuration on 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.930
 game for me it's getting better or worse 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.599
 graphic this is already automatic 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.670
 depending on your phone's hardware 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.130
 I'm using here some on phone 51 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.380
 mid-level cell phone graphic 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.540
 It's very cool, I believe that one 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.130
 with the best hardware you will 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.319
 have more effects mainly than 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.390
 particles with mass everything else 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.580
 Another thing that pleased me a great deal is the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.739
 freedom of movement of character 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.989
 although the game is not open-world 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.390
 but that he has some maps there that 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.030
 allow you to scan in a 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.640
 I like this freedom and the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.280
 gameplay that at first I confess that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.260
 take a little bit but after a few ten 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.690
 you will adapt to it 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.910
 It is simple and easy to play and a 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.590
 another thing I need to highlight the option 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.150
 to play offline, this is cool 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.510
 mainly there you are playing 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.220
 routes without an internet connection 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.680
 I did not like the game although he 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.660
 have a chat option that does not have the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.359
 Then multiplayer version you will play 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.310
 on the whole campaign part by the 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.620
 least until the gameloft brings some 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.769
 update that allows the option 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.780
 multiplayer for now is solo game is 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.300
 a very cool bath game guaranteed there 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.860
 several hours of fun I recommend and 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.860
 worth downloading yes 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.530
 well if you like watching the game 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.360
 set in Second War I believe 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.409
 you will like brothers in arms 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.139
 3 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.849
 I hope you like my recommendation. 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.740
 remembering are three weekly videos here 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.599

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.169

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.389
