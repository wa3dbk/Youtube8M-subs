00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.059
 trick to peel cds or dvds 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.299
 there are countless crafts that are 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.430
 can do with recycled cds 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.039
 you can see many of these ideas in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.880
 our videos by clicking on the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.740
 links that appear on the screen 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.489
 but in many occasions it is 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.160
 essential transparent leave by 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.309
 we'll show you how easy and fast 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.559
 what can be done by leaving the 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.350
 impeccably transparent just 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.250
 we will need the following a cedÃ© as 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.010
 it is logical and packing tape 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.060
 Well, it's as simple as cutting 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.060
 a piece of duct tape 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.740
 paste it very well stuck on the cd 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 and give a dry pull 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.550
 what have you been surprised at how easy it is 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.930
 it comes out you just have to repeat this 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.930
 operation throughout the cde 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.820
 an advice 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.120
 so you do not break the ribbon 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.890
 adhesive as to me buy it quality 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.260
 notwithstanding the small remnants of 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.210
 Tape glue are removed 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.660
 easily with a little alcohol or 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.660
 acetone 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.870
 and we do another 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.830
 if you see that the aluminum layer is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.990
 resist the first pull first you have 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.330
 to make a radial cut with a cutter 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.600
 do not press too much it's about 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.980
 Cut the aluminum without damaging the plastic 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.260
 Now we stick a piece of duct tape 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.240
 about the area to which we have given the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.240
 so we press well cut 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.970
 and we give a dry pull 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.730
 repeat the operation exactly the same 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.730
 that before 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.090
