00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.960
 there are days there in the morning he had a life beyond the museums too 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.299
 Berlin 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.539
 they had the house now in Afghanistan are three but 99 of the hour 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.710
 to go to work 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.480
 but here he is already in a newspaper 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 as at the last big he CDU in Essen 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.220
 three weeks ago 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.990
 If you see her, you can buy his family doctor or a large wooden cross 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.789
 Family doctor equal to three Aron 9 90 the hour I want politicians 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.050
 and he has gone 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.840
 What is the first time that the fees of family doctors since 2007 by ten percent 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.010
 gone up 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.440
 that is, they have four weeks ago 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.840
 the naturally untenable states that we all but know the same 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.760
 I demo mine 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.630
 Anyone would demonstrate to him Â«For four euros the 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.720
 Work has to go where do we get there? 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.400
 at all somewhere in the year 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.210
 because all roads are blocked 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.940
 the job miracle that we have that also finds in the low-wage sector city 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.850
 or 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.060
 we have a job there or even three million unemployed we have 6 3 6 2 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.909
 the hartz4 recipient and only three million unemployed screed that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090
 he's frozen so much fun 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.670
 or as Aufstocker 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.110
 Aufstocker go on tour there was indeed a full job earned but so little 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.380
 Money l that their salary still needs to be increased to hartz-iv level 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.750
 So if you're like Wanner as a family doctor 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.260
 For 93 work they go insurer week, they have 46 euros 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.710
 in the month 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.710
 and that would have increased her seven euros 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 as an anarchist four major roles more 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.840
 hartz4 he is so negatively occupied meanwhile this is the word that has 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.020
 had a negative connotation and meanwhile lent over the company 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.090
 said the Zuger term which both seriously 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.610
 and if I do not get the people through the 2 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.060
 more 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.210
 Manama workers temporary workers and work by themselves 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.849
 at the Marburg break of the sentences unemployed than even the least and 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.899
 as far as I can see that I'm so definite but so are Americans now 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.899
 Never say in America you would say a little bit out of it 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.420
 that sounds a lot more optimistic he is between two jobs 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.919
 why do not they say then unemployed I still work breaks 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 where the unemployment benefit i pause bread at the edge 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.279
 I already shattered that the first as Aufstocker work 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.929
 which is reluctantly 390 hour so little that is not again 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.159
 Victory in a row against Sarrazin or 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.909
 He has discovered before all the abuse of Muslims as a source of money 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.689
 always hacked on the hartz iv receivers 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.090
 Sarrazin as a financial senator of Berlin made a self - experiment and 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.039
 found out that for 3 EUR 73 office 8 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.039
 balanced and recyclable rich drain approx 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.669
 For the family doctor that means one hour of work a day 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.449
 because who is balanced and invites the fabric empire 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.739
 I read the article on the whole earth in the end I was really with 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.489
 the nerves down he is at the end then not if the health insurance 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 claims that the family doctors after 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.340
 Deduction of all costs for the practice on average 10 000 euros gross per month 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.949
 from 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:39.299
 At 93 then that means this man is going to work 2500 hours a month 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.129
 so you do not want to lie 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.019
 there comes a 40-hour week non-election 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 that's 80 hours 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.900
 so he sees 80 pieces of land from work here is one 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.899
 Calculation weakness arises, of course, Judge White River 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.099
 trier 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.749
 I put a lot then I know that the Saracen son of 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:22.620
 Arx is 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.050
 yes you see that also Fox in his mobile phone calls rich household 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.500
 Wherever you work around the clock you can say the spokeswoman Sarrazin 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.610
 to better understand 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.039
 Now, over that with the chaotic series we win the patient though 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.840
 it should not be cold anymore he sees yellow white water but like Sarrazin why 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.599
 Books have never gotten far 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.459
 yes those are the empty ones of a female as a child so hot was bathed more 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.770
 you should have the sack you should not have fired at the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.599
 Bundesbank remains with he has more time to write books that's it 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.330
 a bonus 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.360
 or he will always do everything so the newspaper "The Dawn" challenge the motive 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.699
 Immediately writing over for the deed should be all about predictions 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.160
 the forecasts of the last round they have their economic forecasts it does 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.809
 The hunts should come in the spring of 2000 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:14.979
 and the autumnal timers 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.580
 yes it was yes 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.930
 For 40 years, 80 samples from the 40 years but not all true 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.990
 prognosis 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.870
 gives 80 try no hit 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.870
 Phrases like that would lead to that 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.409
 at some point the correct number but have to Prof 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.409
 It's late in the year in which Schalke become champions 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.619
 the successor of the resigned and Benjamin as well as the pension gap the 

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:51.099
 Pension gap or wonder how people are getting fatter 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.219
 if they do because people from morning to evening narrators for 30 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:55.439
 Years no turnaround 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.249
 the brother of himself against players as always 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.249
 an upholstery for which one was later during the last few weeks 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.489
 the next forecast is 80 years old when 80 years old 

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:10.879
 Percent of the German citizens voted the hardest hurdle the designers at the fabric 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:11.860
 over the world 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.210
 for those who go with the way 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.750
 heal way Specki months as all way the Germans anyway who 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.020
 Sarrazin at &amp; s 100 years the Kirner Moslems but also read or 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:26.259
 yes in a hundred years because the Germans are dying out - because they were gone the way 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.749
 multiply like 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:31.129
 like the Muslims has 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.819
 in a hundred years at the Masters she worries that 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:35.860
 I relax the food 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.669
 since then I know it at the Department of the Environment may be 12 so 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.669
 reached 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.659
 there is the underdog made from the find 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.930
 Tonight and they are passing through Wacker Neuson and they are high tide 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.259
 if other experts say yes, if we do not radically change our way of life 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.560
 With his huge energy consumed, he will finally change 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.820
 then the sea level deal rising will also give forecast one hundred 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.360
 Years ago, both parts of Warsaw are under water 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.089
 and now that the forecast head over heels 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:19.629
 like the German Genbank year out mosques everywhere 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:20.940
 and they are under water 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.389
 just 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:24.680
 closely followed 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.680
 the leftover Germany provided fat floats up 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:43.329
 and most victories may then come pondering if it might 

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:46.349
 but either the daughters had to unsubscribe from five lessons
