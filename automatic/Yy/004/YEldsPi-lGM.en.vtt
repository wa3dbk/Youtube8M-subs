00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the oil injector so he took it off and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.680 
the oil injector so he took it off and
put<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.519> screw<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> line<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.480> then<00:02:34.569> he

put it screw in the line and then he

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.120 
put it screw in the line and then he
just<00:02:34.840> mixes<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> gas<00:02:35.350> it's<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> little<00:02:36.040> bit

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
just mixes the gas it's a little bit

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.759 
just mixes the gas it's a little bit
easier<00:02:36.459> well<00:02:37.209> it's<00:02:37.720> harder<00:02:38.080> but<00:02:38.290> it's

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
easier well it's harder but it's

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.380 
easier well it's harder but it's
probably<00:02:39.040> better<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.580> he<00:02:39.670> had<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.819> at<00:02:40.000> pump<00:02:40.180> dr.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
probably better so he had to at pump dr.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.130 
probably better so he had to at pump dr.
