00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
command and voice command can be a

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.480 
command and voice command can be a
little<00:05:37.900> tricky<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.289> use<00:05:38.410> at<00:05:38.889> first<00:05:39.099> until<00:05:39.400> you

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
little tricky to use at first until you

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.520 
little tricky to use at first until you
actually<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.880> swing<00:05:40.180> around<00:05:40.330> of<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:40.720> so<00:05:41.380> let's

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
actually the swing around of it so let's

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:50.580 
actually the swing around of it so let's
try<00:05:41.680> something<00:05:41.949> here<00:05:44.580> contact<00:05:45.580> russell<00:05:49.590> that

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
try something here contact russell that

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.020 
try something here contact russell that
gives<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:50.889> a<00:05:50.919> general<00:05:51.159> idea<00:05:51.340> of<00:05:51.639> how<00:05:51.699> this

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
gives you a general idea of how this
