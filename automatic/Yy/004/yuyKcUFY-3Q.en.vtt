all<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> benchmarks<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> results

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
all the benchmarks to get to the results

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.810 
all the benchmarks to get to the results
quickly<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:19.619> scores<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.100> no<00:01:20.250> data<00:01:20.400> let's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
quickly the scores have no data let's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.950 
quickly the scores have no data let's
have<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> look<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> score<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> 8<00:01:24.479> 9<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
have a look so we got a score of 8 9 to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
have a look so we got a score of 8 9 to
3<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.680> bit<00:01:25.950> less<00:01:26.159> definitely<00:01:26.790> when

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
3 which is a bit less definitely when

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.999 
3 which is a bit less definitely when
compared<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> carbonate<00:01:28.290> 12<00:01:28.560> plus<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
compared to the carbonate 12 plus and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.910 
compared to the carbonate 12 plus and
this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.549> over<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> 500<00:01:30.270> L<00:01:30.479> both<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.409> its<00:01:31.590> code

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
this is over a 500 L both of its code

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.390 
this is over a 500 L both of its code
above<00:01:32.430> 10,000<00:01:33.409> now<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> run<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
above 10,000 now we are going to run the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.850 
above 10,000 now we are going to run the
quadrant<00:01:35.850> benchmark<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.590> being

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
quadrant benchmark this is also being

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.280 
quadrant benchmark this is also being
fast<00:01:41.130> forwarded<00:01:41.610> let's<00:01:42.509> submit<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.899> code<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
fast forwarded let's submit this code to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830 
fast forwarded let's submit this code to
get<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> comparison<00:01:43.799> chart<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.689> got

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
get a comparison chart going so you got

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
get a comparison chart going so you got
a<00:01:45.869> score<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.460> 2880

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
a score of 2880

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.700 
a score of 2880
which<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.360> again<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.930> bit<00:01:49.110> less<00:01:49.290> than<00:01:49.530> we

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
which is again a bit less than we

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.490 
which is again a bit less than we
expected<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.540> then<00:01:51.540> again<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
expected but then again this is the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.109 
expected but then again this is the
cheapest<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.189> bunch<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> still<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
cheapest of the bunch and still it

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.179 
cheapest of the bunch and still it
performs<00:01:54.540> quite<00:01:54.689> well<00:01:54.920> now<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.100> are

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
performs quite well now if we are

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.910 
performs quite well now if we are
running<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> Nina<00:01:56.700> math<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.119> benchmark<00:01:57.920> it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
running the Nina math to benchmark it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
running the Nina math to benchmark it
will<00:01:59.189> test<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.880> graphics<00:02:00.299> prowess<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> he
