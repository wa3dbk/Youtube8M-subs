through the hole and make sure that the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.040 
through the hole and make sure that the
rope<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.440> lined<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:08.479> respectively<00:02:09.479> we're

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
rope is lined up respectively we're

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.600 
rope is lined up respectively we're
going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> pull<00:02:10.560> our<00:02:10.770> rope<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.490> way

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
going to pull our rope all the way

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.670 
going to pull our rope all the way
through<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:13.020> give<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.350> better<00:02:13.590> idea

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
through just to give you a better idea

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:32.460 
through just to give you a better idea
of<00:02:14.100> how<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.030> rope<00:02:15.390> threading<00:02:15.840> will<00:02:15.990> look

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.500 

next<00:02:32.950> we're<00:02:33.160> going<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.340> take<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:34.120> end<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
next we're going to take the end of the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.150 
next we're going to take the end of the
rope<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.900> thread<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.410> back<00:02:35.440> through<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
rope and thread it back through the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.520 
rope and thread it back through the
locking<00:02:36.880> mechanism<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.630> case<00:02:40.930> first

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
locking mechanism in this case first

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:54.380 
locking mechanism in this case first
we'll<00:02:41.830> go<00:02:42.010> through<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:43.060> other<00:02:43.270> hole<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:44.050> used

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.150 

back<00:02:55.390> underneath<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.110> locking<00:02:56.560> mechanism

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
back underneath the locking mechanism

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.010 
back underneath the locking mechanism
and<00:02:57.250> at<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.790> point<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.330> might<00:02:58.570> be<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> good

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
and at this point it might be a good

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.560 
and at this point it might be a good
idea<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.590> pull<00:02:59.800> some<00:03:00.010> extra<00:03:00.340> rope<00:03:00.520> through

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.940 

then<00:03:04.570> we're<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.110> run<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.560> end<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
then we're going to run the end of the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.880 
then we're going to run the end of the
rope<00:03:06.160> over<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.940> other<00:03:07.120> pulley<00:03:07.450> now<00:03:08.410> let's<00:03:08.710> go

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
rope over the other pulley now let's go

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.500 
rope over the other pulley now let's go
to<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.100> close-up<00:03:09.460> view<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.360> step<00:03:15.510> again

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
to a close-up view of this step again

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.000 
to a close-up view of this step again
we're<00:03:16.930> going<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.140> take<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.470> end<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.800> rope

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
we're going to take the end of the rope

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.530 
we're going to take the end of the rope
run<00:03:18.520> it<00:03:18.640> through<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.270> other<00:03:19.510> hole<00:03:21.540> underneath

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
run it through the other hole underneath

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:34.800 
run it through the other hole underneath
the<00:03:23.260> locking<00:03:23.680> mechanism<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:33.330> over<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.780> other

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the locking mechanism and over the other

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:48.360 
the locking mechanism and over the other
pulley<00:03:35.410> wheel

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.589 

finally<00:03:49.370> we're<00:03:49.849> going<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.060> take<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.360> end<00:03:50.510> of

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
finally we're going to take the end of

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.869 
finally we're going to take the end of
the<00:03:50.720> rope<00:03:50.930> run<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:51.980> through<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.400> pulley<00:03:52.580> wheel

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
the rope run it through the pulley wheel

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.300 
the rope run it through the pulley wheel
on<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.239> other<00:03:53.269> set<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:54.080> hoist<00:03:54.349> arms<00:03:54.799> through

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
on the other set of hoist arms through

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.550 
on the other set of hoist arms through
the<00:03:55.340> hole<00:03:55.700> on<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.060> mounting<00:03:56.690> bracket<00:03:57.200> with

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
the hole on the mounting bracket with

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.309 
the hole on the mounting bracket with
the<00:03:57.590> locking<00:03:58.190> mechanism<00:03:58.760> on<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.319> we're

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
the locking mechanism on it and we're

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:16.480 
the locking mechanism on it and we're
going<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.500> form<00:04:00.799> another<00:04:01.220> double<00:04:01.940> knot

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:16.490 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.060 

again<00:04:17.490> make<00:04:18.330> sure<00:04:18.360> to<00:04:18.990> form<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.380> large<00:04:19.620> double

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
again make sure to form a large double

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.770 
again make sure to form a large double
knot<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.670> that<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.940> rope<00:04:21.150> cannot<00:04:21.570> pull

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
knot so that the rope cannot pull

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.640 
knot so that the rope cannot pull
through<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:22.170> hole<00:04:22.730> at<00:04:23.780> this<00:04:24.780> point<00:04:25.080> you're

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
through the hole at this point you're

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.200 
through the hole at this point you're
threading<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.220> complete<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.820> you're<00:04:27.030> ready

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
threading is complete and you're ready

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.540 
threading is complete and you're ready
to<00:04:27.300> mount<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.690> hoist<00:04:30.860> we<00:04:31.860> do<00:04:32.040> want<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.340> point

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
to mount the hoist we do want to point

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.240 
to mount the hoist we do want to point
out<00:04:32.790> that<00:04:33.360> with<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.900> threading<00:04:34.710> you'll

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
out that with this threading you'll

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.950 
out that with this threading you'll
notice<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.000> end<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.510> rope<00:04:36.720> is

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
notice that the end of the rope is

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.770 
notice that the end of the rope is
actually<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:38.040> loop<00:04:38.730> there<00:04:39.420> will<00:04:39.570> not<00:04:39.750> be

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
actually just a loop there will not be

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.290 
actually just a loop there will not be
two<00:04:40.170> pieces<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.650> rope<00:04:40.950> it's<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.550> one<00:04:41.820> piece

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
two pieces of rope it's just one piece

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.200 
two pieces of rope it's just one piece
the<00:04:43.200> threading<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.740> complete<00:04:44.160> now<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:44.880> can

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the threading is complete now you can

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.700 
the threading is complete now you can
mount<00:04:45.360> your<00:04:45.450> hoist<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.080> enjoy<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.680> thank<00:04:47.610> you
