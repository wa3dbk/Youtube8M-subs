place on both records you'll notice that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.769 
place on both records you'll notice that
I<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:25.140> two<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> same<00:00:25.769> records<00:00:26.130> here

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
I have two of the same records here

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
I have two of the same records here
Snoop<00:00:27.779> Dogg<00:00:28.050> from<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.529> church<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.310> palace

Snoop Dogg from the church to the palace
so<00:00:30.510> what<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.199> want<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
so what we want to do is you want to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
so what we want to do is you want to
basically<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.290> easiest<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> mark

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
basically the easiest thing is to mark

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.389 
basically the easiest thing is to mark
the<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.399> first<00:00:35.640> beat<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.829> find<00:00:37.829> out<00:00:37.980> where

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the very first beat so find out where

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
the very first beat so find out where
that<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.870> you'll<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.590> on

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
that is and you'll see that right on

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.830 
that is and you'll see that right on
that<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.219> where<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:47.910> beat<00:00:48.210> starts<00:00:48.629> is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that right where that beat starts is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
that right where that beat starts is
right<00:00:49.410> where<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:50.039> markers<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> do

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
right where my little markers so I do

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
right where my little markers so I do
that<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.629> both<00:00:51.780> records<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.920> both<00:00:53.100> records

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that on both records so on both records

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
that on both records so on both records
exactly<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.239> where<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.420> first<00:00:54.660> beat<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
exactly right where that first beat is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.299 
exactly right where that first beat is
is<00:00:56.809> right<00:00:57.809> where<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.079> little<00:00:58.350> markers<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.800> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is right where my little markers is so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.389 
is right where my little markers is so
we<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.559> we<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.739> note<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
we know that we can note we have a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.850 
we know that we can note we have a
visual<00:01:02.789> cue<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.359> where<00:01:03.750> our<00:01:03.989> beats<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
visual cue of where our beats are on the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.530 
visual cue of where our beats are on the
record

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
record

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.140 
record
essentially<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.750> juggling<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:08.150> you're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
essentially what juggling is is you're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.080 
essentially what juggling is is you're
just<00:01:09.240> looping<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> music<00:01:10.200> back<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> forth

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
just looping the music back and forth

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.670 
just looping the music back and forth
using<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.479> two<00:01:12.659> records<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.110> manipulate<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
using the two records to manipulate it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.399 
using the two records to manipulate it
the<00:01:14.070> easiest<00:01:14.610> form<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> basic<00:01:15.780> loop<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the easiest form is just a basic loop so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.499 
the easiest form is just a basic loop so
you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.460> either<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.970> count<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> four

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
you can do it in either a count of four

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
you can do it in either a count of four
beats<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.930> eight<00:01:19.110> beats<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.890> whatever<00:01:20.130> but

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
beats or eight beats or whatever but

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100 
beats or eight beats or whatever but
you're<00:01:20.549> basically<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> play<00:01:21.330> say<00:01:21.900> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you're basically going to play say this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.760 
you're basically going to play say this
record<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:23.210> four<00:01:24.210> beats<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.229> three<00:01:25.530> four

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
record for four beats one two three four

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.859 
record for four beats one two three four
you're<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.430> cut<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.909> side<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.840> can

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you're going to cut to this side you can

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.749 
you're going to cut to this side you can
play<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.290> two<00:01:28.530> three<00:01:28.799> four<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
play one two three four you're going to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.910 
play one two three four you're going to
rewind<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.600> side<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.290> size<00:01:31.439> plan<00:01:31.710> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
rewind this side has this size plan so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
rewind this side has this size plan so
you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> cue<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.579> right<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> 1<00:01:33.150> then

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you can cue it up right on the 1 then

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.100 
you can cue it up right on the 1 then
play<00:01:33.810> 1<00:01:34.020> 2<00:01:34.200> 3<00:01:34.380> 4<00:01:34.680> 1<00:01:34.890> 2<00:01:34.920> 3<00:01:35.220> 4<00:01:35.460> 1<00:01:35.610> 2<00:01:35.820> 3<00:01:35.850> 4<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.420> you'll

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
play 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and you'll

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.219 
play 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and you'll
get<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.380> endless<00:01:37.710> loop<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:39.060> music<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
get an endless loop of your music that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.999 
get an endless loop of your music that
is<00:01:40.439> juggling<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.610> simplest<00:01:42.420> form<00:01:42.509> so

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
is juggling in the simplest form so

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
is juggling in the simplest form so
let's<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.189> sample<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.930> our

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
let's get a sample there so we have our

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
let's get a sample there so we have our
one<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.310> our<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.700> we're

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
one there our one there and what we're

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.800 
one there our one there and what we're
gonna<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:52.649> play<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.640> four<00:01:54.420> beats<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
gonna do is play this for four beats so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.260 
gonna do is play this for four beats so
we're<00:01:54.930> gonna<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.229> one

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
we're gonna go one

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.569 
we're gonna go one
three<00:01:56.960> four<00:01:58.000> or<00:01:59.000> one<00:01:59.179> in<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.359> one<00:02:00.399> row<00:02:01.399> line

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
three four or one in this one row line

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:09.550 
three four or one in this one row line
this<00:02:01.759> one<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.829> you<00:02:06.920> basically<00:02:08.379> loop<00:02:09.379> it<00:02:09.530> back

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
this one and you basically loop it back

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.860 
this one and you basically loop it back
and<00:02:09.920> forth<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.819> could<00:02:16.970> go<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.209> forever<00:02:17.360> but

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and forth that could go on forever but

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.809 
and forth that could go on forever but
essentially<00:02:18.530> that's<00:02:19.220> all<00:02:19.370> you're<00:02:19.519> doing<00:02:19.549> is

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
essentially that's all you're doing is

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.009 
essentially that's all you're doing is
you're<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:19.970> gonna<00:02:20.180> take<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.510> little<00:02:20.780> section

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
you're just gonna take a little section

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.660 
you're just gonna take a little section
of<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:21.410> song<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.920> you're<00:02:22.220> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.370> loop<00:02:22.580> it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
of one song and you're going to loop it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.699 
of one song and you're going to loop it
over<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.060> over<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.239> create<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.660> new<00:02:23.810> beat<00:02:24.019> that

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
over and over to create a new beat that

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.210 
over and over to create a new beat that
is<00:02:24.920> basically<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.989> premise<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.620> juggling<00:02:28.069> and

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
is basically the premise of juggling and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.309 
is basically the premise of juggling and
then<00:02:28.459> from<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.630> totally<00:02:30.170> do<00:02:30.290> a

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
then from that you can totally do a

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.720 
then from that you can totally do a
hundred<00:02:30.590> different<00:02:30.769> things<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.400> do<00:02:31.579> more

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
hundred different things you can do more

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.509 
hundred different things you can do more
complex<00:02:32.319> juggles<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.560> pitch<00:02:33.860> changes<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
complex juggles and pitch changes and

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.069 
complex juggles and pitch changes and
whatnot<00:02:34.849> which<00:02:35.329> we'll<00:02:35.480> be<00:02:35.569> looking<00:02:35.690> at<00:02:35.930> in

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
whatnot which we'll be looking at in

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:45.420 
whatnot which we'll be looking at in
another<00:02:36.170> clip

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.489
