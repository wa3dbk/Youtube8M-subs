damage<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.700> guess<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.510> use<00:02:45.660> swords<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.080> lot

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
damage I guess if you use swords a lot

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.380 
damage I guess if you use swords a lot
the<00:02:46.320> time<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.620> get<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:47.010> damage<00:02:47.550> boost<00:02:47.790> or<00:02:48.150> like

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the time you get a damage boost or like

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.170 
the time you get a damage boost or like
your<00:02:49.350> your<00:02:49.560> skills<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.310> gone<00:02:50.580> up<00:02:50.730> by<00:02:51.000> this

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
your your skills have gone up by this

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.960 
your your skills have gone up by this
percentage<00:02:51.720> or<00:02:51.900> whatever<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.680> know

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
percentage or whatever you're you know

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.400 
percentage or whatever you're you know
but<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.120> one<00:02:54.240> quote<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.810> really<00:02:55.110> do

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
but there's one quote that I really do

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.770 
but there's one quote that I really do
like<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.920> says<00:02:56.220> use<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> silver<00:02:57.090> sword<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
like it says use a silver sword all the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.680 
like it says use a silver sword all the
time<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.380> skill<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:59.070> swords<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.120> that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
time and your skill with swords and that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.280 
time and your skill with swords and that
particular<00:03:01.280> sword<00:03:02.280> will<00:03:02.640> improve<00:03:03.090> improve<00:03:03.780> so

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
particular sword will improve improve so

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.290 
particular sword will improve improve so
that<00:03:04.320> means<00:03:04.650> there's<00:03:04.890> no<00:03:05.070> correct<00:03:05.970> way<00:03:06.090> to

is<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.290> strategy<00:03:52.920> elements<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:53.880> pretty

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
is the strategy elements this is pretty

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.780

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
revolves around this is the kind of

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.610 
revolves around this is the kind of
story<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:06.000> ties<00:04:06.209> into<00:04:06.570> there<00:04:07.320> are<00:04:07.500> these

even the best terraria players can't

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.140 
even the best terraria players can't
defend<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.440> whole<00:04:17.709> map<00:04:18.009> so<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:18.579> encourages

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
defend the whole map so it encourages

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.270

so you need to set up these towers in

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.700 
so you need to set up these towers in

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
order to make sure the crystal is

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.040 
order to make sure the crystal is
defended<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.550> who<00:04:34.240> knows<00:04:34.449> maybe<00:04:34.479> they'll<00:04:34.960> be

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
defended and who knows maybe they'll be

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.990 
defended and who knows maybe they'll be
like<00:04:35.199> bosses<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:36.280> all<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.610> sudden<00:04:36.880> come

we have half of the content in terraria
PC<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.490> then<00:05:33.909> in<00:05:34.120> terraria<00:05:34.449> console<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.110> have

PC and then in terraria console you have

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.409 
PC and then in terraria console you have
all<00:05:35.770> sorts<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.250> random<00:05:36.520> bosses<00:05:37.060> like<00:05:37.300> the

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
all sorts of random bosses like the

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.990 
all sorts of random bosses like the
turkey<00:05:37.870> one<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.289> some<00:05:38.770> of<00:05:38.889> the<00:05:39.039> other<00:05:39.669> things

turkey one and some of the other things

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.490 
turkey one and some of the other things
that<00:05:40.180> just<00:05:40.300> don't<00:05:40.419> fit<00:05:40.750> in<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.960> game<00:05:41.139> in<00:05:41.349> my

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
that just don't fit in the game in my

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.100 
that just don't fit in the game in my
opinion<00:05:41.530> and<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:42.490> even<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:43.000> art<00:05:43.150> style<00:05:43.449> seems

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
opinion and and even the art style seems

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.839 
opinion and and even the art style seems
a<00:05:44.229> bit<00:05:44.349> off<00:05:44.500> like<00:05:44.949> the<00:05:45.070> Thanksgiving<00:05:45.669> turkey

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
a bit off like the Thanksgiving turkey

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.939 
a bit off like the Thanksgiving turkey
looks<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.389> bit<00:05:46.419> like<00:05:47.020> it<00:05:47.139> was<00:05:47.259> done<00:05:47.349> in<00:05:47.409> paint<00:05:47.770> in

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
looks a bit like it was done in paint in

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.270 
looks a bit like it was done in paint in
my<00:05:48.009> opinion<00:05:48.520> so<00:05:49.509> yeah<00:05:49.840> that's<00:05:50.229> that<00:05:50.409> and<00:05:50.740> also

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
my opinion so yeah that's that and also

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.029 
my opinion so yeah that's that and also
there's<00:05:51.940> no<00:05:52.210> early<00:05:52.690> access<00:05:53.320> mainly<00:05:53.740> because

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
there's no early access mainly because

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.219 
there's no early access mainly because
the<00:05:54.460> original<00:05:55.030> terraria<00:05:55.539> had<00:05:55.659> some<00:05:55.840> issues

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
the original terraria had some issues

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.810 
the original terraria had some issues
with<00:05:56.380> that<00:05:56.409> back<00:05:56.860> in<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.220> day<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.699> they

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
with that back in the day and they

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.060 
with that back in the day and they
probably<00:05:58.150> don't<00:05:58.300> want<00:05:58.570> to<00:05:58.630> repeat<00:05:59.070> alrighty

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
probably don't want to repeat alrighty
