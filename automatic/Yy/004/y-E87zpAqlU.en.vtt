be<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> 20s<00:00:47.660> but<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.200> happy<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
be in the 20s but I was happy in the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.850 
penny get scared there was no game plan
I<00:01:02.579> mean<00:01:03.019> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.500> wanted<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> put

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I mean you know we just wanted to put

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.880 
I mean you know we just wanted to put
pressure<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:07.200> them<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.560> his<00:01:07.740> right

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.000 
pressure on we take them off his right
hand<00:01:08.479> which<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.780> thought<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.170> allowed<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
hand which I thought we allowed them to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
hand which I thought we allowed them to
get<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> his<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.610> late<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> game<00:01:12.240> that's

minutes as usual but I thought the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.790 
minutes as usual but I thought the
defensive<00:01:46.869> pressure<00:01:46.930> was<00:01:47.229> good<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.590> mean

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
defensive pressure was good I mean
