00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
so I had to bump up the shutter speed

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.490 
so I had to bump up the shutter speed

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
okay so you know all you the ISO can we

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.580 
okay so you know all you the ISO can we
also<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.830> customized<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.880> wish<00:01:12.590> the
