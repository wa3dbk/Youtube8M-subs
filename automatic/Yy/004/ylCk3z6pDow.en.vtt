00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
majority of the voice acting is really

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800 
majority of the voice acting is really
well<00:01:43.829> done<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.820> will<00:01:45.060> say<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> pacing<00:01:45.720> was

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

itself<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> didn't<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.360> anything

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
situations and never really gets born so

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.190 
situations and never really gets born so
these<00:04:39.010> two<00:04:39.310> main<00:04:39.580> gameplay<00:04:40.020> elements<00:04:41.020> just

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
these two main gameplay elements just

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.350

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
work really well together and the game

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.850 
work really well together and the game
didn't<00:04:43.630> want<00:04:43.810> just<00:04:44.020> focus<00:04:44.320> on<00:04:44.440> one<00:04:44.650> because

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
didn't want just focus on one because

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.350 
didn't want just focus on one because
the<00:04:44.950> game<00:04:45.130> would<00:04:45.250> have<00:04:45.400> been<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.550> bore<00:04:45.850> but<00:04:45.880> with

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
the game would have been a bore but with

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.450 
the game would have been a bore but with
these<00:04:46.510> two<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:47.200> really<00:04:47.620> works<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.160> makes<00:04:48.340> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
these two it really works that makes the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.220
