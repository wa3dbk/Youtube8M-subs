00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
my preference and I think that's about

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.990 
my preference and I think that's about
it<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.520> black<00:01:53.090> these<00:01:54.649> I<00:01:55.649> don't<00:01:56.460> recall

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it it's black these I don't recall

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.899 
it it's black these I don't recall
exactly<00:01:57.149> what<00:01:58.430> Kershaw<00:02:01.250> calls<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
exactly what Kershaw calls this but it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.429 
exactly what Kershaw calls this but it
has<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:04.640> spring<00:02:05.640> assisted<00:02:06.149> blade<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.140> know

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
has a spring assisted blade so you know

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.040 
has a spring assisted blade so you know
so<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.979> thumb<00:02:08.759> catch<00:02:09.000> right<00:02:09.360> here<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so we have a thumb catch right here and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.619 
so we have a thumb catch right here and
of<00:02:10.979> course<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.580> be<00:02:11.670> switched<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.300> either

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
of course that can be switched to either

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.890 
of course that can be switched to either
side

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
side

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.309 
side
and<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.739> this<00:02:14.950> along<00:02:15.250> because<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.870> opens

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
and I like this along because it opens

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.820 
and I like this along because it opens
real<00:02:17.650> easy<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.430> spring<00:02:18.730> assisted<00:02:19.180> blade

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
real easy it's a spring assisted blade

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.449 
real easy it's a spring assisted blade
and<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:21.190> course<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.580> has<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.940> liner<00:02:22.180> lock

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
and of course it has the liner lock

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.280 
and of course it has the liner lock
which<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.940> move<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.629> close<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
which you have to move to close the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.610 
which you have to move to close the
plate<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.129> this<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.459> real<00:02:27.670> easy<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.629> open<00:02:28.900> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
plate so this is real easy to open and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.809 
plate so this is real easy to open and
unlike<00:02:30.489> some<00:02:30.879> knives<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.390> I've<00:02:31.569> seen

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
unlike some knives that I've seen

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.100 
unlike some knives that I've seen
they're<00:02:33.819> just<00:02:34.030> too<00:02:34.150> difficult<00:02:34.629> to<00:02:34.720> open<00:02:35.049> I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
they're just too difficult to open I

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.500 
they're just too difficult to open I
like<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:35.739> things<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.129> open<00:02:36.579> real<00:02:37.269> easy

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
like I like things that open real easy

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.130 
like I like things that open real easy
like<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:43.030> isn't<00:02:43.450> everyday<00:02:43.690> carry

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
like this and this isn't everyday carry

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.520 
like this and this isn't everyday carry
you<00:02:45.040> can<00:02:45.190> see<00:02:45.340> I've<00:02:45.459> got<00:02:45.610> somewhere<00:02:46.349> where<00:02:47.349> on

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you can see I've got somewhere where on

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.509 
you can see I've got somewhere where on
the<00:02:47.680> clip<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.840> haven't<00:02:49.840> had<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.500> do<00:02:50.890> anything<00:02:51.250> to

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
the clip I haven't had to do anything to

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.319 
the clip I haven't had to do anything to
this<00:02:51.700> aside<00:02:52.239> from<00:02:52.569> sharpen<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.379> blade<00:02:53.620> and

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
this aside from sharpen the blade and

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.569 
this aside from sharpen the blade and
you<00:02:55.329> know<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.079> little<00:02:56.680> drop<00:02:56.859> of<00:02:57.010> oil<00:02:57.099> here<00:02:57.459> and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
you know a little drop of oil here and

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.210 
you know a little drop of oil here and
there<00:02:57.700> nothing<00:02:57.879> too<00:02:58.239> major<00:02:58.799> it's<00:02:59.799> held<00:03:00.099> up

you<00:04:08.049> know<00:04:08.169> I<00:04:08.199> bought<00:04:08.440> this<00:04:08.709> thinking<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.160> it

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
you know I bought this thinking that it

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.909 
you know I bought this thinking that it
would<00:04:09.549> last<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:10.000> few<00:04:10.209> years<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.780> it's<00:04:10.930> probably

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
would last a few years and it's probably

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.550 
would last a few years and it's probably
lasted<00:04:12.340> ten<00:04:12.579> years<00:04:12.849> at<00:04:13.060> least<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.840> it's<00:04:14.349> still

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
lasted ten years at least and it's still

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.129 
lasted ten years at least and it's still
going<00:04:14.829> strong<00:04:14.859> so<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.760> really<00:04:16.570> haven't<00:04:16.870> had<00:04:17.109> a

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
going strong so I really haven't had a

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:24.680 
going strong so I really haven't had a
need<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.560> buy<00:04:17.709> any<00:04:18.039> other<00:04:18.070> knives

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.529 

trying<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.780> think<00:04:25.930> if<00:04:26.169> there's<00:04:26.199> anything<00:04:26.800> else

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.850 
think I covered all the talking points
and<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.449> had<00:04:34.630> written<00:04:34.810> down<00:04:34.960> about<00:04:35.259> this
