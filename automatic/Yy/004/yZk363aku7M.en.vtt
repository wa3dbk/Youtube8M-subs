00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.440 
can you can see me pulling off some
quick<00:01:38.549> shots<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.060> long<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.240> you're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
quick shots and as long as you're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
quick shots and as long as you're
accurate<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.470> definitely<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:41.040> some

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
accurate you can definitely get some

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
accurate you can definitely get some
quick<00:01:41.400> scopes<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.180> maybe<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> like

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
quick scopes in there maybe you like

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
quick scopes in there maybe you like
that<00:01:43.200> maybe<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.460> definitely

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that maybe you don't but it's definitely

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.850 
that maybe you don't but it's definitely
in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> game<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.110> viable<00:01:46.500> option

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
in the game and it is a viable option

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
in the game and it is a viable option
especially<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.850> weapon<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.119> where<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
especially if a weapon is where you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999 
especially if a weapon is where you
can't<00:01:48.630> even<00:01:48.810> noscope<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> be

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
can't even noscope you want to be

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.679 
can't even noscope you want to be
getting<00:01:50.130> those<00:01:50.310> quick<00:01:50.579> shots<00:01:50.850> off<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> quick

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
getting those quick shots off and quick

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
getting those quick shots off and quick
scoping<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> definitely<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> game<00:01:53.009> but

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
scoping is definitely in the game but

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.580 
scoping is definitely in the game but
sniping<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.479> definitely<00:01:55.049> harder<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.470> think

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
sniping is definitely harder I think

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.289 
sniping is definitely harder I think
it's<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.979> load<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.310> fun<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.909> really

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it's a load of fun and really

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.760 
it's a load of fun and really
challenging<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.869> advanced<00:01:58.200> warfare<00:01:58.439> but

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
challenging in advanced warfare but

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
challenging in advanced warfare but
rewarding<00:01:58.950> because<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.880> Call<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> Duty's
