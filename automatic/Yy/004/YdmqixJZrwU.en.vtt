before you get into it so this is a more
natural<00:00:40.469> gameplay<00:00:40.800> something<00:00:41.190> that's<00:00:41.340> going

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
natural gameplay something that's going

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
natural gameplay something that's going
to<00:00:41.550> happen<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> consistent<00:00:42.329> basis<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.200> not

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to happen on a consistent basis it's not

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.639 
to happen on a consistent basis it's not
something<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.300> kind<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> i've<00:00:45.840> played<00:00:46.260> 50

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
something that's kind of i've played 50

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
something that's kind of i've played 50
games<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.129> i<00:00:47.370> finally<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.120> gameplay

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
games and i finally got a good gameplay

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.729 
games and i finally got a good gameplay
and<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.870> nothing<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.410> i<00:00:49.469> played

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and that was nothing like that i played

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.229 
and that was nothing like that i played
a<00:00:49.770> couple<00:00:49.980> games<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> class<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.000> i<00:00:51.059> put

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
a couple games with the class and i put

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.330 
a couple games with the class and i put
up<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> best<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.840> those<00:00:52.050> couple<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
up the best of those couple you know of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
up the best of those couple you know of
gameplay<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> best<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
gameplay so this is the best of that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
gameplay so this is the best of that
this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.770> expect<00:00:55.829> using<00:00:56.730> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
this is what you can expect using this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
this is what you can expect using this
class<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:58.020> class<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.559> actually

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
class and this class was actually

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.819 
class and this class was actually
submitted<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> us<00:00:59.699> by<00:00:59.730> black<00:01:00.270> ice<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.840> kind

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
submitted to us by black ice and I kind

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.290 
submitted to us by black ice and I kind
of<00:01:01.890> tweaked<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> around<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.149> guys

of tweaked it around a bit so you guys
can<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.780> his<00:01:03.899> setup<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.409> versus<00:01:04.860> what

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
can see what his setup was versus what

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
can see what his setup was versus what
my<00:01:05.159> setup<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> you'll<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.570> his<00:01:06.689> set<00:01:06.869> up

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
my setup was and you'll see his set up

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
my setup was and you'll see his set up
on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> screen<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.580> left

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
on the screen right now he you know left

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.250 
on the screen right now he you know left
a<00:01:08.909> comment<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.299> i<00:01:09.420> took<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.630> comment<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
a comment and i took that comment and I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
a comment and i took that comment and I
thought<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.799> can't<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> this

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
thought I can't really do some of this

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.910 
thought I can't really do some of this
because<00:01:12.510> i'm<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.170> high<00:01:13.680> enough

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
because i'm not actually high enough

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
because i'm not actually high enough
level<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.369> i<00:01:14.460> mainly<00:01:14.700> play<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.240> ps3<00:01:15.479> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
level because i mainly play on ps3 but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
level because i mainly play on ps3 but
i'm<00:01:16.350> slowly<00:01:16.619> working<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.100> leveling<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.670> pc

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
i'm slowly working on leveling up on pc

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.370 
i'm slowly working on leveling up on pc
as<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.390> i'm<00:01:18.509> taking<00:01:18.810> classes<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.320> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
as well but i'm taking classes that I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.080 
as well but i'm taking classes that I
can<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.009> mix-and-match<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:20.939> him

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
can do or mix-and-match to make him

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.300 
can do or mix-and-match to make him
similar<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.590> break<00:01:22.830> what<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.250> were

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
similar and not break what they were

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.890 
similar and not break what they were
going<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> went<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.659> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
going for so what I went with was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
going for so what I went with was
lightweight<00:01:25.259> toughness<00:01:26.159> extreme

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
lightweight toughness extreme

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
lightweight toughness extreme
conditioning<00:01:27.479> two<00:01:27.689> tomahawks<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.920> tac-45

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
conditioning two tomahawks the tac-45

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.030 
conditioning two tomahawks the tac-45
obviously<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> he<00:01:30.720> said<00:01:31.079> only<00:01:31.439> extended<00:01:31.890> mags

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
obviously and he said only extended mags

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
obviously and he said only extended mags
but<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> decided<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.670> put<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> long<00:01:33.030> barrel<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.479> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
but I decided to put a long barrel on it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.910 
but I decided to put a long barrel on it
to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.869> more<00:01:33.990> feasible<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to make it more feasible because the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.789 
to make it more feasible because the
tac-45<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.630> sucks<00:01:37.110> at

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
tac-45 really really really sucks at

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
tac-45 really really really sucks at
long<00:01:38.070> range<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.610> couldn't<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.000> any<00:01:39.180> kills

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
long range like I couldn't get any kills

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
long range like I couldn't get any kills
with<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.930> mean<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.220> just

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
with it I mean I could but it was just

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.120 
with it I mean I could but it was just
good<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.600> yeah<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.649> all<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.950> say<00:01:44.100> about

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
good just yeah it's all I can say about

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.679 
good just yeah it's all I can say about
it<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> put<00:01:44.880> danger<00:01:45.180> close<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it and then I put danger close and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
it and then I put danger close and
secondary<00:01:46.229> fighter<00:01:46.500> obviously<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.670> i

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
secondary fighter obviously because i

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
secondary fighter obviously because i
need<00:01:48.420> those<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:48.780> attachments<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> i<00:01:49.649> needed

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
need those two attachments and i needed

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.190 
need those two attachments and i needed
two<00:01:50.220> tomahawks<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.450> main<00:01:51.600> reason<00:01:51.930> i<00:01:51.990> did

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
two tomahawks and the main reason i did

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.660 
two tomahawks and the main reason i did
go<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.560> double<00:01:52.799> attachments<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.640> i

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
go with double attachments is because i

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.160 
go with double attachments is because i
didn't<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.090> ghost<00:01:54.329> unlocked<00:01:54.720> yet<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.110> i

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
didn't have ghost unlocked yet so i

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
didn't have ghost unlocked yet so i
figured<00:01:55.530> throw<00:01:55.860> secondary<00:01:56.340> gunfighter<00:01:56.729> on

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
figured throw secondary gunfighter on

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.990 
figured throw secondary gunfighter on
you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.210> fill<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> full<00:01:57.869> ten<00:01:58.049> slots<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
you know fill up the full ten slots and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
you know fill up the full ten slots and
black<00:02:00.000> guys<00:02:00.210> called<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.020> Deadpool

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
black guys called this the Deadpool

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.139 
black guys called this the Deadpool
class<00:02:02.280> which<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.610> understand<00:02:03.030> because

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
class which I understand because

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.810 
class which I understand because
Deadpool<00:02:03.659> uses<00:02:03.930> pistols<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:05.460> thinking<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Deadpool uses pistols I was thinking to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.490 
Deadpool uses pistols I was thinking to
myself<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.210> wish<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.540> had<00:02:06.659> dual<00:02:06.899> pistols<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
myself I wish I had dual pistols at the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619 
myself I wish I had dual pistols at the
time<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.970> Deadpool

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
time because that's really what Deadpool

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.340 
time because that's really what Deadpool
Deadpool<00:02:10.259> uses<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
Deadpool uses is you

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.830 
Deadpool uses is you
is<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.650> two<00:02:12.040> pistols<00:02:12.460> it's<00:02:13.360> really<00:02:13.570> hard<00:02:13.720> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
is to two pistols it's really hard to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.680 
is to two pistols it's really hard to
say<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.230> tongue<00:02:14.830> pushed<00:02:15.100> her<00:02:15.250> anyways<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.540> is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
say a tongue pushed her anyways this is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.630 
say a tongue pushed her anyways this is
essentially<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.320> Deadpool<00:02:17.890> class<00:02:18.220> it's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
essentially the Deadpool class it's

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.570 
essentially the Deadpool class it's
using<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.150> know<00:02:19.180> attack<00:02:19.540> 45<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.380> that's<00:02:21.340> it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
using you know attack 45 and that's it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.880 
using you know attack 45 and that's it
pretty<00:02:21.820> much<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.240> some<00:02:22.420> throwing<00:02:22.720> axes<00:02:23.050> but

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
pretty much and some throwing axes but

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.830 
pretty much and some throwing axes but
what<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.220> found<00:02:24.490> difficult<00:02:24.850> about<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.600> class

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
what I found difficult about this class

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.260 
what I found difficult about this class
was<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.530> fact<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.550> didn't<00:02:27.880> have<00:02:27.940> ghosts

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
was the fact that I didn't have ghosts

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.370 
was the fact that I didn't have ghosts
which<00:02:28.480> would<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:28.720> been<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.900> really<00:02:29.140> nice

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
which would have been a really nice

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.920 
which would have been a really nice
feature<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.580> can<00:02:30.880> use<00:02:31.390> ghost<00:02:31.660> if

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
feature to it so if you can use ghost if

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.140 
feature to it so if you can use ghost if
not<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.530> guess<00:02:33.340> you're<00:02:33.520> kind<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.700> shut<00:02:33.850> up<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> lot

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
not I guess you're kind of shut up a lot

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.320 
not I guess you're kind of shut up a lot
like<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.450> was<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:36.190> works<00:02:36.400> really<00:02:36.610> well<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.300> a

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
like I was and it works really well in a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.600 
like I was and it works really well in a
free-for-all<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.620> closed<00:02:38.980> quarters<00:02:39.310> as

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
free-for-all and in closed quarters as

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.920 
free-for-all and in closed quarters as
you<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:39.880> see<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.120> most<00:02:40.240> of<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.540> gameplay<00:02:40.780> I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
you can see in most of this gameplay I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.720 
you can see in most of this gameplay I
was<00:02:41.140> trying<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.530> get<00:02:41.770> into<00:02:42.040> building<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:42.700> I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
was trying to get into building so I

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.310 
was trying to get into building so I
could<00:02:42.940> get<00:02:43.060> those<00:02:43.180> easy<00:02:43.480> three<00:02:43.810> or<00:02:43.930> four<00:02:44.080> shots

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
could get those easy three or four shots

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.260 
could get those easy three or four shots
off<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.710> actually<00:02:45.040> kill<00:02:45.250> them<00:02:45.400> quicker<00:02:46.120> than

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
off to actually kill them quicker than

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.950 
off to actually kill them quicker than
they<00:02:46.390> can<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.660> know<00:02:46.780> turn<00:02:47.050> on<00:02:47.200> me<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:49.000> kept

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
they can you know turn on me but I kept

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.510 
they can you know turn on me but I kept
finding<00:02:50.080> myself<00:02:50.320> at<00:02:50.650> long<00:02:50.830> ranges<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.400> it's

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
finding myself at long ranges and it's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.310 
finding myself at long ranges and it's
not<00:02:51.940> something<00:02:52.210> you<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:52.540> want<00:02:53.050> this

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
not something you really want this

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.960 
not something you really want this
classroom<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.280> can<00:02:54.430> pull<00:02:54.610> off<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
classroom you can pull off the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.160 
classroom you can pull off the
long-range<00:02:55.330> shots<00:02:55.570> if<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.960> long

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
long-range shots if you have a long

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.820 
long-range shots if you have a long
barrel<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:57.210> it's<00:02:58.210> not<00:02:58.360> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> happen<00:02:59.500> most

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
barrel but it's not going to happen most

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.630 
barrel but it's not going to happen most
of<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.010> time<00:03:00.160> unless<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.490> have<00:03:00.610> really

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
of the time unless you have really

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.580 
of the time unless you have really
really<00:03:01.090> really<00:03:01.390> good<00:03:01.660> accuracy<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.440> want

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
really really good accuracy so you want

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.340 
really really good accuracy so you want

firing I found myself hip firing a lot
after<00:03:39.640> my<00:03:40.030> first<00:03:40.360> game<00:03:41.080> i<00:03:41.110> started<00:03:41.620> hit<00:03:41.710> firing

after my first game i started hit firing
a<00:03:42.010> lot<00:03:42.130> because<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.460> was<00:03:42.550> more<00:03:42.700> feasible

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
a lot because it was more feasible

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.610 
a lot because it was more feasible

because i could click faster the fast
you<00:03:44.770> can<00:03:44.860> get<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.010> rounds<00:03:45.250> off<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.550> quick

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
focus on strafing rather than actually

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.640 
focus on strafing rather than actually
aiming<00:03:57.880> because<00:03:58.840> you're<00:03:59.170> going<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.320> get<00:03:59.470> more

aiming because you're going to get more
kills<00:03:59.800> that<00:04:00.010> way<00:04:00.130> because<00:04:00.310> your<00:04:00.520> heart<00:04:00.670> or

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
kills that way because your heart or

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.430 
kills that way because your heart or
target<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.150> hit<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.540> you're<00:04:02.080> pumping<00:04:02.380> those

rounds<00:04:02.740> up<00:04:02.830> pretty<00:04:03.070> quick<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:04.270> tac-45

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
rounds up pretty quick so the tac-45

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.220 
rounds up pretty quick so the tac-45
it's<00:04:06.490> an<00:04:06.730> it's<00:04:07.060> an<00:04:07.150> awesome<00:04:07.270> gun<00:04:07.600> if<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.020> use

it's an it's an awesome gun if you use

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.890 
it's an it's an awesome gun if you use
it<00:04:08.380> right<00:04:08.530> let's<00:04:08.830> just<00:04:09.040> say<00:04:09.070> that<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:09.900> was

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
it right let's just say that and I was

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.150 
it right let's just say that and I was
thinking<00:04:10.960> about<00:04:11.290> giving<00:04:11.470> these<00:04:11.880> classes<00:04:12.880> a

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
thinking about giving these classes a

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.289 
thinking about giving these classes a
difficulty<00:04:15.160> rating<00:04:15.370> on<00:04:15.700> like<00:04:15.850> how<00:04:15.970> hard<00:04:16.120> they

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
difficulty rating on like how hard they

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.820 
difficulty rating on like how hard they
are<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.450> use<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.020> i<00:04:17.080> would<00:04:17.230> i<00:04:17.350> would<00:04:17.410> rate<00:04:17.680> this

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
are to use and i would i would rate this

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.530 
are to use and i would i would rate this
one<00:04:18.040> more

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
one more

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.900 
one more
I<00:04:19.800> don't<00:04:20.800> know<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:21.010> don't<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.400> didn't<00:04:21.670> go<00:04:21.760> into

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
I don't know I don't I didn't go into

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.280 
I don't know I don't I didn't go into
this<00:04:22.060> like<00:04:22.240> thinking<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.780> was<00:04:22.900> gonna<00:04:23.020> rate

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
this like thinking that I was gonna rate

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.960 
this like thinking that I was gonna rate
this<00:04:23.440> one<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:23.860> I'm<00:04:23.980> gonna<00:04:24.070> give<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.580> scale<00:04:24.850> of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
this one so I'm gonna give it a scale of

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.580 
this one so I'm gonna give it a scale of
like<00:04:25.120> easy<00:04:25.420> to<00:04:26.280> normal<00:04:27.480> hard<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:29.170> extremely

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
like easy to normal hard to extremely

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.830 
like easy to normal hard to extremely
hard<00:04:29.890> so<00:04:30.670> this<00:04:30.820> is<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.180> would<00:04:31.540> say<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.780> is

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
hard so this is I would say this is

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.110 
hard so this is I would say this is
about<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.260> normal<00:04:32.740> too<00:04:33.010> hard<00:04:33.340> somewhere<00:04:34.030> in

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
about a normal too hard somewhere in

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.020 
about a normal too hard somewhere in
between<00:04:34.180> there<00:04:34.390> because<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:36.610> does<00:04:36.790> take<00:04:37.000> a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
between there because it does take a

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.400 
between there because it does take a
little<00:04:37.240> bit<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:37.510> skill<00:04:37.810> for<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.050> long-range

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
little bit of skill for the long-range

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.840 
little bit of skill for the long-range
shots<00:04:38.620> but<00:04:38.830> up<00:04:38.950> close<00:04:38.980> and<00:04:39.310> personal<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:39.730> can

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
shots but up close and personal you can

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.070 
shots but up close and personal you can
just<00:04:40.000> kind<00:04:40.150> of<00:04:40.210> spray<00:04:40.480> so<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.750> you're

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
just kind of spray so you you're

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.680 
just kind of spray so you you're
guaranteed<00:04:41.590> kills<00:04:41.860> with<00:04:42.010> this<00:04:42.160> gun<00:04:42.450> but<00:04:43.450> at

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
guaranteed kills with this gun but at

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.880 
guaranteed kills with this gun but at
the<00:04:43.780> same<00:04:43.990> time<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:44.290> does<00:04:44.380> take<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:44.590> little<00:04:44.710> bit

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
the same time it does take a little bit

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.250 
the same time it does take a little bit
of<00:04:44.950> skill<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.370> it's<00:04:45.610> kind<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:45.850> in<00:04:46.000> between

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
of skill so it's kind of in between

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.990 
of skill so it's kind of in between
being<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.410> normal<00:04:47.620> kind<00:04:47.920> of<00:04:48.070> setup<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.580> between

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
being a normal kind of setup and between

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.380 
being a normal kind of setup and between
hard<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:50.140> anywhere<00:04:50.860> in<00:04:50.950> between<00:04:51.010> there<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.550> to

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
hard so anywhere in between there and to

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.820 
hard so anywhere in between there and to
give<00:04:52.510> you<00:04:52.600> guys<00:04:52.780> an<00:04:53.050> understanding<00:04:53.650> what<00:04:53.770> I

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
give you guys an understanding what I

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.250 
give you guys an understanding what I
mean<00:04:53.980> by<00:04:54.100> normal<00:04:54.160> too<00:04:54.580> hard<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:55.150> normal<00:04:56.020> set<00:04:56.170> up

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
mean by normal too hard a normal set up

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.190 
mean by normal too hard a normal set up
for<00:04:56.410> me<00:04:56.500> would<00:04:56.620> be<00:04:56.680> like<00:04:57.210> using<00:04:58.210> an<00:04:58.390> an<00:04:58.570> with

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
for me would be like using an an with

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.480 
for me would be like using an an with
extended<00:04:59.620> mags<00:04:59.650> in<00:04:59.920> a<00:04:59.980> red<00:05:00.100> dot<00:05:00.250> sight

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
extended mags in a red dot sight

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.550 
extended mags in a red dot sight
something<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.000> that<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.390> then<00:05:01.570> easy<00:05:01.840> would

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
something like that and then easy would

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.890 
something like that and then easy would
be<00:05:02.590> something<00:05:03.130> like<00:05:03.310> well<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.300> guess<00:05:04.540> in<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.780> n

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
be something like well I guess in a n

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.450 
be something like well I guess in a n
would<00:05:05.050> be<00:05:05.080> more<00:05:05.350> easy<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.740> normal<00:05:06.130> setup<00:05:06.310> would

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
would be more easy a normal setup would

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.060 
would be more easy a normal setup would
be<00:05:06.640> something<00:05:07.120> like<00:05:10.380> this<00:05:11.380> is<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.590> tough<00:05:11.770> one<00:05:11.800> to

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
be something like this is a tough one to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.370 
be something like this is a tough one to
say<00:05:12.190> what<00:05:12.340> would<00:05:12.430> be<00:05:12.610> like<00:05:12.820> easy<00:05:13.150> what's<00:05:14.140> easy

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
say what would be like easy what's easy

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.770 
say what would be like easy what's easy
to<00:05:14.560> use<00:05:14.680> like<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.890> Miss<00:05:15.160> Mick<00:05:15.370> with<00:05:16.210> rapid<00:05:16.600> fire

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
to use like a Miss Mick with rapid fire

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.020 
to use like a Miss Mick with rapid fire
in<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.080> long<00:05:17.230> barrel<00:05:17.470> that's<00:05:18.340> really<00:05:18.730> easy<00:05:18.850> to

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
in a long barrel that's really easy to

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.360 
in a long barrel that's really easy to
use<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.450> then<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.870> step<00:05:20.590> up<00:05:20.770> from<00:05:20.890> that<00:05:21.100> to

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
use and then a step up from that to

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.480 
use and then a step up from that to
normal<00:05:21.730> would<00:05:21.880> be<00:05:22.000> like<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:23.160> pretty<00:05:24.160> much<00:05:24.280> any

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
normal would be like the pretty much any

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.980 
normal would be like the pretty much any
assault<00:05:24.820> rifle<00:05:25.150> would<00:05:25.240> be<00:05:25.390> like<00:05:25.600> kind<00:05:25.840> of<00:05:25.900> the

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
assault rifle would be like kind of the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.720 
assault rifle would be like kind of the
normal<00:05:26.290> range<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.770> then<00:05:26.830> harder<00:05:27.310> stuff<00:05:27.520> would

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
normal range and then harder stuff would

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.180 
normal range and then harder stuff would
be<00:05:27.820> like<00:05:28.000> pistols<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:28.870> stuff<00:05:29.590> like<00:05:29.710> that<00:05:29.770> I

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
be like pistols and stuff like that I

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.370 
be like pistols and stuff like that I
guess<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.340> shotgun<00:05:30.820> like<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.200> Remington<00:05:32.200> would

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
guess a shotgun like the Remington would

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.530 
guess a shotgun like the Remington would
be<00:05:32.470> easy<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:33.160> me<00:05:33.430> that's<00:05:33.820> personal<00:05:34.210> preference

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
be easy to me that's personal preference

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
understanding of where the gums kind of

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.580 
understanding of where the gums kind of
fallen<00:05:37.630> categories<00:05:38.080> for<00:05:38.200> me<00:05:38.260> I<00:05:38.320> hope<00:05:38.410> they're

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.800 
fallen categories for me I hope they're
kind<00:05:38.770> of<00:05:38.800> similar<00:05:38.980> for<00:05:39.250> everybody<00:05:39.580> because
