00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.600
 one already exists for the vacationer 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.950
 range of outdoor gadgets 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.380
 and do you really want a wilderness or the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.049
 mountain in napa does something more needed something 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.990
 what all these harsh conditions can handle 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 samsung comes with the week 350 full hd 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.930
 video 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.630
 dust water and shockproof 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.680
 the samsung e350 is only about 1 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.730
 thing they film it 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.399
 it happens in 1080p and in 750 p &amp; o 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 captain underwater mode and this should be the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.890
 the images under water are sharper 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.660
 to make 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.850
 but in practice you notice there unfortunately 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.290
 little of what you notice is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.210
 the image stabilization 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.380
 you can also switch this on and off and if 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.400
 you film by hand 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.010
 then you notice that the images are somewhat 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.570
 become smoother but become situation 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.730
 Rougher soon than it is a bit 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.530
 mop with the tap open 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 the trillion this samsung produces 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.720
 something the contrast teachers warm taste 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 but certainly better than the average 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.880
 HD video from the compact camera at this price 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.180
 cat you a went as i now dot audience 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 because certain ones are very underexposed 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.330
 he also has a camera on board 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.250
 medically only 5 megapixels so you are 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.380
 better off with your iphone or you should 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 make screenshots out of you from your full hd 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.220
 material also has a flower on the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 but this is unfortunately only it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.549
 digital kiss so kiss in on the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.610
 pixels you actually have nothing at all 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.650
 survived the Samson involvement only 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.600
 preferably 2 meters and also in it 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.520
 water on your complete freedom through this 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.900
 bumper well we tobias forest he had the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.900
 no longer need to be in the water last time 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.230
 seems its easy to drip we go 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.770
 we test 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.770
 every good by 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.250
 although it only weighs 140 grams 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.180
 a fairly hefty device but then 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.560
 you get something in return 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.630
 namely the screen on the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.910
 front side there are competitors expensive 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.030
 weather gopro has you you can 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.430
 and delete videos while traveling 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.990
 of course they look back 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.570
 all together add up the check 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.610
 samsung b300 actually something very exciting 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.920
 device you will get some 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.410
 carrying systems such as a tire and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.650
 and hang out for when you go surfing or 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.540
 skateboarding but further he could do this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.810
 something very much I just film and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.070
 for 170 euros I think I have a lot of money 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.310
 and therefore you only get two and half 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.310
 star
