00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
them and while I was out I didn't have a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
them and while I was out I didn't have a
coat<00:00:24.150> hanger<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.480> anything<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.810> remove<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> -

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
coat hanger or anything to remove the -

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.710

and<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.910> burned-out<00:00:26.910> bulb<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.330> driving<00:00:27.630> me

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and the burned-out bulb was driving me

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240 
and the burned-out bulb was driving me
nuts<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.170> figured<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.890> do<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
nuts so I figured I do have a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820 
nuts so I figured I do have a
screwdriver<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.760> me<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:31.529> figured<00:00:31.590> out

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
screwdriver with me and I figured out

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.549 
screwdriver with me and I figured out
how<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> gauge<00:00:32.340> cluster<00:00:32.369> without

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
how to get the gauge cluster without

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.790 
how to get the gauge cluster without
using<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:35.719> a<00:00:37.280> puller<00:00:38.280> made<00:00:38.610> from<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.620> coat<00:00:40.620> hanger

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
and turn your wheel slightly to the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.960 
and turn your wheel slightly to the
right<00:04:10.500> as<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.890> pull<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.160> as<00:04:11.550> you<00:04:11.700> pull<00:04:11.879> the

right as you pull the as you pull the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.240 
right as you pull the as you pull the
gauge<00:04:12.180> cluster<00:04:12.690> out<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.739> will<00:04:13.890> allow<00:04:14.099> it

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
gauge cluster out and that will allow it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.770 
gauge cluster out and that will allow it
to

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.020 
to
to<00:04:15.200> rotate<00:04:15.380> out<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:15.890> car<00:04:16.100> there's<00:04:16.790> just

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
to rotate out of the car there's just
