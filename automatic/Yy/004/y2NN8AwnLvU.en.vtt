00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:20.040
 small such technical moment too 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.040
 the deck was not discussed yet semi pile 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:35.850
 it often happens that people understand that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.870
 operation about the surface of the picture if she 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.309
 so it is written extremely uncomfortable but 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.350
 firstly you ruin the image 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.010
 secondly you are all smear soup butter 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.379
 and getting what you see for example 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 a person can't hold down some place 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.070
 you ask from and you like that's why 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.050
 that this one turns out that man is everything 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.300
 does make to really hang up 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 people are shaking big things on weight 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.300
 it is clear that everything is written to the forest sometimes 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.320
 such a thin thing you need to lean 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.180
 rely nowhere and man cannot 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.979
 hold on to him he leans all the time 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.740
 wipes face for these purposes coined 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.600
 so called at headquarters grab 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.270
 the classic version here is this ball he 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.440
 must be leather so that you can 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.130
 operatively 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.630
 but on the whole picture and prop up 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.220
 directly alive and the demand is not 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.970
 because you can unlock a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.080
 the edge like this and on it already 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.080
 based hand 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.030
 I repeat once again this is true for 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.000
 small places of some practical clear 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.220
 registration of small places 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.450
 when you want to thoughtfully put exactly 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:04.810
 somewhere a smear and not ruin what 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:09.220
 drawn already strengthen the opportunity 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.930
 work quietly poor nothing because 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.280
 that when you throw up everything 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.250
 I didn't hit the sand 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.340
 all perfectly copied sometimes 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.980
 need some specific places 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.680
 correct then the husband of the sheet he 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.420
 comfortable and see that you can keep it 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.570
 differently at different angles 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 so you in all therefore recommend to all 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.160
 respectively in the role in the stack that 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.190
 may not necessarily give way wand 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.150
 which at the end of the ball just made 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.630
 any kind of stick conveniently convenient for 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.380
 work that is when some 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.560
 arts and crafts still do yes 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.900
 when the product itself is on the table 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.610
 they just have a river that relies on 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.500
 two bars but in painting of course in 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.350
 mostly all the same things put 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.850
 vertically and he admits it is just 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.850
 what could be a comfortable wand
