00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 and friends all ask a question about 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:10.710
 rear side mirrors up to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:16.020
 when setting the alarm with the key 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 don't close i don't know which ones work for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.650
 all here is a trip to which 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 written there for five seconds hold i 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.039
 show you how to work for me, I tried to 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 the engine is stopped is not to do 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.030
 It turns out to start is necessary if we want 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.340
 so that mirrors do not open when 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.210
 alarm tomsk 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.210
 keychain first we get 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.940
 brought here they are open because I sat down 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.860
 in the car that i was doing i press and 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.150
 carefully we listen let there be sound 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.100
 characteristic talking about what we 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.979
 disabled automatic folding 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:15.350
 mirrors 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:20.420
 here so heard pipip so I after all 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.780
 turn off the radio now I'll open again 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:30.920
 the engine is not yet dumb 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:39.910
 I opened the wilderness of the engine and put on 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.910
 signaling in principle all 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.060
 all mirrors don't fold let's 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.450
 try the reverse option we need 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 to put 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.229
 open shoot alarm 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.659
 we start the engine 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.600
 so now wait for us to have music 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.670
 did not play the radio tape recorder that we heard 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.670
 distinctive peep sound 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.360
 Well 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 then 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.680
 tang tang tang tang tang 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.230
 as rare 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.500
 turn off and go to the mirrors as 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.410
 Well, let's we fold them like that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:20.709
 the button and the mirror were visible as well 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:24.130
 hold for a few seconds there was a pip sound 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.440
 match we can open it and 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.910
 we look what happens when setting on 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.230
 there must be an alarm 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:41.829
 reverse mirror effect should 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:45.370
 shut down deafening engine type out 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.370
 push setting 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:04:02.710
 Esin and 20 it seems that's all the same 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.710
 now open 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:15.370
 and remove the alarm all good 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.690
