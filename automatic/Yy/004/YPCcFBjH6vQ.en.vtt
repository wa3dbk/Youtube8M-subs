00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
I was broke at zero dollars and I almost

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
I was broke at zero dollars and I almost
sold<00:01:25.650> my<00:01:25.860> game<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.729> bored

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
sold my game because I was so bored

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
sold my game because I was so bored
because<00:01:27.450> once<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:27.930> rich<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.560> buy<00:01:29.009> all

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
because once you're rich and buy all

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
because once you're rich and buy all
this<00:01:29.340> stuff<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.180> become<00:01:30.509> poor<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
this stuff and then become poor if you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.490 
this stuff and then become poor if you
can't<00:01:32.040> maintain<00:01:32.520> being<00:01:33.180> rich<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:34.320> rich

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
can't maintain being rich if you're rich

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.859 
can't maintain being rich if you're rich
and<00:01:34.650> become<00:01:35.009> bored<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.420> gonna<00:01:36.570> work<00:01:36.659> out

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and become bored it's not gonna work out

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.060 
and become bored it's not gonna work out
because<00:01:36.960> when<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.290> cars<00:01:37.470> blow<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.950> stuff

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because when your cars blow up and stuff

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
because when your cars blow up and stuff
you<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> an<00:01:38.549> ax<00:01:38.610> plane<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> repair<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you don't have an ax plane to repair it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.910 
you don't have an ax plane to repair it
so<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:39.900> gonna<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.259> rich<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so if you're gonna be rich you need to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
so if you're gonna be rich you need to
stay<00:01:41.189> rich<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:42.090> else<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.360> boring<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> can't

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
stay rich or else is boring if you can't

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.100 
stay rich or else is boring if you can't
maintain<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.430> yeah<00:01:44.670> basically<00:01:45.600> he<00:01:45.899> gave<00:01:46.020> me
