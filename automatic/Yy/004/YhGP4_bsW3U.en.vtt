boxing<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.150> tough<00:01:27.330> sport<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.770> trained

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
boxing is a tough sport but I I trained

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.539 
boxing is a tough sport but I I trained
hard<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.030> prepare<00:01:30.390> hard<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> think<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.549> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
hard and prepare hard so I think I'm you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
hard and prepare hard so I think I'm you
know<00:01:32.579> 38<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.390> long<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.780> don't<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> keep

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
know 38 as long as I don't have to keep

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
know 38 as long as I don't have to keep
making<00:01:34.710> weight<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> smaller<00:01:35.700> guys<00:01:35.820> do

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
making weight like the smaller guys do

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
making weight like the smaller guys do
they<00:01:36.360> destroy<00:01:36.869> their<00:01:37.049> body<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.350> little<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.590> but

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
they destroy their body a little bit but

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
they destroy their body a little bit but
I<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:38.009> heavyweights<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> little

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
I think heavyweights you have a little

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.010 
I think heavyweights you have a little
more<00:01:39.960> longevity<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.820> sport<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
more longevity in the sport but you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
more longevity in the sport but you
dropped<00:01:43.259> some<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.070> make

to stop come with the experience yes
yeah<00:03:55.510> i<00:03:55.750> believe<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.080> what<00:03:56.830> do<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.040> expect<00:03:57.370> in

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
yeah i believe so what do you expect in

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.460 
yeah i believe so what do you expect in
the<00:03:57.670> ring<00:03:57.850> from<00:03:58.209> Europe<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.900> expect<00:03:59.350> a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
the ring from Europe and I expect a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.380 
the ring from Europe and I expect a
tactical<00:04:00.040> fight<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.280> think<00:04:00.610> he's<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.030> box

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
tactical fight I think he's going to box

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.780 
tactical fight I think he's going to box
me<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.870> try<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.650> keep<00:04:02.860> his<00:04:03.070> distance<00:04:03.280> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
me and try to keep his distance and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.360 
me and try to keep his distance and
throws<00:04:04.209> combinations<00:04:04.930> Arthur<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.070> very

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
throws combinations Arthur is a very

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.920 
throws combinations Arthur is a very
strong<00:04:06.670> puncher<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.670> think<00:04:10.480> he's<00:04:10.630> still

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
strong puncher but I I think he's still

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.440 
strong puncher but I I think he's still
developing<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:11.770> he<00:04:12.610> may<00:04:12.790> have<00:04:12.850> improved<00:04:13.300> from

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
developing so he may have improved from

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.850 
developing so he may have improved from
his<00:04:13.600> last<00:04:13.810> fight<00:04:14.050> which<00:04:14.200> I'm<00:04:14.350> sure<00:04:14.500> he<00:04:14.650> did

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
his last fight which I'm sure he did

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.440 
his last fight which I'm sure he did
because<00:04:15.250> he<00:04:15.280> seems<00:04:15.640> like<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.820> determined

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
because he seems like a determined

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.930 
because he seems like a determined
determined<00:04:17.080> kid<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:18.130> expect<00:04:18.640> nothing<00:04:18.730> but

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
determined kid and I expect nothing but

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.840 
determined kid and I expect nothing but
the<00:04:19.150> best<00:04:19.650> from<00:04:20.650> him<00:04:20.890> coming<00:04:21.310> Saturday<00:04:21.669> night

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
the best from him coming Saturday night

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.180 
the best from him coming Saturday night
so<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.090> believe<00:04:22.360> it's<00:04:22.720> going<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.930> be<00:04:23.140> it's<00:04:24.130> going

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
so I believe it's going to be it's going

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.689 
so I believe it's going to be it's going
to<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> hard<00:04:24.640> fight<00:04:24.880> tactical<00:04:25.479> fight<00:04:25.660> and

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
to be a hard fight tactical fight and

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.189 
to be a hard fight tactical fight and
I'll<00:04:27.699> imagine<00:04:28.180> he'll<00:04:28.270> be<00:04:28.419> some<00:04:28.570> fireworks<00:04:28.960> at

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
I'll imagine he'll be some fireworks at

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.580 
I'll imagine he'll be some fireworks at
times<00:04:29.410> going<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:31.120> last<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.840> your<00:04:31.960> losses<00:04:32.230> was

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
times going the last of your losses was

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.140 
fight on YouTube that's a very good
fight<00:04:37.540> but<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.740> went<00:04:39.010> down<00:04:39.310> hard<00:04:39.580> after<00:04:39.820> the

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
fight but you went down hard after the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.170 
fight but you went down hard after the
riot<00:04:40.690> strong<00:04:41.169> right<00:04:41.320> hand<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.860> did<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:42.940> feel

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
that the stoppage was a little every ah
