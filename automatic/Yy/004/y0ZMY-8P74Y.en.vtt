00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
takes its at 100 kpa the map I didn't

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.290 
takes its at 100 kpa the map I didn't
hook<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> map<00:01:21.450> sensor<00:01:21.659> reading<00:01:23.060> hey<00:01:24.060> PA

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300
