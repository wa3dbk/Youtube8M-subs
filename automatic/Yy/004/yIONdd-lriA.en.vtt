00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 That 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.469
 the victory of the city until now wynants time 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 but this case 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.400
 that's nature 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.170
 year that I understand very well but it does not finish or the rules 3 Chris 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
 froome land jack is that the rule that I come not strange why 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.590
 it takes a closer look 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.590
 those are the rules why there is promotion 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.460
 the flower tree 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.530
 but 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.060
 at least take a look 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 just before 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 westerwelle from belgium 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.709
 for example in the city 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.139
 the fifteen 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.139
 the cows that are a good choice animals are making 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 it is true 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.539
 this one 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:46.679
 After intense emmen we received which customers 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.339
 it was impossible for us in March this year

 still register a tunnel yes 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.999
 So 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.249
 Then it becomes difficult to play music that is old 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.809
 so i guess i think the tunnel makes sense to you 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.949
 that my colleague will soon receive an evidemment 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.959
