00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
pairs of strips and they just need to be

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.240 
pairs of strips and they just need to be
pressed<00:02:50.420> now<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.319> I'm<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.799> press<00:02:52.040> the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
color rather than the gray so I'll lay

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.110

gently press that seam over this way you

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.620 
gently press that seam over this way you
don't<00:03:57.250> tend<00:03:57.490> to<00:03:57.580> get<00:03:57.700> little<00:03:57.970> pleats<00:03:58.240> and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
don't tend to get little pleats and

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.530 
don't tend to get little pleats and
tucks<00:03:59.050> where<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.470> seam<00:03:59.680> hasn't<00:04:00.070> pressed<00:04:00.220> open

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
tucks where the seam hasn't pressed open

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.840 
tucks where the seam hasn't pressed open
and<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.660> gives<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.960> nice<00:04:02.170> flat<00:04:03.010> press<00:04:08.850> and

and it gives you a nice flat press and

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.680 
and it gives you a nice flat press and
then<00:04:11.160> back<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.460> cutting<00:04:12.760> board<00:04:12.790> now<00:04:13.180> I'm

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
then back to the cutting board now I'm

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.990 
then back to the cutting board now I'm
going<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.140> slice<00:04:14.410> these<00:04:14.740> up<00:04:14.980> into<00:04:15.220> strips<00:04:16.260> and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
going to slice these up into strips and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.729 
going to slice these up into strips and
I'm<00:04:19.000> going<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.359> lay<00:04:19.510> them<00:04:19.780> right<00:04:20.019> sides

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
I'm going to lay them right sides

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.640 
I'm going to lay them right sides
together<00:04:20.980> then<00:04:21.760> cut<00:04:22.000> them<00:04:22.180> together<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:26.590> I'm

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
together then cut them together so I'm

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.250 
together then cut them together so I'm
not<00:04:26.740> trying<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:27.130> line<00:04:27.310> up<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.550> seam

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
not trying to line up that seam

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.910 
not trying to line up that seam
particularly<00:04:29.260> or<00:04:29.350> anything<00:04:29.530> but<00:04:29.770> I'm<00:04:29.890> just

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
particularly or anything but I'm just

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.530 
particularly or anything but I'm just
going<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.280> lay<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.670> one<00:04:30.820> on<00:04:30.970> top<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.330> other

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
going to lay the one on top of the other

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.560 
going to lay the one on top of the other
and<00:04:32.430> I'm<00:04:33.430> going<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:33.760> just<00:04:33.910> have<00:04:34.090> them<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.450> that

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and I'm going to just have them so that

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:44.250 
and I'm going to just have them so that
I<00:04:34.660> can<00:04:36.750> trim<00:04:37.750> them<00:04:37.900> at<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.230> end<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:43.260> then

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
I can trim them at this end and then

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.620 
I can trim them at this end and then
every<00:04:44.770> three<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.160> half<00:04:45.370> inches<00:04:45.760> using<00:04:46.390> the

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
every three and a half inches using the

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.000 
every three and a half inches using the
markings<00:04:47.020> on<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.380> board<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.960> just<00:04:53.620> go<00:04:53.770> all

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
markings on the board and just go all

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.710 
markings on the board and just go all
the<00:04:54.160> way<00:04:54.310> along<00:04:54.640> doing<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:57.390> so<00:04:58.390> these<00:04:58.570> are

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
the way along doing that so these are

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:07.830 
the way along doing that so these are
cut<00:04:58.870> up<00:04:59.020> three<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.470> half<00:04:59.680> inches

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.620 

you<00:05:08.840> should<00:05:09.020> just<00:05:09.290> get<00:05:09.530> six<00:05:09.890> out<00:05:10.130> it's<00:05:10.630> very

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
you should just get six out it's very

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.080 
you should just get six out it's very
tight<00:05:11.960> but<00:05:12.830> hopefully<00:05:13.250> you'll<00:05:13.400> get<00:05:13.580> six<00:05:13.880> out

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
tight but hopefully you'll get six out

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.160 
tight but hopefully you'll get six out
of<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.360> with<00:05:14.540> from<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:14.990> backwater<00:05:15.670> and<00:05:17.170> then

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
of that with from the backwater and then

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.610 
of that with from the backwater and then
I'm<00:05:18.410> going<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.740> pick<00:05:18.920> up<00:05:19.040> my<00:05:19.790> pair<00:05:20.470> which<00:05:21.470> are

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
I'm going to pick up my pair which are

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.250 
I'm going to pick up my pair which are
already<00:05:21.770> right<00:05:22.250> sides<00:05:22.580> together<00:05:23.140> but<00:05:24.140> I'm

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
already right sides together but I'm

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.140 
already right sides together but I'm
going<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.620> pup<00:05:24.830> these<00:05:25.160> two<00:05:25.490> seams<00:05:25.850> now<00:05:26.120> I

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
going to pup these two seams now I

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.700 
going to pup these two seams now I
should<00:05:26.420> have<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.720> seams<00:05:26.990> going<00:05:27.260> in<00:05:27.410> opposite

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
should have the seams going in opposite

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.290 
should have the seams going in opposite
direction<00:05:28.010> we<00:05:28.280> should<00:05:28.460> have<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.670> color<00:05:28.880> that

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
direction we should have the color that

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.940 
direction we should have the color that
way<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.810> color<00:05:30.020> coming<00:05:30.410> this<00:05:30.530> way<00:05:30.710> so

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
way and the color coming this way so

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.180 
way and the color coming this way so
these<00:05:31.610> seams<00:05:31.910> here<00:05:32.330> I<00:05:32.450> can<00:05:32.780> just<00:05:33.380> place<00:05:34.160> it

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
these seams here I can just place it

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.420 
these seams here I can just place it
down<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.270> can<00:05:35.500> just<00:05:36.500> slide<00:05:36.830> this<00:05:37.100> along

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
down and I can just slide this along

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.870 
down and I can just slide this along
until<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.360> just<00:05:38.660> sits<00:05:38.870> snugly<00:05:39.080> together<00:05:39.880> and

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
until it just sits snugly together and

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.430 
until it just sits snugly together and
then<00:05:41.030> I<00:05:41.120> will<00:05:41.600> take<00:05:41.750> that<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.230> sewing

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
then I will take that to the sewing

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.120 
then I will take that to the sewing
machine<00:05:42.560> and<00:05:43.810> sew<00:05:44.810> my<00:05:45.200> quarter<00:05:45.590> inch<00:05:45.620> seam<00:05:45.980> and

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
machine and sew my quarter inch seam and

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.460 
machine and sew my quarter inch seam and
I'm<00:05:46.250> just<00:05:46.520> holding<00:05:46.940> on<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:47.360> way<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:47.720> seam

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
I'm just holding on to the way that seam

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.070 
I'm just holding on to the way that seam
is<00:05:48.680> battered<00:05:49.040> together<00:05:49.450> you<00:05:50.450> could<00:05:50.600> put<00:05:50.810> a<00:05:50.840> pin

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
is battered together you could put a pin

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.640 
is battered together you could put a pin
in<00:05:51.110> there<00:05:52.510> but<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.600> don't<00:05:53.630> often<00:05:54.140> get<00:05:54.350> around

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
in there but I don't often get around

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:02.260 
in there but I don't often get around
two<00:05:54.800> pins<00:05:57.760> to<00:05:58.760> say<00:06:00.640> just<00:06:01.640> keep<00:06:01.790> an<00:06:01.970> eye<00:06:02.060> that

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
two pins to say just keep an eye that

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.800 
two pins to say just keep an eye that
your<00:06:02.510> edges<00:06:03.260> are<00:06:03.430> staying<00:06:04.430> together<00:06:04.730> and<00:06:07.810> then

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
your edges are staying together and then

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.530 
your edges are staying together and then
I'll<00:06:08.930> pick<00:06:09.140> up<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.410> next<00:06:09.650> pair<00:06:09.980> and<00:06:10.550> do<00:06:11.270> just

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
I'll pick up the next pair and do just

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.930 
I'll pick up the next pair and do just
the<00:06:11.690> same<00:06:11.900> thing<00:06:12.170> again<00:06:12.260> so<00:06:12.470> I'm<00:06:12.800> going<00:06:13.040> to<00:06:13.100> up

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
the same thing again so I'm going to up

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:25.770 
the same thing again so I'm going to up
that<00:06:13.970> sing<00:06:14.540> till<00:06:14.870> it<00:06:14.990> just<00:06:15.020> sits<00:06:15.410> in<00:06:15.590> snuggly

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.209 

then<00:06:26.780> I'll<00:06:26.930> just<00:06:27.080> do<00:06:27.229> one<00:06:27.439> more<00:06:27.469> just<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:28.009> show

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
then I'll just do one more just to show

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.779 
then I'll just do one more just to show
you<00:06:28.719> pick<00:06:29.719> up<00:06:29.900> your<00:06:30.080> pair<00:06:30.289> but<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:31.550> scene

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
you pick up your pair but the scene

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:46.839 
you pick up your pair but the scene
together<00:06:44.740> and<00:06:45.740> by<00:06:45.889> chain<00:06:46.159> piecing<00:06:46.430> you're

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
together and by chain piecing you're

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.779 
together and by chain piecing you're
getting<00:06:47.360> them<00:06:47.860> flowing<00:06:48.860> through<00:06:49.189> nicely<00:06:49.639> you

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
getting them flowing through nicely you

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.820 
getting them flowing through nicely you
could<00:06:50.000> have<00:06:50.659> cut<00:06:50.840> up<00:06:50.990> a<00:06:51.110> whole<00:06:51.139> lot<00:06:51.439> more<00:06:51.620> if

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
could have cut up a whole lot more if

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.730 
could have cut up a whole lot more if
you'd<00:06:51.979> wanted<00:06:52.310> to<00:06:52.629> but<00:06:53.629> for<00:06:54.169> today<00:06:54.379> I'm<00:06:54.590> just

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
the iron and now I open that out and I'm

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.010 
the iron and now I open that out and I'm
going<00:07:02.449> to<00:07:02.569> press<00:07:02.750> the<00:07:02.930> scenes<00:07:03.199> to<00:07:03.469> one<00:07:03.650> side

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.330 

and<00:07:09.020> because<00:07:09.289> I<00:07:09.379> buttered<00:07:09.800> those<00:07:09.979> seams

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
and because I buttered those seams

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.790 
and because I buttered those seams
together<00:07:10.639> just<00:07:11.090> here<00:07:11.389> you<00:07:11.659> get<00:07:11.810> a<00:07:11.840> very<00:07:12.110> nice

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.719 

because<00:07:15.800> I<00:07:15.889> buttered<00:07:16.189> the<00:07:16.279> scenes<00:07:16.520> together

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
because I buttered the scenes together

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.159 
because I buttered the scenes together
here<00:07:17.120> you<00:07:17.240> get<00:07:17.330> a<00:07:17.389> nice<00:07:17.870> point<00:07:18.229> in<00:07:18.529> the<00:07:18.979> middle

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
here you get a nice point in the middle

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:31.860 
here you get a nice point in the middle
so<00:07:21.169> I'll<00:07:21.259> just<00:07:21.439> press<00:07:21.620> these<00:07:21.889> others

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.870 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.890 

and<00:07:32.980> there<00:07:33.980> I've<00:07:34.130> made<00:07:34.370> some<00:07:34.700> four<00:07:35.210> patches<00:07:35.420> in

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
and there I've made some four patches in

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.350 
and there I've made some four patches in
super<00:07:36.380> fast<00:07:36.410> time<00:07:36.980> but<00:07:37.700> they're<00:07:37.880> nice<00:07:38.030> and

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
super fast time but they're nice and

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.710 
super fast time but they're nice and
neat<00:07:38.540> and<00:07:38.750> tidy<00:07:39.370> and<00:07:40.370> that<00:07:41.270> you<00:07:41.390> could<00:07:41.600> be

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 
neat and tidy and that you could be

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.450 
neat and tidy and that you could be
making<00:07:42.050> those<00:07:42.140> into<00:07:42.470> a<00:07:42.500> pulse<00:07:42.800> or<00:07:43.010> whatever<00:07:43.340> it

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 
making those into a pulse or whatever it

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.660 
making those into a pulse or whatever it
is<00:07:43.520> that<00:07:43.700> you're<00:07:43.850> going<00:07:44.000> to<00:07:44.090> use<00:07:44.330> them<00:07:44.480> for<00:07:44.750> and

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:45.670 
is that you're going to use them for and

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.640 
is that you're going to use them for and
by<00:07:46.670> my<00:07:46.910> calculations<00:07:47.090> you<00:07:47.720> should<00:07:47.750> get<00:07:48.110> 24

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.650 
by my calculations you should get 24

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.550 
by my calculations you should get 24
blocks<00:07:48.890> out<00:07:49.250> of<00:07:49.520> four<00:07:50.480> fat<00:07:50.690> quarters<00:07:51.110> cutting

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560 
blocks out of four fat quarters cutting

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.350 
blocks out of four fat quarters cutting
them<00:07:51.680> like<00:07:51.860> that<00:07:52.040> so<00:07:52.640> we<00:07:52.790> cut<00:07:52.970> the<00:07:53.060> strips

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 
them like that so we cut the strips

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.210 
them like that so we cut the strips
three<00:07:53.630> and<00:07:53.720> a<00:07:53.780> half<00:07:53.960> inches<00:07:54.290> join<00:07:55.010> them

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:55.220 
three and a half inches join them

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.640 
three and a half inches join them
together<00:07:55.370> in<00:07:55.760> pairs<00:07:56.060> then<00:07:56.660> we<00:07:56.870> cut<00:07:57.230> them<00:07:57.350> again

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:57.650 
together in pairs then we cut them again

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.740 
together in pairs then we cut them again
at<00:07:57.860> three<00:07:58.190> and<00:07:58.250> a<00:07:58.340> half<00:07:58.520> inch<00:07:58.760> strips<00:07:59.600> across

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750 
at three and a half inch strips across

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.380 
at three and a half inch strips across
those<00:08:00.140> and<00:08:00.470> join<00:08:00.890> them<00:08:01.070> together<00:08:01.220> and<00:08:01.610> so<00:08:02.240> this

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.390 
those and join them together and so this

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.390 
those and join them together and so this
should<00:08:02.570> now<00:08:02.720> measure<00:08:02.990> six<00:08:03.680> and<00:08:03.830> a<00:08:03.860> half<00:08:03.890> inches

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 
should now measure six and a half inches

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.980 
should now measure six and a half inches
and<00:08:04.460> yes<00:08:04.850> it<00:08:05.180> measures<00:08:05.570> six<00:08:05.780> and<00:08:05.930> a<00:08:05.960> half

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:05.990 
and yes it measures six and a half

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.210 
and yes it measures six and a half
inches<00:08:06.440> which<00:08:07.190> is<00:08:07.310> very<00:08:07.580> pleasing<00:08:07.880> and

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:09.220 
inches which is very pleasing and

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.440 
inches which is very pleasing and
they'll<00:08:10.220> be<00:08:10.370> 6-inch<00:08:10.790> finished<00:08:11.120> when<00:08:11.300> they're

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.450
