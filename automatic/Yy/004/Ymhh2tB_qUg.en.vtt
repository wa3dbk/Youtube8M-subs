it's going good good what are you guys
going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.170> show<00:00:07.319> us<00:00:07.410> today<00:00:07.440> well<00:00:08.340> so<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.670> we

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
going to show us today well so what we

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.000 
going to show us today well so what we
have<00:00:08.940> here<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.360> guillotine<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.320> don't<00:00:10.590> made

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
have here is a guillotine of don't made

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.400 
have here is a guillotine of don't made
of<00:00:11.130> cardboard<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:12.389> we're<00:00:12.599> projecting<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
of cardboard and we're projecting on the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.829 
of cardboard and we're projecting on the
directional<00:00:13.860> data<00:00:14.070> ones'<00:00:14.660> Dziedzic<00:00:15.660> dome

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
directional data ones' Dziedzic dome

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.500 
directional data ones' Dziedzic dome
using<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.470> non-directional<00:00:16.890> projector<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
using a non-directional projector so the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.810 
using a non-directional projector so the
projector<00:00:18.930> basically<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.710> throw<00:00:20.400> an<00:00:20.490> image

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
projector basically can throw an image

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.140 
projector basically can throw an image
all<00:00:21.420> over<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.960> dome<00:00:22.199> hundred<00:00:22.590> eighty<00:00:22.740> degrees

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
all over the dome hundred eighty degrees

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.630 
all over the dome hundred eighty degrees
Half<00:00:24.150> Dome<00:00:24.180> basically<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:26.279> neat<00:00:26.519> thing

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
Half Dome basically and the neat thing

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.920 
Half Dome basically and the neat thing
about<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.880> projector<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> camera

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
about this projector is we have a camera

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.560 
about this projector is we have a camera
that<00:00:28.800> shares<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> same<00:00:29.820> lens<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
that shares the same lens as the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.720 
that shares the same lens as the
projector<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> camera<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.009> see<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
projector and so the camera can see and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.299 
projector and so the camera can see and
watch<00:00:33.239> us<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> look<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.290> our<00:00:34.380> gestures<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
watch us and look at our gestures and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.799 
watch us and look at our gestures and
night<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> whole<00:00:36.059> idea<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.570> make<00:00:36.600> an

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
night the whole idea is to make an

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.720 
night the whole idea is to make an
interactive<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> directional<00:00:38.190> projector

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
interactive on a directional projector

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.250 
interactive on a directional projector
and<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.600> we've<00:00:39.750> done<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.230> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and so what we've done here with this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.709 
and so what we've done here with this
demo<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.890> hook<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> number<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.149> different

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
demo is hook up a number of different

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.440 
demo is hook up a number of different
omnidirectional<00:00:43.280> data<00:00:44.280> sources<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
omnidirectional data sources and to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.520 
omnidirectional data sources and to
start<00:00:45.629> playing<00:00:45.930> around<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.200> some<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
start playing around with some of the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
start playing around with some of the
interaction<00:00:47.039> techniques<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.670> display

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
interaction techniques and display

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.330 
interaction techniques and display
techniques<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> stone

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
techniques that we can do with the stone

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
techniques that we can do with the stone
and<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> first<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.280> actually

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and so the first one here is actually

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.819 
and so the first one here is actually
have<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.960> roundtable<00:00:54.960> device<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.710> an

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
have a roundtable device that's an

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.119 
have a roundtable device that's an
omnidirectional<00:00:56.600> video<00:00:57.600> conferencing

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
omnidirectional video conferencing

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.430 
omnidirectional video conferencing
camera<00:00:59.129> and<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.270> benko<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> taken<00:01:01.320> his

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
camera and so benko is just taken his

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
camera and so benko is just taken his
hands<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.920> moving<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> across<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.609> lens<00:01:02.940> yeah

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
hands and moving it across the lens yeah

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740 
hands and moving it across the lens yeah
hi<00:01:03.600> Todd<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.339> actually<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
hi Todd this is actually the kind of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.000 
hi Todd this is actually the kind of
coolest<00:01:07.080> part<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.500> demo<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
coolest part of this demo is that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.280 
coolest part of this demo is that
because<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.939> both<00:01:09.420> camera<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
because we have both camera and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.130 
because we have both camera and
projector<00:01:10.680> device<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> same<00:01:11.790> unit<00:01:12.210> we're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
projector device in the same unit we're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.920 
projector device in the same unit we're
actually<00:01:13.290> able<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.970> use<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> camera<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> allow

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
actually able to use the camera to allow

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
actually able to use the camera to allow
the<00:01:16.530> user<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> interact<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.670> their<00:01:18.000> bare

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the user to interact with their bare

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.510 
the user to interact with their bare
hands<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:19.020> above<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> projector<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.040> like

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
hands right above the projector is like

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
hands right above the projector is like
this<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:22.049> moving<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> image

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
this so right now I'm moving the image

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.940 
this so right now I'm moving the image
literally<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.460> moving<00:01:23.640> my<00:01:23.939> hands

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
literally just by moving my hands

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.240 
literally just by moving my hands
this<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.369> cute<00:01:26.820> gestural<00:01:27.390> pose<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
this little cute gestural pose of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.800 
this little cute gestural pose of
inching<00:01:29.250> gesture<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.240> allow<00:01:30.420> me<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> actually

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
inching gesture to allow me to actually

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
inching gesture to allow me to actually
grab<00:01:31.170> onto<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> image<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.130> move<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.549> around

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
grab onto the image and move it around

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240 
grab onto the image and move it around
so<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.539> almost<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.740> almost<00:01:34.860> kind<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so it's almost it's almost kind of like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.279 
so it's almost it's almost kind of like
thinking<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> multi-touch<00:01:36.390> device<00:01:36.780> but

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
thinking is a multi-touch device but

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.810 
thinking is a multi-touch device but
instead<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.920> interacting<00:01:38.399> on<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> surface

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
instead of interacting on a surface

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.319 
instead of interacting on a surface
we're<00:01:39.090> interacting<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.630> midair<00:01:41.119> let<00:01:42.119> me<00:01:42.210> show

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
we're interacting in midair let me show

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.950 
we're interacting in midair let me show
you<00:01:42.360> some<00:01:42.569> other<00:01:42.659> demos<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> here

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
you some other demos that we have here

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.789 
you some other demos that we have here
worldwide<00:01:45.960> telescope<00:01:46.380> demo

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.410 

I<00:01:51.799> recognize<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
I recognize this so this is the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.300 
I recognize this so this is the
worldwide<00:01:53.690> telescope<00:01:54.049> application<00:01:54.860> right

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
worldwide telescope application right

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.550 
worldwide telescope application right
and<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.940> guys<00:01:56.119> basically<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:56.810> adapted<00:01:57.440> it

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
and you guys basically just adapted it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.430 
and you guys basically just adapted it
for<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:57.830> right<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:58.430> what<00:01:58.610> we<00:01:58.729> did<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:58.970> we

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
for this right so what we did is we

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.499 
for this right so what we did is we
worked<00:02:00.440> with<00:02:00.650> worldwide<00:02:01.580> telescope<00:02:01.820> crew<00:02:02.180> to

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
worked with worldwide telescope crew to

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.859 
worked with worldwide telescope crew to
get<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:03.229> dome<00:02:03.500> projection<00:02:04.100> working<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:05.000> for

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
get the dome projection working it for

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.630 
get the dome projection working it for
their<00:02:06.020> data<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:06.619> right<00:02:06.890> now<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.190> is<00:02:07.340> actually

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
their data so right now this is actually

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.460 
their data so right now this is actually
their<00:02:07.790> data<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.239> displayed<00:02:08.720> correctly<00:02:09.020> for

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
their data but displayed correctly for

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.630 
their data but displayed correctly for
the<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:09.920> our<00:02:10.540> for<00:02:11.540> our<00:02:11.600> dome<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.950> again<00:02:13.430> we're

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the for our for our dome and again we're

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.550 
the for our for our dome and again we're
using<00:02:13.670> our<00:02:14.209> little<00:02:14.630> gestural<00:02:14.989> interactions

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
using our little gestural interactions

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.350 
using our little gestural interactions
to<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:17.060> enable<00:02:17.420> some<00:02:17.900> nice<00:02:19.180> navigational<00:02:20.180> or

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
to to enable some nice navigational or

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.600 
to to enable some nice navigational or
interactions<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:21.440> it's<00:02:22.069> your<00:02:22.160> especially

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
interactions here it's your especially

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.100 
interactions here it's your especially
pinching<00:02:22.970> your<00:02:23.060> hands<00:02:23.510> moving<00:02:23.870> them<00:02:24.080> around

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
pinching your hands moving them around

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.820 
pinching your hands moving them around
and<00:02:24.709> it's<00:02:25.840> manipulating<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.019> image<00:02:27.410> up<00:02:27.650> on

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
and it's manipulating the image up on

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.320 
and it's manipulating the image up on
the<00:02:27.950> dome<00:02:28.130> right<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.880> what<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.150> are<00:02:29.209> looking

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
the dome right and what we are looking

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.910 
the dome right and what we are looking
here<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> Crab<00:02:30.140> Nebula<00:02:32.140> data<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
here is a Crab Nebula data this is the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.759 
here is a Crab Nebula data this is the
wonderful<00:02:34.459> view<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.269> sky<00:02:35.390> I'm<00:02:36.260> strike<00:02:36.620> on

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
wonderful view of the sky I'm strike on

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.220 
wonderful view of the sky I'm strike on
in<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> solar<00:02:37.280> system<00:02:37.340> right<00:02:38.860> son

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.740 

so<00:02:42.830> here<00:02:43.430> now<00:02:43.610> we're<00:02:43.849> kind<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.180> switched<00:02:44.450> away

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
so here now we're kind of switched away

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.170 
so here now we're kind of switched away
from<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> view<00:02:45.260> from<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> earth<00:02:45.849> out<00:02:46.849> in

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
from the view from the earth out in

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.920 
from the view from the earth out in
design<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.080> sky<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.069> actually

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
design to the sky and this is actually

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.720 
design to the sky and this is actually
our<00:02:50.930> solar<00:02:51.830> system<00:02:52.340> we<00:02:53.269> can<00:02:53.450> zoom<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.700> see

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
our solar system we can zoom in and see

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:05.370 
our solar system we can zoom in and see
the<00:02:56.180> sun<00:02:56.659> spots<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:59.780> also<00:02:59.930> go<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:01.060> Saturn

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.050 

so<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.040> basically<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:06.520> took<00:03:06.730> your<00:03:06.850> hands

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
so you basically just took your hands

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.780 
so you basically just took your hands
and<00:03:07.210> put<00:03:07.360> them<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.630> particular<00:03:08.460> form<00:03:09.460> above

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
and put them in a particular form above

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.160 
and put them in a particular form above
the<00:03:09.940> camera<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.450> recognizes<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.990> you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
the camera and it recognizes that you

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.950 
the camera and it recognizes that you
wanted<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.530> give<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.740> a<00:03:11.800> command<00:03:12.070> right<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
wanted to give it a command right so the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.600 
wanted to give it a command right so the
other<00:03:14.110> aspect<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.770> this<00:03:14.860> demo<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.250> we<00:03:15.430> do

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
other aspect of this demo is that we do

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.920 
other aspect of this demo is that we do
have<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.880> speech<00:03:16.180> with<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> control

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
have the speech with the control

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.200 
have the speech with the control
commands<00:03:17.470> but<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.490> don't<00:03:18.640> want<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.850> speech<00:03:19.060> to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
commands but we don't want the speech to

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.910 
commands but we don't want the speech to
be<00:03:19.300> enabled<00:03:19.630> at<00:03:19.720> all<00:03:19.840> times<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.410> what<00:03:20.590> we<00:03:20.710> do<00:03:20.890> is

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
be enabled at all times so what we do is

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.070 
be enabled at all times so what we do is
actually<00:03:21.160> put<00:03:21.520> two<00:03:21.700> hands<00:03:21.970> together<00:03:22.210> like

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
actually put two hands together like

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.020 
actually put two hands together like
this<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.740> have<00:03:23.890> our<00:03:23.980> little<00:03:24.430> thing<00:03:24.550> and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
this and you have our little thing and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.750 
this and you have our little thing and
that<00:03:25.570> triggers<00:03:26.200> our<00:03:26.350> speech<00:03:26.650> recognition<00:03:27.130> and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
that triggers our speech recognition and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.430 
that triggers our speech recognition and
then<00:03:27.880> we<00:03:28.000> can<00:03:28.180> issue<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.540> command<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.290> control

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
then we can issue a command and control

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.290 
then we can issue a command and control
of<00:03:29.740> our<00:03:30.010> interface<00:03:30.430> through<00:03:30.760> speech<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:33.300> I'll

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
of our interface through speech so I'll

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.300 
of our interface through speech so I'll
take<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.570> through<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> little<00:03:34.990> journey<00:03:35.310> your

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
take you through a little journey your

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.000 
take you through a little journey your
space<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.820> think<00:03:37.360> this<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.660> really<00:03:37.840> impressive

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.710 

so<00:03:42.010> we're<00:03:42.130> going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.340> go<00:03:42.490> move<00:03:43.000> out<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:43.540> we're

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
so we're going to go move out and we're

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.750 
so we're going to go move out and we're
going<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.900> go<00:03:44.020> away<00:03:44.470> from<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.010> solar<00:03:45.220> system

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
going to go away from the solar system

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.940 
going to go away from the solar system
you're<00:03:46.210> actually<00:03:46.570> seeing<00:03:46.930> all<00:03:47.110> our<00:03:47.230> planets

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
you're actually seeing all our planets

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.100 
you're actually seeing all our planets
the<00:03:49.220> stars<00:03:49.940> are<00:03:50.180> going<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.390> start<00:03:50.569> moving<00:03:50.780> now

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
the stars are going to start moving now

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.970 
the stars are going to start moving now
because<00:03:52.040> we're<00:03:52.220> actually<00:03:53.209> trying<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.200> get<00:03:54.860> to

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
because we're actually trying to get to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.670 
because we're actually trying to get to
be<00:03:55.099> outskirts<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.790> our<00:03:55.910> galaxy<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:57.410> this<00:03:57.560> would

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
be outskirts of our galaxy so this would

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.930 
be outskirts of our galaxy so this would
be<00:03:57.709> pretty<00:03:57.950> cool<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.250> schools<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.819> would

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
be pretty cool in schools I would

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.880 
be pretty cool in schools I would
imagine<00:03:59.150> oh<00:03:59.569> yeah<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.290> think<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:00.739> been

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
imagine oh yeah I think it's been

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.070 
imagine oh yeah I think it's been
fantastic<00:04:01.069> I<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.390> part<00:04:02.599> of<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.720> reason<00:04:02.959> I

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
fantastic I have part of the reason I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.410 
fantastic I have part of the reason I
should<00:04:03.290> we<00:04:03.379> use<00:04:03.560> cardboard<00:04:04.160> was<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.180> make<00:04:05.300> it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
should we use cardboard was to make it

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
should we use cardboard was to make it
so<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.750> can<00:04:05.870> be<00:04:05.930> very<00:04:05.959> cheaply

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
so that it can be very cheaply

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.470 
so that it can be very cheaply
constructed<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.269> kind<00:04:08.420> of

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
constructed and so this is the kind of

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.479 
constructed and so this is the kind of
thing<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.660> we<00:04:08.840> think<00:04:09.050> that<00:04:09.310> bunch<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.400> high

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
thing that we think that bunch of high

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.430 
thing that we think that bunch of high
school<00:04:10.730> kids<00:04:10.760> can<00:04:11.269> put<00:04:11.630> together<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:13.150> use<00:04:14.150> the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
school kids can put together and use the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.170 
school kids can put together and use the
magic<00:04:15.440> world<00:04:15.650> wide<00:04:15.799> telescope<00:04:16.060> software<00:04:17.060> that

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
magic world wide telescope software that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.569 
magic world wide telescope software that
they<00:04:17.299> have

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
they have

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.550 
they have
base<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.359> build<00:04:19.509> their<00:04:19.720> own<00:04:19.750> little<00:04:20.019> planetary

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
base to build their own little planetary

on<00:04:24.370> with<00:04:24.400> microsoft<00:04:24.970> spheres<00:04:25.300> us<00:04:25.659> here<00:04:25.900> at<00:04:26.020> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
on with microsoft spheres us here at the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.050 
on with microsoft spheres us here at the
surface<00:04:26.319> computer<00:04:26.830> right<00:04:27.280> i<00:04:27.490> understand<00:04:27.969> this

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
surface computer right i understand this

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.429 
surface computer right i understand this
camera<00:04:28.419> is<00:04:28.449> basically<00:04:28.810> what's<00:04:28.990> inside<00:04:29.409> that

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439 
camera is basically what's inside that

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.350 
camera is basically what's inside that
right<00:04:30.129> we're<00:04:30.370> reusing<00:04:30.699> some<00:04:30.909> of<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.180> same

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
right we're reusing some of the same

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.080 
right we're reusing some of the same
components<00:04:32.020> but<00:04:32.560> we're<00:04:32.710> now<00:04:33.159> we<00:04:33.610> remove<00:04:34.060> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
components but we're now we remove the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.959 
components but we're now we remove the
actual<00:04:34.659> spherical<00:04:35.289> globe<00:04:35.860> from<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.460> top<00:04:36.669> and

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
actual spherical globe from the top and

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.390 
actual spherical globe from the top and
we<00:04:37.900> replace<00:04:38.439> it<00:04:38.590> with<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.740> dome<00:04:38.979> so<00:04:39.189> we<00:04:39.280> can

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
we replace it with a dome so we can

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.290 
we replace it with a dome so we can
actually<00:04:39.520> have<00:04:39.729> a<00:04:39.759> completely<00:04:40.120> immersive

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
actually have a completely immersive

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.270 
actually have a completely immersive
experience<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.139> can<00:04:41.259> walk<00:04:41.469> inside<00:04:41.979> of<00:04:42.159> our

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
experience we can walk inside of our

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.939 
experience we can walk inside of our
don't<00:04:42.969> and<00:04:43.750> ce3<00:04:44.379> under<00:04:44.860> 62<00:04:45.129> degrees<00:04:45.280> around<00:04:45.580> so

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
don't and ce3 under 62 degrees around so

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.129 
don't and ce3 under 62 degrees around so
i<00:04:47.949> know<00:04:48.069> you<00:04:48.219> can<00:04:48.460> do<00:04:48.550> something<00:04:48.759> cool<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.449> sort

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
i know you can do something cool to sort
