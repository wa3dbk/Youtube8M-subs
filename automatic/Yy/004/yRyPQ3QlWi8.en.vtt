1<00:00:54.300> minute<00:00:54.330> and<00:00:54.660> you're<00:00:54.780> gonna<00:00:54.870> microwave

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
1 minute and you're gonna microwave

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:03.160 
1 minute and you're gonna microwave
we're<00:00:56.310> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:56.820> our<00:00:57.770> tablespoon

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.490 

now<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.259> reason<00:01:11.530> why<00:01:11.649> we<00:01:11.710> heated<00:01:12.100> up<00:01:12.340> first<00:01:13.500> in

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
now the reason why we heated up first in

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.020 
now the reason why we heated up first in
the<00:01:14.619> microwave<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.159> it<00:01:15.280> makes<00:01:15.429> a<00:01:15.549> lot<00:01:15.729> easier

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
the microwave is it makes a lot easier

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.819 
the microwave is it makes a lot easier
to<00:01:16.210> mix<00:01:16.479> in<00:01:16.659> these<00:01:17.530> ingredients<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
to mix in these ingredients when the
