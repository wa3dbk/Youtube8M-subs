00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.840
 hi friends how are we now in this 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.300
 I bring you a tutorial for 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.340
 all that we have updated 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.810
 a new framework that has taken apple to 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:28.009
 ios 70.6 and well we can see here my 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:32.720
 iphone where this information and 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:35.329
 we found that says the 70.6 ios comes out 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.510
 here we can see it here we have 7 points 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.470
 0.6 and well what happens what is it 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 it happens good 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.060
 I do not know if you have noticed that there is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.700
 17 has one like a bug where it makes 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.850
 the battery will escape in a way 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.670
 terrible a horrible way comes out to me 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.940
 for example since three days ago I was 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.850
 went the battery before noon occupied 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.990
 the phone in the morning and at the latest 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.450
 At one o'clock in the afternoon I already had 10% 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.580
 battery 6 I completely went the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 battery but good to solve this 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 problem is super easy I already tried it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.660
 yesterday and today today 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 example is 2 in the afternoon still 2 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.140
 with 11 and you can see that I have half 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 of batteries I could say but good as 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.970
 sort it all that easy 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.280
 we have to do is open applications 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.369
 the applications that you want comes out 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 it matters what applications are it does not matter 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.259
 which I recommend you open about eight 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.880
 or nine applications must be several 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.250
 comes out once we have opened the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.020
 applications open in multitasking not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.770
 it matters that you do not have this guy installed 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 and I have it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.950
 nothing happens we are deleting one by one 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.799
 of all the applications that we have in 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 the multitasking saleh we are deleting a 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.250
 for once and once we have deleted the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.490
 application let's leave it like this and now 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.129
 with the power button and with the home button 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 let's do a reset of our 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.980
 iphone ipod touch or ipad sale 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.160
 we press the two buttons until no 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.200
 come out apple apple 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.860
 as long as the apple apple does not come out 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.880
 we have to let go out this one too 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.150
 in my case my phone is being 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.340
 restarting here the screen stayed 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.190
 frozen 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.720
 but good 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.900
 we simply expect nothing more than to have 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.520
 to open the reflector again but 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.750
 well this is a small bus that have 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.730
 all reflector versions 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.350
 unfortunately when you do you could 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.200
 say that a hard reset note 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.850
 does not follow the sequence of the iphone ipod 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.260
 touch or ipad but it stays stuck 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:56.800
 but hey I 'm doing this , you're going to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.140
 notice an increase or improvement of your 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.410
 incredibly see battery I'll go back 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.620
 to open 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.200
 this the this program already a second if 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.140
 I have to remove it because here it stays 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.300
 always stuck as I say it is 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.000
 unfortunately a small problem of 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.060
 reflector 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.750
 but then absolutely nothing happens ok 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.110
 we open here and here we go in duplication 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.360
 and ready go out with this friends tell them your 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.850
 phone will be completely good 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.490
 completely healthy and without that escape 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.990
 battery so annoying ok well I hope you've 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.610
 liked this little tutorial the matter 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.350
 it's pretty easy pretty fast 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.430
 pretty simple I remember it 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.780
 it simply closes all 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.970
 Apps that you have in the boutique 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.280
 in multitasking and restart your 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.730
 device with this button the button 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.870
 power and with the home button so good 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.430
 friends finally thank you for your 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.430
 preference and see you in the next 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.430
 dance
