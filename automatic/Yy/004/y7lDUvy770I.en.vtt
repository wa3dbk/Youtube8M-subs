00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
it from there so that's my quick and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.699 
it from there so that's my quick and
simple<00:02:08.940> pose<00:02:09.940> cart<00:02:10.300> goes<00:02:11.230> really<00:02:11.470> well<00:02:11.590> with

my<00:02:11.830> r3<00:02:12.400> from<00:02:12.580> reach<00:02:12.730> higher<00:02:12.910> ground<00:02:13.239> and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
my r3 from reach higher ground and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.750 
my r3 from reach higher ground and
doesn't<00:02:13.540> window<00:02:13.840> cleaning<00:02:14.049> resource<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
doesn't window cleaning resource and I

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.280 
doesn't window cleaning resource and I
think<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.209> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.390> make<00:02:16.540> our<00:02:16.810> lives<00:02:17.080> a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
think it's going to make our lives a

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
think it's going to make our lives a
whole<00:02:17.349> lot<00:02:17.680> easier<00:02:18.299> overwater<00:02:19.299> fit<00:02:19.540> pulling

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
whole lot easier overwater fit pulling

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.470 
whole lot easier overwater fit pulling
these<00:02:20.019> houses<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.620> hopefully<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:22.450> is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
