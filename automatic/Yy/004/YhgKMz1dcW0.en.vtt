00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 yes 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.480
 well this last part then you 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.390
 We will show how to assemble our folder 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.020
 nfs through windows 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.550
 here we have then a summary 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.950
 basically about how important we have 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.660
 to know about our server and know 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.840
 that we are sharing through 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.730
 this is here is the address of our 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:48.380
 server 10.0 point 1.1 and the folders 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.420
 that are being shared omit mp 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.830
 to see that he only executes the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.860
 common command 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.640
 - and the direction of danger we take to 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.550
 windows 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.260
 here in our windows system 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.890
 basically we have to do two steps 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 simple things first and foremost is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.400
 check that there is connection to our 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.960
 servers 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.960
 for this we are going to make a pine 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.829
 and we see that it is working 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.200
 correctly once verified that 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.759
 then and see what connectivity with 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 our server we are going to add the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.520
 service 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.590
 benitez 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.039
 we had already added it in line through 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.070
 nfc as in windows is simpler 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.670
 we are simply going to activate the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.290
 characteristics of a child 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.159
 and we look for the option 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.369
 services for nfc 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.590
 and services for nfl we activate those two 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.289
 boxes or just the customer 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.569
 since it's only for a client 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.390
 and we press accept in my case and the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.209
 I have added so they are not going to 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.270
 add but wait a few seconds 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.109
 immediately paint 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.819
 and once the file is installed 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.129
 bullfighting 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.860
 let's check again what is 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.420
 connectivity per project 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.650
 and what we have to do then 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.980
 disassemble the unit 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.190
 which is going to start that data 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.410
 shared on our server second 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.160
 well for it we were just the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.690
 command mount - or telling you that we are going to 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.150
 mount a mount unit against the end 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.570
 or indicates that they are options that are going to 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.690
 follow let's put it anonymous we're going 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.620
 to connect anonymously and we're going to 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.800
 avoid then that this block 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.520
 the active by the cut 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.320
 for the access of multiple users 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.370
 we're just going to have it as a reading 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.760
 then let's put r 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.730
 so that we can only read the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.769
 file from this unit that we're going to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.730
 riding that is important because at 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.750
 combine these anonymous elements not blog 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.150
 r 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.830
 and others can do that only 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.340
 we can access to read the file 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.410
 we know that for ubuntu it is not allowed in 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.630
 our server ubuntu server us 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.090
 write permissions 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.380
 we have to enter as root or we have 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.900
 to enter with a user who has 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.490
 permits in this case identify the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.660
 Windows user is practically 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:43.610
 impossible to tell you these features of 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.510
 anonymous reading and among others so 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.650
 generally unless they look for the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.580
 form or try using samba or others 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.090
 elements that the user is detected or 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.760
 work with the user 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.840
 from windows alain 2 then there is going to 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.239
 be possible 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.090
 read and edit but in this case 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.090
 only we will be able to avoid the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.769
 file then let's write case 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.769
 sensitive so that it is detected 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.550
 the difference between uppercase and 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:26.680
 lowercase as 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.889
 they tell me if we are going to add you now 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.330
 our server address two 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.300
 bars 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.849
 and the direction and faith in the ferry dor 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.659
 also the address of the folder already 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.659
 we know what it is 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.729
 and we're also going to tell you in what unit 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.889
 we are going to ride it 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.900
 the unit in which we are going to assemble this 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.779
 or the files that we share 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.689
 loud servers by ubuntu so 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:59.670
 saying it can be and can be any 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.530
 by in this case we are going to leave the web 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.550
 once concluded then 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.330
 we press people 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.870
 how do we see that I correctly calculate well 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.370
 what are we going to verify 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.020
 this is how to travel our unit 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.560
 with the files that are being 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.560
 sharing 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.100
 how are we going here 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.520
 there is an example here below 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.380
 the special example 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.880
 we have created previously 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.880
 so you will see 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.170
 how is this shared we know that no 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.170
 we can save 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.899
 what can not go to save in another 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.899
 place 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:54.490
 as we see here we do not have permission 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.490
 of course not 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.400
 so 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.280
 it's good to play with the permissions 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.820
 and this command to see how we can 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.650
 edit and access the files to be able 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.810
 write about them but in the meantime 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.690
 we can access and see what is 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.389
 sharing through nfc is fine 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.120
 important once you have finished this 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:25.830
 command we see that it works correctly 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.660
 and we want to remove the unit 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.490
 we simply write 1 1 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.409
 and the letter of the unit that we have 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.699
 joined in this case the av 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.699
 we will see that it is here 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:45.760
 and dismantled and disappeared 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.760
 so it's basically the same as line 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.130
 but based entirely on windows well 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.260
 that has been all for deliveries close to 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.780
 me face the questions and comments 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.980
 they can leave the end of the video you 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.950
 we will help as we can 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:04.450
 so practice and we'll see each other in a 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.450
 next delivery bye bye
