00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.470
 the finalist of the federation cup of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.100
 this year will be decided in the stadium gal 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.530
 next March 18 because the 0 to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.450
 0 of the first meeting in linarejos leaves 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.550
 the tie completely open 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.320
 after a sporting linares that was a lot 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.870
 better in the first part than the team 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 Basque second division b but without 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.920
 However, in the second half 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.460
 forces that did not fail were the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.500
 spectators over 2000 blues in the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
 tier against a rival with four 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.129
 footballers in the starting eleven that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.579
 have passed in first division with the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.399
 real society the meeting was already beginning 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.620
 the six minutes first time javi 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.460
 quesada one of the most outstanding ends 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.460
 shooting out 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.990
 we go to the minute 22 they will see that in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.790
 the first part the linares is the one 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.190
 domina steals the frozen ball and does it 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.050
 all good leads but say pull the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.949
 door instead of passing a companion the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.949
 ball goes out 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.610
 again javi quesada from afar 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.610
 otermín makes the best stop of the game 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.530
 again and I gave it in the first part one 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.650
 of the most prominent makes mischief 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.020
 three defenders take a kick 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.430
 that the referee does not see and the public of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.470
 linarejos begins to warm the atmosphere 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.540
 because the linares felt comfortable in the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.900
 midfield even the defenses are 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.000
 they cheered bout and notice what little hat 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.880
 try from afar repels a defender 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.550
 the play will end in lara's shot 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.860
 and shortcut otermín again the linares was 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.510
 far superior to a real union of irun that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.470
 had come it seemed that for the draw 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.470
 no goals 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.009
 again the azulillos to the load to 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.520
 garrido from afar looking for the squad 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.520
 long 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.680
 and the anger of linarejos with the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.739
 Sevillian collegiate well is a frost 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.319
 it ends without a vote nobody cuts the game on 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.750
 referee does not see it there is another fault and to the 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.450
 rest in linares was leaving with a 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.819
 tremendous effort and demonstrating its best 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.330
 version after a complicated week 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.580
 with the loss against san pedro and the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.030
 tie in antequera with a very bad 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.030
 first part 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.730
 hopefully a first time I think that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 We have deserved more prize 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.230
 at least for ghana by intensity 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.659
 to get to try to always look for the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.769
 opposite goal and had come to get 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.500
 a result like the one they got 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.680
 try to make us wrong and I 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.200
 I think it was an equal first half 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.220
 matched but the balance scales 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.610
 pulling to linares by over all domain 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.190
 territorial with far shots 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.170
 I believe that because our center field 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.390
 not even vote he liked it he wanted to be 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.820
 had to tell him without a doubt the technician 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.590
 aitor zulaika to his men in the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.290
 second part that will throw to door and 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.410
 Jorge Sanchez will prove to notice Sáizar 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.100
 in the first nothing more to take out of center 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.290
 try to surprise the goalkeeper 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.629
 azulillo 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.700
 but the best move without a doubt of all the 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.849
 meeting for the Basques would have it in 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.640
 the minute 58 to alonso after this 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.159
 ozcoidi action is left alone in the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.469
 left flank and sends the zapatazo to 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.629
 the tie when he had only the goalkeeper 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.790
 front carousel of changes in the 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.400
 linares putting all the gunpowder with 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.470
 angel corpas and for jean also what 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.780
 would the visitor set with beau and 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.370
 if the two of your best men without 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.930
 however the second half and I 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.030
 precisely because of the absence of 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.019
 clear chances of goal some of the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.019
 most outstanding 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.599
 rafa payan escapes more from the 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.450
 account and in the end javi quesada defines 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.609
 but stops the goalkeeper will do it from 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.609
 away also I try to volley but 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.200
 without direction there was no spark in this 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.419
 second half and still the Basques 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.389
 they could leave with the favorable result 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.730
 to the match back to the crossbar 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.040
 in this center chut that goes to the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.039
 stringer in the absence of a minute for the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.130
 conclusion and the worst news 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:22.160
 Injured corpas can be fibula or 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.990
 sprain the first thing would leave you out 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.150
 in the template what remains of 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.540
 season that we have not been 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.280
 deep or I think it was not lack of 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.960
 spark is that we have not seen to see if 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.780
 there was no spark because there has not been 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.190
 racing in brawn sprint is to see if 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.140
 there is spark or not because everything was at the foot 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.900
 walk to time then then the 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.849
 main slogan if you want to have the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.849
 ball and play 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.860
 have and play with the ball are not two 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.689
 things to have and play with the ball to attack 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.429
 and defend with the ball yes I think that 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.439
 was the main slogan and that's the 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:57.510
 team has taken it to rajatabla perhaps 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:59.370
 what we have lacked a bit is 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.740
 once we have left the cans 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.240
 when we get some control 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.250
 depth both inside and outside 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.950
 because we had the extremes and not 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.500
 we have summoned them what what 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.570
 we wanted because good I have also 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.490
 seen a little fair about and in the 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.260
 second part and I wanted to put him there like that 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.360
 the ones to look for a little speed but 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.370
 is that he has not seen himself if he was 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.190
 with a spark not no if it recovers 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.830
 sensations a lot is that they are also 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.240
 psychological many times with too much 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.340
 advantages of you think everything is easy 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.820
 the half hour is winning in antequera 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.340
 03 and everything is complicated as it does not come out as 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.020
 we have left and to 120% any team 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.150
 you can win and if we know well above 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.950
 that the rivals against 9 rag have 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.540
 that plus motivation, just like the 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.900
 we have, we have everything 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.950
 complicates then well we know that the 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.600
 team is fine that the team is so 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.420
 strong that many times they are aspects 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.830
 psychological and that we are in good 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.510
 way to recover people as soon as 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.610
 possible that that does not come to me is not 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.960
 nothing that of corpas is nothing for 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.430
 try on Sunday to have the most people 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.290
 available because on Sunday yes that 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.360
 win yes or yes with the intensity that 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.440
 we had that way the first ones finished 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.150
 90 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.950
 80 minutes of this tie with 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.480
 goalless draw with the linares 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.150
 recovering the best sensations 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.850
 giving the face before a much superior rival 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.670
 that was not so much in linarejos the 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.130
 encounter back remember day 18 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.920
 in the stadium gal de irún there will be 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.020
 Azulillos in the Basque countryside will cheer 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.500
 from the stand to give encouragement to your 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.250
 men in this final clash are going 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.250
 to know very soon
