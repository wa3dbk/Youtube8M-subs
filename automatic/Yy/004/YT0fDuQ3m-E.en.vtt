very<00:01:28.539> well<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.960> PlayStation<00:01:29.560> but<00:01:30.130> i<00:01:30.160> think<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
very well on PlayStation but i think the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.469 
very well on PlayStation but i think the
strain<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:32.130> having<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.340> support<00:01:33.490> the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
strain of having that support the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.540 
strain of having that support the
playstation<00:01:35.080> 3<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.679> the<00:01:35.860> playstation<00:01:36.340> 4

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
playstation 3 and the playstation 4

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.449 
playstation 3 and the playstation 4
versions<00:01:37.030> basically<00:01:37.959> on<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.289> same<00:01:38.440> PSN<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.250> I

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
versions basically on the same PSN and I

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.059 
versions basically on the same PSN and I
realize<00:01:39.819> bungees<00:01:40.390> are<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.500> one<00:01:41.679> doing<00:01:41.979> the

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
realize bungees are the one doing the

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.249 
realize bungees are the one doing the
servers<00:01:42.520> or<00:01:42.640> whatever<00:01:42.910> but<00:01:43.119> PSN<00:01:43.630> still<00:01:43.929> has<00:01:44.110> to

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
servers or whatever but PSN still has to

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.320 
servers or whatever but PSN still has to
be<00:01:44.289> supported<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:44.920> NP<00:01:45.130> n<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.550> be<00:01:45.580> overloaded

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
be supported and NP n can be overloaded

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.440 
be supported and NP n can be overloaded
as<00:01:47.080> we<00:01:47.259> saw<00:01:47.440> with<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.770> DDoS<00:01:48.160> attacks<00:01:48.550> they

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
as we saw with the DDoS attacks they

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.630 
as we saw with the DDoS attacks they
only<00:01:49.569> have<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.840> one<00:01:50.020> data<00:01:50.259> center<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.860> so

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
only have the one data center and so

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.580 
only have the one data center and so
that's<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.149> lot<00:01:52.330> of<00:01:52.450> strain<00:01:52.720> for<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.050> single<00:01:53.380> data

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
that's a lot of strain for a single data

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
that's a lot of strain for a single data
center<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.160> we<00:01:54.369> saw<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.610> Alpha<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.390> beta
