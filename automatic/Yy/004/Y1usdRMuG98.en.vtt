 all classic mega two I'm 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.600
 okay after if I have to choose one 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:58.659
 of the two mega it's more secular this word 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:59.920
 if I like my club so much better 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.240
 to be told that my color 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.409
 favorite because I like better any case 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 of the god there is more wind that have 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.640
 viewed on youtube it's happy 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.160
 seems weird the genres is not 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.569
 less good he is nice as are also 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.780
 my early I preferred me like that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.180
 well let's say I did not enjoy fighting 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.260
 will be very useful in fact I cut you if 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.560
 how can it be good but but good 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.000
 that's when I have doubts then objects 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.819
 given he has no better double-type at 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.540
 world what 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.489
 in exchange and this time we will test 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.130
 the night of 8x 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.069
 you saw there was fighting even 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.870
 time I hope to throw to the shutter su 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.620
 by the caterpillar padar time you to mega 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.150

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.650
 print doing the test no but 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.019
 I like it so much better for me 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.500
 it's a true legendary so much the 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.500
 only the only one 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.590
 you stay in the type 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.320
 I like them too on the range 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.330
 low voltage between them I prefer the one 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.430
 there between the two minors I prefer the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:32.930
 time otherwise I clearly preferred the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:34.970
 mega evolved name I agree what 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.630
 fell miotto did in fact like 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.330
 many others many more are 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.710
 passed before you unfortunately and from 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.210
 Now suddenly we have all seen bin 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.280
 we all know we have where the people are 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.260
 never when we saw both of them 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.030
 low specimens we were going to go given 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.380
