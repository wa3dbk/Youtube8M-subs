00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.400 
in the 250 milliliter beaker on the
right<00:00:45.719> I've<00:00:46.559> dissolved<00:00:47.309> 15<00:00:48.180> grams<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:49.200> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
about 20 milliliters of hydrochloric

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.770 
about 20 milliliters of hydrochloric
acid<00:01:06.350> I'm<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.189> add<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
acid I'm now going to add the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.020 
acid I'm now going to add the
hydrochloric<00:01:09.780> acid<00:01:10.439> drop-wise<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
hydrochloric acid drop-wise to the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.219 
hydrochloric acid drop-wise to the
sodium<00:01:12.630> benzoate<00:01:13.400> solution<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.670> stirring<00:01:15.229> 1

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
sodium benzoate solution with stirring 1

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.600 
sodium benzoate solution with stirring 1
I<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.799> us<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.310> white<00:01:18.150> precipitate<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
I do with us a white precipitate of

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.840 
I do with us a white precipitate of
benzoic<00:01:20.610> acid<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:21.689> form

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.219 

so<00:01:29.420> we<00:01:29.540> can<00:01:29.810> see<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.470> precipitate<00:01:31.370> forms

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
so we can see the precipitate forms

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:59.340 
so we can see the precipitate forms
immediately

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.200 

a<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:01.450> more<00:02:01.890> hydrochloric<00:02:02.890> acid<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.670> added

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
a little more hydrochloric acid is added

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:23.309 
a little more hydrochloric acid is added
and<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.439> little<00:02:05.740> more<00:02:06.270> precipitate<00:02:07.270> forms<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
and a little more precipitate forms the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.930 
and a little more precipitate forms the
solution<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.819> starting<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.720> get<00:02:25.900> thick<00:02:26.410> with

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
solution is starting to get thick with

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.210 
solution is starting to get thick with
precipitate<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.980> still<00:02:30.430> add<00:02:31.060> more

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
precipitate I can still add more

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.550 
precipitate I can still add more
hydrochloric<00:02:33.220> acid<00:02:33.819> because<00:02:34.269> precipitate<00:02:35.260> is

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
hydrochloric acid because precipitate is

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.460 
hydrochloric acid because precipitate is
still<00:02:36.090> forming<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.569> actually

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
still forming as I do this is actually

00:02:41.470 --> 00:03:05.699 
still forming as I do this is actually
becoming<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.459> fairly<00:02:43.090> thick<00:02:44.010> slurry<00:02:45.010> here

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.539 

it<00:03:06.709> looks<00:03:07.250> like<00:03:07.579> I'm<00:03:07.939> getting<00:03:08.420> no<00:03:08.810> more

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
it looks like I'm getting no more

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.080 
it looks like I'm getting no more
precipitate<00:03:10.549> formation<00:03:11.209> by<00:03:11.959> adding

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
precipitate formation by adding

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.960 
precipitate formation by adding
hydrochloric<00:03:14.090> acid<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.680> I'm<00:03:15.890> now<00:03:16.189> ready<00:03:16.640> for

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
hydrochloric acid so I'm now ready for

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.690 
hydrochloric acid so I'm now ready for
the<00:03:17.450> next<00:03:17.480> step

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
the next step

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.869 
the next step
namely<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:20.140> vacuum<00:03:21.140> filter<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.579> can

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
namely to vacuum filter so that I can

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.830 
namely to vacuum filter so that I can
recover<00:03:23.329> my<00:03:24.040> precipitate<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.909> benzoic

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
recover my precipitate of the benzoic

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.420 
recover my precipitate of the benzoic
acid<00:03:27.549> I've<00:03:28.549> set<00:03:29.030> up<00:03:29.060> for<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.840> Hume

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
acid I've set up for that Hume

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.580 
acid I've set up for that Hume
filtration<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.640> my<00:03:31.819> vacuum<00:03:32.329> source<00:03:33.200> is

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
filtration and my vacuum source is

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.860 
filtration and my vacuum source is
turned<00:03:33.920> on<00:03:34.430> I'm<00:03:35.090> now<00:03:35.420> going<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.989> filter<00:03:36.799> off<00:03:37.040> my

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
turned on I'm now going to filter off my

00:03:37.870 --> 00:05:10.439 
turned on I'm now going to filter off my
precipitate

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.939 

I'm<00:05:10.990> going<00:05:11.379> to<00:05:11.590> stop<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:13.259> vacuum<00:05:14.259> filtration

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
I'm going to stop the vacuum filtration

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.860 
I'm going to stop the vacuum filtration
so<00:05:15.879> I<00:05:15.909> can<00:05:17.400> empty<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.580> liquid<00:05:19.150> from<00:05:19.509> the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
so I can empty the liquid from the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.969 
so I can empty the liquid from the
Erlenmeyer<00:05:20.969> vacuum<00:05:21.969> flask<00:05:22.539> and<00:05:23.139> then<00:05:23.439> I<00:05:23.499> will
