any<00:05:31.080> kid<00:05:31.350> said<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.890> is<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:34.050> clone<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.620> the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
any kid said it is the clone and the

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.100 
any kid said it is the clone and the
md-88<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.780> plain<00:05:37.230> black<00:05:37.760> with<00:05:38.760> them<00:05:39.000> no<00:05:39.840> white

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
md-88 is plain black with them no white

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.530 
md-88 is plain black with them no white
laying<00:05:40.530> around<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.950> it's<00:05:41.610> more<00:05:42.300> expensive

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
laying around it it's more expensive

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.010 
laying around it it's more expensive
obviously<00:05:43.140> and<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:45.180> quality<00:05:45.540> at<00:05:45.630> nighttime

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
obviously and the quality at nighttime

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.740 
obviously and the quality at nighttime
will<00:05:46.380> be<00:05:46.500> better<00:05:46.710> but<00:05:47.460> on<00:05:47.700> this<00:05:47.910> year<00:05:48.210> I<00:05:48.420> find

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
will be better but on this year I find

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.700 
will be better but on this year I find
it<00:05:48.870> appalling<00:05:49.170> is<00:05:49.560> far<00:05:50.100> better<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.700> daytime

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
it appalling is far better and daytime

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.530 
it appalling is far better and daytime
to<00:05:52.710> up<00:05:52.890> to<00:05:53.160> this<00:05:53.310> rather<00:05:53.640> than<00:05:53.760> the<00:05:54.030> Andy<00:05:54.300> Eric

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
to up to this rather than the Andy Eric

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.860 
to up to this rather than the Andy Eric
so<00:05:55.380> obvious<00:05:56.130> daytime<00:05:56.520> so<00:05:56.760> it's<00:05:56.940> script<00:05:57.450> for

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
so obvious daytime so it's script for

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.340 
so obvious daytime so it's script for
the<00:05:57.960> money

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
the money

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.450 
the money
and<00:05:59.510> what<00:06:00.510> else<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:00.960> NBA<00:06:01.260> has<00:06:01.620> slider<00:06:01.980> buttons

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
and what else the NBA has slider buttons

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.640 
and what else the NBA has slider buttons
so<00:06:02.940> you<00:06:03.150> put<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.540> power<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:04.020> pushing<00:06:04.440> it<00:06:04.530> up

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
so you put a power you pushing it up

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.700 
so you put a power you pushing it up
this<00:06:05.160> here<00:06:05.400> is<00:06:05.520> just<00:06:05.670> click<00:06:05.940> buttons<00:06:06.270> and<00:06:06.710> the

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
this here is just click buttons and the

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.520 
this here is just click buttons and the
ones<00:06:07.920> you<00:06:08.280> would<00:06:08.550> notice<00:06:08.790> it<00:06:08.910> most<00:06:09.420> easily<00:06:10.110> as

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
ones you would notice it most easily as

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.800 
ones you would notice it most easily as
when<00:06:11.160> you're<00:06:11.340> recording<00:06:11.790> you'll<00:06:12.540> see<00:06:12.780> a

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
when you're recording you'll see a

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.690 
when you're recording you'll see a
yellow<00:06:13.760> tip<00:06:14.760> across<00:06:15.570> the<00:06:15.750> bottom<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.640> that<00:06:17.640> is

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
yellow tip across the bottom and that is

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.620 
yellow tip across the bottom and that is
c-clone<00:06:18.390> I<00:06:18.950> just<00:06:19.950> think<00:06:20.160> of<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.490> indie<00:06:21.240> erases

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630
