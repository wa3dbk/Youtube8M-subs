00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.970
 good kids how are you doing today 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.369
 we return with the vs to see the two 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.199
 sister cousins the r pk that we have in 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.180
 batesville 4 and the truth is that I 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.680
 you surprised jce a lot the other day and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.269
 also for good because there would never be 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.280
 thought that so many would like again 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.629
 the dvs series and the truth is that I 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.829
 I was quite happy about the subject that is 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.720
 a series that we say is like 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.120
 feature of the channel and it has made me 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.920
 think about what I had to ask for forgiveness 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.809
 for taking two weeks without bringing a 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.610
 episode has come second roasted nava de 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.680
 strike many things and many novelties 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.940
 for battlefield they give me work but 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.409
 well I think that we also 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.540
 interest given in the answer they have 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.769
 had and good after all these rodeos 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.390
 finally we are going to see one of the 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.220
 comparisons that I least expected that 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.070
 they will win and more with the opponents that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.360
 they had that was the sg against the 91 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 but it really seems that many 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.049
 you wanted to see the duel of the bonuses r pk 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.729
 which are also quite similar but 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.409
 has some key features that 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.720
 I think they can make very interesting 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.250
 tves so nothing let's go to the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.930
 statistics first like 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.460
 we will always see the cadence that will be 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.560
 of six hundred rounds per minute to 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.240
 both which makes them the light ones of 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.799
 smaller caliber of all the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.600
 class just ahead of the option well 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.070
 that we can already see that his role 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.760
 will be more oriented to do these 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 conversions 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.540
 of jump said that we like so much in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.150
 the next section we will have the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.620
 recharge which will be very long 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.710
 36 seconds for short recharge and 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.330
 4.5 for the long in the case of 74 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.010
 which are in both aspects the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.230
 Longest recharge time of all 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.870
 light of its type and in addition it will have between 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.720
 quotes only 45 bullets compared to 61 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.360
 of 12 and its recharge cuts 2.4 seconds 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.940
 and of 35 for the long one making it like this 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.470
 in the fastest of the support class and 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.820
 as I told you before these two are 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.770
 geared to be the assault rifles 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.540
 Battlefield 4 light weather and how 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.950
 such will have a much smaller setback 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.050
 than that of her peers pulling more 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.750
 so good towards an assault rifle 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.050
 as a vertical recoil the 74 will have a 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.760
 0.28 for the left a 0.25 and for the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.830
 right a 0.2 that the truth is that it is 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.360
 quite low but certainly not so low 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.430
 like the one of the 12 for which the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.200
 numbers in the vertical will be 0.3 lo 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.090
 which it is a little higher but 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.700
 compensates with its horizontal recoil that 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.110
 is 0.15 to the left and 0.1 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.660
 to the right which does 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.550
 Extremely manageable however there 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.890
 an aspect that conditions this and is like 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.150
 not my dearest first retreat that 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.640
 in this case it will be 1 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.439
 for the 12th which in combination with your 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.060
 kick will make it pretty good for 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.099
 the long ones but if we really want 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.439
 make bursts we certainly want to have in 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.379
 the hands the 74 which has a 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.420
 multiplier very very low of 0 75 what 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.159
 that makes it great in bursts and 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.989
 very related to its capacity to the area 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.280
 if reaffirming the concept of rifle 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.709
 lightweight assault we have his 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.420
 precisions which are 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.189
 surprisingly good of 0.2 is to say 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.109
 in par with the precision of a rifle 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.609
 assault and also a fact in which I do not 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.709
 I usually never fix but that's where it is 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.269
 the spread increase by bullet to which in 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.829
 these two is quite less than in the 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.840
 case of the assault rifles with what 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.819
 which we can say without fear of doubt that 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.409
 they are practically assault rifles with 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.909
 a larger charger and with 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.560
 deficiencies in mobility to your 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.480
 precision moving and hip because 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.579
 of course, but what sense would they have 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.500
 an assault rifle not so nothing after 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.720
 see the comparison of those aspects more 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.670
 essential we see that both 74 and 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.650
 the 12 have 600 bullets cadence with 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.450
 which will be 11 in the next place 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.069
 will win the 12 in the aspect of the recoil 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.780
 with which the 21 is done and in the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.000
 recharge will also earn the 12 which 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.310
 makes 31 in the aspect of precision 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.140
 of course winning at 74 which makes 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.000
 the 32nd and finally in the aspect 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.100
 rank win to 74 because he has higher 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.270
 bullet speed and maximum range so 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.580
 that everything remains in a tie at three 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.350
 deliveries and of course we go to 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.900
 opinions today let's start with the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.340
 classic the rp k 74 and is that it is the most 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.959
 similar that we can cross now 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.700
 himself a kalashnikov in battlefield with 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.709
 its wooden details typical of the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.930
 classic weapons that give you a feeling 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.970
 Well, as I 'm telling you , it's a classic weapon 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.500
 difficult to match and is that I also 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 I think this was the answer from dais to 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.459
 the massive requests that they put 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.530
 an ak-47 that for more than they ask it not 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.030
 are able to probably put in 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.430
 do not betray your principles that is the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.260
 to use a weapon that is if not use 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.180
 well that has been more or less used 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.919
 by the current armies where by 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.900
 course do not enter is to take super 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.160
 classic is so they put this though 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.900
 I think it would have been a hundred times 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.780
 better put us an assault rifle like 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.580
 74 which is really what we wanted 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.710
 but we do not know what we have 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.480
 the future maybe we will have an ak-47 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.520
 before the end of battlefield 4 of 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.080
 moment we have this lcd gun 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.550
 chain a risen that by the way is taught to 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.110
 unlock in a video that I will leave you in 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.850
 the description in case you did not arrive and you know 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.100
 The truth is that for a while now 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.840
 and also as you ask me lately 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.230
 I will say the accessories that I used during 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.720
 gameplay 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.130
 and stop 74 of course I could not 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.750
 remove its only facet that is its 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.490
 long behavior with which it must 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.290
 the heavy barrel to give it more precision 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.420
 the upward kick to accentuate that 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.980
 capacity and as always my beloved laser 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.260
 that will end up with a lot of dust to be 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.090
 without moving from all my weapons and about 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.830
 the 12 then good input and I can you 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.570
 say that I think it's the prettiest of 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.610
 all 12 is this game is the most 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.500
 long magazine with more bullets and the truth 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.540
 is that I think it's good just 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.670
 pretty pretty though despite 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.470
 this as I said before is very difficult 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.360
 that nothing like the classic image of 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.610
 74 and of course be here 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.200
 pure polymer and without curves or approaching 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.080
 to capture that kalashnikov feeling of 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.150
 who enjoys the 74 also against this 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.400
 weapon is that it may seem that you're 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.470
 using simply another 12 which is a 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.880
 defect that I can give to bat end 4 and 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.680
 is that they have put several versions of the 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.240
 same weapon in different categories 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.520
 for example it is made by an assault rifle 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.320
 two carbines a semi automatic and it's what 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.060
 same thing that happens with you take a rifle 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.730
 Assault a light machine gun 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.500
 carbine a semiautomatic with which to 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.060
 Sometimes you can hate the weapon itself 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.190
 because you have used too much of the rest of 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.050
 his sisters and like that takes away him like 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.639
 charm to the game not but good at 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.009
 issue of accessories history 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.689
 the same as the 74 simply you 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.979
 change the barrel fitting to the brake 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.169
 mouth to take away a little bit of that 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.120
 vertical recession and of course leave 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.439
 the blood 'sao potato and then the slot 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.840
 optional as I always say 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.759
 filling with the laser and as a conclusion 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.800
 I can tell you like so many other times 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.840
 had to be said in this series is that 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.729
 to yield to the reason to not give the 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.800
 victory to the weapon that I really love well 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.210
 that today the duel of rr freckles wins the 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.819
 Young man is re sin, face the 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.770
 veteran rebecca 74 and good kids 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.569
 that would be all for today and I'm going to 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.039
 dismiss without first commenting on the most 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.960
 recent update that has come to 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.909
 battlefield 4 and I'm enjoying 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.469
 like a real dwarf playing my 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.479
 favorite game since it seems to me that the 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.860
 very famous net code has been greatly improved 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.629
 and it allows you to play with this kind of 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.250
 weapons that before won 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.319
 practically with any other weapon 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.969
 of the game and as always you already know how 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.229
 You must vote the following v / s must
