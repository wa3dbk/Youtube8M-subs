00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
some kind of comparison that's a 71

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.950 
some kind of comparison that's a 71
nightlight<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:40.190> see<00:01:40.430> acceptable<00:01:41.150> I'll

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
nightlight and you see acceptable I'll

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.870 
nightlight and you see acceptable I'll
turn<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.490> look<00:01:43.729> what<00:01:43.910> it<00:01:44.030> adds<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.420> do

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880

nothing here's your 7 want to light okay
use<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.760> general<00:01:53.180> area<00:01:54.100> see<00:01:55.100> how<00:01:55.840> I'll<00:01:56.840> turn

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
use the general area see how I'll turn

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.620 
use the general area see how I'll turn
off<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.619> one<00:02:00.789> now<00:02:01.789> I'm<00:02:01.970> painting<00:02:02.300> at<00:02:02.600> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
off this one now I'm painting at the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.419 
off this one now I'm painting at the
flyer<00:02:03.550> can't<00:02:04.550> see<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.970> fire<00:02:05.300> at<00:02:05.600> all<00:02:05.720> anymore

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
flyer can't see that fire at all anymore

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.770 
flyer can't see that fire at all anymore
so<00:02:07.429> there's<00:02:07.670> your<00:02:07.700> 7<00:02:08.210> watts<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.630> incandescent

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
so there's your 7 watts of incandescent

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.660 
so there's your 7 watts of incandescent
late<00:02:09.530> no<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:10.039> does<00:02:12.190> almost<00:02:13.190> nothing

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.170 

I<00:02:19.410> mean<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.500> could<00:02:20.709> be<00:02:20.860> wrong<00:02:20.980> i<00:02:21.040> might<00:02:21.580> be<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
I mean I could be wrong i might be for a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.780 
I mean I could be wrong i might be for a
while<00:02:22.360> bold<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.900> there<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.410> i<00:02:23.650> think<00:02:24.489> it's<00:02:24.640> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
while bold in there but i think it's a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.320 
while bold in there but i think it's a
seven<00:02:25.239> on<00:02:25.330> base<00:02:26.640> anyway<00:02:27.640> that's<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:28.510> nightlight

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
seven on base anyway that's a nightlight

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:40.220 
seven on base anyway that's a nightlight
this<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.050> next<00:02:32.380> thing<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.800> room<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.400> you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.870 

can<00:02:41.230> see<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.620> difference<00:02:42.540> when<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.660> found<00:02:47.880> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
can see the difference when I found and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.970 
can see the difference when I found and
then<00:02:49.060> if<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.330> turn<00:02:49.569> off<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:50.050> night<00:02:50.350> light<00:02:50.620> over

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
then if I turn off this night light over

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.800 
then if I turn off this night light over
here<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.230> how<00:02:56.350> gone<00:02:57.239> up<00:02:58.239> fridge<00:02:58.630> of

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
here you can see how gone up fridge of

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.410 
here you can see how gone up fridge of
there's<00:02:59.080> about<00:02:59.380> eight<00:03:00.370> feet<00:03:00.670> away<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.180> turn

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
there's about eight feet away if I turn

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.400 
there's about eight feet away if I turn
off<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.720> nightlight<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:04.810> was<00:03:04.930> like<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.290> was

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
off the nightlight it was like it was

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.150 
off the nightlight it was like it was
doing<00:03:05.680> nothing<00:03:06.040> at<00:03:06.190> all

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.760 

here's<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.240> thing<00:03:11.510> when<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:11.810> ran<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.320> on<00:03:12.410> 12

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
here's the thing when I ran it on 12

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.220 
here's the thing when I ran it on 12
volts<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.520> wasn't<00:03:14.030> as<00:03:14.330> bright<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:17.090> I'm<00:03:17.780> closer

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
volts I wasn't as bright so I'm closer

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.860 
volts I wasn't as bright so I'm closer
to<00:03:18.500> resonant<00:03:21.370> frequency<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.580> everything<00:03:23.120> on

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
to resonant frequency and everything on

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.860 
to resonant frequency and everything on
this<00:03:24.550> 3.7<00:03:25.550> oh<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:25.670> don't<00:03:25.850> have<00:03:26.120> an<00:03:26.270> A<00:03:26.390> me<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.750> hook

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
this 3.7 oh I don't have an A me to hook

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.160 
this 3.7 oh I don't have an A me to hook
up<00:03:27.110> did<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:28.040> when<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.220> did<00:03:28.690> was<00:03:29.690> about<00:03:29.990> two

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
up did but when I did was about two

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.040 
up did but when I did was about two
hundred<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.500> 20<00:03:30.890> milliamps<00:03:31.550> on<00:03:31.820> on<00:03:32.180> four

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
hundred and 20 milliamps on on four

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.120 
hundred and 20 milliamps on on four
holes<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.460> a<00:03:37.580> good<00:03:37.760> light<00:03:38.830> it's<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.890> very

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
holes and it's a good light it's a very

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.450 
holes and it's a good light it's a very
usable<00:03:40.730> light<00:03:44.230> that's<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:45.470> now<00:03:45.800> I'm

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
usable light that's it for now I'm

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.450 
usable light that's it for now I'm
running<00:03:46.910> on<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.860> tip<00:03:48.970> 3055<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.860> I<00:03:51.950> forget<00:03:52.310> how
