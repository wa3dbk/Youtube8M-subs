00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.989
 actress in the step and pus and could have 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.989

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.170
 I'm going to take this from 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.390
 with this hermitage that a lot of points 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.130
 even if it was automatic and that would be 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.170
 ok with a handle 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.899
 Viviane that even the good effects 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.159

 here with that I get here 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.070
 this lake like 18 and it makes union 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.010
 like stevie chin zombies is a good thing 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.610
 if you can not go to the asshole because you 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.650
 kill 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.830
 for example here they see everything what I have 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.830
 what to do 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.580
 this game is very complex 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.330
 and since you change the gun twice 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.390
 as well as this so that this mine also 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.640
 to be restored more than nothing are 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.820
 movements like that someone is right now 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.570
 I'm going to give a pistol track because 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.570
 who see points 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.480
 and good, more than anything is all this 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.480
 yes 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.670
 I already have here we are accumulated I am going to 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.670
 finish my vitality 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.900
 then together 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.819
 to make collateral and come more 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.819
 points and I already have the 4000 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.840
 I will leave trolear 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.120
 the way I grab it and if the room that 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.430
 still do not have the same amount of points 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.020
 and kill them with guns give you get 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.480
 all died for a pomegranate using it 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.450
 they are so many points and they come there I already have 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.709
 again 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.030
 let's see I'm going to win it because then 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.580
 disappears 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.800
 ready max amo ivan here is a chaos 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.800
 he did not grab us here 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.090
 what comes a lot for the opposite 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.390
 because if they're not going to get me in line 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.790
 I'm going to them but so to work the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.840
 loves between them because as they do not come in 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.690
 a very order 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.090
 right if it does not come in a super line 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.239
 Leave a lot of space, so see how 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.830
 they are joining and here if they see that 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.629
 come very close to you vayansé what 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.980
 more attached to give them space for 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.819
 the side against which here would be that 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.819
 Iran 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.080
 ashton of the boys 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.810
 I have done I usually kill if the 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.220
 I have as well as without aiming because it is 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.579
 more likely to make the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.579
 head 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.470
 I already have six thousand ok see that desmadre 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.850
 it comes 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.360
 we go pegadito to them jumped today for his 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.580
 side 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.760
 I put it back and assimilate all the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.760
 weather 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.030
 come here and I leave these trailers 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.849
 because they will serve later no longer 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.180
 they are many and per round I think they come out 24 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.180
 something like that 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.870
 I'm going to take out the other sister 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.730
 by tomás that nothing I need to open 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.470
 doors to see cheer doctoral so 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.470
 the water without and how it comes out 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.849
 these words are pinches troleros 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.479
 it's more I want a pinches cake 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.479
 slapped 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:20.149
 and I think they run on their back they go more 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.149
 slow 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.720
 these usually run fast normally 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.430
 so I'll leave it there and how do you see that 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.860
 some friends we are going to open here way 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.629
 here 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.110
 and good to see if we were some of 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:48.330
 here is the power here is activated in this 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.909
 well pincha hidden area goes beyond the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.599
 wall from here there seems to be nothing 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.280

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:01.940
