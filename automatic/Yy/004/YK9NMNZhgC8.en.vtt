actually expanded to predefined scenes
258<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.040> camera<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> big

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
258 on this camera so that is a big

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.139

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
