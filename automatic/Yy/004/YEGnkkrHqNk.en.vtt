Minecraft<00:00:06.210> population<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.140> i<00:00:07.170> think<00:00:07.440> android

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
Minecraft population so i think android

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.560

had<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.280> before<00:00:08.490> as<00:00:08.820> but<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.120> finally<00:00:09.450> now

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
had this before as but it's finally now

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.919 
had this before as but it's finally now
on<00:00:09.719> iOS<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.309> pretty<00:00:11.790> awesome<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.809> what

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
on iOS and it is pretty awesome so what

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900 
on iOS and it is pretty awesome so what
it<00:00:13.049> basically<00:00:13.200> does<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> puts<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.580> caves

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it basically does is it puts in caves

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.930 
it basically does is it puts in caves
into<00:00:15.379> basically<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.670> microkorg<00:00:17.670> edition

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
into basically a microkorg edition

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
into basically a microkorg edition
generated<00:00:18.359> world<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.230> does<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
generated world and what this does is

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.620 
generated world and what this does is
instead<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> having<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.400> download<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.880> map<00:00:21.060> this

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
instead of having to download a map this

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
instead of having to download a map this
puts<00:00:21.810> caves<00:00:22.109> into<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.340> generated

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
puts caves into you or I'm generated

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.310 
puts caves into you or I'm generated

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
world and i'm gonna doing creator just

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.660 
world and i'm gonna doing creator just

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
so i can show you some of the young

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
so i can show you some of the young
caves<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.020> need<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.770> need

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
caves but all you need to do is you need

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400 
caves but all you need to do is you need
to<00:00:40.980> create<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.700> they'll<00:00:42.480> basically<00:00:42.750> bee

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
to create it and they'll basically bee

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.459 
to create it and they'll basically bee
caves<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.700> let's<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.360> generate<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
caves in it so let's just generate it so

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.350 
caves in it so let's just generate it so
um<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.070> should<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> link<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.700> screen<00:00:48.030> right

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
um this should be a link on screen right

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.299 
um this should be a link on screen right
now<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.840> basically<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.440> i<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.190> this

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
now and basically what i think what this

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.020 
now and basically what i think what this
does<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.879> puts<00:00:51.719> mk's<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.770> um<00:00:53.010> after<00:00:53.730> as

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
does is it puts mk's in um after as

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
does is it puts mk's in um after as
january<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> world<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.559> i<00:00:56.250> don't

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
january to the world so it's i don't

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
january to the world so it's i don't
think<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.180> random<00:00:57.600> caves<00:00:57.870> instead<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.410> think

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
think it's random caves instead I think

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.520 
think it's random caves instead I think
it's<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.329> pre-made<00:01:00.329> caves<00:01:00.750> into<00:01:01.079> micro

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's just like pre-made caves into micro

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
it's just like pre-made caves into micro
kitchen<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:02.309> been<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> lot<00:01:02.640> more<00:01:02.699> um

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
kitchen this has been a lot more um

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
kitchen this has been a lot more um
terrain<00:01:03.600> generation<00:01:03.719> mods<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.830> like

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
terrain generation mods and it's like

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.830 
terrain generation mods and it's like
really<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.549> good<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.299> there's<00:01:06.450> also<00:01:06.540> flat

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
really really good so there's also flat

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.030 
really really good so there's also flat
worlds<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.260> stuff<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> might<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.860> show

caves basically stairs to start the game
and<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:30.150> back<00:01:30.299> into<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> world<00:01:30.750> which<00:01:30.900> made<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and go back into the world which made so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.140 
and go back into the world which made so
then<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.579> load<00:01:32.670> two<00:01:32.729> chunks

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
then it's just going to load two chunks

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
then it's just going to load two chunks
again<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.130> caves

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
again and as you see there are now caves

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.399 
again and as you see there are now caves
over<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.000> ace<00:01:36.540> quite<00:01:36.900> glitchy<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
over there I'm ace quite glitchy so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
over there I'm ace quite glitchy so
there's<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> lighting<00:01:38.070> glitch<00:01:38.250> right<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.700> so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
there's a lighting glitch right here so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
there's a lighting glitch right here so
I'm<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.630> place<00:01:39.869> torch<00:01:40.259> down<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
I'm just gonna go place torch down and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
I'm just gonna go place torch down and
see<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.070> fixes<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> um<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.570> basically<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
see if that fixes it um so basically it

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
see if that fixes it um so basically it
creates<00:01:43.470> these<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.799> massive<00:01:44.189> holes<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.579> not

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
creates these like massive holes I'm not

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
creates these like massive holes I'm not
big<00:01:44.909> fan<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.390> holes<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.470> believe

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
big fan of these holes but I do believe

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.850 
big fan of these holes but I do believe
there's<00:01:47.159> caves<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:47.880> woods<00:01:48.180> um<00:01:48.420> as<00:01:49.229> well<00:01:49.740> as

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
there's caves down woods um as well as

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.810 
there's caves down woods um as well as
stuff<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.310> doesn't<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:50.579> work

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
stuff for this it doesn't actually work

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.060 
stuff for this it doesn't actually work
on<00:01:50.970> sand<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.570> some<00:01:51.720> reason<00:01:52.079> believed<00:01:52.439> us<00:01:52.590> TNT

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
on sand for some reason believed us TNT

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.410 
on sand for some reason believed us TNT
sometimes<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.119> might<00:01:54.390> be

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
sometimes so thing that we might be

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
sometimes so thing that we might be
connected<00:01:54.720> pecially<00:01:55.470> there's<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.740> this

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
connected pecially there's like this

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
connected pecially there's like this
dips<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> ground<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:57.990> caves<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
dips in the ground and there are caves I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.950 
dips in the ground and there are caves I
further<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.189> into<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> ground<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.540> i'm<00:02:00.840> not

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
further down into the ground but i'm not

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.569 
further down into the ground but i'm not
really<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.259> huge<00:02:01.439> fan<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.920> huge<00:02:02.310> like

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
caves near thing and as you see this

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.440 
caves near thing and as you see this
massive<00:02:04.649> glitch<00:02:04.950> back<00:02:05.250> happens<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.329> just

massive glitch back happens so if I just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.809 
massive glitch back happens so if I just
break<00:02:06.540> block<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.170> 68<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.680> relights<00:02:08.160> but

game with caves and have some caves
generated<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.240> then<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:16.960> one<00:02:17.200> way<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.380> do

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
generated in then this is one way to do

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.560 
generated in then this is one way to do
I<00:02:17.650> would<00:02:18.010> say<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.460> as<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.150> see<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.330> does

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
I would say and as you can see it does

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.960 
I would say and as you can see it does
it<00:02:19.780> does<00:02:20.050> also<00:02:20.230> work<00:02:20.530> underwater<00:02:21.100> by<00:02:21.520> crazies

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
it does also work underwater by crazies

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.140 
it does also work underwater by crazies
massive<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.510> caverns<00:02:23.380> under<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.800> water

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
massive like caverns under the water

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.610 
massive like caverns under the water
just<00:02:25.150> go<00:02:25.240> down<00:02:25.420> here<00:02:25.630> as<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:25.900> see<00:02:25.990> some<00:02:26.590> of

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
just go down here as you can see some of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.020 
just go down here as you can see some of
the<00:02:26.740> waters<00:02:27.070> been<00:02:27.160> cleared<00:02:27.490> away<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.940> it's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
the waters been cleared away and it's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.550 
the waters been cleared away and it's
just<00:02:28.150> floating<00:02:28.300> specific<00:02:28.810> glitching<00:02:29.260> in<00:02:29.320> some

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
just floating specific glitching in some

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.310 
just floating specific glitching in some
places<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.700> dig<00:02:30.940> down<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.630> will<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:32.200> able

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
places if you dig down you will be able

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.440 
places if you dig down you will be able
to<00:02:32.470> find<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:33.130> um<00:02:33.370> caves<00:02:33.730> under<00:02:34.180> deep

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
to find like um caves under deep

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.420 
to find like um caves under deep
underground<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.170> found<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.860> few<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.130> i<00:02:36.190> can

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
underground I found a few so i can

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.120 
underground I found a few so i can
confirm<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.790> i'm<00:02:37.180> very<00:02:37.240> sure<00:02:37.750> um<00:02:37.960> but<00:02:38.860> I'm

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
confirm this i'm very sure um but I'm

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.730 
confirm this i'm very sure um but I'm
let's<00:02:39.850> just<00:02:39.940> see<00:02:40.240> if<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.390> can<00:02:40.540> find<00:02:40.750> any<00:02:40.990> I'm<00:02:41.500> so

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
let's just see if I can find any I'm so

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.350 
let's just see if I can find any I'm so
hopefully<00:02:42.070> Jay<00:02:42.250> burn<00:02:42.430> hartson<00:02:42.970> will

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
hopefully Jay burn hartson will

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.300 
hopefully Jay burn hartson will
hopefully<00:02:43.600> bring<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.380> caves<00:02:44.650> some<00:02:44.980> point

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
hopefully bring in caves some point

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.640 
hopefully bring in caves some point
however<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.209> just<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.810> quick<00:02:47.350> fix

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
however this is just like a quick fix

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.650 
however this is just like a quick fix
for<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.400> but<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.790> quite<00:02:48.940> literally<00:02:49.420> still
