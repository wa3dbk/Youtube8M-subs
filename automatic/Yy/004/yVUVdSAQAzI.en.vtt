the large fan with the blue LED so here

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.640 
the large fan with the blue LED so here
we<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.610> mess<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:14.000> cables<00:02:14.380> here<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.530> also

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
we have the mess of cables here we also

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.500 
we have the mess of cables here we also
have<00:02:15.830> screws<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.489> map<00:02:16.610> those<00:02:16.760> into<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.030> case

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.420 

so<00:02:20.510> here<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.320> whole<00:02:21.590> bunch<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.280> cables

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
so here we have a whole bunch of cables

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.949 
so here we have a whole bunch of cables
coming<00:02:22.760> out<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.060> power<00:02:23.239> supply<00:02:23.450> which<00:02:23.810> is

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
coming out of the power supply which is

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.790 
coming out of the power supply which is
expected<00:02:25.510> now<00:02:26.510> I'm<00:02:27.230> not<00:02:27.380> going<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.560> go<00:02:27.650> through

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
expected now I'm not going to go through

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.170 
expected now I'm not going to go through
all<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:27.950> these<00:02:28.100> but<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.400> do<00:02:28.520> have<00:02:28.640> some<00:02:28.820> molex

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
all of these but we do have some molex

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.660 
all of these but we do have some molex
cables<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.440> power<00:02:31.340> for<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
cables this is the power for the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.920 
cables this is the power for the
motherboard<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:34.250> pin<00:02:34.489> cables<00:02:34.940> SATA<00:02:35.510> power

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
motherboard for pin cables SATA power

motherboard for pin cables SATA power
cables<00:02:37.030> looks<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.180> some<00:02:38.299> power<00:02:38.480> cables<00:02:38.930> for

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
cables looks like some power cables for

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.729 
cables looks like some power cables for
various<00:02:39.670> floppy<00:02:40.670> drives<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.299> whatnot<00:02:41.630> so

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
various floppy drives and whatnot so

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.810 
various floppy drives and whatnot so
plenty<00:02:42.739> of<00:02:42.860> connections<00:02:43.310> for<00:02:43.459> everything

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820

that you have taking a closer look at
the<00:02:46.700> power<00:02:46.820> supply<00:02:47.090> itself<00:02:48.459> looks<00:02:49.459> very<00:02:49.730> nice

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
the power supply itself looks very nice

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.509 
the power supply itself looks very nice
it's<00:02:50.209> nice<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.510> shiny<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.100> camera<00:02:52.310> right

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519
