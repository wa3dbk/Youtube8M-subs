00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.869 
and it's not that big of a deal and the
other<00:02:07.200> paper<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.799> took<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.489> guess<00:02:08.670> was

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
other paper that I took off I guess was

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.780 
other paper that I took off I guess was
the<00:02:08.910> instruction<00:02:09.599> booklet<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.670> got

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the instruction booklet or you got

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.309 
the instruction booklet or you got
basically<00:02:12.239> telling<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> controls<00:02:13.140> right

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
basically telling you the controls right

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.870 
basically telling you the controls right
there

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
there

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.660 
there
nothing<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.540> just<00:02:14.960> one<00:02:15.470> simple<00:02:15.770> page<00:02:16.160> if

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
nothing to it just one simple page if

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.820 
nothing to it just one simple page if
you<00:02:16.910> could<00:02:17.090> call<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.450> page<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.840> guess<00:02:18.050> so

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
you could call it a page I guess so

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.140 
you could call it a page I guess so
that's<00:02:18.980> then<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.340> also<00:02:19.460> get<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> registration

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
that's then you also get a registration

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.090 
that's then you also get a registration
