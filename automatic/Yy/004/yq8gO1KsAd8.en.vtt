00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello who are you what are you always doing 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.100
 still frank riemann 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.360
 we have just renovated we have ourselves 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.639
 met for one and a half years 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.650
 There was the first interview we had 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.940
 at that time the easycard presented for the first time 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.280
 in the big circle had moved moving 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.130
 months behind us and I have to say so 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.410
 very slowly we see land in 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.060
 very good 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.710
 So you should not blame us 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.540
 will be strong then we let run 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.399
 get you as you say yes will be supplemented 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.899
 me for the second time like such a 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.609
 since then, one and a half years have passed 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.719
 lasting red what is the idea of ​​a 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.289
 somehow innovative and fresh 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.390
 Well, that's the end of the day 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.100
 as with any start up probably make 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.460
 Of course, I can only speak for us 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.109
 I have such a concept first shaped 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.300
 we were ridiculed then we would 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.550
 ignored and now most catch 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.899
 and want to work with us 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.360
 So we all have highs and 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.800
 Deep through we had stress first 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.630
 with insurance companies the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.290
 concept did not get it 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.869
 We wanted to have one for the first 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.250
 in march last year also capital 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.079
 external worried about the crowd 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.700
 Finance has the record 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.759
 set up at that time that one 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.509
 100,000 euro in one minute and ne 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 nonsense in 87 minutes then had and 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.810
 Nice experiences that you almost us 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.700
 spying has narrow and say 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.960
 also copied that copying me 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.979
 Actually I'm so interested 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.500
 We are interested in the art and 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.320
 wise how that was done but 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.509
 We also noticed that we are investors 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.070
 can always inspire because of the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.140
 concept and the simplicity of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.850
 concept 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.350
 but at the end of the day the investors 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.759
 is really wanted and the whole thing 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.350
 topic because you have no insurance 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.049
 I find it from the affinity 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.090
 logically, although brilliant would be synonymous 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.240
 like to invest but only then say 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.140
 I need ironic winter cold 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.159
 so it is very important that you are yourself 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.299
 really taken such a rib 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.060
 probably many start ups in 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.200
 items or complete with take 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.410
 would you crowdfunding startups as 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.760
 recommend alternative to investors 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 In any case, cracking points 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.650
 Indeed 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.250
 This is also known in the end 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.930
 Look match industry if you have others 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.450
 investors on board then get the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.430
 then give in to capital 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.769
 Of course they are very reluctant to see that 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.200
 that you almost silent participations with 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.700
 140 140 companies that are the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.870
 at the end of the day if you are your teacher 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.160
 there is already life to hell 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.299
 Okay, people out there can do that 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.140
 and me, of course, always one 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.700
 also for little scandals 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.750
 interest here and there, he says 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.250
 maybe once a sentence on the topic 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.500
 copycat what was so the background as 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.150
 that was the background was created 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.510
 we were there we had there as well 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.370
 our first interview at the end of 2011 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.930
 Of course we have some 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.510
 talked about incubators 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.660
 for us at the end of the day then anyway 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.630
 already too far were one of the incubators 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.140
 then we did not invest one that did not 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.329
 I wanted to and could say one 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.940
 removed known recommended the out 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.560
 the industry is coming if we too 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.930
 actually rated very positively 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.489
 ask timerman then have it and it 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.180
 my guess the man claim 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.850
 initially actually targeted 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.739
 was introduced in parenthesis to the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.480
 system that we have to get to know 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.049
 and copy and contacts to 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.480
 to get 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.980
 He has another one then 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.269
 hired from us and then have 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.130
 I think so in september / october 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.420
 to found copycat 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.920
 So with the nightmare everyone has reasons 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.680
 or idea is part with investors then 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.569
 yes that could happen if you 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.340
 if you have a good concept that honors 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.870
 Of course the concept will be good as well 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.380
 We felt the Chinese know 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.239
 copy 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.799
 So just have fun on copying 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.599
 but is simply a homage to 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.010
 the master if you want so you 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.230
 can actually be proud of that 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.260
 but it was copied again the 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.120
 Just answer what 's in now 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
 the next moment phase for you 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.760
 I can imagine that a big one 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.859
 board coinsurance what is 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.079
 Actually, how are you doing before that 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.060
 thick board is it it has been me 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.160
 I did not receive a request from 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.709
 a middle insurance ours 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.060
 system as white label solution 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.739
 want that the second solution is then 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.340
 already the second the second company 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.460
 have we would like to have 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.620
 meanwhile contracts with the worldwide 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.090
 largest insurance broker closed 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.530
 for us the contracts with the 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.750
 insurance is negotiated so speak 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.150
 we now have a contact person there 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.680
 which are also active worldwide 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.630
 Of course we have the same 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.569
 access to other markets so we are 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.139
 just intense with poland to go on so too 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.819
 say we have a one big one 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.110
 Big deal just in the preparations 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:56.990
 with one with a company that over 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.729
 working in stationary operated cards 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.550
 So you can say quiet 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.229
 the company is called content card die 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.570
 are relatively familiar we want in the 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.430
 stationary trade with we go in 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.440
 will soon be a very one 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.710
 refined facebook application out 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.409
 rather bring to the middle end more than 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.330
 So we are late 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.419
 on the right track even if we still have 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.740
 of course not the capital now 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.050
 that we would wish for 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.610
 but it is indeed one of the day for us 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.860
 too and says that's great too 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.360
 So trace say you thought for sure how 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.449
 looked a bit too rosy and 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.039
 hagen well what means days it is one 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.659
 hard time so I do not do it 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.880
 hero we have we have we have 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.409
 partly not known where we where 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 We will make the money for the next appointment 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.610
 but you have to be clear 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.830
 see but by some measures the 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.719
 we are in september / october 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.159
 we are we are now 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.409
 well on the way so our self in 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.310
 increased dramatically 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.880
 logically not reveal what we 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.409
 copycat we have made 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.750
 We will have reasonable income 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:03.139
 Two three contracts in the pipeline 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:08.440
 So red was not rosy but what 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.440
 do you play okay thank you many like
