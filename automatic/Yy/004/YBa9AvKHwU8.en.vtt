00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
at one time in a live stream that would

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
at one time in a live stream that would
be<00:01:06.659> absolutely<00:01:07.140> amazing<00:01:08.130> um<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> I've<00:01:10.950> been

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
be absolutely amazing um so I've been

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
be absolutely amazing um so I've been
usually<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> program<00:01:12.030> called<00:01:12.299> xsplit

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
usually a program called xsplit

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.520 
usually a program called xsplit
broadcaster<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> before<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> used<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.200> flash

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
broadcaster and before I used a flash

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
broadcaster and before I used a flash
media<00:01:16.770> encoder<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.580> whenever<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.390> moved

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
media encoder and it whenever you moved

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
media encoder and it whenever you moved
it<00:01:19.140> would<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.500> pixely<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> stayed

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it would go up pixely but if you stayed

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.780 
it would go up pixely but if you stayed
still<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.720> would<00:01:21.960> stay<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.290> perfect<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
still it would stay like perfect like a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.270 
still it would stay like perfect like a
really<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.420> quality<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.500> i<00:01:25.530> switched<00:01:25.830> over

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
really good quality so i switched over

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
really good quality so i switched over
to<00:01:26.310> xsplit<00:01:26.880> broadcaster<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> looks

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
to xsplit broadcaster and it looks

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.340 
to xsplit broadcaster and it looks
absolutely<00:01:28.259> amazing<00:01:29.390> i<00:01:30.390> lowered<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.930> quality

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
absolutely amazing i lowered the quality

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
absolutely amazing i lowered the quality
a<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.590> after<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.950> got<00:01:32.220> dropped<00:01:32.610> sometimes<00:01:33.210> for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
a bit after I got dropped sometimes for

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
a bit after I got dropped sometimes for
going<00:01:33.750> offline<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.619> looks<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:34.920> i'm<00:01:35.220> not

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
getting dropped anymore which is a good

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
getting dropped anymore which is a good
sign<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> good<00:01:37.740> sign<00:01:38.329> um<00:01:40.310> yeah<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.820> you

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
they had none of that but battlefield EA

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.490 
they had none of that but battlefield EA
seems<00:05:35.390> like<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:35.750> cool<00:05:36.020> developer<00:05:36.620> they<00:05:37.430> are

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
seems like a cool developer they are

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.530 
seems like a cool developer they are
keeping<00:05:39.500> it<00:05:39.740> really<00:05:39.860> cool<00:05:40.160> with<00:05:40.580> battlefield

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
keeping it really cool with battlefield

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.660 
keeping it really cool with battlefield
and<00:05:41.990> just<00:05:42.140> letting<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.530> community<00:05:42.650> see<00:05:43.310> what

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
and just letting the community see what

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.090 
and just letting the community see what
they<00:05:43.790> want<00:05:43.970> to<00:05:44.030> see<00:05:44.560> there's<00:05:45.560> throwing<00:05:45.890> us<00:05:45.980> a

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
they want to see there's throwing us a

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.250 
they want to see there's throwing us a

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
lot of stuff to look at and I think

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.420 
lot of stuff to look at and I think
that's<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.590> way<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:48.740> go<00:05:48.980> if<00:05:49.100> you're<00:05:49.220> going<00:05:49.280> to

that's the way to go if you're going to

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.400 
that's the way to go if you're going to
release<00:05:49.670> a<00:05:49.730> game<00:05:50.030> you<00:05:50.630> want<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:50.990> show<00:05:51.230> the
