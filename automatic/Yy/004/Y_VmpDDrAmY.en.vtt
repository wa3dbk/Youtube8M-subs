00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
somewhat you guys know how my setup is I

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.930 
somewhat you guys know how my setup is I
got<00:00:03.570> done<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.560> big<00:00:04.740> three<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.250> got<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.730> power

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
got done the big three I got the power

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.360 
got done the big three I got the power
wire<00:00:06.210> coming<00:00:06.569> from<00:00:06.660> my<00:00:07.010> alternator<00:00:08.010> going

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
wire coming from my alternator going

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.209 
wire coming from my alternator going
shaking<00:00:08.820> my<00:00:08.940> positive<00:00:09.480> terminal<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.230> got<00:00:10.920> my

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
shaking my positive terminal I got my

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.879 
shaking my positive terminal I got my
ground<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.750> lot<00:00:12.900> instead<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.290> coming<00:00:13.620> from

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
ground it's a lot instead of coming from

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.670 
ground it's a lot instead of coming from
usually<00:00:14.790> it'll<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.389> alternator<00:00:16.289> ground

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
usually it'll be the alternator ground

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.400 
usually it'll be the alternator ground
go<00:00:17.190> into<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> body<00:00:17.760> frame<00:00:18.180> ground<00:00:18.570> but

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
go into the body frame ground but

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
go into the body frame ground but
instead<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.710> used<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.740> AC<00:00:22.920> compressor

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
instead I used the AC compressor

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
instead I used the AC compressor
hopefully<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.480> think<00:00:24.869> that's<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> same<00:00:25.350> ground

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
hopefully I think that's the same ground

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
hopefully I think that's the same ground
it<00:00:25.830> connects<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> engine<00:00:26.220> block<00:00:26.730> down<00:00:27.060> there

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it connects the engine block down there

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.080 
it connects the engine block down there
beside<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.140> everything<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.670> used<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
beside and everything so it just used it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.959 
beside and everything so it just used it
connect<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> straight<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.380> mine<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.969> my

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
connect it straight to mine and my

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.209 
connect it straight to mine and my
ground<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:33.420> frame<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.170> don't<00:00:34.739> mind<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
ground on my frame and don't mind that

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
ground on my frame and don't mind that
red<00:00:35.730> piece<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.570> there

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
red piece right there

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.780 
red piece right there
I<00:00:37.079> know<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.500> red<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.040> ain't<00:00:38.219> positive

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I know it's red but it ain't positive

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.119 
I know it's red but it ain't positive
it's<00:00:39.239> definitely<00:00:39.450> negative<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.920> see

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it's definitely negative if you see

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.770 
it's definitely negative if you see
right<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.730> much<00:00:42.059> stock<00:00:42.420> ground

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
right here this is much stock ground

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.180 
right here this is much stock ground
that's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.739> four<00:00:43.980> gauge<00:00:45.110> aftermarket<00:00:46.110> ground<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that's a four gauge aftermarket ground I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.830 
that's a four gauge aftermarket ground I
did<00:00:48.140> let's<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.440> into<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> body<00:00:49.920> ground

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
did let's all go into the body ground

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.180 
did let's all go into the body ground
