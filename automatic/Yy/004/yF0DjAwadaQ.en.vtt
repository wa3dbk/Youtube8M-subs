okay<00:00:00.780> so<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:00.960> guess<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.469> common<00:00:01.890> problem<00:00:02.190> for

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
okay so I guess a common problem for

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.769 
okay so I guess a common problem for
these<00:00:02.550> 4.6<00:00:03.389> liter<00:00:03.600> v8<00:00:03.799> Mustangs<00:00:05.569> you<00:00:06.569> get<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
these 4.6 liter v8 Mustangs you get a

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.750 
these 4.6 liter v8 Mustangs you get a
chicken<00:00:07.140> check<00:00:07.680> engine<00:00:07.919> light<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.639> a

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
chicken check engine light and it's a

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120 
chicken check engine light and it's a
misfire<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.269> one<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.630> your<00:00:09.690> cylinders<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.889> my

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
case it was a misfire in cylinder number

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.980 
case it was a misfire in cylinder number
two<00:00:13.759> which<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.790> back<00:00:15.480> right<00:00:15.690> down<00:00:15.900> over<00:00:16.440> here

and then on your driver side it'll be

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.950 
and then on your driver side it'll be
five<00:00:32.239> six<00:00:33.469> seven<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.590> eight<00:00:34.820> now<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.750> course

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
five six seven and eight now of course

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
five six seven and eight now of course
you<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> start<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> cheapest<00:00:38.160> part

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you want to start with the cheapest part

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.110 
you want to start with the cheapest part
first<00:00:38.930> check<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.200> spark<00:00:41.070> plug<00:00:41.340> that's<00:00:41.910> what

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
first check your spark plug that's what

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.040 
first check your spark plug that's what
I<00:00:42.180> did<00:00:42.420> my<00:00:42.450> spark<00:00:42.899> plug<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.260> fine<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.989> was

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
I did my spark plug was fine it was

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
I did my spark plug was fine it was
cylinder<00:00:46.590> two<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.070> we'll<00:00:47.250> work<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.910> side

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
cylinder two but we'll work on this side

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560 
cylinder two but we'll work on this side
since<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.510> easier<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
since it's easier to see so all you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
since it's easier to see so all you
would<00:00:51.719> need<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> remove<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> coil

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
would need to do is remove the coil

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.560 
would need to do is remove the coil
packs<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:54.030> engines<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.649> have

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
packs now these engines they don't have

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
packs now these engines they don't have
spark<00:00:57.570> plug<00:00:57.780> wires<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.320> majority<00:00:58.859> vehicles

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
spark plug wires like majority vehicles

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
spark plug wires like majority vehicles
do<00:00:59.430> its<00:00:59.879> power<00:01:00.239> source<00:01:00.510> comes<00:01:00.899> from<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.920> coil

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
do its power source comes from the coil

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.000 
do its power source comes from the coil
pack<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.149> connected<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.830> with<00:01:04.830> these

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
pack and it's connected with with these

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
pack and it's connected with with these
wires<00:01:05.250> right<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.600> coil<00:01:06.900> packs

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
wires right here now these coil packs

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
wires right here now these coil packs
have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.409> quick<00:01:07.710> disconnect<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.150> guess<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.689> won't

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
have a quick disconnect I guess we won't

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.469 
have a quick disconnect I guess we won't
call<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.580> push<00:01:11.790> underneath<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
call you just push underneath that

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.160 
call you just push underneath that
little<00:01:12.720> clip<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.830> pull<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.610> off

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
little clip and they pull right off

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.490 
little clip and they pull right off
they're<00:01:16.170> being<00:01:16.409> held<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.500> seven

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
they're being held down with a seven

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.190 
they're being held down with a seven
millimeter<00:01:19.680> bolt<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.020> them

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
millimeter bolt just one on all of them

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.330 
millimeter bolt just one on all of them
and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.400> remove<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.540> bolt<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.350> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and you just remove this bolt and this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
and you just remove this bolt and this
coil<00:01:26.580> pack<00:01:26.850> comes<00:01:27.090> right<00:01:27.330> out

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
coil pack comes right out

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
coil pack comes right out
now<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> coil<00:01:28.439> pack<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.040> gives<00:01:29.280> your

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
now the coil pack is what gives your

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.719 
now the coil pack is what gives your
spark<00:01:29.820> plug<00:01:30.030> gets<00:01:30.210> sparked<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> did

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
spark plug gets sparked so what I did

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.630 
spark plug gets sparked so what I did
was<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.240> went<00:01:33.990> down<00:01:34.200> no<00:01:34.380> Riley's<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:34.979> me<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> coil

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
was I went down no Riley's got me a coil

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.249 
was I went down no Riley's got me a coil
pack<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:37.250> $66.00<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.790> placed<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> that's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
pack for $66.00 we placed it and that's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.429 
pack for $66.00 we placed it and that's
all<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> yeah<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> save

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
all it was so yeah if you want to save

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
all it was so yeah if you want to save
some<00:01:43.470> time<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.189> money<00:01:44.360> before<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
some time and money before you take it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.929 
some time and money before you take it
to<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.899> mechanic<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.590> charge<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> $60<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
to a mechanic and they charge you $60 to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.929 
to a mechanic and they charge you $60 to
just<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.159> tried<00:01:50.159> looking<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
just look at it I tried looking at that

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.960 
just look at it I tried looking at that
first<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.600> remember<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:53.250> spark<00:01:53.520> plugs<00:01:53.579> need

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
first I remember these spark plugs need

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.709 
first I remember these spark plugs need
to<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.119> gapped<00:01:54.570> at<00:01:54.869> point<00:01:55.649> zero<00:01:56.280> five<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.240> two

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
to be gapped at point zero five to two

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.920 
to be gapped at point zero five to two
point<00:01:58.110> zero<00:01:58.350> five<00:01:59.130> six<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.820> put<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:00.689> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
point zero five six I put it right in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.959 
point zero five six I put it right in
the<00:02:00.990> middle<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.409> point<00:02:01.740> zero<00:02:02.130> five<00:02:02.430> four<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the middle at point zero five four and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.410 
the middle at point zero five four and
if<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.520> sounds<00:02:05.549> questionable

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
if you know if that sounds questionable

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
if you know if that sounds questionable
because<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.110> kind<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.469> big<00:02:07.680> gap<00:02:07.910> just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
because that's kind of a big gap just
