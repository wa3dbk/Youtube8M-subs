00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.039
 and so hi to all his friends this is the 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.480
 lot common hold me for me 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.039
 it's great and today we are 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.680
 found for unpacking the gopro 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.750
 hero this is the new camera input of 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.460
 brand range so we're all going from 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.949
 continued started talking about packaging 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.540
 which is well done but who is when 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.790
 not even so successful is beautiful 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.150
 than that of his big sisters so 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.550
 then we have a leaflet first 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.170
 first steps with go pro then by the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.199
 following we have three stickers from 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.689
 mark your progress here we see 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.820
 everywhere and then a notice 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:01.180
 tutorial two fixing accessories 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.850
 sticking a flat rounded a box 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.670
 back unsealed a usb cable and for 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.520
 finish the gopro herself which is 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.200
 integrated directly into its housing the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.210
 gopro offers three video modes 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.210
 the first to shoot in 1080p 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.890
 at 30 or 25 fps the second we 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 make up 720p view at 60 or 50 fps and the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.940
 third allows us to have the shave 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.810
 on previous view so insulting me 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.510
 ie from 720p to 62 50 fps more 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.360
 she uses the h 264 formats and creates 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.310
 files in point mp4 the number of 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.680
 advanced modes on this camera are only 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.260
 not huge but still present more 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.229
 that we have the super master spot 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.479
 view as well as quick capture level 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.520
 photo she is not bad but she 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.950
 is not excellent either 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.200
 that she will not give us the quality 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.970
 of a DSLR or smartphone top of 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.830
 range but here's what allow us to 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.260
 take pictures to his own 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.960
 quickly since it has 5 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.060
 megapixels and that burst capture can 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.409
 reach 5 frames per second this 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.490
 who is really not bad me died at 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.110
 bottom that its 3.7 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.970
 it can also be used to 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.220
 to accelerate the rapid movement 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.830
 since it has a catch mode 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.439
 pictures at intervals of 0 5 seconds 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.140
 optical side it incorporates a lens 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.760
 in glass with a focal of 2008 which him 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.310
 allows to have a good quality in the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.470
 night also from a wide angle that can 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.020
 so capture 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.190
 a large field of vision around mud 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.090
 battery level it integrates a 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.970
 mile 180 million lithium battery 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 eur pair running under premieres of 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.640
 New York 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.320
 to finish to save all your 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.770
 movies and photos you will have to bring yourself 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.430
 a class 10 microsd card or the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.430
 hsv 1 is of maximum 32 gigas of 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.770
 storage so the 64 is useless that you 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.630
 will not come back on it as a conclusion I 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.670
 think level level price quality it 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.500
 there is no better for now with the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.420
 remaining camera qualities to the water 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.209
 very easy to use with good 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.370
 autonomy nor quality worthy a guÃ¨ye of 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.709
 videos worthy of courses and go home 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.510
 irreproachable finish make it is 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.200
 very good despite the lack of adjustment 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.390
 the lack of wifi screen as well as the fact 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.970
 that it is not removable from its hull 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.660
 but hey we have nothing without anything you 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.340
 say and if we want more we pay on 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.870
 only friend I hope this video has you 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.480
 more if it is the case do not hesitate to 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.560
 to share as much as possible and I 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.250
 see you soon for new ones 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.450
 videos 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.450
 this ethologist worse
