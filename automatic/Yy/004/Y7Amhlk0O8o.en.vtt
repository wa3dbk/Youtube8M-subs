through<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.150> this<00:01:57.330> pedal<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.900> sweep<00:01:58.260> of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
through with this pedal and the sweep of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.980 
through with this pedal and the sweep of
the<00:01:58.920> tone<00:01:59.160> control<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.760> a<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> little<00:02:00.780> bit

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the tone control is a is a little bit

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.120 
the tone control is a is a little bit
more<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.619> wider<00:02:01.860> sweep<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.830> main

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
more of a wider sweep and the main

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.139 
more of a wider sweep and the main
change<00:02:05.640> though<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.540> regular<00:02:06.990> hoof<00:02:07.200> had

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
change though is the regular hoof had

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.090 
change though is the regular hoof had
germanium<00:02:09.149> transistors<00:02:09.780> which<00:02:10.350> can<00:02:10.740> be<00:02:11.070> a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
germanium transistors which can be a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.920 
germanium transistors which can be a
little<00:02:11.340> bit<00:02:11.459> more<00:02:11.580> finicky<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.390> terms<00:02:12.720> of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
little bit more finicky in terms of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.420 
little bit more finicky in terms of
temperature<00:02:13.410> change<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.959> with<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.980> pedal

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
temperature change and with this pedal

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
temperature change and with this pedal
they've<00:02:17.610> removed<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.120> germanium

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
they've removed the germanium

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.570 
they've removed the germanium
transistors<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.320> added<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.890> specially

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
transistors and added for specially

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.180 
transistors and added for specially
selected<00:02:20.760> silicon<00:02:21.510> transistors<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.800> more

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
selected silicon transistors for a more

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.570 
selected silicon transistors for a more
stable<00:02:23.959> tone<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.290> sound<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> just<00:02:26.340> really

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
stable tone and sound and it just really

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.449 
stable tone and sound and it just really
has<00:02:26.700> all<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.180> goodness<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.810> want<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:29.220> a

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
has all the goodness that you want in a

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.520 
has all the goodness that you want in a
great<00:02:29.730> fuzz<00:02:29.970> pedal<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.200> control<00:02:31.500> is

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
great fuzz pedal and so the control is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
great fuzz pedal and so the control is
very<00:02:31.769> easily<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.519> tone<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:33.030> have<00:02:33.209> level

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
very easily we have tone we have level

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.479 
very easily we have tone we have level
we<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.320> amount<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.680> fuzz<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.250> then<00:02:35.400> we

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
we have the amount of fuzz and then we

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.009 
we have the amount of fuzz and then we
have<00:02:35.610> shift<00:02:35.910> control<00:02:36.300> which<00:02:36.480> controls<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
have shift control which controls the

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.930 
have shift control which controls the
kind<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.410> mid<00:02:37.650> content<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.640> go<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
kind of mid content so as we go to the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.060 
kind of mid content so as we go to the
left<00:02:39.150> its<00:02:39.660> scooped<00:02:39.959> mids<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
left its scooped mids as we go to the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.400 
left its scooped mids as we go to the
right<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:41.519> boosted<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.080> what<00:02:43.200> I'm<00:02:43.290> going

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
right it's boosted and so what I'm going

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.080 
right it's boosted and so what I'm going
to<00:02:43.440> do<00:02:43.560> now<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.830> I'm<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.040> turn<00:02:44.220> both<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
to do now is I'm going to turn both the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.540 
to do now is I'm going to turn both the
tone<00:02:45.300> control<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.800> shift<00:02:47.130> control

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
tone control and the shift control

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.780 
tone control and the shift control
because<00:02:48.360> they're<00:02:48.480> both<00:02:48.630> kind<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.019> EQ<00:02:49.590> controls

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
because they're both kind of EQ controls

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.890 
because they're both kind of EQ controls
to<00:02:50.790> twelve<00:02:51.030> o'clock<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.570> will<00:02:51.750> let<00:02:51.840> you

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
to twelve o'clock and I will let you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.350 
to twelve o'clock and I will let you
listen<00:02:52.140> again<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.709> we<00:02:53.250> will<00:02:53.489> go<00:02:53.670> through<00:02:53.940> some

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
listen again and we will go through some

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:57.649 
listen again and we will go through some
of<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> ranges<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.930> both<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.350> those<00:02:55.440> knobs

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.360 

so<00:03:58.659> that's<00:03:58.870> quite<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.260> range<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.769> the<00:04:00.069> shift

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
so that's quite a range in the shift

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.160 
so that's quite a range in the shift
controller<00:04:00.760> bring<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.150> back<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:01.390> 12<00:04:02.079> o'clock

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
controller bring that back to 12 o'clock

00:04:02.170 --> 00:05:46.190 
controller bring that back to 12 o'clock
and<00:04:02.590> I'll<00:04:03.489> let<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:03.879> listen<00:04:04.030> again

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.560 

so<00:05:47.200> there<00:05:47.560> is<00:05:47.740> some<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.520> range<00:05:48.760> of<00:05:49.000> the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
so there is some of the range of the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.870 
so there is some of the range of the
tone<00:05:49.840> control<00:05:50.169> and<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:51.220> shift<00:05:51.490> control<00:05:51.850> I

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
tone control and the shift control I

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.420 
tone control and the shift control I

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
kind of really like the shift with it

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.390 
kind of really like the shift with it
about<00:05:54.790> here<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:56.110> tone<00:05:56.440> just<00:05:56.889> backed<00:05:57.190> off

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
about here and the tone just backed off

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.060 
about here and the tone just backed off
just<00:05:57.940> a<00:05:58.090> touch<00:05:58.360> it's<00:05:59.020> where<00:05:59.230> I<00:05:59.260> like<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.830> I<00:05:59.919> want
