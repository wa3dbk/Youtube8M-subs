00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello to you again this is a wonderful 2d 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:08.160
 and we start 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.100
 I recently started preparing for the special issue 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.739
 have 2d 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 developing it will take some time and 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.399
 most likely it will consist of 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.370
 several parts also like a story 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.170
 series of games shinobi doom and what you see 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.449
 special issue I would like to talk about 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.100
 one of the favorite games of childhood which 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.979
 personally brought me a lot of positive 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.390
 emotions and it will even be a few 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.520
 information release 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.649
 how much little narrative is mine 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.180
 Getting to know this game is a jackie game 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.050
 chan's action kung fu 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.080
 was released by hudson soft 1990 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.970
 year on pristavkin with but naturally 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.300
 it came into my hands that year 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.190
 ninety-eighth or 99 on one of 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.020
 disassembled cartridges on which black 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.690
 marker and careless handwriting was 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.220
 written jackie chan got with you 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.100
 actually with a bunch of others of the same 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.080
 a variety of cartridges and jack I even 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.850
 I did not immediately start as in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.830
 time any thrash with hieroglyphs in 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.440
 the title could among the yard boy 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.509
 be called whatever you like 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.310
 even remotely resembled an actor or 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.310
 film 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.369
 so what is there I remember as a game sign 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.220
 safflower my brother and I gave the name of the escape 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.799
 from the camp on the general played and the rest 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.399
 games and one evening it came to 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.280
 jackie 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.319
 at night say the hall feast game hour before 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.420
 two nights good that at the time I live 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.750
 lived in a separate room and according to the ancestors cap 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.670
 for it did not get the most amazing 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.860
 for me then was the fact that the game 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.660
 really called jackie chan 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.640
 but on this my surprise is not 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.489
 all ended intuitively in the game 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.160
 understandable and plot 2 evil sorcerer steals 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.260
 girlfriend jackie and gameplay was 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.630
 well balanced she was 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.250
 both simple and complex and not 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.940
 caused no negative emotions 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.040
 related to losing but separately also 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.170
 worth noting musical accompaniment 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.750
 as the music in the game is simply unique 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.830
 even now the best tracks from the game 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.830
 nostalgia is bursting 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.310
 In general, I passed the game in my childhood and 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.130
 actually forgot about it 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.459
 but with the advent of internet emulators and 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.700
 decided to find her again and this game surprised 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.980
 I once again turns out to be Jackie Chan 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.470
 not just 8 bits per n. game about 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.780
 Jacks were available in 16 bit format 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.000
 and it was not sega or super 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.750
 nintendo unknown turbo 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.730
 graphics 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.959
 and I began to understand what 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.959
 This version was different 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.350
 this game came out a year later than the original 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.510
 sleep area graph is better yes and jackie himself 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.120
 was really similar to himself caricature but 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.490
 still like yes the gameplay is nothing 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.710
 did not differ much at all 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.630
 to the naked eye it was almost noticeable 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.730
 not possible it was that rare case 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.340
 when the game when transferring to another 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.470
 the platform won in quality that is 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.540
 all left in its original form only 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.090
 slightly improved graphics and enhanced 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.680
 quality of music 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.930
 principle, we still have the same level 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.060
 only different placement of objects with 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.430
 the same enemies really hit some 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.130
 of them changed before the game became a bit 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.590
 more difficult due to the fact that the enemies have become 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.010
 more living but somehow drastically 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.530
 nothing has changed though worth noting 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.540
 adding two mini bosses in the fourth 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.230
 and the fifth levels of which were not in 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.230
 original game 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.900
 16-bit jackie chan's action consul 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.280
 traversed in the same breath as the original 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.860
 and leave a bunch of positive emotions in 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.320
 the result was very pleased with the boss of 16 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.920
 bit version as well as radiant music and 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.880
 as always i got a lot of fun 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.340
 I advise anyone who is not familiar with this 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.860
 play a game of her act of acquaintance 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.460
 us version play and 16-bit port you 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.460
 you will not regret 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.640
 Well, that's probably all for everyone 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.190
