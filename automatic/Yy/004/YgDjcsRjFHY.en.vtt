00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.560

 Well, I take my pot here as well 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.970
 First I will cut the onions 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.360
 and the princely heads began and 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.160

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 let's go now I just stand this 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.540
 Onion here is doing very well with this 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.880
 knife because the blade is just right 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.580
 simply kept shape is one of those 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.700
 right blade to work i say 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.700
 times 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.040
 well so you are already brown so i have 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.450
 pull the cream still poured 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.440

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.230
 Cut in the garlic and me 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.540
 something happens cream next to it here 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.280
 the earth is falling in the snow now 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.280
 I'll try some ice cream here 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.560

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.680

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.049
 So in winter you can get here 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.870

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.260
 Well, I taste the time off whether the salt 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.629

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.319
 for the whole then in the cup fills 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.060
 then water again and cook 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.019
 the spaetzle 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.019
 yes, then it is already so far 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.850
 so I used the noodles poured off 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:31.840
 spätzle and now I just go my 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.290
 add sauce again here 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.669
 in and then try it somehow 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.970
 evenly stir the sauce 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.010

 Spaetzle also something for cream sauce again 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:53.710
 record and then at the end 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:05:03.480
 then come cheese-making and that's it 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:03.480
