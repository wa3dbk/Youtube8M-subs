00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
just think about this research forum

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.000 
just think about this research forum
before<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.850> start<00:00:21.150> lifting<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:22.830> say

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
before you start lifting I would say

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.220 
before you start lifting I would say
even<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:23.880> i<00:00:23.910> say<00:00:24.269> research<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.869> formula

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
even at all i say research the formula

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.500 
even at all i say research the formula
lift<00:00:25.410> before<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.830> execute<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:27.150> minimize

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
lift before you execute it to minimize

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.080 
lift before you execute it to minimize
the<00:00:27.720> risk<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.019> injury<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.279> maximize<00:00:29.460> your

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the risk of injury and to maximize your

sensitive and if I hit it against
something<00:02:21.090> no<00:02:21.900> matter<00:02:22.050> how<00:02:22.290> lightly<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.830> hurts

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
something no matter how lightly it hurts

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.820 
something no matter how lightly it hurts
really<00:02:23.400> badly<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.320> know<00:02:25.410> I'm<00:02:25.560> trying<00:02:25.740> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
really badly so you know I'm trying to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.620 
really badly so you know I'm trying to
research<00:02:26.100> alternatives<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.940> preacher<00:02:27.210> curls

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
research alternatives to preacher curls

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.370 
research alternatives to preacher curls
so<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.020> fix<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:31.290> just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
so that I can fix that and that's just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.530 
so that I can fix that and that's just
an<00:02:31.620> example<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:32.070> something<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.240> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
an example of something that you know I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.150 
an example of something that you know I
really<00:02:34.200> couldn't<00:02:34.440> avoid<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:35.040> I'm

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
really couldn't avoid it because I'm

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.400 
really couldn't avoid it because I'm
performing<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.730> lift<00:02:35.940> right<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
performing the lift right it's just that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
performing the lift right it's just that
for<00:02:38.190> some<00:02:38.430> reason<00:02:38.460> my<00:02:38.850> body<00:02:39.090> doesn't<00:02:39.390> sync

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
for some reason my body doesn't sync

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.290 
for some reason my body doesn't sync
with<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> don't<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.380> why<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.150> we

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
with it I don't know why but you know we

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.170 
with it I don't know why but you know we
all<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.570> things<00:02:42.750> like<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.030> can

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
all have things like that but if you can

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.630 
all have things like that but if you can
help<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.570> make<00:02:46.200> sure<00:02:46.230> your<00:02:46.830> form<00:02:47.130> does<00:02:47.490> not

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
help it make sure your form does not

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.220 
help it make sure your form does not
deteriorate<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.810> don't<00:02:48.990> injure

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
deteriorate and you don't injure

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.740 
deteriorate and you don't injure
yourself<00:02:49.370> for<00:02:50.370> example<00:02:50.790> when<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.360> was<00:02:51.570> dead

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
yourself for example when I was dead

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.250 
yourself for example when I was dead
lifting<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:53.450> think<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> first<00:02:54.960> time<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
lifting I think it was the first time I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.080 
lifting I think it was the first time I
dead<00:02:55.440> lifted<00:02:55.800> three<00:02:56.220> plates<00:02:56.490> for<00:02:56.700> three<00:02:56.850> sets

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
dead lifted three plates for three sets

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.670 
dead lifted three plates for three sets
of<00:02:57.180> five<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.960> footage<00:02:58.200> it'll<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.620> in

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
of five I have the footage it'll be in

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.340 
of five I have the footage it'll be in
the<00:02:58.740> transformation<00:02:59.340> video<00:03:00.110> my<00:03:01.110> very<00:03:01.260> first

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the transformation video my very first

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.990 
the transformation video my very first
time<00:03:01.680> deadlifting<00:03:02.220> three<00:03:02.430> plates<00:03:02.670> for<00:03:02.850> three

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
time deadlifting three plates for three

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.660 
time deadlifting three plates for three
sets<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.300> five<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.890> afterwards<00:03:04.890> immediately

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
sets of five I afterwards immediately

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.060 
sets of five I afterwards immediately
afterwards<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.420> had<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:06.840> weird<00:03:07.320> pain<00:03:07.710> in<00:03:07.920> my

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
afterwards I had this weird pain in my

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.340 
afterwards I had this weird pain in my
left<00:03:08.310> trap<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.420> wasn't<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.810> right<00:03:09.930> one

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
left trap and it wasn't in my right one

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.710 
left trap and it wasn't in my right one
so<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.040> watched<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.820> footage<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:12.330> luckily

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so I watched the footage because luckily

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.140 
so I watched the footage because luckily
I<00:03:12.870> filmed<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:14.070> realized<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:14.940> some

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
I filmed it and I realized that for some

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.810 
I filmed it and I realized that for some
reason<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:16.020> right<00:03:16.350> side<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.800> bar<00:03:17.010> was

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
reason the right side of the bar was

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.729 
reason the right side of the bar was
lower<00:03:18.090> than<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.390> left<00:03:18.630> when<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.080> pulled<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:19.560> on

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
lower than the left when I pulled up on

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.370 
lower than the left when I pulled up on
my<00:03:19.890> last<00:03:20.100> few<00:03:20.370> reps<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.720> realized<00:03:22.200> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
my last few reps and so I realized that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.250 
my last few reps and so I realized that
I<00:03:22.500> guess<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.100> was<00:03:23.459> over<00:03:23.700> compensating<00:03:24.360> for

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
I guess I was over compensating for

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.940 
I guess I was over compensating for
something<00:03:26.690> lack<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.870> pulling<00:03:28.170> strength<00:03:28.650> maybe

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
something lack of pulling strength maybe

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.250 
something lack of pulling strength maybe
it<00:03:29.100> was<00:03:29.190> my<00:03:29.310> posterior<00:03:29.670> chain<00:03:30.030> was<00:03:30.209> lacking<00:03:30.450> by

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
it was my posterior chain was lacking by

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.600 
it was my posterior chain was lacking by
even<00:03:31.739> shrugging<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.310> little<00:03:32.520> bit<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.530> luckily<00:03:35.250> I

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
even shrugging a little bit so luckily I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.250 
even shrugging a little bit so luckily I
think<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.060> caught<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.630> fixed<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.989> but

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
think I caught that and fixed it but

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.710 
think I caught that and fixed it but
it's<00:03:38.130> very<00:03:38.280> important<00:03:38.760> guys<00:03:38.910> check<00:03:39.360> yourself

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
it's very important guys check yourself

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.440 
it's very important guys check yourself
before<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.200> wreck<00:03:40.290> yourself<00:03:41.360> actually<00:03:42.360> you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
before you wreck yourself actually you
