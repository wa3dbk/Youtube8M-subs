 very good and yes guys and finally 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.260
 we are in version 5.1.1 that just 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.260
 leave right now 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.880
 Well and clearly it sees what has 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.950
 past have greatly improved the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.810
 graphics as you can see here by 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.119
 example this ship before you could not see anything 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.980
 now you see a lot you see everything 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.790
 perfectly here the systems judge 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.790
 we are both talking 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.570
 well this is blocked that 's what the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.220
 only problem that there is right now and 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.700
 good the rest is everything is enough 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.700
 all right 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.019
 to see the ships 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.409
 sometimes the gifts are the same 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.409
 we were and here in particular there 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.309
 for shield we did not buy it two and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.329
 then with two others that are 7 and the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.329
 8 what are these here 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.530
 and then also 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.299
 It seemed to me that no no no no vale vale 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.080
 what I want to look at sometimes have 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.850
 corrected where 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.850
 I rolled to see if it comes out not in color 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.409
 and they know what they would be like before 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.760
 Now go good, let's try 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.620
 see these we're going this 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.530
 let's see how much detail it has 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.530
 Now the detail has improved a lot 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.320
 this one side 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.930
 Let's see 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.930
 to see this as it is now 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.630
