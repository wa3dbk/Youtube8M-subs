00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.139
 hi to all and wilshere c6 naxos then 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.579
 you surely understood it with the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.129
 video title today I'm going 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.230
 show you how to emerge from the map 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.550
 turn 10 beats with a technique a lot 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.980
 simpler to achieve 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 you will see it very quickly so your 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.179
 friend is going to have to lie down at the edge of a 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.949
 window at this specific point of the map 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.359
 so he puts himself well first you go 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.130
 get on it and you're going to have to 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.140
 and do a kind of stratagem 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.750
 to be able to reach this platform 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.730
 so jump behind English is so 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.199
 reach this famous platform so 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.910
 already the glitch is well started you the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.070
 see texture bugs from everywhere 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.460
 but it does not stop there you go 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.079
 have to take your micro drones and the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.210
 put in the in the corner as I the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.699
 are currently doing in the video for 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.100
 to be able to start a series of short 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.420
 scales and so his short scales 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.129
 that will allow you and well 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.859
 to reach the roofs of the map and so 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.780
 can come out at the end of this map 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.370
 so you slowly started 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.380
 short scales and you need 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.790
 to be that of two people 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.630
 are enough to be able to do these 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.300
 famous short scale 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.040
 it's a bit complicated but it's 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.150
 feasible 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.530
 so you know how it works 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.640
 short scale system you go up 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.710
 on the head of your teammate 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.270
 he will stand up he will jump you 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.950
 go jump one same time on his head 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 to get on the second spot 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.100
 once you are on the second spot 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.020
 just take a microphone right 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.660
 to stick it against the wall and redo 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.090
 again a short scale for 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.070
 able to finalize the glitch and so 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.260
 reach the roofs of the map 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.870
 so that's a technique I find 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.700
 much easier than previous ones 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.380
 because the pressantes was really 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.660
 complicated to realize 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.490
 this one is frankly accessible to 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.740
 all 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.850
 this is it so I hope that that of 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.440
 game will have pleased you if that's the case 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.880
 do not hesitate to like commented share 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.910

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.020
 extremely pleasure know that as soon 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.640

 battlefield community on the chain 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.750
 communal 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.840
 you have the trailer on my channel too 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.060
 it would really make me very happy to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.190
