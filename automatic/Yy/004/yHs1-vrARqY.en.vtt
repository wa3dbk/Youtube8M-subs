foolproof what we have going on here
then<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.620> means<00:03:52.800> we<00:03:52.950> just<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> problem

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
then that means we just have a problem

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.610 
then that means we just have a problem
with<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.240> system<00:03:54.540> we<00:03:54.870> have<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.020> problem<00:03:55.320> with

with the system we have a problem with

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.830 
with the system we have a problem with
this<00:03:55.770> period<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.300> more<00:03:57.480> reason

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
this period and it's just more reason

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.210 
this period and it's just more reason
that<00:03:57.960> we<00:03:58.050> should<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.320> moving<00:03:58.470> away<00:03:58.710> from<00:03:58.890> it

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
that we should be moving away from it

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.640 
that we should be moving away from it
without<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.450> strictest<00:04:00.900> oversight<00:04:01.440> these

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
without the strictest oversight these

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.430 
without the strictest oversight these
companies<00:04:02.070> are<00:04:02.100> gonna<00:04:02.280> cut<00:04:02.520> corners<00:04:02.940> uh<00:04:03.540> every

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
companies are gonna cut corners uh every

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.560 
companies are gonna cut corners uh every
possible<00:04:04.920> way<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.670> this<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.270> not<00:04:06.420> going

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
possible way so this this is not going

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.720 
possible way so this this is not going

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
to end no question about it uh let's

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.150 
to end no question about it uh let's
