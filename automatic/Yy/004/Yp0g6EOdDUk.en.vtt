actually<00:00:31.800> before<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:33.300> big<00:00:33.450> fan

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
actually before I was a really big fan

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.810 
actually before I was a really big fan
of<00:00:33.840> Android<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.010> hadn't<00:00:35.700> sent<00:00:36.120> some<00:00:36.420> Daleks<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
of Android I hadn't sent some Daleks and

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.570 
of Android I hadn't sent some Daleks and
I<00:00:38.820> never<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.660> liked<00:00:40.080> iPhones<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.310> just

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
I never really liked iPhones I just

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.150 
I never really liked iPhones I just
thought<00:00:41.760> they<00:00:41.970> were<00:00:42.000> too<00:00:42.630> small<00:00:42.990> for<00:00:43.230> me<00:00:43.380> but

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
thought they were too small for me but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.370 
thought they were too small for me but
then<00:00:44.460> when<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.910> heard<00:00:45.210> about<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.600> iPhone<00:00:46.050> 6

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
then when I heard about the iPhone 6

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.400 
then when I heard about the iPhone 6
then<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.400> was<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.910> actually<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.960> bigger

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
then it was going actually to be bigger

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.890 
then it was going actually to be bigger
than<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:50.190> iPhone<00:00:50.570> 5s

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
than the iPhone 5s

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.610 
than the iPhone 5s
I<00:00:51.930> was<00:00:52.740> really<00:00:53.610> excited<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.620> wow

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
I was really excited I was like wow

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.850 
I was really excited I was like wow
maybe<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:57.090> get<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> iPhone<00:00:57.540> 6<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.620> it's

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
maybe I would get the iPhone 6 if it's

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.730 
maybe I would get the iPhone 6 if it's
big<00:00:59.190> enough<00:00:59.220> for<00:00:59.880> me<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.240> then<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:01.230> went<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.560> the

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740

Birds<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.400> yes<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.330> think<00:02:17.660> that's<00:02:18.319> all<00:02:18.620> here

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
Birds and yes I think that's all here

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.780 
Birds and yes I think that's all here
then<00:02:19.430> next<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.360> yotube<00:02:20.989> battery<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.520> one

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
then next I have yotube battery this one

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.490 
then next I have yotube battery this one
is<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.709> battery<00:02:24.709> doctor<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.239> basically<00:02:26.930> this

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
is the battery doctor so basically this

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.030 
is the battery doctor so basically this
will<00:02:27.739> help<00:02:28.069> save<00:02:28.640> battery<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:30.230> your<00:02:30.319> cellphone

will help save battery in your cellphone
but<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.430> don't<00:02:31.670> think<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.120> really<00:02:32.390> works<00:02:32.780> so

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
but I don't think this really works so

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.830 
but I don't think this really works so
well<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.190> don't<00:02:34.519> recommend<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.570> download

is one of my favorites I am not sure if
you<00:04:10.990> have<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.380> pay<00:04:11.740> for<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:12.370> app<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:13.600> even<00:04:13.900> if

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
you have to pay for this app but even if

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.630 
you have to pay for this app but even if
you<00:04:14.110> have<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.470> pay<00:04:14.650> for<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.190> think<00:04:15.280> it's

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
you have to pay for it I think it's

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.150 
you have to pay for it I think it's
worth<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.330> because<00:04:17.080> they<00:04:17.530> have<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:17.980> many

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
worth it because they have so many

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.610 
worth it because they have so many
