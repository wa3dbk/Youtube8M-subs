00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
cover my entire head so a lot of the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100 
cover my entire head so a lot of the
times<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.920> have<00:00:57.490> to<00:00:57.760> turn<00:00:58.750> into<00:00:58.990> a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110

times I have to turn into a
contortionist<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.070> twist<00:01:00.400> all<00:01:00.610> kinds<00:01:01.030> of

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
contortionist and twist all kinds of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.109 
contortionist and twist all kinds of
ways<00:01:01.240> to<00:01:01.480> get<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:03.310> steam<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.850> get<00:01:03.940> all

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
ways to get the the steam to get all

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.940 
ways to get the the steam to get all
over<00:01:04.210> my<00:01:04.390> head<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.869> hood<00:01:05.350> them<00:01:05.560> fit<00:01:05.800> all

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
over my head and the hood them fit all

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.590 
over my head and the hood them fit all
over<00:01:06.100> our<00:01:06.250> head<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:06.580> just<00:01:06.850> kind<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.120> I'm

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
over our head so I just kind of I'm

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.450 
over our head so I just kind of I'm
never<00:01:07.900> really<00:01:08.080> enthused<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.830> go<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.310> sit

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
never really enthused to go and sit

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.820 
never really enthused to go and sit
under<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:09.940> also<00:01:10.420> have<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> hooded<00:01:11.200> dryer<00:01:11.370> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
under it I also have a hooded dryer that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.380 
under it I also have a hooded dryer that
it's<00:01:14.830> kind<00:01:15.010> of<00:01:15.040> big<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.430> clunky<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.880> it's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
it's kind of big and clunky and it's

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.960 
it's kind of big and clunky and it's
usually<00:01:16.900> stored<00:01:17.230> away<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.710> so<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.550> just

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
usually stored away and so I just

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.520 
usually stored away and so I just
sometimes<00:01:19.270> it's<00:01:19.600> on<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.870> move<00:01:20.050> to<00:01:20.200> go<00:01:20.350> check

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
sometimes it's on the move to go check

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.350 
sometimes it's on the move to go check
it<00:01:20.650> out<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.160> I<00:01:21.370> feel<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:21.880> this<00:01:22.000> would<00:01:22.180> be<00:01:22.330> a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
it out and I feel that this would be a

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.910 
it out and I feel that this would be a
good<00:01:22.690> option

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
good option

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.280 
good option
it<00:01:24.130> says<00:01:24.370> grateful<00:01:24.880> conditioning<00:01:25.510> treatments

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
it says grateful conditioning treatments

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.410 
it says grateful conditioning treatments
and<00:01:27.010> you're<00:01:27.250> supposed<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.670> be<00:01:27.820> able<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.150> wash

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
and you're supposed to be able to wash

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.090 
and you're supposed to be able to wash
it<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.370> all<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.850> good<00:01:31.030> stuff<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.710> comes<00:01:32.890> in

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
it and all that good stuff it comes in

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.790 
it and all that good stuff it comes in
this<00:01:33.190> little<00:01:33.250> bad<00:01:33.700> for<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:35.050> instructions<00:01:35.830> and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
this little bad for the instructions and

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.250 
this little bad for the instructions and
you<00:01:38.800> know<00:01:38.890> open<00:01:39.159> in<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.340> fight<00:01:39.550> line<00:01:39.730> camp

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
you know open in the fight line camp

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.120 
you know open in the fight line camp
well

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
well

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.420 
well
and<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.729> comes<00:01:42.909> with<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.180> hose<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.340> the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
and so it comes with a hose this is the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.280 
and so it comes with a hose this is the
father<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.850> attach<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.180> your<00:01:46.479> blow-dry<00:01:46.960> has<00:01:47.259> a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
father you attach to your blow-dry has a

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.890 
father you attach to your blow-dry has a
little<00:01:47.759> plastic<00:01:49.799> plastic<00:01:50.970> elastic<00:01:51.970> in<00:01:52.570> here

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
little plastic plastic elastic in here

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.469 
little plastic plastic elastic in here
and<00:01:53.500> then<00:01:53.650> there<00:01:53.920> are<00:01:53.950> some<00:01:56.850> what's<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.030> okay

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
and then there are some what's this okay

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.510 
and then there are some what's this okay
I<00:01:58.690> guess<00:01:59.049> these<00:01:59.290> are<00:01:59.350> some<00:01:59.680> booms<00:02:00.009> for<00:02:00.340> like

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
I guess these are some booms for like

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.550 
I guess these are some booms for like
the<00:02:00.610> case<00:02:01.229> distribution<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:04.229> got<00:02:05.229> my<00:02:05.350> blow

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
the case distribution so I got my blow

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.240 
the case distribution so I got my blow
dryer<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.310> I'm<00:02:06.759> just<00:02:06.940> going<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.530> attach<00:02:08.530> this

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
dryer and I'm just going to attach this

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.830 
dryer and I'm just going to attach this
end<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.050> blow<00:02:11.200> dryer<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.480> let's<00:02:13.480> see<00:02:13.720> what

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
end to the blow dryer and let's see what

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.580 
end to the blow dryer and let's see what
this<00:02:13.989> does

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
this does

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.570 
this does
and<00:02:15.190> then<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.489> guess<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:15.970> supposed<00:02:16.360> to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and then I guess you just supposed to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:27.690 
and then I guess you just supposed to

and<00:03:07.760> what<00:03:07.910> they<00:03:08.060> were<00:03:08.120> like<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.390> string

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.960 

believe<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.959> heat<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.739> evenly<00:03:18.010> distributed

believe the heat is evenly distributed

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.460 
believe the heat is evenly distributed
that<00:03:19.920> kind<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.420> mile<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.659> an<00:03:22.840> ability<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.290> a

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
that kind of mile and an ability that a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.830 
that kind of mile and an ability that a
piece<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.830> evening

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
piece of evening

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.150 
piece of evening
I<00:03:25.900> can<00:03:26.140> feel<00:03:26.379> you<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.650> back<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.430> front

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.100 

on<00:03:32.820> what<00:03:33.030> burn<00:03:33.470> me<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.830> attempting<00:03:35.460> to

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110
