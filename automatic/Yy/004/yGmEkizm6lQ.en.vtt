00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:20.680
 hello dear friends continue today 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:24.270
 topic of answers to your questions and there is one 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.759
 a question that probably deserves 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.610
 a separate series and now even his 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.800
 read out 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.350
 he would have seemed pretty 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.079
 trite but really pretty 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.000
 look tells a 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.149
 the phrase as a tea master 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.120
 it's like this exercise is just not 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.870
 understand what you need to go through to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 that there is such an order should come and 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.530
 here's a question 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.010
 Mask that the concept of tea master 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.030
 in in china tea master us russia they 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 differ slightly and so in china there is 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.190
 this is a clear terminology what is 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.570
 sticking too it moo gave ears it can 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.090
 be teacher accordingly in 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.189
 institute in some sort of kids 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.040
 can be bones private 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.329
 Lecturer tea thing to that is, 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.680
 any just recognized 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.590
 tea specialist or maybe just 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.240
 granddaughter master yes and so on maybe 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.810
 can u called just bowl 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.979
 that is, tea literally tea teacher 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.310
 or tea to teach tea to teach 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.770
 there are also degrees say desperate 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.720
 funds that are issued official 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.090
 by some graduates let's say 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.670
 agencies yes authorized 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.670
 until which you manage there 20 min there pin 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.190
 the bowl the bowl and so on that is it like 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.920
 let's say in china a common phenomenon 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.420
 in china tea culture let's say so long ago 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.729
 long ago there is absolutely official 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.489
 approved and the concept of tea master 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.650
 here's a graduate and so 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.540
 Further here on the second house in parallel with 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.040
 by this there is and just understand and tea 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.280
 the master who most likely got accustomed to the colors 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.760
 our country because we donâ€™t have both 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.790
 such generally recognized such random 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.519
 there are such schools 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.840
 graduated and or there may be 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.450
 which is live tomato transfer 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.480
 some Chinese institutions which 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.090
 may declare that here we are doing 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.540
 tea masters and set tea mode 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.410
 master 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.360
 let's say it is a concept rather purely well 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.120
 image yes that is, if there is any 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.769
 an organization that can say that 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.900
 here we are doing there if there is any 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.060
 public recognition of the organization 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.410
 maybe this is the case with Russia there 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.720
 there is the Tea School 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.390
 some old tea clubs there we are 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.060
 also do the shadows of the school of god and so on 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.060
 that is, it is such a phenomenon 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.680
 haul the tea master is something more than 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.050
 just some paper that man 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.910
 got some organization 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.900
 that is, it is a person who is just 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.530
 should after shouting here is the title of master 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.019
 he may rather not get himself so 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.760
 calling from people who are using this tea 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.299
 brewed who believes that the person 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.760
 really has some say so 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.810
 there is a riot he died there is an understanding that 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.400
 This tea is there is the ability to make tea 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.930
 so that it is noticeable that 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.569
 really master that is and skill 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.579
 brew good tea and tell well 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.340
 about tea and generally understand what it is 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.900
 that is, it may not be easy 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.629
 superficially some sort of knowledge there varieties 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.420
 tea or is there the name of the dishes there and so 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.280
 further it is a little not that of course too 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.379
 you need to know for sure, but this is rude 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.599
 speaking first grade school and all 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:10.000
 the rest that's why the skill she doesn't 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.030
 in copying some knowledge she's 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.150
 ability to express individuality through me 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.229
 I would say so, that is why many 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.160
 truly recognized masters they 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.630
 invented the whale their ways of brewing 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.840
 created their schools then there are some 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.220
 ideas that is more often any knowledge she is 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.110
 as it is accumulating some 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
 the knowledge of the past is coming together 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.910
 reworked through their experience and 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.510
 giving birth to their accounting do not necessarily have to 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.730
 differ a lot 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.350
 1 what was the same I can do the opposite 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.850
 very different and many 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.520
 contemporaries this can be perceived 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.170
 yes he is there at all what he does it in 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.160
 there is such a book there that says so 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.080
 it is impossible how is it not skill 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.810
 here he breaks there he brews 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.050
 without anything serious . terrible nightmare 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.430
 so it is possible that is, as it were, some things 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.600
 they just come 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.000
 whether or not your leaves are included 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.790
 understanding of mastery as you accumulate 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.490
 experience and you like doing that to me 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.710
 on 1 don't like when some masters 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.810
 here are new up start talking about 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.920
 that this is the only way 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.930
 an error which is called at all in 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.080
 tea environment is not only a tea room and this 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.480
 in any possible in any subculture this 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.980
 can manifest itself but how easy does it take 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.350
 the man will start saying that here I am 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.970
 invented and this is the most correct because 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.070
 that I came up with it seems to me here 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.270
 me there detaining me in this my 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.920
 the invention 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.880
 so this is the thing about this one 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.170
 terrible what could be 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.670
 impose doing not too like 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.680
 watch plans to do what you like 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.780
 feel 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.250
 maybe someone to consult listen 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.530
 Do other people's advice is not to listen to others' advice 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.410
 this is the main thing for everyone 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.790
 imposing anything is the most important thing in 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:08.950
 this 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:11.440
 of skill so thought it worth it 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:16.840
 so funny in general ending 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:19.440
 the question as to whether or not if 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.910
 performs if it gives some 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.310
 positive emotions where the joy of life 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.330
 type new impressions new acquaintances 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.980
 of course it's worth why not but can't 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.990
 be a straightforward recipe how to get through 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.420
 that is, now he took me 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.910
 I will go here this slide there or he chair or 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.400
 from swimming it sea and i came i became 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.130
 very much her mother does not happen that is 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.040
 of course everyone has his own way of course 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.170
 each their own some comprehension each 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.330
 put your concept into this for 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.640
 someone tea skill this skill 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.740
 it's good to trade tea for someone tea 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.940
 mastery is his skill cool 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.850
 brew and something about it 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.220
 telling for someone together and for 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.250
 somebody's just a show on somebody's 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.450
 just not something like that 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.590
 spiritualized esoteric there and so 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.590
 further here and 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:13.730
 it's good that everyone has their own leaf 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:17.020
 it is to appreciate love develop and bring 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:20.090
 others especially if you are happy about them 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.690
 perhaps probably all I wish pleasant 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:33.220
 tea party 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:33.220
 and to new meetings excellent chief
