00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
have to do is I put it in reverse and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.130 
have to do is I put it in reverse and
you'll<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.320> second<00:00:49.920> delay<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
you'll see just a second delay here and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.350 
you'll see just a second delay here and
the<00:00:52.140> camera<00:00:52.559> will<00:00:53.190> pull<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.610> show<00:00:54.120> everything

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the camera will pull up show everything

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
the camera will pull up show everything
behind<00:00:54.780> me<00:00:55.520> take<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> reverse<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.920> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
behind me take it out of reverse and it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.959 
behind me take it out of reverse and it
goes<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.370> to<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> main<00:01:01.170> screen<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:02.489> this

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
goes back to the main screen now this

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.810 
goes back to the main screen now this
was<00:01:03.629> only<00:01:03.809> possible<00:01:03.899> due<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.369> tweak<00:01:07.820> from

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
was only possible due to a tweak from

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
there and those two things right there

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.969 
there and those two things right there
are<00:01:41.439> what<00:01:41.590> allows<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:43.030> webcam<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.979> function

on/off<00:01:46.679> like<00:01:47.679> it<00:01:47.799> does<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.789> you<00:01:48.850> may<00:01:49.240> be

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
on/off like it does so you may be

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.050 
on/off like it does so you may be
thinking<00:01:49.539> okay<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:49.990> how<00:01:50.679> does<00:01:50.739> the<00:01:51.640> webcam

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
know when to put the vehicle in Reverse

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.080 
know when to put the vehicle in Reverse
well<00:01:56.250> awesome<00:01:57.250> pictures<00:01:57.789> I'll<00:01:57.909> show<00:01:58.060> later

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
well awesome pictures I'll show later

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.919 
well awesome pictures I'll show later
but<00:01:58.509> basically<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.959> used<00:01:59.679> a<00:02:00.119> long<00:02:01.119> USB

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
but basically I used a long USB

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.190 
but basically I used a long USB
extension<00:02:02.319> and<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:03.579> cut<00:02:03.880> into<00:02:04.030> either<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:04.810> red

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
extension and I cut into either the red

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.400 
extension and I cut into either the red
power<00:02:05.380> wire<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.369> used<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.729> relay<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.810> taps

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
power wire and it used a relay that taps

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.289 
power wire and it used a relay that taps
into<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.640> positive<00:02:10.319> brake<00:02:11.319> light<00:02:11.760> wire<00:02:12.760> so

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
into the positive brake light wire so

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.900 
into the positive brake light wire so
when<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:14.769> put<00:02:14.920> your<00:02:14.950> vehicle<00:02:15.250> reverse<00:02:15.519> brake

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
when you put your vehicle reverse brake

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.699 
when you put your vehicle reverse brake
lights<00:02:16.120> come<00:02:16.329> on<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.780> switches<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.379> relay

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
lights come on that switches the relay

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.490 
lights come on that switches the relay
on<00:02:18.060> which<00:02:19.060> completes<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.660> connection<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.379> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
on which completes the connection on the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.890 
on which completes the connection on the
USB<00:02:20.769> cable<00:02:21.040> which<00:02:21.370> turns<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.849> camera<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:22.269> so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
USB cable which turns the camera on so

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.800 
USB cable which turns the camera on so
all<00:02:23.260> all<00:02:24.130> things<00:02:24.609> said<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.450> pretty

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
all all things said it's a pretty
