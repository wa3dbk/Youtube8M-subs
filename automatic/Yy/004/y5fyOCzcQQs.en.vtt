important I hit the spacebar to play if

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.160 
important I hit the spacebar to play if
I<00:01:23.159> find<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.670> low<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.540> raise<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I find that it's low I can raise the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.490 
I find that it's low I can raise the
levels<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.860> drop<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.750> create

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
parts as you see fit so the quickest

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.639 
parts as you see fit so the quickest
Anini<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> easiest<00:01:42.840> way<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Anini of easiest way for you to do the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.539 
Anini of easiest way for you to do the
editing<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:45.380> find<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> point<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.280> finding

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
editing is to find the point of finding

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.940 
editing is to find the point of finding
kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.119> an<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.720> out<00:01:49.200> point<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.710> where<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
kind of an in and out point of where you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.980 
kind of an in and out point of where you
want<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.790> edit<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> let's<00:01:54.450> say<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.750> there

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
want to to edit so let's say right there

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
want to to edit so let's say right there
I<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> cut<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.100> select<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> clip

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
I want to cut out to select the clip

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.560 
I want to cut out to select the clip
highlight<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.780> press<00:01:58.100> command<00:01:59.100> T<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.880> edit

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
highlight it press command T or edit

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.620 
highlight it press command T or edit
split<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:02.130> makes<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.430> cut<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
split and it makes a cut right there and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.810 
split and it makes a cut right there and
then<00:02:04.140> let's<00:02:04.409> say<00:02:04.560> after<00:02:04.890> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
then let's say after that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.630 
then let's say after that
I<00:02:06.350> might<00:02:07.350> want<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.620> get<00:02:07.830> rid<00:02:07.979> from<00:02:08.220> after<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I might want to get rid from after the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.760 
I might want to get rid from after the
air<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.000> select<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.600> clip<00:02:09.780> again<00:02:09.929> command<00:02:10.530> T

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
air so I select the clip again command T

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.490 
air so I select the clip again command T
and<00:02:11.100> then<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.060> choose<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.020> part<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and then I choose the part I want to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
and then I choose the part I want to
delete<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:13.950> let's<00:02:14.130> say<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.820> that's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
delete so let's say it's that and that's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.560 
delete so let's say it's that and that's

up here and then you can then bring down
pieces<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.400> those<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.060> let's<00:02:45.209> say<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
pieces of those and let's say this is a

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.380 
pieces of those and let's say this is a
part<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.170> really<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.850> keep<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.090> in

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
part that I really like and keep it in

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.210 
part that I really like and keep it in
another<00:02:48.750> track<00:02:49.110> bring<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.650> another<00:02:49.800> track

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and go to the beginning of each track

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.550 
and go to the beginning of each track
and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.270> would<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.540> multiple<00:02:55.230> Clips

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and then you would have multiple Clips

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.530 
and then you would have multiple Clips
let's<00:02:55.890> say<00:02:56.040> I've<00:02:56.130> got<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.520> B<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.269> another

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
let's say I've got this B to be another

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
two types of files that will be in here

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.650 
two types of files that will be in here
your<00:03:49.530> GarageBand<00:03:50.130> project<00:03:50.220> file<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.030> then<00:03:51.540> an

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
your GarageBand project file and then an

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.479 
your GarageBand project file and then an
audio<00:03:51.780> file<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.920> clip<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.190> you

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.400 
audio file so this is the clip that you
would<00:03:53.670> be<00:03:53.820> bringing<00:03:54.060> for<00:03:54.420> example<00:03:54.870> into<00:03:55.260> your

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
would be bringing for example into your

would be bringing for example into your
iBooks<00:03:55.860> project<00:03:56.459> as<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:57.120> finished<00:03:57.690> audio<00:03:58.260> clip

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
iBooks project as a finished audio clip

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.020 
iBooks project as a finished audio clip
it's<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:58.799> an<00:03:58.950> mp3<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.579> this<00:03:59.670> case<00:03:59.850> it's

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
it's like an mp3 in this case it's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.360 
it's like an mp3 in this case it's
called<00:04:00.209> an<00:04:00.390> m40<00:04:03.440> another<00:04:04.440> aspect<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.160> this

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
called an m40 another aspect to this
