as<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> background<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.809> gonna

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
as the background so I'm just gonna

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.779 
as the background so I'm just gonna
simply<00:00:58.199> create<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> new<00:00:58.680> composition<00:00:59.219> based<00:00:59.550> on

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.970 
simply create a new composition based on
that<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.469> high<00:01:01.680> definition

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

object you want to sort of like zoom

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.760 
object you want to sort of like zoom
past<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.680> scaled<00:02:08.459> more<00:02:09.140> than<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.530> background

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
past is scaled more than the background

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.920 
past is scaled more than the background
so<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.489> case<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> background<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.450> scale

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so in this case the background is scale

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.220 
so in this case the background is scale
140<00:02:13.890> percents<00:02:14.579> and<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.510> means<00:02:15.689> the<00:02:16.019> single

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
140 percents and that means the single

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.940 
140 percents and that means the single
has<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.709> be<00:02:16.860> scaled<00:02:17.250> more<00:02:17.670> than<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.890> I'm

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
has to be scaled more than that so I'm

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.910 
has to be scaled more than that so I'm
gonna<00:02:20.069> scale<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.430> let's<00:02:20.879> say<00:02:21.030> 100<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.409> know

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
gonna scale it let's say 100 and I know

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.330 
gonna scale it let's say 100 and I know
70<00:02:23.489> okay<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.659> what<00:02:25.170> also<00:02:25.590> we're<00:02:25.739> gonna<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.129> is

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
70 okay and what also we're gonna do is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.199 
70 okay and what also we're gonna do is
I'm<00:02:26.489> gonna<00:02:26.610> go<00:02:26.939> into<00:02:27.709> position<00:02:28.709> I'm<00:02:29.519> gonna<00:02:29.790> go

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
I'm gonna go into position I'm gonna go

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.920 
I'm gonna go into position I'm gonna go
back<00:02:30.900> set<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> keyframe<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.819> I'm<00:02:33.480> gonna<00:02:33.629> go<00:02:33.870> to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
back set a keyframe and I'm gonna go to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.500 
back set a keyframe and I'm gonna go to
here<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.220> last<00:02:35.400> keyframe<00:02:35.849> I'm<00:02:36.299> gonna

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
here to the last keyframe I'm gonna

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.220 
here to the last keyframe I'm gonna
simply<00:02:37.400> make<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> little<00:02:38.879> sort<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.269> motion<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
simply make a little sort of motion and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.300 
simply make a little sort of motion and
move<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:41.189> its<00:02:41.220> side<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.730> don't<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:43.310> like

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
move it to its side I don't like like

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.369 
move it to its side I don't like like
let's<00:02:44.700> say<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.180> direction<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.109> here

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
let's say this direction and now here

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.339 
let's say this direction and now here
you<00:02:46.409> go<00:02:46.620> back<00:02:46.859> and<00:02:47.129> play<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:48.720> sort<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.079> looks

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
you go back and play it it sort of looks

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.430 
you go back and play it it sort of looks
like<00:02:49.409> we're<00:02:49.739> actually<00:02:49.950> zooming<00:02:50.909> past<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
like we're actually zooming past the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.670 
like we're actually zooming past the
seagull<00:02:53.370> right<00:02:53.639> there<00:02:53.909> so<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.260> really

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
seagull right there so this is a really

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.250 
seagull right there so this is a really
really<00:02:56.069> easy<00:02:56.220> effect<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.180> do<00:02:57.359> it<00:02:57.900> doesn't

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
really easy effect to do it doesn't

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.860 
really easy effect to do it doesn't
require<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.859> lot<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.159> skill<00:03:01.129> so<00:03:02.129> yeah<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.810> is

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
require a lot of skill so yeah this is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.960 
require a lot of skill so yeah this is
actually<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.280> tutorial<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.849> this

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
actually it for that tutorial like this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.360 
actually it for that tutorial like this
it<00:03:06.090> was<00:03:06.180> really<00:03:06.209> quick<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.019> do<00:03:07.170> I'm<00:03:08.129> just<00:03:08.189> gonna

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it was really quick to do I'm just gonna

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.339 
it was really quick to do I'm just gonna
try<00:03:08.819> something<00:03:09.420> different<00:03:09.629> right<00:03:10.019> here<00:03:10.230> I'm

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
try something different right here I'm

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.339 
try something different right here I'm
gonna<00:03:10.470> try<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.599> let's<00:03:12.599> get<00:03:12.780> some<00:03:12.989> position

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
gonna try to let's get some position

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.319 
gonna try to let's get some position
right<00:03:13.590> here<00:03:15.590> okay<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.519> I'm<00:03:17.609> gonna<00:03:17.790> go<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
right here okay and I'm gonna go to the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.250 
right here okay and I'm gonna go to the
last<00:03:18.510> frame<00:03:18.780> right<00:03:19.019> here<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:20.040> I'm<00:03:20.160> gonna<00:03:20.340> move

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
last frame right here and I'm gonna move

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.479 
last frame right here and I'm gonna move
this<00:03:22.260> let's<00:03:22.919> say<00:03:23.190> down<00:03:23.579> also<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:25.129> it's<00:03:26.129> at<00:03:26.280> that

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
this let's say down also in it's at that

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.649 
this let's say down also in it's at that
side

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:39.470 

okay<00:03:32.659> let's<00:03:32.840> see<00:03:32.989> how<00:03:33.170> does<00:03:33.230> this<00:03:33.590> look

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.899 

this<00:03:40.319> looks<00:03:40.560> good<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.129> would<00:03:41.340> say<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.879> really

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
this looks good I would say you really

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.059 
this looks good I would say you really
can't<00:03:42.480> say<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.050> seagull<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.650> actually

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
can't say that the seagull is actually

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.500 
can't say that the seagull is actually
moving<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:45.209> front<00:03:45.870> into<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.560> camera<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.510> yeah

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
moving in front into the camera so yeah

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.100 
moving in front into the camera so yeah
this<00:03:48.720> looks<00:03:48.989> nice<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.970> reason<00:03:51.269> why<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.450> scaled

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
this looks nice the reason why I scaled

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.180 
this looks nice the reason why I scaled
the<00:03:52.470> background<00:03:52.950> less<00:03:53.459> than<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.330> seagull<00:03:54.840> is

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
the background less than the seagull is

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.240 
the background less than the seagull is
because<00:03:56.190> when<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.209> zoom<00:03:57.569> in<00:03:57.870> with<00:03:58.680> an<00:03:58.830> actual

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
because when you zoom in with an actual

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.809 
because when you zoom in with an actual
camera

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
camera

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.640 
camera
it<00:03:59.879> sort<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.239> looks<00:04:00.480> like<00:04:00.690> for<00:04:01.170> example<00:04:01.230> if<00:04:01.530> you

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
it sort of looks like for example if you

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.339 
it sort of looks like for example if you
zoom<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.280> objects<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.420> in<00:04:03.660> foreground

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
zoom on objects that is in foreground

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.860 
zoom on objects that is in foreground
it<00:04:04.769> looks<00:04:05.160> like<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.730> background<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.569> not

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
it looks like the background is not

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.690 
it looks like the background is not
zooming<00:04:07.560> or<00:04:07.860> scaling<00:04:08.549> up<00:04:08.909> as<00:04:09.150> much<00:04:09.480> as<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
zooming or scaling up as much as the

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.759 
zooming or scaling up as much as the
object<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:11.910> foreground<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:13.560> the

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
object in a foreground and that's the

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.250 
object in a foreground and that's the
same<00:04:14.010> effect<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.549> we're<00:04:14.730> using<00:04:15.060> here<00:04:15.599> or<00:04:15.750> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
same effect that we're using here or a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.469 
same effect that we're using here or a
parallax<00:04:16.979> scrolling<00:04:17.130> there<00:04:17.910> is<00:04:18.000> another<00:04:18.239> way

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
parallax scrolling there is another way

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.349 
parallax scrolling there is another way
that<00:04:18.510> we<00:04:18.840> can<00:04:19.019> do<00:04:19.199> this<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.430> does<00:04:21.329> not

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
that we can do this but that does not

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.110 
that we can do this but that does not
always<00:04:21.600> work<00:04:22.169> when<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.250> pick<00:04:23.490> some<00:04:23.699> images

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
always work when you pick some images

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.900 
always work when you pick some images
make<00:04:24.360> sure<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.720> there<00:04:24.960> is<00:04:25.199> nothing<00:04:26.190> covering

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
make sure that there is nothing covering

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.790 
make sure that there is nothing covering
it<00:04:27.090> for<00:04:27.330> example<00:04:27.690> if<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:28.020> want<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.350> zoom<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
it for example if I want to zoom the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.640 
it for example if I want to zoom the
seagull<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.430> there<00:04:29.550> will<00:04:29.729> be<00:04:29.760> like<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:31.620> a

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
seagull and there will be like like a

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.260 
seagull and there will be like like a
box<00:04:32.039> here<00:04:32.400> covering<00:04:32.910> it

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
box here covering it

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.659 
box here covering it
I<00:04:33.300> would<00:04:33.780> first<00:04:33.990> off<00:04:34.260> have<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.669> separately

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
I would first off have to separately

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.719 
I would first off have to separately
zoom<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.510> Box<00:04:36.780> faster<00:04:37.770> than<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.130> seagull

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
zoom the Box faster than a seagull

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.879 
zoom the Box faster than a seagull
because<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.360> more<00:04:39.660> into<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.380> foreground

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
because that is more into a foreground

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.850 
because that is more into a foreground
and<00:04:41.160> then<00:04:41.520> only<00:04:41.940> afterwards<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.660> seagull<00:04:43.169> but

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
and then only afterwards the seagull but

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.430 
and then only afterwards the seagull but
also<00:04:44.039> make<00:04:44.310> sure<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:45.060> cut<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.260> object

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
also make sure that you cut the object

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.950 
also make sure that you cut the object
correctly<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.729> scale<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.389> correctly<00:04:48.750> but

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
correctly and you scale it correctly but

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.710 
correctly and you scale it correctly but
sometimes<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.620> can<00:04:49.830> mess<00:04:50.099> up<00:04:50.340> badly<00:04:51.210> by

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
sometimes you can mess up badly by

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.260 
sometimes you can mess up badly by
scaling<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.520> can<00:04:53.669> see<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.030> there<00:04:54.240> are

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
scaling and you can see that there are

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.800 
scaling and you can see that there are
some<00:04:55.139> parts<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.700> object<00:04:57.210> or<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.479> this<00:04:57.599> case

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
some parts of the object or in this case

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.870 
some parts of the object or in this case
for<00:04:58.020> example<00:04:58.050> there<00:04:58.440> wouldn't<00:04:58.830> be<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:59.160> leg

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
for example there wouldn't be a leg

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.779 
for example there wouldn't be a leg
and<00:05:00.289> yeah<00:05:01.289> just<00:05:01.320> make<00:05:01.710> sure<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.160> scale<00:05:02.639> it

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
and yeah just make sure you scale it

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.089 
and yeah just make sure you scale it
correctly<00:05:03.270> okay<00:05:04.080> guys<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:04.440> that's<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.860> for
