valley you push it down the bar pops up

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.090 
valley you push it down the bar pops up
then<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.140> flip<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:39.010> bar<00:00:39.220> over<00:00:40.440> into<00:00:41.440> position

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
then I flip the bar over into position

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
then I flip the bar over into position
I'll<00:00:42.940> remove<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.720> first<00:00:43.930> half<00:00:44.200> of<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.410> tire
