as<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.490> see<00:00:26.789> right<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:27.680> what<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> did<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
as you can see right here what I did is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.420 
as you can see right here what I did is
I<00:00:30.599> installed<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.109> right<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
I installed it right here with just a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.389 
I installed it right here with just a
zip<00:00:33.360> tie<00:00:33.600> temporarily<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.680> also<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> sock

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
zip tie temporarily I also put a sock

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
zip tie temporarily I also put a sock
around<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> won't<00:00:36.180> scratch<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> frame

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
around it so I won't scratch the frame

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
around it so I won't scratch the frame
of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> bike<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:38.430> probably<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> best

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
of the bike that's probably the best

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.380 
of the bike that's probably the best
place<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.110> able<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> find<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.910> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
place that I was able to find that this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.130 
place that I was able to find that this
will<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.719> installed<00:00:44.450> what<00:00:45.450> will<00:00:45.570> happen<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
will get installed what will happen is a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.959 
will get installed what will happen is a
black<00:00:46.469> piece<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> fairing<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.489> cover<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
black piece of fairing will cover that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.209 
black piece of fairing will cover that
up<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> majority<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.070> see

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
up a majority of this as you can see

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.819 
up a majority of this as you can see
from<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> bike<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:52.199> missing<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
from the bike the it's missing the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
from the bike the it's missing the
fairings<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.809> plastic

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
fairings right now I've got the plastic

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.450 
fairings right now I've got the plastic
in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.250> garage<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:58.500> process<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.039> painting

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
in the garage and in process of painting

in the garage and in process of painting
them<00:00:59.670> I'm<00:01:00.420> probably<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> same<00:01:00.989> color<00:01:01.289> which

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
