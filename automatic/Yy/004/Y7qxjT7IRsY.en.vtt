matches co city we know that we
introduced<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> lot<00:02:03.959> of<00:02:04.110> new<00:02:04.170> mechanics<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
introduced a lot of new mechanics and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.929 
introduced a lot of new mechanics and
you<00:02:04.890> never<00:02:05.069> know<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> put<00:02:05.729> them<00:02:05.819> out<00:02:05.909> in

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
you never know when you put them out in

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.309 
you never know when you put them out in
the<00:02:06.090> wild<00:02:06.450> our<00:02:06.539> players<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
the wild our players really going to

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.289 
the wild our players really going to
like<00:02:07.469> dealing<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.220> power<00:02:08.489> relays<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
like dealing with power relays and the

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.180 
like dealing with power relays and the
doomsday<00:02:09.660> device<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.530> suspected<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
doomsday device we suspected that the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.500 
doomsday device we suspected that the
doomsday<00:02:11.459> device<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.880> popular<00:02:12.329> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
doomsday device would be popular and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.240 
doomsday device would be popular and
luckily<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.230> worked<00:02:13.410> out<00:02:13.500> for<00:02:13.560> us<00:02:13.769> what

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
luckily that worked out for us what

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.000 
luckily that worked out for us what
exactly<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.269> Doomsday<00:02:15.720> advice<00:02:15.989> device<00:02:16.590> so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
exactly is the Doomsday advice device so

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.000 
exactly is the Doomsday advice device so
the<00:02:17.040> doomsday<00:02:17.730> device<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:19.110> object<00:02:19.920> that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the doomsday device is an object that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
the doomsday device is an object that
you're<00:02:20.220> fighting<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.670> control<00:02:20.940> over<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.569> the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
you're fighting for control over in the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.509 
you're fighting for control over in the
center<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.110> map<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.709> activates<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
center of the map it activates for the

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.339 
center of the map it activates for the
first<00:02:23.730> time<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.150> 10<00:02:24.360> minutes<00:02:24.629> into<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> match<00:02:25.140> on

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
first time at 10 minutes into a match on

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.530 
first time at 10 minutes into a match on
Co<00:02:25.530> city<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.099> at<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.700> point<00:02:26.910> either<00:02:27.209> team

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
Co city and at that point either team

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.050 
Co city and at that point either team
can<00:02:27.930> destroy<00:02:28.500> its<00:02:28.650> defense<00:02:28.950> system<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.519> pick

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
can destroy its defense system and pick

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.880 
can destroy its defense system and pick
up<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.329> device<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.989> fires<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.470> doomsday

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
up the device that fires the doomsday

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.099 
up the device that fires the doomsday
device<00:02:32.160> itself<00:02:32.549> once<00:02:33.389> you<00:02:33.510> have<00:02:33.540> control<00:02:34.049> of

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
device itself once you have control of

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.860 
device itself once you have control of
it<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.590> basically<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:35.430> fire<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.940> gigantic

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it you basically can fire this gigantic

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.140 
it you basically can fire this gigantic
energy<00:02:37.380> blast<00:02:37.620> anywhere<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.639> the<00:02:38.730> map<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
energy blast anywhere in the map and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.509 
energy blast anywhere in the map and
effectively<00:02:40.019> deal<00:02:40.290> damage<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.859> anything<00:02:41.310> that

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
effectively deal damage to anything that

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.819 
effectively deal damage to anything that
this<00:02:41.819> thing<00:02:42.000> hits<00:02:42.269> it'll<00:02:42.810> deal<00:02:43.380> damage<00:02:43.560> to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
this thing hits it'll deal damage to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.890 
this thing hits it'll deal damage to
structures<00:02:43.889> like<00:02:44.430> turrets<00:02:44.880> it'll<00:02:45.569> kill<00:02:45.750> other

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
structures like turrets it'll kill other

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.379 
structures like turrets it'll kill other
players<00:02:46.139> it<00:02:46.680> destroys<00:02:47.040> drones<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:48.150> wrecks

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
players it destroys drones it wrecks

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.289 
players it destroys drones it wrecks
everything<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.069> actually<00:02:50.700> had<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> chance<00:02:51.180> to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
everything so I actually had a chance to

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.660 
everything so I actually had a chance to
play<00:02:51.359> Gothamites<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:52.019> MLG<00:02:52.459> wishes<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.609> know

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
play Gothamites at MLG wishes I know

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.240 
play Gothamites at MLG wishes I know
your<00:02:53.940> original<00:02:54.299> map<00:02:54.480> yeah<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.920> think

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
your original map yeah that one I think

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.559 
your original map yeah that one I think
a<00:02:56.310> lot<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.489> League<00:02:56.700> players<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.209> sort<00:02:57.510> of

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
a lot of League players with sort of

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.530 
a lot of League players with sort of
compared<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.079> Dominion<00:02:58.730> for<00:02:59.730> from<00:03:00.329> league

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
compared to Dominion for from league

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.379 
compared to Dominion for from league
legends<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.410> coast<00:03:02.340> city<00:03:02.519> did<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:02.940> guys<00:03:03.060> do

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
legends for coast city did you guys do

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.330 
legends for coast city did you guys do
you<00:03:03.450> find<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.840> there's<00:03:04.049> an<00:03:04.169> analogy<00:03:04.829> sort<00:03:05.280> of

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
you find like there's an analogy sort of

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.800 
you find like there's an analogy sort of
game<00:03:05.489> mode<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.120> or<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.329> sort<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.660> its

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
game mode for it or is it sort of its

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.990 
game mode for it or is it sort of its
own<00:03:06.930> thing<00:03:07.139> actually<00:03:07.769> for<00:03:08.010> coast<00:03:08.310> city<00:03:08.549> we

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
own thing actually for coast city we

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.849 
own thing actually for coast city we
were<00:03:09.180> trying<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.780> build<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.109> map<00:03:10.319> right<00:03:10.680> from

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
were trying to build a map right from

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.680 
were trying to build a map right from
the<00:03:10.980> get<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.310> gecko<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.450> would<00:03:12.569> be

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the get the gecko that would be

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.809 
the get the gecko that would be
completely<00:03:13.200> unique<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> infinite<00:03:14.190> crisis<00:03:14.609> and

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
completely unique to infinite crisis and

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.640 
completely unique to infinite crisis and
so<00:03:15.389> that's<00:03:15.660> where<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.290> sort<00:03:16.560> of

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
so that's where you see the sort of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.309 
so that's where you see the sort of
combination<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.609> Lane

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
combination of Lane

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.380 
combination of Lane
with<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.890> massive<00:03:19.310> jungle<00:03:19.879> in<00:03:19.999> the<00:03:20.090> center<00:03:20.329> of

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
with a massive jungle in the center of

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.869 
with a massive jungle in the center of
the<00:03:20.510> map<00:03:20.719> and<00:03:21.129> elements<00:03:22.129> like<00:03:22.249> capture<00:03:22.579> points

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
the map and elements like capture points

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.580 
the map and elements like capture points
out<00:03:22.999> of<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.150> power<00:03:23.359> relays<00:03:23.780> which<00:03:24.230> when<00:03:24.469> you

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
out of the power relays which when you

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.670 
out of the power relays which when you
capture<00:03:24.980> them<00:03:25.269> effectively<00:03:26.269> not<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:27.139> how

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
capture them effectively not that's how

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.110 
capture them effectively not that's how
you're<00:03:27.829> going<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.010> push<00:03:28.189> lanes<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.790> makes<00:03:28.969> your

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
you're going to push lanes it makes your

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.360 
you're going to push lanes it makes your
drones<00:03:29.450> actually<00:03:29.900> tougher<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.499> gives<00:03:31.159> you<00:03:31.249> an

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
drones actually tougher and gives you an

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.009 
drones actually tougher and gives you an
advantage<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.909> pushing<00:03:32.420> down<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.749> turrets

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
advantage and pushing down the turrets

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.569 
advantage and pushing down the turrets
themselves<00:03:33.499> but<00:03:33.799> it's<00:03:33.950> sort<00:03:34.099> of<00:03:34.219> a<00:03:34.280> hybrid

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
themselves but it's sort of a hybrid

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.990 
themselves but it's sort of a hybrid
between<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.420> capture<00:03:35.959> point<00:03:36.170> map<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:36.700> at<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.849> map

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
between a capture point map and at a map

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.089 
between a capture point map and at a map
with<00:03:38.180> traditional<00:03:38.629> turrets<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.109> laning<00:03:39.500> with

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
with traditional turrets and laning with

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.009 
with traditional turrets and laning with
the<00:03:40.730> added<00:03:41.090> bonus<00:03:41.209> of<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.540> Doomsday<00:03:41.930> Device

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
the added bonus of the Doomsday Device

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.660 
the added bonus of the Doomsday Device
thrown<00:03:42.439> in<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.620> center<00:03:42.889> to<00:03:43.099> really<00:03:43.430> break

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
thrown in the center to really break

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.000 
thrown in the center to really break
stalemates<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:45.139> obviously<00:03:45.439> there's<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.769> couple

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
stalemates so obviously there's a couple

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.000 
stalemates so obviously there's a couple
more<00:03:46.129> objectives<00:03:46.700> in<00:03:46.909> custody<00:03:47.749> what<00:03:48.680> are<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
more objectives in custody what are the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.379 
more objectives in custody what are the
other<00:03:49.400> differences<00:03:49.879> between<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.359> and

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
other differences between it and

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.940 
other differences between it and
Gothamites<00:03:51.430> well<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:53.180> has<00:03:53.359> laning<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.799> that

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
Gothamites well it has laning so so that

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.229 
Gothamites well it has laning so so that
that's<00:03:55.159> a<00:03:55.310> big<00:03:55.459> difference<00:03:55.579> route<00:03:55.969> the<00:03:56.090> bat

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
that's a big difference route the bat

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.849 
that's a big difference route the bat
there's<00:03:56.510> actually<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.870> leading<00:03:57.379> phase<00:03:57.590> but

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
there's actually a leading phase but

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.429 
there's actually a leading phase but
there's<00:03:58.040> only<00:03:58.159> two<00:03:58.370> lanes<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:58.939> so<00:03:59.209> but<00:04:00.079> if

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
there's only two lanes and so but if

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.500 
there's only two lanes and so but if
you're<00:04:00.590> coming<00:04:00.799> from<00:04:00.919> a<00:04:01.340> more<00:04:01.909> standard<00:04:02.269> three

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
you're coming from a more standard three

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.550 
you're coming from a more standard three
lane<00:04:02.659> map<00:04:02.870> you're<00:04:03.109> really<00:04:03.260> going<00:04:03.349> to<00:04:03.409> have<00:04:03.469> to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
lane map you're really going to have to

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.140 
lane map you're really going to have to
evaluate<00:04:03.769> what<00:04:04.129> strategy<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:04.609> want<00:04:04.909> to<00:04:05.000> use

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
evaluate what strategy you want to use

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.309 
evaluate what strategy you want to use
because<00:04:05.359> it's<00:04:05.629> still<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.870> 5v5<00:04:06.379> map<00:04:08.139> it's<00:04:09.139> got

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
because it's still a 5v5 map it's got

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.140 
because it's still a 5v5 map it's got
the<00:04:09.620> power<00:04:09.799> relays<00:04:10.250> which<00:04:10.639> will<00:04:10.879> help<00:04:10.969> you

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the power relays which will help you

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.270 
the power relays which will help you
push<00:04:11.449> the<00:04:11.569> lanes<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:11.989> all<00:04:12.109> that<00:04:12.290> which<00:04:13.189> we

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
push the lanes and all that which we

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.890 
push the lanes and all that which we
covered<00:04:13.400> already<00:04:13.639> and<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.510> Doomsday<00:04:14.840> Device

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
covered already and the Doomsday Device

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.219 
covered already and the Doomsday Device
as<00:04:15.409> as<00:04:16.009> as<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.699> big<00:04:16.910> element<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.660> will<00:04:17.780> sway

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
as as as the big element that will sway

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.830 
as as as the big element that will sway
a<00:04:18.500> match<00:04:18.739> one<00:04:19.099> way<00:04:19.250> or<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.459> other<00:04:19.599> so<00:04:20.599> it's

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
a match one way or the other so it's

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.540 
a match one way or the other so it's
mostly<00:04:20.989> about<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.500> objectives<00:04:22.009> in<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.430> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
mostly about the objectives in it to the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.159 
mostly about the objectives in it to the
game<00:04:22.759> center<00:04:23.120> last<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.449> little<00:04:23.539> bit<00:04:23.630> longer<00:04:23.840> for

game center last a little bit longer for

the<00:04:24.830> matches<00:04:25.159> the<00:04:25.639> matches<00:04:25.970> are<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.150> little<00:04:26.330> bit

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
the matches the matches are a little bit

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.260 
the matches the matches are a little bit
longer<00:04:26.630> than<00:04:26.900> Gothamites<00:04:27.880> typical<00:04:28.880> Gotham

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
longer than Gothamites typical Gotham

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.490 
longer than Gothamites typical Gotham
Heights<00:04:29.449> match<00:04:29.690> will<00:04:29.960> last<00:04:30.139> somewhere

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
Heights match will last somewhere

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.659 
Heights match will last somewhere
between<00:04:31.060> 20<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.090> 30<00:04:32.389> minutes<00:04:32.860> for<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:34.130> CO<00:04:34.430> City

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
between 20 to 30 minutes for a CO City

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.540 
between 20 to 30 minutes for a CO City
match<00:04:34.849> one<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.509> that's<00:04:35.780> going<00:04:36.550> reasonably

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
match one that that's going reasonably

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.249 
match one that that's going reasonably
competitively<00:04:38.300> you're<00:04:38.870> going<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.050> probably

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
competitively you're going to probably

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.499 
competitively you're going to probably
be<00:04:39.409> in<00:04:39.590> there<00:04:39.800> for<00:04:40.099> about<00:04:40.190> half<00:04:40.940> hour<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.270> 40

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
be in there for about half hour to 40

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.899 
be in there for about half hour to 40
minutes<00:04:41.659> so<00:04:42.650> on<00:04:43.009> average<00:04:43.220> about<00:04:43.460> 10<00:04:43.729> minutes

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
minutes so on average about 10 minutes

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.510

really<00:05:58.320> great<00:05:58.530> to<00:05:58.590> interact<00:05:58.979> with<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.250> pros<00:05:59.520> I

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
really great to interact with the pros I

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.240 
really great to interact with the pros I
think<00:06:00.449> just<00:06:00.479> their<00:06:00.870> perspective<00:06:01.560> on<00:06:01.710> games<00:06:01.979> is

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
think just their perspective on games is

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.050 
think just their perspective on games is
at<00:06:02.490> a<00:06:02.520> much<00:06:02.970> higher<00:06:03.300> level<00:06:03.960> than<00:06:04.710> than<00:06:05.639> the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
at a much higher level than than the

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.159 
at a much higher level than than the
average<00:06:06.330> person<00:06:06.360> that's<00:06:06.750> going<00:06:06.870> to<00:06:06.960> play<00:06:07.050> our

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
average person that's going to play our

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.900 
average person that's going to play our
game<00:06:07.320> which<00:06:07.919> is<00:06:08.009> obvious<00:06:08.340> because<00:06:08.460> they're

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
game which is obvious because they're

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.850 
game which is obvious because they're
the<00:06:08.940> pros<00:06:09.289> but<00:06:10.289> it's<00:06:10.349> always<00:06:10.680> really

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
the pros but it's always really

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.200 
the pros but it's always really
interesting<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.460> see<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.699> types<00:06:11.940> of<00:06:12.060> things

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
interesting to see the types of things

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.820 
interesting to see the types of things
that<00:06:12.360> they're<00:06:12.539> looking<00:06:12.810> for<00:06:13.020> when<00:06:13.590> we<00:06:13.710> had

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
that they're looking for when we had

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.529 
that they're looking for when we had
complexity<00:06:14.340> out<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.580> office<00:06:14.759> one<00:06:15.389> of<00:06:15.479> the

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
complexity out the office one of the

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.820 
complexity out the office one of the
things<00:06:15.720> that<00:06:15.840> I<00:06:15.960> found<00:06:16.530> really<00:06:16.620> interesting

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
things that I found really interesting

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.129 
things that I found really interesting
was<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:17.430> they<00:06:18.120> immediately<00:06:18.330> wanted<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:19.020> know

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
was that they immediately wanted to know

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.050 
was that they immediately wanted to know
all<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.710> numbers<00:06:20.039> for<00:06:20.400> everything<00:06:20.880> in<00:06:20.970> the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
all the numbers for everything in the

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.450 
all the numbers for everything in the
game<00:06:21.210> exactly<00:06:21.870> how<00:06:22.229> they<00:06:22.409> scaled<00:06:22.740> across<00:06:23.039> all

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
game exactly how they scaled across all

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.600 
game exactly how they scaled across all
the<00:06:23.639> characters<00:06:24.000> leveling<00:06:24.449> and<00:06:25.370> every<00:06:26.370> little

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
the characters leveling and every little

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.129 
the characters leveling and every little
detail<00:06:26.760> that<00:06:27.120> we<00:06:27.210> could<00:06:27.330> provide<00:06:27.599> them<00:06:27.840> and

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
detail that we could provide them and

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.570 
detail that we could provide them and
when<00:06:28.260> it<00:06:28.349> wasn't<00:06:28.650> clear<00:06:28.770> in<00:06:28.949> the<00:06:29.039> game<00:06:29.220> they

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
when it wasn't clear in the game they

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.189 
when it wasn't clear in the game they
were<00:06:29.639> asking<00:06:29.849> us<00:06:30.210> about<00:06:30.360> exactly<00:06:30.870> what<00:06:31.020> the

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
were asking us about exactly what the

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.779 
were asking us about exactly what the
numbers<00:06:31.470> were<00:06:31.500> and<00:06:31.949> so<00:06:32.310> that's<00:06:32.520> something

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789
