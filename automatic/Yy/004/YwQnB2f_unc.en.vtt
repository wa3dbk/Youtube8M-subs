00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this is the first year that I'm doing it

this is the first year that I'm doing it
gives<00:01:12.540> reads<00:01:12.720> challenge<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.320> I've<00:01:13.409> never

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
gives reads challenge so I've never

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
gives reads challenge so I've never
really<00:01:13.860> had<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.070> end-of-the-year<00:01:14.790> almost

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
really had that end-of-the-year almost

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.780 
really had that end-of-the-year almost
completing<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> feeling<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> totally<00:01:17.460> set

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
completing it feeling but I totally set

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.859 
completing it feeling but I totally set
the<00:01:17.880> bar<00:01:18.030> low<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.420> everything<00:01:18.810> was

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the bar low because everything was

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
the bar low because everything was
expecting<00:01:19.380> much<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.680> myself<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.130> year<00:01:20.189> I'm

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
expecting much for myself this year I'm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160 
expecting much for myself this year I'm
already<00:01:21.119> doing<00:01:21.270> pretty<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> though<00:01:22.140> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
already doing pretty good on it though I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.600 
already doing pretty good on it though I
think<00:01:22.530> eventually<00:01:22.770> I'm<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> pump

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
think eventually I'm gonna have to pump

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
think eventually I'm gonna have to pump
it<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.350> very<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.830> low

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it up just because it was very very low

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
it up just because it was very very low
and<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:26.880> shamed<00:01:27.060> myself<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.869> pushing

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and I was shamed myself for not pushing

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.870 
and I was shamed myself for not pushing
myself<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.130> should've<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
myself as much as I should've that's a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
myself as much as I should've that's a
whole<00:01:30.030> other<00:01:30.060> story<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.720> I'd<00:01:30.960> probably<00:01:31.170> just

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
whole other story but I'd probably just

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.960 
whole other story but I'd probably just
let<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.369> okay<00:01:32.610> whatever<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
let it go and be like okay whatever I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
let it go and be like okay whatever I
didn't<00:01:33.299> finish<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.290> hate

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
didn't finish because I really hate

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.810 
didn't finish because I really hate

would never pick up and put down five
books<00:03:49.610> at<00:03:50.180> that<00:03:50.239> point<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.870> would<00:03:51.019> just<00:03:51.170> stop

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
books at that point I would just stop

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.229 
books at that point I would just stop
reading<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:52.070> in<00:03:52.220> reality<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.850> am<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.150> a

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
reading but in reality if I am in a

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.559 
reading but in reality if I am in a
slump<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.600> just<00:03:53.840> kind<00:03:54.049> of<00:03:54.140> look<00:03:54.320> for

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
slump I just kind of look for

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.759 
slump I just kind of look for
look<00:03:54.689> that<00:03:54.840> I've<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:55.230> been<00:03:55.260> wanting<00:03:55.560> to

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
look that I've really been wanting to

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.470 
look that I've really been wanting to
read<00:03:56.069> usually<00:03:56.459> it'll<00:03:56.760> make<00:03:56.909> contemporary

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
read usually it'll make contemporary

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.879 
read usually it'll make contemporary
just<00:03:57.659> because<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.140> majority<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.769> were

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
just because the majority that were

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.259 
just because the majority that were
standalone<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.579> there's<00:03:59.760> less<00:03:59.879> commitment

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
standalone so there's less commitment

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.629 
standalone so there's less commitment
and<00:04:00.599> I'll<00:04:00.719> usually<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:01.079> fun<00:04:01.560> cute<00:04:02.040> fast

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
and I'll usually just fun cute fast

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.580 
and I'll usually just fun cute fast
reads<00:04:02.999> but<00:04:03.359> in<00:04:03.480> some<00:04:03.659> cases<00:04:03.900> like<00:04:04.139> I<00:04:04.260> was<00:04:04.409> in<00:04:04.499> a

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
reads but in some cases like I was in a

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.649 
reads but in some cases like I was in a
huge<00:04:04.859> slump<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.519> last<00:04:05.700> two<00:04:05.879> months<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.090> 2014

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
huge slump the last two months of 2014

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.300 
huge slump the last two months of 2014
and<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:07.079> finally<00:04:07.469> picked<00:04:07.590> up<00:04:07.739> in<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.010> afterlife

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
and I finally picked up in the afterlife

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.220 
and I finally picked up in the afterlife
by<00:04:08.489> Alexandra<00:04:08.969> Bracken<00:04:08.999> which<00:04:09.749> is<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
by Alexandra Bracken which is the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.839 
by Alexandra Bracken which is the
conclusion<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:10.889> dystopian<00:04:11.400> series<00:04:11.549> it's

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
conclusion to a dystopian series it's

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.910 
conclusion to a dystopian series it's
very<00:04:12.060> very<00:04:12.239> heavy<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.810> not<00:04:13.379> coming<00:04:13.709> on<00:04:13.799> my

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
very very heavy and not coming on my

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.530 
very very heavy and not coming on my
slope<00:04:14.159> so<00:04:14.430> again<00:04:14.639> it<00:04:14.819> just<00:04:14.849> really<00:04:15.120> depends<00:04:15.420> on

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
slope so again it just really depends on

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.420 
slope so again it just really depends on
my<00:04:15.659> mood<00:04:15.689> but<00:04:16.289> I'll<00:04:16.590> usually<00:04:16.949> pick<00:04:17.310> up

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
my mood but I'll usually pick up

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.650 
my mood but I'll usually pick up
something<00:04:17.759> that<00:04:17.880> I've<00:04:18.000> really<00:04:18.269> been<00:04:18.449> wanting

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
something that I've really been wanting

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.539 
something that I've really been wanting
to<00:04:19.079> read<00:04:19.259> not<00:04:19.620> necessarily<00:04:20.130> something<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.519> I

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
to read not necessarily something that I

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.370 
to read not necessarily something that I
feel<00:04:20.759> I<00:04:20.789> have<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.150> read<00:04:21.509> question<00:04:21.989> 10<00:04:22.199> there

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380

anticipating reading a book like if it's

definitely pick that up next but I've

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.529 
definitely pick that up next but I've
been<00:04:53.009> trying<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.520> pick<00:04:53.820> off<00:04:53.970> books<00:04:54.300> not

necessarily there all these new books
that<00:04:56.250> I've<00:04:56.340> been<00:04:56.460> wanting<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:56.759> read<00:04:57.090> which<00:04:57.330> is

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
that I've been wanting to read which is

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.670 
that I've been wanting to read which is
why<00:04:57.570> I'm<00:04:57.690> doing<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:58.050> whole<00:04:58.199> TBR<00:04:58.650> challenge

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
why I'm doing that whole TBR challenge

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.770 
why I'm doing that whole TBR challenge
thing<00:04:59.250> so<00:04:59.639> maybe<00:04:59.820> one<00:05:00.030> day<00:05:00.210> I'll<00:05:00.330> even<00:05:00.539> it<00:05:00.659> out

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
thing so maybe one day I'll even it out

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.689 
thing so maybe one day I'll even it out
but<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.110> is<00:05:01.409> the<00:05:01.560> greatest<00:05:01.770> problem<00:05:02.009> tag<00:05:02.430> I

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
but that is the greatest problem tag I

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.189 
but that is the greatest problem tag I
really<00:05:03.000> don't<00:05:03.180> know<00:05:03.270> who<00:05:03.509> has<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.020> hasn't

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
really don't know who has and hasn't

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.659 
really don't know who has and hasn't
done<00:05:04.349> this<00:05:04.560> tag<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.070> I'll<00:05:05.220> probably<00:05:05.430> just

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
done this tag so I'll probably just

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:06.830 
done this tag so I'll probably just
check<00:05:05.880> out<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.030> few<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.300> channels<00:05:06.659> that<00:05:06.720> are

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.480
