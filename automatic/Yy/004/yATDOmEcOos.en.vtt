00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.630 

so<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.190> is<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.090> thing

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
so I think that they can is this thing

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.600 
so I think that they can is this thing
just<00:01:23.640> try<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:23.820> make<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.300> smooth<00:01:24.720> pad<00:01:25.610> like

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just try to make it a smooth pad like

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.010 
just try to make it a smooth pad like
think<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> dance<00:01:27.450> slow<00:01:27.690> because<00:01:27.870> it's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
think about it dance slow because it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.720 
think about it dance slow because it's
not<00:01:28.140> super<00:01:28.500> fast<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.250> connects<00:01:29.580> your

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
not super fast but just connects your

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:38.060 
not super fast but just connects your
wrist

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.969

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
sinks into them just anyways just think

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.699 
sinks into them just anyways just think
about<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.540> flow<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:57.320> everything<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.470> saw

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
