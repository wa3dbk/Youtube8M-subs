00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.940
 Good friends, GO friends, friends, everyone. 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.580
 I am the publicist Justin of Taiwanese Brunswick. 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.880
 Then bring everyone to this time. 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.720
 Zhuhai International Circuit 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.970
 Then what you are attending is 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.960
 AMG Advanced Training 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.930
 That is, AMG's advanced training course. 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.190
 This course is a two-day course 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.870
 Compared to last year’s Taiwanese Bruns in Dapeng Bay 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.970
 Basic Training 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.430
 It’s AMG’s advanced training. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.420
 More compact and more diverse 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.370
 Then there are all kinds of AMG models 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.240
 Imported in this training 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.690
 Included inside the MGCC luxury car 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.930
 AMG45 models include GLA45 AMG 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.680
 A45 AMG and CLA45 AMG 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.730
 Also includes high-end models like CLS63 AMG 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.830
 And GT S was just released in Taiwan not long ago. 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.760
 GT's model 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.980
 Also in this training 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.910
 Let all the students understand 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.640
 Then these two days and one night of this course 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.900
 It can be said that it is very diversified and very compact. 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.340
 Then it contains what is called from the beginning 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.990
 This activity of the rapid cone and 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.450
 AutoX is the analog track 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.150
 Such a driver 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.700
 And high-speed fixed-point braking 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.380
 And training with a brake 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.930
 All for the sake of being more compact 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.110
 The course of the whole track is in the layout 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.820
 So all the students 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.660
 In a phased manner like this 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.620
 Simplified and relatively more difficult 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.700
 Such a training process 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 Can get a better and more complete training 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.530
 Then at the same time after each training session of the coach 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.200
 Will share all training data with the participants 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.550
 That is from his speeding brakes 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 That even into the bend, etc. 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.180
 a data analysis like this 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.320
 Let the students be able to work in two days 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.010
 Constantly correct your own driving behavior 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.080
 Able to put AMG performance 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.100
 On this famous international circuit 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.350
 Be able to perform even more vividly 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.910
 That Taiwanese singer at Mercedes AMG 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.400
 After the sub-brand is established 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.070
 Will continue to work 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.340
 Expand the performance brand like AMG 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 At the same time, we will continue to hold 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.720
 Many customer training camps such activities 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.270
 That includes AMG Driving Academy 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.200
 Part of this driving school at AMG 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.320
 We will continue to hold 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.680
 At the same time, we will have AMG in the future. 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.380
 Basic Training is interested 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.320
 GO car spectator friends 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.160
 Then welcome to all of us 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.720
 Authorize the display center dealer to do a consultation 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.630
 Relevant information will also be posted on our 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.080
 Taiwanese official website 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.810
 That also welcomes everyone to have a chance. 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.440
 Able to participate in our Shanghai International Circuit 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.720
 AMG Driving Academy 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.100
 Training like Basic Training 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.500
 I hope everyone can be good at these in the future. 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.600
 Internationally renowned track 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.250
 Able to experience AMG's ultimate performance 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.800
 Just we are too noisy on this GTS 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.090
 So it’s not so good that everyone can’t hear it. 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.110
 Then I am now on the A45. 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.280
 But I will introduce it to you. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.940
 I feel the GT S 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.780
 The first one is its bending speed 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.640
 It bends much faster than you think. 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.300
 And it will be very stable 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.240
 Although it is a rear drive, it is completely open. 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.870
 The fear of the back drive 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.800
 The second part is the gearbox 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.620
 You must remember to dial to M mode. 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.860
 Whatever you use 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.000
 S mode or Sport + mode 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.020
 In fact, its shift is still not as fast as M. 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.900
 When you use the M mode, you are now driving to A45. 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.700
 You will think that the A45 seems to be a comfortable card. 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.040
 In the future, we will still test drive GT S in Taiwan. 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.060
 Then I can only introduce it to you this time. 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.990
 It is at Zhuhai Circuit 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.190
 Its entire dynamic performance 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.470
 Because Zhuhai Circuit is about one kilometer more than Dapeng Bay. 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.710
 But his lap will be faster than Dapeng Bay. 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.960
 Because it is almost always a high speed corner 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.220
 There are still a few hairpin bends to worry about safety. 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.800
 It has a lot of three third gears 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.720
 Full throttle bend 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.480
 So you drive up for the vehicle 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.310
 The stability and strength of the chassis is important 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.560
 The strength of the vehicle is not enough 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.090
 If it is soft in the corner 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.620
 May cause it to be a bend 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.760
 It will have understeer 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.290
 But whether it is A45 or CLS63 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.850
 Even GT S has no such problem. 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.800
 And whether it is a four-wheel drive 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.330
 It feels like it's all open 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.620
 In fact, the bending speed is very good. 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.740
 It's this gearbox of this 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.880
 Still no GT S is good 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.350
 GT S will still be forced to downshift 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.320
 But in the A45 it is also some protection device 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.040
 You can't do it on your own track. 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.320
 Deliberately switch gears 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.040
 Basically GT S it drives up the gearbox 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.340
 Much like a sequence 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.010
 Regardless of the speed of the shift 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.570
 There is a gear that you can control. 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.100
 It has a wide range 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.220
 It won't protect the gearbox because it wants to protect the engine 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.520
 So it is in the process of shifting 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.240
 You will get in the way 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.180
 Like we are now open A45 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.520
 Sometimes when I want to drop to the second gear 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.710
 You have to wait for the speed to really slow down 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.200
 It will really let you down to second gear 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.080
 A45 brakes are actually great 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.200
 But if you opened GT S today 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.750
 You will think that the A45 is not good. 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.790
 Especially now at least 35 degrees above 35 degrees 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.010
 After you step on the car several times 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.700
 I saw that the disc and the order piece rubbed against each other. 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.700
 That sly voice means that the car is overheated.
