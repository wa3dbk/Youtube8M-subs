create the interior seen in the night
with<00:00:06.120> various<00:00:06.930> light<00:00:07.890> sources<00:00:08.630> ok<00:00:09.630> let's

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
with various light sources ok let's

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
with various light sources ok let's
start<00:00:10.490> so<00:00:11.490> from<00:00:12.300> here<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.950> made<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:15.980> bedroom

scene in the house so actually I didn't
apply<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.769> any<00:00:22.949> light<00:00:23.279> sources<00:00:23.789> yet<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.289> as

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
apply there any light sources yet so as

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.550 
apply there any light sources yet so as
you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.250> there<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.580> no<00:00:26.760> light

from<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.379> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.649> apply<00:00:44.899> some<00:00:45.899> light

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
from here I'm going to apply some light

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.900 
from here I'm going to apply some light
sources<00:00:46.559> okay<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.660> scene<00:00:49.050> actually<00:00:49.910> we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
sources okay in this scene actually we

have a fluorescent light on the ceiling
as<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> primary<00:00:55.350> light<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.090> have

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
as a primary light and then we have

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.939 
as a primary light and then we have
several<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.300> down<00:01:00.629> lights<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.800> we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
several like down lights and then we

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.240 
several like down lights and then we
have<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.750> floor<00:01:03.750> stand<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.100> have

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
have one floor stand and then we have

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
have one floor stand and then we have
one<00:01:06.890> substance<00:01:07.890> light<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
one substance light so I'm going to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.030 
one substance light so I'm going to
apply<00:01:11.280> I'm<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> light<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.390> those

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
apply I'm going to light up those

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.929 
apply I'm going to light up those
lighting<00:01:14.040> devices<00:01:14.689> with<00:01:15.920> very<00:01:16.920> we're<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.610> light

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
lighting devices with very we're a light

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.109 
lighting devices with very we're a light
and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.780> target<00:01:19.380> spotlight<00:01:19.920> okay<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and then some target spotlight okay so

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
and then some target spotlight okay so
um<00:01:21.890> before<00:01:22.890> applying<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.790> light<00:01:24.150> sources<00:01:24.720> we

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
um before applying the light sources we

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
um before applying the light sources we
need<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.009> apply<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.880> rate<00:01:27.090> light<00:01:27.390> material

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
need to apply if we rate light material

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.249 
need to apply if we rate light material
to<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.479> object<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.960> has<00:01:31.229> light<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> first<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to the object that has light so first of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
to the object that has light so first of
all<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> apply<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.670> light

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
all I'm going to apply the very light

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.710 
all I'm going to apply the very light
material<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.680> fluorescent

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
material to the to this fluorescent

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.980 
material to the to this fluorescent
light<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.650> ceiling<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.909> let's<00:01:42.420> select<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
light on the ceiling so let's select the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.830 
light on the ceiling so let's select the
ceiling<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> isolate<00:01:45.479> this

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
ceiling then I'm going to isolate this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
ceiling then I'm going to isolate this
and<00:01:46.700> then<00:01:47.840> i'm<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> select<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and then i'm going to select the this

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.560 
and then i'm going to select the this
polygon<00:01:51.509> ok<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.439> let's<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> modify<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
polygon ok so let's go to modify and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.380 
polygon ok so let's go to modify and
then<00:01:54.750> select<00:01:55.140> polygon<00:01:55.820> then<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.060> can

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
then select polygon then now you can

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.819 
then select polygon then now you can
select<00:01:58.340> those<00:01:59.390> polygons<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.500> will

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
select those polygons actually that will

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.990 
select those polygons actually that will
be<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.369> fluorescent<00:02:02.969> light<00:02:03.329> source<00:02:03.979> so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
be the fluorescent light source so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.620 
be the fluorescent light source so
I'm<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> apply<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:08.330> very<00:02:09.330> light

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
I'm going to apply the very light

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.250 
I'm going to apply the very light
material<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.320> already<00:02:11.160> made<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.060> very<00:02:12.840> light

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
material I already made this very light

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.690 
material I already made this very light
material<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.070> make<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:16.860> very<00:02:17.100> material

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
material you can make here very material

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.450 
material you can make here very material
and<00:02:17.820> here<00:02:18.750> we're<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.170> light<00:02:19.470> material<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
and here we're a light material so you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.210 
and here we're a light material so you
can<00:02:20.700> click<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.810> then<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.830> apply

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
can click this and then you can apply

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.120 
can click this and then you can apply
I'm<00:02:23.700> actually<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.600> want<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.260> apply<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.830> white

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
I'm actually I want to apply the white

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.150 
I'm actually I want to apply the white
white<00:02:26.880> color<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.630> then<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.830> change

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
white color and then you can change

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.990 
white color and then you can change
intensity<00:02:29.970> i<00:02:30.120> applied<00:02:30.840> re<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:34.520> let's<00:02:35.520> apply

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
intensity i applied re so let's apply

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.920 
intensity i applied re so let's apply
like<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.430> then<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.360> this

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
like this and then you have this

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.949 
like this and then you have this
fluorescent<00:02:40.590> light<00:02:40.860> here<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.090> let's<00:02:42.360> unhide

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
fluorescent light here so let's unhide

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.880 
fluorescent light here so let's unhide
all<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:45.320> I'm<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.650> apply<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:48.890> very

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
all and then I'm going to apply the very

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.770 
all and then I'm going to apply the very
light<00:02:50.310> material<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:53.959> downlight<00:02:55.670> also<00:02:56.780> so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
light material to the downlight also so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.220 
light material to the downlight also so
let's<00:02:58.170> select<00:02:59.390> those<00:03:01.220> down<00:03:02.220> light<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.930> then

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
let's select those down light and then

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.110 
let's select those down light and then
isolate<00:03:04.770> then<00:03:05.840> i'm<00:03:06.840> going<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:08.600> select<00:03:09.600> again

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
isolate then i'm going to select again

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.550 
isolate then i'm going to select again
this<00:03:12.120> polygon<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:14.040> will<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.790> perp<00:03:15.720> so

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
this polygon so this will be a perp so

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.210 
this polygon so this will be a perp so
we<00:03:17.010> need<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.430> apply<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.260> light<00:03:19.260> material<00:03:19.799> here

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
we need to apply the light material here

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.580 
we need to apply the light material here
okay<00:03:21.000> so

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
okay so

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.229 
okay so
alright<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.580> then<00:03:24.730> here<00:03:25.150> also<00:03:27.000> polygon<00:03:28.000> and

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
alright and then here also polygon and

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.000 
alright and then here also polygon and
you<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.569> select<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:29.080> polygon<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.800> then<00:03:29.950> you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
you can select this polygon and then you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.170 
you can select this polygon and then you
can<00:03:30.160> apply<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:32.050> material<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:34.349> this<00:03:35.349> too

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
can apply the like material and this too

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.229 
can apply the like material and this too
so<00:03:37.180> let's<00:03:38.019> select<00:03:38.410> this<00:03:38.920> one<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.670> polygon

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
so let's select this one and the polygon

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.780 
so let's select this one and the polygon
and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.599> can<00:03:40.780> select<00:03:40.989> this<00:03:41.349> barb<00:03:41.790> and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
and then you can select this barb and

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.369 
and then you can select this barb and
then<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.060> can<00:03:43.470> apply<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:46.480> like<00:03:47.290> material<00:03:47.970> so

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
then you can apply this like material so

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.559 
then you can apply this like material so
let's<00:03:50.379> unhide<00:03:50.920> all<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.599> I'm<00:03:52.750> going<00:03:52.989> to

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
let's unhide all and then I'm going to

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.610 
let's unhide all and then I'm going to
render<00:03:55.569> this<00:03:55.870> sin<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:58.030> can<00:03:58.239> see<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
render this sin so you can see the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.210 
render this sin so you can see the
difference<00:04:01.950> all<00:04:02.950> right

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.940 

it<00:04:07.490> takes<00:04:07.880> little<00:04:08.300> time<00:04:10.480> okay<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.960> here

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
it takes little time okay so here

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.120 
it takes little time okay so here
actually<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:16.280> very<00:04:16.519> light<00:04:16.970> material<00:04:18.130> creates

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
actually the very light material creates

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.330 
actually the very light material creates
some<00:04:20.230> portion<00:04:21.230> of<00:04:21.380> light<00:04:21.620> but<00:04:21.980> it's<00:04:22.130> not

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
some portion of light but it's not

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.080 
some portion of light but it's not
enough<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.470> upon<00:04:24.470> here<00:04:24.890> you<00:04:25.190> will<00:04:25.430> we<00:04:25.850> will

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
enough so upon here you will we will

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.210 
enough so upon here you will we will
apply<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.500> actual<00:04:27.980> light<00:04:28.640> sources<00:04:29.240> okay

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
apply the actual light sources okay

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.060 
apply the actual light sources okay
first<00:04:31.220> we<00:04:31.610> need<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.790> apply<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.990> target<00:04:33.830> spot

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
first we need to apply the target spot

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.440 
first we need to apply the target spot
by<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.880> those<00:04:35.480> down<00:04:35.960> lights<00:04:36.290> okay<00:04:37.210> for<00:04:38.210> that

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
by for those down lights okay for that

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.010 
by for those down lights okay for that
actually<00:04:39.230> I'm<00:04:39.320> going<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.620> maximize<00:04:40.280> this

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
actually I'm going to maximize this

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.060 
actually I'm going to maximize this
front<00:04:42.020> view<00:04:43.390> then<00:04:44.390> I'm<00:04:45.050> going<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.320> select<00:04:45.620> the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
front view then I'm going to select the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.420 
front view then I'm going to select the
light<00:04:46.400> here<00:04:47.270> then<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.350> can<00:04:48.530> select<00:04:48.710> target

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
light here then you can select target

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.270 
light here then you can select target
spotlight<00:04:50.000> here<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:51.520> then<00:04:52.520> right<00:04:52.970> under<00:04:53.390> the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
spotlight here and then right under the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.110 
spotlight here and then right under the
lighting<00:04:55.280> device<00:04:55.630> you<00:04:56.630> can<00:04:57.040> click<00:04:58.040> and<00:04:58.370> drag

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.580 

and<00:05:02.750> now<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:02.990> have<00:05:03.350> a<00:05:03.490> target<00:05:04.490> spotlight<00:05:05.590> then

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
and now you have a target spotlight then

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.830 
and now you have a target spotlight then
you<00:05:06.979> need<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.280> adjust<00:05:09.639> its<00:05:10.639> position<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:14.630> have

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
you need to adjust its position you have

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.580 
you need to adjust its position you have
to<00:05:15.050> select<00:05:15.290> target<00:05:15.979> also<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:17.960> can<00:05:18.350> move<00:05:18.530> to

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
to select target also so you can move to

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.120 
to select target also so you can move to
the<00:05:19.070> right<00:05:19.250> position<00:05:20.380> this<00:05:21.380> likes<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:21.949> be<00:05:22.100> the

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
the right position this likes to be the

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:30.310 
the right position this likes to be the
center<00:05:22.400> of<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:24.470> lighting<00:05:24.889> device<00:05:25.690> ok<00:05:28.810> now<00:05:29.810> I'm

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
center of the lighting device ok now I'm

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.129 
center of the lighting device ok now I'm
going<00:05:30.380> to<00:05:31.070> adjust<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:34.090> range<00:05:35.090> of<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.900> light

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
going to adjust the range of the light

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.810 
going to adjust the range of the light
so<00:05:38.380> for<00:05:39.380> that<00:05:39.620> let's<00:05:39.949> select<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.610> light

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
so for that let's select the light

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.540 
so for that let's select the light
source<00:05:41.740> actually<00:05:42.740> I'm<00:05:42.979> going<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.370> restrict

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
source actually I'm going to restrict

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.780 
source actually I'm going to restrict
the<00:05:44.330> selection<00:05:45.160> only<00:05:46.160> four<00:05:46.370> lights<00:05:46.720> okay<00:05:47.720> so
