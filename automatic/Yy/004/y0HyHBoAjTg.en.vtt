00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
bad idea let's find somebody else okay

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.770 
bad idea let's find somebody else okay
so<00:01:42.500> first<00:01:43.130> we'll<00:01:43.550> link<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.970> attacks<00:01:44.330> first

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
so first we'll link to attacks first

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.990 
so first we'll link to attacks first
let's<00:01:45.080> take<00:01:45.290> this<00:01:45.470> really<00:01:45.830> any<00:01:46.280> base<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.730> not

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
let's take this really any base it's not

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.910 
let's take this really any base it's not
very<00:01:47.210> well<00:01:47.420> upgrading<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.170> should<00:01:48.470> at<00:01:48.710> least

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
very well upgrading this should at least

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.450 
very well upgrading this should at least
cover<00:01:49.220> any<00:01:49.460> cups<00:01:49.730> that<00:01:49.910> we<00:01:50.090> might<00:01:50.420> lose<00:01:50.720> later

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
cover any cups that we might lose later

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.040 
cover any cups that we might lose later
and<00:01:52.460> maybe<00:01:52.820> we<00:01:53.180> should<00:01:53.390> be<00:01:53.510> able<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.810> at<00:01:53.900> least

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
and maybe we should be able to at least

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.200 
and maybe we should be able to at least
stand<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.470> chance<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.860> getting<00:01:55.250> two<00:01:55.490> stars<00:01:55.910> on

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
stand a chance of getting two stars on

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.540 
stand a chance of getting two stars on
this<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:56.960> well<00:01:57.620> it's<00:01:57.800> past<00:01:57.980> town<00:01:58.310> hall<00:01:58.520> 9

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
than three rage to freeze when you're

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.000 
than three rage to freeze when you're

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
i'm not going to kick these out because

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.150 
i'm not going to kick these out because
obviously<00:03:59.930> when<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.440> get<00:04:00.590> your<00:04:00.620> level<00:04:00.980> five

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
obviously when you get your level five

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.800 
obviously when you get your level five
dragons<00:04:01.430> nobody's<00:04:01.970> actually<00:04:02.210> going<00:04:02.660> to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
dragons nobody's actually going to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.480 
dragons nobody's actually going to
attack<00:04:03.020> without<00:04:03.230> full<00:04:03.620> camps<00:04:03.950> or<00:04:04.100> full<00:04:04.280> clan

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
attack without full camps or full clan

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.830 
attack without full camps or full clan
castle<00:04:04.640> so<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:04.940> guess<00:04:05.210> it's<00:04:05.360> reasonable<00:04:05.810> to

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
castle so I guess it's reasonable to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.440 
castle so I guess it's reasonable to
keep<00:04:06.050> these<00:04:06.230> loons<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.880> they<00:04:07.880> might<00:04:08.090> just<00:04:08.240> help

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
keep these loons in they might just help

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.150 
keep these loons in they might just help
us<00:04:08.630> just<00:04:08.990> a<00:04:09.230> little<00:04:09.470> bit<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.800> it'll<00:04:09.920> be<00:04:10.070> an

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
us just a little bit and it'll be an

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.430 
us just a little bit and it'll be an
accurate<00:04:10.310> an<00:04:11.000> accurate<00:04:11.420> comparison<00:04:11.600> for<00:04:12.320> when

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
accurate an accurate comparison for when

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.410 
accurate an accurate comparison for when
we<00:04:12.620> get<00:04:12.860> our<00:04:13.100> level<00:04:13.459> 5s<00:04:13.850> all<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.060> caps<00:04:14.270> are

we get our level 5s all the caps are
full<00:04:14.600> I've<00:04:14.750> got<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.959> same<00:04:15.200> spells<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.709> here

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
that what is that higgledy-piggledy base

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.290 
that what is that higgledy-piggledy base
no<00:04:35.530> we're<00:04:35.770> not<00:04:35.890> going<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.190> take<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.400> this

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
no we're not going to take that this

no we're not going to take that this
this<00:04:37.990> one<00:04:38.290> looks<00:04:38.470> good<00:04:38.800> Polly<00:04:39.100> max<00:04:39.370> defenses

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
this one looks good Polly max defenses

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.340 
this one looks good Polly max defenses
we<00:04:40.030> don't<00:04:40.210> care<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.630> wrong<00:04:40.780> way<00:04:40.930> is<00:04:41.200> &amp;

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
we don't care that the wrong way is &amp;

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.410 
we don't care that the wrong way is &amp;
Dragons<00:04:41.710> expose<00:04:42.400> are<00:04:42.580> pointing<00:04:42.940> in<00:04:43.000> where<00:04:43.150> so

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
Dragons expose are pointing in where so

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.720 
Dragons expose are pointing in where so
that's<00:04:43.600> going<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:43.990> be<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.140> good<00:04:44.320> test<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.580> I

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
that's going to be a good test and I

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.310 
that's going to be a good test and I
think<00:04:46.030> we're<00:04:46.210> going<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.450> have<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.690> do<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.870> very

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
think we're going to have to do a very

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.260 
think we're going to have to do a very
similar<00:04:47.740> thing<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.130> what<00:04:48.370> we<00:04:48.640> did<00:04:48.760> last<00:04:48.820> time

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
similar thing to what we did last time

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.380 
similar thing to what we did last time
we<00:04:50.200> do<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.830> deal<00:04:51.040> with<00:04:51.220> two<00:04:51.520> air<00:04:51.850> defenses

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
we do have to deal with two air defenses

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.880 
we do have to deal with two air defenses
here<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.870> need<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.230> try<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.590> get<00:04:53.740> those

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
here so we need to try and get those

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.320 
here so we need to try and get those
down<00:04:54.100> maybe<00:04:54.430> I'm<00:04:54.670> going<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.880> have<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.000> use<00:04:55.180> my

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
down maybe I'm going to have to use my

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.760 
down maybe I'm going to have to use my
Royals<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:55.780> don't<00:04:55.990> know<00:04:56.110> i'm<00:04:56.230> going<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.440> use<00:04:56.590> the
