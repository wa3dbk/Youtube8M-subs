00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 Hi! People, everything welcome, one more. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.629
 reading of the month 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.700
 I'm going to tell you today what I 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.190
 I read the month of March 2015 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.820
 and look very low it was not a very month 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 easy for me I started college and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 I was working too, so I 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.099
 I really could not read much 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 now maybe I should start reading a little 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.019
 but college is eating me 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.079
 enough time have to have a lot 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.350
 for college academic text texts 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.390
 theorists then covers this with me who 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.730
 I started myself by reading the diary 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.610
 by anne frank already has a review here on 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.610
 channel I'll leave the link for that one there 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.399
 underneath is I really do not know much 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 much of this reading and certainly entered 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.379
 to my favorite book list of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.190
 life to a very intense reading as well 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.710
 pretty and a little heavy because people 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.890
 You know you did not survive there. 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.049
 holocaust then yes christi is heavy 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.090
 but I loved doing this reading is 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.280
 a book that I recommend to everyone 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 After I read the honest truth 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.229
 release of the dl game concept 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.270
 death of the book I do not want to leave here 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.640
 his house here because he's always mine. 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 I'm going to the book. She's reading. She's finding it. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950
 cool, I really liked the book, I 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.840
 I think it's cute, I think he's going to make us 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.759
 think mainly with readers 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 because he speaks to this 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.759
 younger audience is the protagonist is 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.570
 a child about 10 years of age and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.310
 who has a terminal illness and he 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.770
 resolves to run away from home because he 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.460
 want to do a second treatment of the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.909
 cancer he is tired of this life that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.000
 sick of in bed living hospital 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.409
 So I remember well how touching it is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.619
 dn game narrative 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.499
 the old dengue mark she is very fluent 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.960
 do you really think you 're reading the point of 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:07.880
 A child's view I really liked the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.470
 his writing has a review there on the blog 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.440
 will leave the link here as well 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.540
 some photos of the book for you to see and 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.160
 I recommend then but by the readers 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.190
 younger readers for more 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.450
 different will not be such a read. 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.120
 So interesting the last book I 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.500
 concludes this month was the other 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.569
 guilherme ramos 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.090
 This is a new publisher's release. 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.370
 century by the talent label of the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.500
 Brazilian literature they throw 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.690
 new authors I really liked the book 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.099
 have a blog review the key here 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.290
 down 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.480
 He is a super cute book he has. 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.290
 some illustrations he has poetry 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.640
 chronic tales and he will address 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.930
 aspects of human relations 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.150
 so he will talk about 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.549
 loving relationships to talk 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.430
 about family relationships about 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.620
 relationship in the workplace and 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.650
 about a bit of spirituality too 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.630
 It's very beautiful, I liked the writing . 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.450
 Guilherme is different. 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.849
 he plays with the words he plays 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.049
 with writing is a very full book of 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.599
 experiments 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.040
 I really liked it, I'm super Indian and 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.079
 I think it's also very cool as a 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.299
 This is a book that talks about 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.000
 many things so I think it 's easy 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.549
 people identify with him I 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.099
 I liked very much I'm indicating to 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.200
 Several people have already spent a lot 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.410
 Congratulations, congratulations, I loved your book. 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.389
 Thank you editor I really liked the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.099
 altruism these were the letters that I 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.959
 End it now, I'll show you 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.139
 readers are in progress in me 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.720
 finally i started ou a game of thrones 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:47.569
 by george martin and I'm on the page 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.400
 170 in the chapter here there are people going 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.470
 show enough 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.450
 I thought I would not like it much more 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.579
 I'm enjoying it very 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.069
 I'm just coming back because the narrative is 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.540
 really slow 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.599
 already knew that would be so but it is sold 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.709
 has a part that knows that 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:11.709
 here she is and where she describes the 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.829
 landscapes and castles and such 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.889
 Jesus has a lot and I already like it a lot 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.459
 the name of the games area I have used the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.520
 safe and for now I gave even off 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.120
 but there the case in which is shown a lot 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 Good, and this is very sad, but I'm 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.250
 finding this drug going interesting 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.169
 happened and he had a day that I 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.630
 I always spoke so I got lots of fries. 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.580
 These people are not like me 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.340
 if this stuff is good I keep reading 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.240
 bete ree lives wala roehrs I want to be me 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.210
 I wrote it I'm on page 164 and you do not 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.470
 in a moment of the narrative I 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.479
 I was waiting for a book that spoke 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.360
 about ballet this level do not talk too much 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.840
 about this and I 'm expecting native 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.210
 more adult native well teenager well 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.009
 for now know that they smell cheering 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.280
 I'm going to finish reading just a lot. 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.900
 I know when but I will conclude guedes 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.789
 now assemble from comics because 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.930
 I finally started reading my edition 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:18.460
 Wonderful earned ozu girlfriend from 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.300
 great and I'm in chapter 4 I read 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.400
 train and three comic chapters 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.659
 because it's so effective here, huh? 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.770
 and he then the first three of nadinho 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.870
 people, which is very good, I knew that 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.880
 This is very good here, but I never 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.199
 had read really great does not know a 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.479
 bit of history and such 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.340
 I know the importance of marina's inside 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.870
 of the universe of hqs that is not a 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.909
 universe that dominates much and I 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.490
 I understand a lot of manga and anime but I 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.990
 I really do understand American comics. 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.870
 one thing I 'm not starting to 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.650
 understand more now but I did not find it much 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.380
 good very little because great is a framework 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.840
 that he subverts every order of what has already 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.720
 had preestablished in heroes 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.080
 americans 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.290
 so it 's incredible, uh 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.720
 I in this edition is South American and a 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.170
 preface of the had to say that is the 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.840
 cartoonist does not give up and the administrator 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.180
 Anyway, it's really good, it's really good and 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.070
 This feeling is wonderful, too. 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.590
 I do a bit later with photos on the blog 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.690
 For you, neither better on the rise, but I 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.220
 I want to finish reading first 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.320
 no spoiler maybe i 'm taking 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.500
 the characters are very complex 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:35.300
 awesome and then study in my head 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:38.150
 of all this, the Brazilian does not 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.920

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.520
