00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
gh3 it's got a redesigned sensor so I've

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
gh3 it's got a redesigned sensor so I've
noticed<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.950> files<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.460> iso<00:00:45.090> 3200<00:00:45.570> they

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
noticed it files up to iso 3200 they

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.220 
noticed it files up to iso 3200 they
look<00:00:46.410> great<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:47.719> have<00:00:48.719> nothing<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.050> complain

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

about<00:00:49.320> using<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> gh3<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:51.899> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
about using the gh3 but but I think this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
about using the gh3 but but I think this
might<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.530> notch<00:00:52.710> above<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.160> far<00:00:53.309> as

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
might be a little notch above as far as

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
might be a little notch above as far as

selection is is really more extensive

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.500

than<00:02:16.680> any<00:02:16.860> other<00:02:17.010> mirrorless<00:02:17.819> camera<00:02:18.150> system

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
than any other mirrorless camera system

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.580 
than any other mirrorless camera system
and<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.140> reasons<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.439> I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
and it's one of the reasons that I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.660 
and it's one of the reasons that I
started<00:02:19.860> shooting<00:02:20.040> Micro<00:02:20.489> Four<00:02:20.610> Thirds

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
started shooting Micro Four Thirds

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.399 
started shooting Micro Four Thirds
myself<00:02:21.239> about<00:02:22.079> two<00:02:22.260> years<00:02:22.439> ago<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.840> for

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
myself about two years ago this is for

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.809 
myself about two years ago this is for
example<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.860> seven<00:02:26.159> to<00:02:26.250> fourteen<00:02:26.610> millimeter

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
example a seven to fourteen millimeter

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.750 
example a seven to fourteen millimeter
f4<00:02:27.540> which<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.409> a<00:02:28.439> 14<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> 28<00:02:29.310> millimeter

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
f4 which is a 14 to 28 millimeter

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.690 
f4 which is a 14 to 28 millimeter
equivalent<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.390> you've<00:02:30.569> basically<00:02:30.750> got<00:02:31.700> 14

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
equivalent so you've basically got 14

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.069 
equivalent so you've basically got 14
millimeters<00:02:33.319> fish<00:02:34.319> eye<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.920> wide<00:02:35.069> end<00:02:35.099> to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
millimeters fish eye on the wide end to

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.319 
millimeters fish eye on the wide end to
600<00:02:37.079> millimeter<00:02:37.379> equivalent<00:02:37.920> telephoto<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
600 millimeter equivalent telephoto and

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.759 
600 millimeter equivalent telephoto and
everything<00:02:39.659> in<00:02:39.750> between<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.379> covers<00:02:40.590> a

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
everything in between so that covers a

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.160 
everything in between so that covers a
pretty<00:02:41.010> big<00:02:41.189> pretty<00:02:41.730> big<00:02:41.970> range<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.750> noticed

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
pretty big pretty big range I noticed

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.110 
pretty big pretty big range I noticed
that<00:02:43.769> when<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.040> showed<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.459> images<00:02:44.819> on<00:02:45.000> the

that when you showed the images on the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.009 
that when you showed the images on the
screen<00:02:45.409> the<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.980> fidelity<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
screen the the fidelity and the the

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.039 
screen the the fidelity and the the
sharpness<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.459> outstanding<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:51.959> you

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049
