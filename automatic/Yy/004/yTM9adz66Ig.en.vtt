00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.410
 watch the future come 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.900
 more interesting and more interesting look at 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
 Mediatek solution for a long time 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.710
 There are devices on the market with 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.590
 wireless charging module for a long time 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.240
 there are docks themselves for such charging 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.810
 many standards in mediatek have developed 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 chip mt 3188 which works immediately with 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.830
 all at the moment most 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.219
 three wireless standards are popular 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.660
 charge is chap mei and reasons most 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.420
 common standard is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.610
 of course than this induction charging 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.410
 This is in lumia phones 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.280
 nexus sony xperia z3 devices you and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.020
 where many more 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.610
 This is a common global standard that allows 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.039
 charge up to four 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.410
 centimeters is not particularly fast but the most 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.600
 popular charging standard api and we 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.230
 almost the same but works for others 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.789
 frequencies 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 but the reasons are interesting because 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.829
 uses magnetic resonance method and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 allows you to charge at a greater distance 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.789
 several devices and power 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.619
 can reach up to 50 watts that is, 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 Essentially, the laptop can be charged 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.729
 the only problem is that this 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.159
 standard barely makes its way onto 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.990
 market competitors us a lot of popular 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 so here is a new chip from mediatek 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 supports all three standards at once 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.080
 This for manufacturers it is also worth 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.880
 as one standard chip therefore 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.830
 cost for example phone because of this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 will not grow but still more 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.850
 I wonder how in this case will be 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.970
 look this very future reasons 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 charges at a distance it's great 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.259
 we shift the device to charge than 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.350
 everything works okay now foam 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.540
 also works already, ekiy sells 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.570
 tables and bedside tables with such a charger 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.020
 me it is built into this thing but such 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.180
 an approach 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.610
 more interesting it seems that it is just 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.770
 the table but the phone is somehow charging 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.869
 the fact is that under this table is 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.040
 charger working on 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.399
 distance here is the future smt board 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.500
 3188 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.079
 and the coils are very thin she is calm 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.969
 fit in this iphone case need 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.920
 just connect the lightning and all 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.290
 now iphone can be charged from any 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.720
 wireless source if you take a look 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.790
 on a similar case for xperia z3 then how 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.549
 you can see how this board looks 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.349
 she is really very thin soon 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.510
 such a universal chip from mediatek 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.340
 will start to build in the phone and tablet and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.159
 not even wearable smart watches 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.750
 For example, the chip has already been certified so 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.790
 that the first devices that can 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.930
 charge literally everything we probably 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.930
 we will see this year already
