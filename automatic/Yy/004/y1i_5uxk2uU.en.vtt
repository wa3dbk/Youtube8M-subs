with one eye I'm going to pick up the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.040 
with one eye I'm going to pick up the
loops<00:02:25.600> one<00:02:26.440> at<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.800> time<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.660> I'm<00:02:28.660> going<00:02:28.930> to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
loops one at a time and I'm going to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.600 
loops one at a time and I'm going to
place<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.709> loops<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.840> needle<00:02:31.870> directly

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
place the loops on the needle directly

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.010 
place the loops on the needle directly
above<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.030> it's<00:02:34.300> going<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.690> every<00:02:34.930> other

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
above but it's going to be every other

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.100 
above but it's going to be every other
needle<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.800> this<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.580> going<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.110> second

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
needle so this is going to go on second

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.800 
needle so this is going to go on second
needle<00:02:38.800> one<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:40.140> next<00:02:41.140> loop<00:02:41.760> skip<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.910> needle<00:02:43.239> it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
needle one to next loop skip a needle it

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.640 
needle one to next loop skip a needle it
goes<00:02:44.050> on<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.800> fourth<00:02:45.130> needle<00:02:45.610> next<00:02:46.450> one<00:02:46.810> goes

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
goes on the fourth needle next one goes

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.440 
goes on the fourth needle next one goes

when I get over to this slide if I have
trouble<00:03:06.330> seeing<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.720> loop<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.620> give<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.220> a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
trouble seeing the loop I just give it a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.310 
trouble seeing the loop I just give it a
stretch<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.480> stretched<00:03:09.780> more<00:03:10.050> into

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
stretch so that it stretched more into

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.040 
stretch so that it stretched more into
the<00:03:10.470> shape<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.700> position<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.390> was<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.540> when<00:03:13.020> I

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
the shape and position it was in when I

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.810 
the shape and position it was in when I
first<00:03:13.640> pulled<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.590> see<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.460> last

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
first pulled it and I can see that last

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.280 
first pulled it and I can see that last
loop

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.089 

the<00:03:21.530> last<00:03:21.830> loop<00:03:22.129> is<00:03:22.340> right<00:03:22.720> here<00:03:23.930> pick<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.860> up

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
the last loop is right here pick that up

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.910 
the last loop is right here pick that up
put<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.519> here

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
put it here

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.400

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and that's the hem picked up as I've

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.380 
and that's the hem picked up as I've
been<00:03:32.560> doing<00:03:32.980> on<00:03:33.130> these<00:03:33.340> letting<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.270> go

been doing on these letting you go

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.130 
been doing on these letting you go
forward<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.230> hold<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> hem<00:03:36.250> back<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.810> knits

off very easily in a few rows you have

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.120 
off very easily in a few rows you have
probably<00:03:54.040> noticed<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:54.940> don't<00:03:55.180> don't<00:03:55.570> knit

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
probably noticed that I don't don't knit

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.420 
probably noticed that I don't don't knit
very<00:03:57.130> very<00:03:57.489> fast<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:58.150> try<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.720> maintain<00:03:59.310> kind<00:04:00.310> of

very very fast I try to maintain kind of
a<00:04:00.520> slow<00:04:00.880> even<00:04:01.510> speed<00:04:02.010> because<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.970> seems<00:04:04.239> to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
a slow even speed because it seems to

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.290 
a slow even speed because it seems to
make<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.780> Knitting<00:04:05.080> come<00:04:05.290> out<00:04:05.500> or<00:04:05.860> even<00:04:06.300> now

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
make the Knitting come out or even now

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.530 
make the Knitting come out or even now
I'm<00:04:07.420> going<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.810> remove<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:09.100> Ravel<00:04:09.610> cord<00:04:09.640> by

I'm going to remove this Ravel cord by

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.009 
I'm going to remove this Ravel cord by

pulling this Ravel cord off
discard<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.320> waste<00:04:14.620> yarn<00:04:14.950> this<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:15.970> what<00:04:16.329> the

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
discard the waste yarn this is what the

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.949 
discard the waste yarn this is what the
inside<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.380> hand<00:04:17.709> looks<00:04:18.160> like

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
inside of this hand looks like

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.249 
inside of this hand looks like
this<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.769> what<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.519> outside<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.990> ham

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
this is what the outside of this ham

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.520 
this is what the outside of this ham
looks<00:04:24.160> like<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.639> makes<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:25.000> wonderful<00:04:25.530> picot

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
looks like it makes a wonderful picot

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.790 
looks like it makes a wonderful picot
hem<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:28.090> contrast<00:04:28.539> let<00:04:29.139> me<00:04:29.229> get<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.530> other

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
hem and to contrast let me get the other

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.180 
hem and to contrast let me get the other
people<00:04:30.250> hem

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.910 

the<00:04:37.190> other<00:04:37.430> people<00:04:37.760> hem<00:04:38.210> that<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.510> just<00:04:38.870> did<00:04:39.200> is

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
the other people hem that I just did is

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.640 
the other people hem that I just did is
a<00:04:39.980> little<00:04:40.370> bulkier<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.270> flares<00:04:41.660> out<00:04:41.960> more

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
a little bulkier and it flares out more

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.820 
a little bulkier and it flares out more
so<00:04:43.220> this<00:04:43.460> one<00:04:43.730> is<00:04:44.030> thinner<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:45.260> lies<00:04:45.500> more

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
so this one is thinner and it lies more

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.270 
so this one is thinner and it lies more
flat<00:04:46.360> however<00:04:47.360> this<00:04:47.840> one<00:04:48.110> doesn't<00:04:48.350> look<00:04:48.650> so

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
flat however this one doesn't look so

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.560 
flat however this one doesn't look so
good<00:04:49.460> on<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.820> other<00:04:49.970> side

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
good on the other side

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.450 
good on the other side
on<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.080> other<00:04:51.170> side<00:04:51.260> it's<00:04:51.680> more<00:04:51.950> spider

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
on the other side it's more spider

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.110 
on the other side it's more spider
webbing<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:54.110> that<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:55.010> little<00:04:55.700> shortcut

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
webbing so that is a little shortcut

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.530 
webbing so that is a little shortcut
picot<00:04:56.720> hem<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:57.830> love<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.580> use<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:59.060> use<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.420> on
