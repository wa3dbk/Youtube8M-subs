00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
like a blown-up diagram it says sleeper

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.290 
like a blown-up diagram it says sleeper
simulant<00:00:45.740> it<00:00:46.400> basically<00:00:46.700> just<00:00:46.910> looks<00:00:47.090> like<00:00:47.180> a

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
simulant it basically just looks like a

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.960 
simulant it basically just looks like a
blown-up<00:00:47.720> image<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.920> sniper<00:00:49.310> of<00:00:49.610> it<00:00:49.760> being

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
blown-up image of a sniper of it being

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.700 
blown-up image of a sniper of it being
like<00:00:50.150> assembled<00:00:50.750> or<00:00:50.870> something<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.380> if<00:00:51.590> you

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
like assembled or something and if you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.780 
like assembled or something and if you
actually<00:00:51.800> look<00:00:51.980> it<00:00:52.220> has<00:00:52.370> these<00:00:52.550> same

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
actually look it has these same

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.229 
actually look it has these same
triangles<00:00:53.450> as<00:00:53.630> the<00:00:54.020> ACD<00:00:54.590> feedback<00:00:55.130> fence<00:00:55.460> for

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
triangles as the ACD feedback fence for

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.280 
triangles as the ACD feedback fence for
the<00:00:56.329> Titan<00:00:56.720> if<00:00:56.810> you<00:00:56.870> don't<00:00:57.020> know<00:00:57.079> what<00:00:57.170> they

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
the Titan if you don't know what they

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.780 
the Titan if you don't know what they
are<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:57.590> is<00:00:57.649> what<00:00:57.890> they<00:00:57.980> are<00:00:58.010> here<00:00:58.130> they<00:00:58.640> are

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
are this is what they are here they are

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.970 
are this is what they are here they are
a<00:00:58.820> pair<00:00:59.060> of<00:00:59.120> Titan<00:00:59.600> exotics<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.530> active

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
a pair of Titan exotics the active

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.010 
a pair of Titan exotics the active
contact<00:01:01.399> defense<00:01:01.730> system<00:01:02.120> uses<00:01:02.450> water<00:01:02.630> hole

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
contact defense system uses water hole

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.960 
contact defense system uses water hole
material<00:01:03.470> to<00:01:03.590> store<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.890> retaliatory<00:01:04.369> charge

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
material to store a retaliatory charge

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.359 
material to store a retaliatory charge
so<00:01:05.570> could<00:01:05.810> we<00:01:05.930> be<00:01:06.079> seeing<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.619> light<00:01:06.920> sniper

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
so could we be seeing a light sniper

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.609 
so could we be seeing a light sniper
which<00:01:07.670> possibly<00:01:07.939> shoots<00:01:08.750> electric<00:01:09.469> or

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
which possibly shoots electric or

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.380 
which possibly shoots electric or
something<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.250> would<00:01:10.369> be<00:01:10.430> insane<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.119> could

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
something that would be insane it could

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.060 
something that would be insane it could
be<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.570> shotgun<00:01:12.020> I<00:01:12.079> have<00:01:12.200> no<00:01:12.380> idea<00:01:12.649> but<00:01:12.829> it<00:01:12.920> looks

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
be a shotgun I have no idea but it looks

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.469 
be a shotgun I have no idea but it looks
more<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.370> a<00:01:13.430> sniper<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:14.120> me

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
more of a sniper to me

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.480 
more of a sniper to me
if<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.290> actually<00:01:15.380> look<00:01:15.560> up<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.979> top<00:01:16.220> right

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
if you actually look up in the top right

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.980 
if you actually look up in the top right
here<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:16.760> can<00:01:16.880> actually<00:01:17.000> see<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.330> side<00:01:17.600> view<00:01:17.630> of

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
here you can actually see a side view of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.660 
here you can actually see a side view of
it<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.290> then<00:01:18.650> a<00:01:18.740> front<00:01:19.040> view<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:19.520> like

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
it and then a front view and then I like

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.700 
it and then a front view and then I like
a<00:01:19.700> top-down<00:01:20.240> view<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.570> think<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.350> if

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
a top-down view I think that is and if

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.289 
a top-down view I think that is and if
you<00:01:21.799> actually<00:01:21.920> look<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.490> top<00:01:22.760> left<00:01:23.090> you

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
you actually look to the top left you

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.570 
you actually look to the top left you
can<00:01:23.330> see<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:23.750> little<00:01:23.930> icon<00:01:24.440> thingy<00:01:24.950> it's<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
can see this little icon thingy it's the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.000 
can see this little icon thingy it's the
same<00:01:25.790> icon<00:01:26.270> as<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.630> pocket<00:01:27.020> infinity<00:01:27.560> for<00:01:27.920> the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
same icon as the pocket infinity for the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.920 
same icon as the pocket infinity for the
last<00:01:28.280> upgrade<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.000> is<00:01:29.090> also<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.630> same

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
last upgrade and it is also the same

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.890 
last upgrade and it is also the same
picture<00:01:30.530> for<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.280> ACD<00:01:31.790> feedback<00:01:32.299> fence<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
picture for the ACD feedback fence the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.170 
picture for the ACD feedback fence the
rough<00:01:33.440> conductors<00:01:34.070> which<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:34.820> thought<00:01:35.000> was

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
rough conductors which I thought was

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.670
