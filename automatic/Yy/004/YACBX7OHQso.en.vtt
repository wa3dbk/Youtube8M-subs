change<00:01:30.210> your<00:01:30.659> player<00:01:30.869> name<00:01:31.220> for<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.310> in-game

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
change your player name for your in-game

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
change your player name for your in-game
name<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> essentially<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.509> had<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> edit

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
name you essentially just had to edit

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.749 
name you essentially just had to edit
this<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.829> piece<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.070> code<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.490> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this little piece of code and this I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.249 
this little piece of code and this I
think<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.299> notepad<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.900> something<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
think was like notepad or something so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.899 
think was like notepad or something so
as<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:37.979> ahead<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> yourself<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.790> can

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
as you can see ahead of yourself you can

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760 
as you can see ahead of yourself you can
see<00:01:39.090> Jack<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.600> Jack<00:01:39.840> frog's<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> entire

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
see Jack was Jack frog's for the entire

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.010 
see Jack was Jack frog's for the entire
event<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.250> X<00:01:41.520> Factor<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.390> decided

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
event there was X Factor and I decided

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.929 
event there was X Factor and I decided
to<00:01:43.200> name<00:01:43.320> my<00:01:43.500> self<00:01:43.740> level<00:01:44.040> cap<00:01:44.220> gaming<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.790> as

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
to name my self level cap gaming just as

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.550 
to name my self level cap gaming just as
a<00:01:44.970> joke<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.689> pursuit<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.049> point<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.380> time

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
a joke for this pursuit of point in time

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.160 
a joke for this pursuit of point in time
which<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.759> wasn't<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.270> funny<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> thought

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
which it wasn't that funny but I thought

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.359 
which it wasn't that funny but I thought
it<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> funny<00:01:49.860> at<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.040> time

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it was kind of funny at the time

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
it was kind of funny at the time
does<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.119> funny<00:01:51.329> now<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.189> even<00:01:53.189> need

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
does not that funny now but even need

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.310 
does not that funny now but even need
some<00:01:53.549> other<00:01:53.670> games<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.210> remember<00:01:54.450> I'd<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.899> was

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
some other games I remember I'd I was

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.289 
some other games I remember I'd I was
able<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> somehow<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.310> name<00:01:56.549> myself<00:01:57.000> into<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
able to somehow just name myself into a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.959 
able to somehow just name myself into a
smiley<00:01:57.810> face<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.500> there's<00:01:59.310> no<00:01:59.520> need<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.729> be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
smiley face like there's no need to be

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.450 
smiley face like there's no need to be
upset<00:02:00.119> friends<00:02:00.810> yeah<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:02.219> name

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
upset friends yeah that's that that name

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.219 
upset friends yeah that's that that name
was<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.909> funny<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.479> half<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> second

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
was kind of funny for like half a second

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.990 
was kind of funny for like half a second
but<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> ability<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.490> change<00:02:05.759> names

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
but just the ability to change names

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.730 
but just the ability to change names
keep<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.360> mind<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:07.049> necessarily

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
keep in mind that that's not necessarily

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
keep in mind that that's not necessarily
I<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.340> never<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> Russian<00:02:09.060> badger

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
I was that was never the Russian badger

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.790 
I was that was never the Russian badger
about<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.960> event<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.530> thought<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
about this event because I thought that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.310 
about this event because I thought that
was<00:02:10.890> too<00:02:11.009> bland<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.520> boring<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> would<00:02:13.080> say

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
was too bland and boring but I would say

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.960 
was too bland and boring but I would say
that<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:13.890> was<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> lot<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.310> guys<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.700> didn't

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
that there was a lot of guys that didn't

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.460 
that there was a lot of guys that didn't
quite<00:02:15.150> understand<00:02:15.630> how<00:02:15.870> close<00:02:16.170> quarters

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
quite understand how close quarters

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.740 
quite understand how close quarters
oriented<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:16.980> map<00:02:17.190> was<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.300> took

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
oriented this map was and I took

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.090 
oriented this map was and I took
advantage<00:02:19.020> with<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> mtar<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:19.860> not<00:02:19.980> gonna

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
advantage with the mtar I'm not gonna

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.500 
advantage with the mtar I'm not gonna
say<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.310> mtar<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.670> broken<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.390> is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
say the mtar is broken but it is

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750 
say the mtar is broken but it is
definitely<00:02:22.080> probably<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.190> best<00:02:23.370> car<00:02:23.610> line

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
definitely probably the best car line

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.450 
definitely probably the best car line
for<00:02:24.000> any<00:02:24.150> sort<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.600> or<00:02:24.900> carbine<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:26.070> any<00:02:26.220> sort

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
for any sort of or carbine for any sort

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.580 
for any sort of or carbine for any sort
of<00:02:26.550> close<00:02:26.760> quarters<00:02:27.240> oriented<00:02:27.870> map<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:28.350> with

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of close quarters oriented map now with

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.860 
of close quarters oriented map now with
in<00:02:29.400> terms<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.790> chain-link<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.330> think<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> lot<00:02:30.780> of

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
in terms of chain-link I think a lot of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.150 
in terms of chain-link I think a lot of
people<00:02:31.050> misunderstood<00:02:31.560> exactly<00:02:31.980> how<00:02:32.070> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
people misunderstood exactly how it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.860 
people misunderstood exactly how it
works<00:02:32.310> essentially<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.330> just<00:02:33.360> want<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.720> make

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
works essentially you just want to make

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.130 
works essentially you just want to make
as<00:02:34.020> many<00:02:34.280> links<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> chain<00:02:35.790> obviously<00:02:36.480> but

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
as many links in the chain obviously but

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.380 
as many links in the chain obviously but
the<00:02:37.440> more<00:02:37.650> adjacent<00:02:38.280> by<00:02:38.640> capturing<00:02:39.120> sort<00:02:39.330> of

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the more adjacent by capturing sort of

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.210 
the more adjacent by capturing sort of
adjacent<00:02:39.810> points<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.200> make<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.620> chain<00:02:40.980> link

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
adjacent points you make a chain link

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580 
adjacent points you make a chain link
and<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.640> top<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.660> not<00:02:43.020> what<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and on top of that it's not what I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.350 
and on top of that it's not what I
thought<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.040> was<00:02:44.160> originally<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.940> thought<00:02:45.209> it

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
thought it was originally I thought it

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.780 
thought it was originally I thought it
was<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.570> tug<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.870> war<00:02:45.990> where<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.790> could

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
was like a tug of war where you could

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120 
was like a tug of war where you could
only<00:02:47.970> cap<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:48.810> flag<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:49.560> soon<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.920> cap

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
only cap one flag so as soon as you cap

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.220 
only cap one flag so as soon as you cap
one<00:02:50.370> flag<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.270> then<00:02:51.390> cap<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> next<00:02:52.080> one

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
one flag you can then cap the next one

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.650 
one flag you can then cap the next one
but<00:02:52.440> only<00:02:52.709> one<00:02:53.220> flag<00:02:53.520> was<00:02:53.790> open<00:02:54.120> at<00:02:54.240> any<00:02:54.330> point

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
but only one flag was open at any point

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.120 
but only one flag was open at any point
in<00:02:54.720> time<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:54.930> both<00:02:55.410> teams<00:02:55.650> had<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> fight

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
in time that both teams had to fight

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.520

domination<00:03:19.680> but<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.040> definitely<00:03:20.580> very

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
domination but it is definitely very

quick and yet again you just want to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.320 
quick and yet again you just want to

so don't think that it's excessively

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.290 
so don't think that it's excessively

that you already have adjacent flags and
you<00:03:40.320> also<00:03:40.470> want<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.830> make<00:03:40.950> sure<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.160> you

adjacent points that's that's really the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.130 
adjacent points that's that's really the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
gist of it because I was just like you I

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
gist of it because I was just like you I
was<00:03:58.260> thinking<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.709> was<00:03:58.769> gonna<00:03:58.890> be<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> lot

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
was thinking that it was gonna be a lot

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.199 
was thinking that it was gonna be a lot

more complex and kobe wesley snipes from

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
dad from downtown and i I was just like

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.430 
dad from downtown and i I was just like
you<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.360> didn't<00:04:06.630> think<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.840> would<00:04:06.930> get<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.230> but

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
you I didn't think I would get that but

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.740 
you I didn't think I would get that but
I<00:04:07.500> somehow<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:08.010> with<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.370> m67<00:04:08.880> frag<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.600> all

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
I somehow it with the m67 frag of all

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.300 
I somehow it with the m67 frag of all
things<00:04:09.989> nobody<00:04:10.200> even<00:04:10.530> uses<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:11.100> thing

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
things nobody even uses that thing

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.770 
things nobody even uses that thing
anymore<00:04:11.519> it's<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:11.880> generic<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.570> it's<00:04:12.660> so

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
anymore it's so generic and it's so

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.130 
you're welcome so in general I would say
that<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.580> gonna<00:04:17.820> be<00:04:17.910> invaluable<00:04:18.299> not<00:04:18.870> only

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
that it is gonna be invaluable not only

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.690 
that it is gonna be invaluable not only
to<00:04:19.260> use<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.500> mtar<00:04:19.830> but<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.099> think<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> amp<00:04:20.520> car

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
to use the mtar but I think the amp car

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.629 
to use the mtar but I think the amp car
is<00:04:20.789> pretty<00:04:21.030> unbe

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
is pretty unbe

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.490

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
if you're not gonna use a shotgun or any

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.499 
if you're not gonna use a shotgun or any
sort<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.919> like<00:04:24.610> if<00:04:24.699> you're<00:04:24.849> not<00:04:24.879> gonna<00:04:25.060> use<00:04:25.180> I

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.839 
don't know an m10 14 or a spaz or an 870
I<00:04:28.360> think<00:04:28.840> as<00:04:29.080> far<00:04:29.620> as<00:04:29.830> automatic<00:04:30.400> weapons<00:04:30.699> go

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
I think as far as automatic weapons go

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.640 
I think as far as automatic weapons go
you<00:04:31.060> can't<00:04:31.360> really<00:04:31.629> lose<00:04:31.780> with<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> M<00:04:32.199> tall<00:04:32.439> it

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
you can't really lose with the M tall it

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.740 
you can't really lose with the M tall it
is<00:04:32.800> just<00:04:32.979> so<00:04:33.159> extremely<00:04:33.550> good<00:04:33.789> it<00:04:34.330> kills<00:04:34.569> so

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
is just so extremely good it kills so

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.719 
is just so extremely good it kills so
extremely<00:04:35.080> fast<00:04:35.379> in<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.590> bullpup<00:04:36.009> additionally

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
extremely fast in a bullpup additionally

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.640 
extremely fast in a bullpup additionally
it<00:04:36.849> is<00:04:37.030> very<00:04:37.270> very<00:04:37.479> convenient<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.110> have<00:04:38.139> I

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
it is very very convenient to have I

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.850 
it is very very convenient to have I
picked<00:04:39.580> up<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.939> f2000<00:04:40.900> not<00:04:41.139> really<00:04:41.469> sure<00:04:41.680> why

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
picked up the f2000 not really sure why

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.830 
picked up the f2000 not really sure why
this<00:04:41.919> guy<00:04:42.280> would<00:04:42.580> be<00:04:42.610> using<00:04:43.060> a<00:04:43.150> potato<00:04:43.449> grip

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
this guy would be using a potato grip

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.240 
this guy would be using a potato grip
and<00:04:44.050> this<00:04:44.139> sort<00:04:44.349> of<00:04:44.439> a<00:04:44.500> sight<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:45.039> that

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
and this sort of a sight that is that

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.879 
and this sort of a sight that is that
obstructive<00:04:45.849> but<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.330> guess<00:04:47.229> he's<00:04:47.439> gonna<00:04:47.650> kind

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
obstructive but I guess he's gonna kind

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.010 
obstructive but I guess he's gonna kind
of<00:04:48.009> do<00:04:48.159> his<00:04:48.280> own<00:04:48.430> thing<00:04:48.490> but<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.449> general<00:04:49.840> I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
of do his own thing but in general I

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.659 
of do his own thing but in general I
would<00:04:50.080> say<00:04:50.169> chain-link<00:04:50.740> is<00:04:50.860> very<00:04:51.159> fun

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
would say chain-link is very fun

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.240 
would say chain-link is very fun
it's<00:04:51.789> very<00:04:52.509> domination<00:04:53.379> oriented<00:04:53.889> but<00:04:54.190> I

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
it's very domination oriented but I

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.589 
it's very domination oriented but I
think<00:04:54.490> it's<00:04:54.610> gonna<00:04:54.699> be<00:04:54.849> half<00:04:55.000> -<00:04:55.180> it's<00:04:55.479> gonna

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
think it's gonna be half - it's gonna

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.700 
think it's gonna be half - it's gonna
have<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.960> be<00:04:56.050> played<00:04:56.259> a<00:04:56.289> little<00:04:56.620> bit

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
have to be played a little bit

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.749 
have to be played a little bit
differently<00:04:57.069> for<00:04:57.310> you<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.490> be<00:04:57.580> successful

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
differently for you to be successful

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.339 
differently for you to be successful
it's<00:04:58.210> like<00:04:58.360> you<00:04:58.449> can<00:04:58.539> just<00:04:58.690> cap<00:04:58.810> any<00:04:59.020> points

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
it's like you can just cap any points

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.450 
it's like you can just cap any points
that<00:04:59.379> you<00:04:59.530> want<00:04:59.710> there's<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.009> little<00:05:00.159> more

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
that you want there's a little more

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.119 
that you want there's a little more
strategy<00:05:00.909> out<00:05:01.509> of<00:05:01.780> exactly<00:05:02.530> which<00:05:02.710> points<00:05:03.069> you

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
strategy out of exactly which points you

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.100 
strategy out of exactly which points you
want<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.370> cap<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.819> break<00:05:04.180> certain<00:05:04.509> lengths<00:05:04.930> of
