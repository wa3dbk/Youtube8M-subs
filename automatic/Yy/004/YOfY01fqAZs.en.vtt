00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
that you'd like if the school chooses to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
that you'd like if the school chooses to
support<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
support it if you know you have the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.910 
support it if you know you have the
ingredients<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.409> place<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
ingredients there in place as a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.260 
ingredients there in place as a
university<00:01:11.520> its<00:01:11.670> attractive<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
university its attractive to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.600 
university its attractive to
student-athletes<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.110> think<00:01:13.409> both<00:01:14.100> VCU

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
student-athletes and i think both VCU

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.830 
student-athletes and i think both VCU
and<00:01:14.729> akron<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.360> attractive<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and akron are very attractive to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
and akron are very attractive to
students<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.680> i<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.189> big<00:01:17.400> piece

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
students and i think that's a big piece

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060 
students and i think that's a big piece
of<00:01:17.939> why<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.049> successful<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.710> as

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
of why you can be successful here as

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
of why you can be successful here as
well<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> support<00:01:21.030> within<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.540> department

come<00:03:30.700> here<00:03:30.940> well<00:03:31.569> I<00:03:31.660> think<00:03:32.080> it's<00:03:32.319> about<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
come here well I think it's about the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.380 
come here well I think it's about the
opportunity<00:03:33.190> it's<00:03:33.550> about<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> opportunity

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
opportunity it's about the opportunity

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.080 
opportunity it's about the opportunity
to<00:03:34.510> come<00:03:34.780> somewhere<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.880> realize<00:03:36.880> your

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
potential as a student and as an athlete

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.490 
potential as a student and as an athlete
I<00:03:39.130> think<00:03:39.700> our<00:03:39.790> soccer<00:03:40.060> program<00:03:40.600> will<00:03:40.989> be<00:03:41.200> an

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
I think our soccer program will be an

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.800 
I think our soccer program will be an
opportunity<00:03:41.709> for<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.790> lot<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.209> young<00:03:43.420> men<00:03:43.600> to

opportunity for a lot of young men to

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.630 
opportunity for a lot of young men to
come<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.290> realize<00:03:44.590> their<00:03:44.920> goals<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.459> dreams

special soccer places a soccer tradition

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.880 
special soccer places a soccer tradition
a<00:03:51.489> community<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.630> embraces<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.380> game<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
a community that embraces the game and

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.100 
a community that embraces the game and
you<00:03:54.459> know<00:03:54.549> be<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.940> first<00:03:55.209> ones<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.569> come<00:03:55.810> and

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
you know be the first ones to come and

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.059 
you know be the first ones to come and
be<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.440> one<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.709> wins<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.950> national

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069

be the one that wins the national
championship<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.239> that's<00:03:59.019> probably<00:03:59.319> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
championship and so that's probably the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.680 
championship and so that's probably the
direction<00:04:00.069> and<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.430> goal<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.940> that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690

everybody has and that's certainly a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.320

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
we're going to see on the field style of

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.910 
we're going to see on the field style of
play<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:11.019> sort<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.380> thing<00:04:11.440> everybody<00:04:11.860> wants

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920

play that sort of thing everybody wants
to<00:04:12.100> know<00:04:12.190> what<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.400> know<00:04:12.489> what's<00:04:12.670> going<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.850> be

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
to know what you know what's going to be

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.030 
to know what you know what's going to be
our<00:04:12.970> signature<00:04:13.480> well<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.230> think<00:04:14.410> our<00:04:14.530> signature

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
our signature well I think our signature

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.190 
our signature well I think our signature
is<00:04:15.100> going<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.400> be<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.580> very<00:04:16.000> attractive<00:04:16.329> yet

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
is going to be a very attractive yet

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.110 
is going to be a very attractive yet
effective<00:04:17.709> style<00:04:17.889> of<00:04:18.070> play<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:18.970> think

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
effective style of play and so I think

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.120 
effective style of play and so I think
you<00:04:19.570> know<00:04:19.600> defending<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:20.440> attacking<00:04:20.470> with

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
you know defending and attacking with

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.409 
you know defending and attacking with
equal<00:04:21.459> intensity<00:04:23.250> helping<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.460> not<00:04:24.669> only<00:04:24.820> play

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
equal intensity helping to not only play

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.300 
equal intensity helping to not only play
an<00:04:25.510> attractive<00:04:25.960> style<00:04:26.229> but<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:27.010> I<00:04:27.100> said

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
an attractive style but to like I said

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.920 
an attractive style but to like I said
be<00:04:27.490> effective<00:04:27.940> in<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.600> think<00:04:28.840> our

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
be effective in it and so I think our

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.140 
be effective in it and so I think our
teams<00:04:29.140> are<00:04:29.200> going<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.380> defend<00:04:29.680> well<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.150> we're

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
teams are going to defend well and we're

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.610 
teams are going to defend well and we're
going<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.330> do<00:04:31.450> our<00:04:31.510> best<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:32.050> play<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.500> game

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
going to do our best to play the game

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.990 
going to do our best to play the game
the<00:04:32.770> right<00:04:32.800> way<00:04:32.919> put<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> ball<00:04:33.610> on<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.760> ground

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
the right way put the ball on the ground

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.120 
the right way put the ball on the ground
possess<00:04:34.539> it<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.810> create<00:04:35.229> opportunities<00:04:35.860> to

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
possess it and create opportunities to
