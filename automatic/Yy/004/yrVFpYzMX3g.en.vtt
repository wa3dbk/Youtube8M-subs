okay I'm going to attempt to show this
again<00:00:04.490> here's<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> engine<00:00:06.649> intake<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:08.099> is

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
again here's the engine intake this is

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.900 
again here's the engine intake this is
the<00:00:08.429> actual<00:00:08.760> intake<00:00:09.179> flap<00:00:09.510> motor<00:00:10.550> that<00:00:11.550> keeps

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the actual intake flap motor that keeps

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.770 
the actual intake flap motor that keeps
getting<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> air<00:00:13.130> p2<00:00:14.130> 0<00:00:14.460> 1<00:00:14.790> 5

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
getting with the air p2 0 1 5

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.279 
getting with the air p2 0 1 5
only<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.139> one<00:00:16.320> hand<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.770> bear<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.070> me<00:00:18.289> now

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
only have one hand so bear with me now

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.880 
only have one hand so bear with me now
the<00:00:19.350> actual<00:00:19.770> piece<00:00:20.430> if<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.300> look<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:22.230> let<00:00:22.859> me

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the actual piece if you look here let me

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:33.250 
the actual piece if you look here let me
zoom<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.340> sorry<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:24.420> video

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.819 

okay<00:00:34.430> this<00:00:35.120> piece<00:00:35.660> is<00:00:35.930> what<00:00:36.110> moves<00:00:36.380> forward

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
okay this piece is what moves forward

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.290 
okay this piece is what moves forward
and<00:00:36.920> back<00:00:37.070> at<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.460> end<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.880> it<00:00:38.030> there's<00:00:38.210> a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
and back at the end of it there's a

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.840 
and back at the end of it there's a
piece<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.440> knob<00:00:39.710> kind<00:00:40.579> of<00:00:40.670> looks<00:00:40.790> like

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
piece that the knob kind of looks like

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.119 
piece that the knob kind of looks like
this<00:00:41.120> if<00:00:41.300> you've<00:00:41.420> taken<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:42.559> off<00:00:42.770> which<00:00:43.010> I

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
this if you've taken this off which I

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.640 
this if you've taken this off which I
have<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.940> clean<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.780> out<00:00:44.960> just<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.230> check<00:00:45.470> this

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
have to clean it out just to check this

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.549 
have to clean it out just to check this
out<00:00:45.890> compare<00:00:46.190> what's<00:00:46.400> wrong<00:00:46.610> now<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:46.940> know<00:00:47.559> now

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
out compare what's wrong now I know now

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.560 
out compare what's wrong now I know now
there's<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.550> actual<00:00:52.879> intake<00:00:53.269> motor

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
there's a the the actual intake motor

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.530 
there's a the the actual intake motor
has<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:53.870> flap<00:00:54.489> then<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:55.640> moves<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:56.059> course<00:00:56.300> and

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
has a flap then that moves of course and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.290 
has a flap then that moves of course and
the<00:00:57.050> hinge<00:00:57.320> that<00:00:57.440> actually<00:00:57.800> moves<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.430> arm<00:00:59.000> I

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
the hinge that actually moves the arm I

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.960 
the hinge that actually moves the arm I
guess<00:00:59.449> you<00:00:59.570> call<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.829> slides<00:01:00.829> on<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.670> piece

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
guess you call it slides on this piece

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.450 
guess you call it slides on this piece
which<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:02.449> piece<00:01:02.659> is<00:01:03.040> measuring<00:01:04.040> this<00:01:04.250> piece

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
which this piece is measuring this piece

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.910 
which this piece is measuring this piece
is<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.509> mechanism<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.410> moves<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:06.800> the

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
is the mechanism that moves on the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.660 
is the mechanism that moves on the
actual<00:01:07.340> motor<00:01:07.520> well<00:01:08.450> when<00:01:09.050> it<00:01:09.200> goes<00:01:09.670> towards

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
actual motor well when it goes towards

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.730 
actual motor well when it goes towards
the<00:01:10.700> back<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.090> engine<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.570> guess<00:01:12.410> it<00:01:12.560> kind

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
the back of the engine I guess it kind

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.950 
the back of the engine I guess it kind
of<00:01:12.770> slides<00:01:13.070> off<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:14.360> guess<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:14.690> too<00:01:14.780> much

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
of slides off and I guess it's too much

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.480 
of slides off and I guess it's too much
torque<00:01:15.289> on<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.590> motor<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:15.920> actually<00:01:16.130> move<00:01:16.310> it

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
torque on the motor to actually move it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.609 
torque on the motor to actually move it
forward<00:01:17.479> or<00:01:17.600> turn<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.050> believe<00:01:18.289> it's<00:01:18.410> off

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
forward or turn it I believe it's off

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.870 
forward or turn it I believe it's off
that's<00:01:18.890> fine<00:01:19.009> I'm<00:01:19.160> going<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.340> run<00:01:19.460> an<00:01:19.580> output

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
that's fine I'm going to run an output

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.380 
that's fine I'm going to run an output
test<00:01:20.149> using<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.460> VCDs<00:01:23.410> rostec<00:01:24.410> software<00:01:25.300> if<00:01:26.300> I

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
test using the VCDs rostec software if I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.290 
test using the VCDs rostec software if I
can<00:01:26.570> find<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.380> take<00:01:27.619> manifold<00:01:28.520> flap<00:01:28.789> there

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
can find it and take manifold flap there

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.800 
can find it and take manifold flap there
we<00:01:29.390> go<00:01:29.679> start<00:01:30.679> now<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.369> says<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.789> should<00:01:32.000> be<00:01:32.210> on

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
we go start now it says it should be on

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.419 
we go start now it says it should be on
which<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.560> believe<00:01:33.800> means<00:01:33.950> forward<00:01:36.220> now<00:01:37.220> it

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
which I believe means forward now it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.859 
which I believe means forward now it
work<00:01:37.610> with<00:01:37.819> you<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.179> you'll<00:01:38.360> see<00:01:38.539> how<00:01:38.690> a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
work with you and you'll see how a

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.150 
work with you and you'll see how a
little<00:01:39.259> piece<00:01:39.530> sticks<00:01:39.800> out<00:01:39.979> here<00:01:40.539> when<00:01:41.539> that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
little piece sticks out here when that

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.490 
little piece sticks out here when that
slides<00:01:43.160> off<00:01:43.310> now<00:01:43.580> won't<00:01:43.789> come<00:01:44.060> back<00:01:44.289> see<00:01:45.289> off

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
slides off now won't come back see off

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.680 
slides off now won't come back see off
it's<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.550> its<00:01:46.700> now<00:01:46.819> it's<00:01:47.000> off<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.420> didn't

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
it's on on its now it's off it didn't

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.080 
it's on on its now it's off it didn't
move<00:01:47.810> now<00:01:48.560> if<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:48.739> slide<00:01:49.069> this<00:01:49.250> back<00:01:51.910> now<00:01:52.910> it's

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
move now if I slide this back now it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.850 
move now if I slide this back now it's
on<00:01:53.300> again<00:01:53.330> now<00:01:53.869> watch<00:01:54.080> when<00:01:54.289> it<00:01:54.380> goes<00:01:54.500> off<00:01:54.619> it's

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
on again now watch when it goes off it's

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.800 
on again now watch when it goes off it's
going<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.009> move<00:01:55.280> but<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.149> can't<00:01:56.360> see<00:01:56.509> it<00:01:56.539> off

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
going to move but you can't see it off

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.790 
going to move but you can't see it off
it<00:01:57.080> moved<00:01:57.319> so<00:01:57.920> I'm<00:01:57.979> going<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.220> try<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.399> use<00:01:58.610> this

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
it moved so I'm going to try to use this

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.100 
it moved so I'm going to try to use this

clip<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.799> don't<00:03:24.920> know<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.100> exact<00:03:25.340> side<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.579> have

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
clip I don't know the exact side I have

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.410 
clip I don't know the exact side I have
a<00:03:25.910> whole<00:03:26.470> unit<00:03:27.609> Hoklo<00:03:28.609> container<00:03:29.000> full<00:03:29.239> of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
a whole unit Hoklo container full of

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.780 
a whole unit Hoklo container full of
them<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.769> don't<00:03:30.829> know<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.069> exact<00:03:31.459> but<00:03:31.639> now

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
them so I don't know the exact but now

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.870 
them so I don't know the exact but now
it's<00:03:31.970> working<00:03:32.150> perfectly

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
it's working perfectly

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.900 
it's working perfectly
so<00:03:34.880> now<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.090> know<00:03:35.269> replacing<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.639> moto<00:03:37.639> I

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
so now you know replacing this moto I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.599 
so now you know replacing this moto I
don't<00:03:38.060> think<00:03:38.269> would<00:03:38.359> fix<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:39.049> error<00:03:39.680> if<00:03:40.250> you

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
don't think would fix that error if you

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.879 
don't think would fix that error if you
get<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.090> because<00:03:41.359> I<00:03:41.810> guess<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.560> just<00:03:42.739> gets

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
get this because I guess this just gets

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.670 
get this because I guess this just gets
worn<00:03:43.130> down<00:03:43.370> from<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.849> use<00:03:44.200> there's<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.260> ball<00:03:45.470> on

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
worn down from the use there's a ball on

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.309 
worn down from the use there's a ball on
the<00:03:45.859> shaft<00:03:46.609> side<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.209> runner<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:48.079> there's

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
the shaft side of the runner and there's

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.900 
the shaft side of the runner and there's
a<00:03:48.410> ball<00:03:48.620> on<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:49.639> side<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.669> motor

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
a ball on the side of the of the motor

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.210 
a ball on the side of the of the motor
now<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.959> could<00:03:54.109> it<00:03:54.530> was<00:03:54.680> possible<00:03:55.069> to

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
now if you could it was possible to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.490 
now if you could it was possible to
replace<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.849> little<00:03:56.150> arm<00:03:56.470> which<00:03:57.470> is

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
replace that little arm which is

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.559 
replace that little arm which is
actually<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.790> piece<00:03:59.060> there

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
actually that piece there

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.659 
actually that piece there
it's<00:04:00.530> like<00:04:00.680> round<00:04:00.950> on<00:04:01.099> each<00:04:01.250> side<00:04:01.459> like<00:04:01.489> a

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
it's like round on each side like a

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.569 
it's like round on each side like a
almost<00:04:02.269> like<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.480> dog<00:04:02.720> bone<00:04:02.930> type<00:04:03.169> deal<00:04:03.579> you

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
almost like a dog bone type deal you

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:04.870 
almost like a dog bone type deal you
know

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880
