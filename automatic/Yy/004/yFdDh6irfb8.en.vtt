00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.100 
builder thingy and important note is
that<00:04:35.249> if<00:04:35.400> we<00:04:35.490> did<00:04:35.669> not<00:04:35.819> include<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.539> there<00:04:36.930> at

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
that if we did not include that there at

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.379 
that if we did not include that there at
the<00:04:37.199> bottom<00:04:37.789> our<00:04:38.789> trees<00:04:39.029> would<00:04:39.150> have<00:04:39.270> looked

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
the bottom our trees would have looked

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.469 
the bottom our trees would have looked
like<00:04:39.509> this<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.699> doesn't<00:04:41.999> exactly<00:04:42.240> look

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
like this and that doesn't exactly look

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.700 
like this and that doesn't exactly look
what<00:04:42.599> we<00:04:42.719> want<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.080> be<00:04:43.199> we<00:04:43.469> could<00:04:43.560> always

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
what we want it to be we could always

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.230 
what we want it to be we could always
move<00:04:43.889> this<00:04:44.129> down<00:04:44.340> another<00:04:44.580> level<00:04:44.789> to<00:04:45.029> make<00:04:45.150> it

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
move this down another level to make it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.179 
move this down another level to make it
a<00:04:45.270> negative<00:04:45.360> one<00:04:45.719> well<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.650> seems<00:04:47.009> you'll

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
a negative one well that seems you'll

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:49.189 
a negative one well that seems you'll
get<00:04:47.310> stuff<00:04:47.520> like<00:04:47.639> this<00:04:47.759> you'll<00:04:48.240> get<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.569> one

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
get stuff like this you'll get that one

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.879 
get stuff like this you'll get that one
be<00:04:49.319> there<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:52.050> rest<00:04:52.229> of<00:04:52.319> it<00:04:52.439> will<00:04:52.529> be<00:04:52.620> here

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
be there and the rest of it will be here

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.740 
be there and the rest of it will be here
and<00:04:53.849> you<00:04:53.909> don't<00:04:54.060> really<00:04:54.150> want<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.599> happen

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
and you don't really want that to happen

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.300 
and you don't really want that to happen
that's<00:04:55.680> why<00:04:55.830> we<00:04:56.099> include<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.759> dirts<00:04:58.219> make<00:04:59.219> it

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
that's why we include the dirts make it

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.330 
that's why we include the dirts make it
look<00:04:59.430> like<00:05:00.229> it's<00:05:01.229> always<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.680> good<00:05:01.830> practice<00:05:01.889> to

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
look like it's always a good practice to

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.830 
look like it's always a good practice to
get<00:05:02.430> into<00:05:05.000> anyway<00:05:06.029> yeah<00:05:06.270> there's<00:05:06.479> our<00:05:06.599> trees

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
get into anyway yeah there's our trees

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.469 
get into anyway yeah there's our trees
you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.169> change<00:05:07.379> all<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.590> settings<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.949> want

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
you can change all the settings you want

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.939 
you can change all the settings you want
yeah<00:05:09.479> that's<00:05:09.779> pretty<00:05:09.930> much<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.319> for<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.710> bo2

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
yeah that's pretty much it for the bo2

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.409 
yeah that's pretty much it for the bo2
objects

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
objects

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.809 
objects
important<00:05:13.349> note<00:05:13.469> is<00:05:13.529> that<00:05:13.680> stuff<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.490> chest

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
important note is that stuff like chest

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.100 
important note is that stuff like chest
contents<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:16.099> NBT<00:05:17.099> data<00:05:17.310> will<00:05:17.490> not<00:05:17.580> be<00:05:17.729> saved

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
contents and NBT data will not be saved

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.119 
contents and NBT data will not be saved
that<00:05:19.110> would<00:05:19.319> only<00:05:19.560> something<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:19.949> can<00:05:20.039> do

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
that would only something you can do

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.059 
that would only something you can do
with<00:05:20.249> bo3<00:05:20.460> objects<00:05:21.029> so<00:05:21.810> if<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:22.169> want<00:05:22.349> order<00:05:22.919> on

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
with bo3 objects so if you want order on

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.490 
with bo3 objects so if you want order on
that<00:05:23.189> in<00:05:23.249> the<00:05:23.310> future<00:05:23.539> but<00:05:24.539> in<00:05:24.689> the<00:05:24.779> meantime<00:05:24.960> I
