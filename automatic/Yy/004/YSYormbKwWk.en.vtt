00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.770 
based out of New Orleans we're playing a

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.210 
bunch of showcases while we're here the
fact<00:00:44.020> that<00:00:44.080> I<00:00:44.200> can<00:00:44.379> plug<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:44.770> my<00:00:44.920> own<00:00:45.070> guitar

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
fact that I can plug in my own guitar

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.360 
fact that I can plug in my own guitar
and<00:00:45.730> play<00:00:45.970> that<00:00:46.420> could<00:00:46.540> be<00:00:47.040> relaxing<00:00:48.040> taking

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
and play that could be relaxing taking

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.189 
and play that could be relaxing taking
my<00:00:48.430> mind<00:00:48.580> off<00:00:48.700> things<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.059> also<00:00:49.239> practicing

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
my mind off things and also practicing

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.799 
my mind off things and also practicing
and<00:00:50.470> also<00:00:50.769> learning<00:00:51.269> rhythmically<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.570> just

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
and also learning rhythmically and just

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.450 
and also learning rhythmically and just
just<00:00:52.960> from<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.470> musician's<00:00:53.860> perspective<00:00:54.370> it

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
just from a musician's perspective it

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.040 
just from a musician's perspective it
seems<00:00:54.610> like<00:00:54.820> it<00:00:54.940> links<00:00:55.150> up<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.360> lot<00:00:55.480> more<00:00:55.690> looks

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
seems like it links up a lot more looks

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.110 
seems like it links up a lot more looks
like<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.830> way<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.040> would<00:00:57.250> actually<00:00:57.640> learn<00:00:57.879> to

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
like the way you would actually learn to

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.210 
like the way you would actually learn to
play<00:00:58.360> the<00:00:58.510> instrument<00:00:58.960> honestly<00:00:59.949> if<00:01:00.040> I<00:01:00.100> had

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
play the instrument honestly if I had

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.229 
play the instrument honestly if I had
something<00:01:00.460> like<00:01:00.489> this<00:01:00.699> when<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:01.000> was<00:01:01.120> learning

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
something like this when I was learning

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.490 
something like this when I was learning
how<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.420> play<00:01:01.690> I<00:01:01.720> probably<00:01:02.050> would<00:01:02.260> have<00:01:02.320> been<00:01:02.440> a

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
how to play I probably would have been a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.609 
how to play I probably would have been a
little<00:01:02.710> bit<00:01:02.830> better<00:01:07.020> alright<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.350> what<00:01:08.470> do<00:01:08.530> you

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
little bit better alright so what do you

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.080 
little bit better alright so what do you
think<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.860> rock<00:01:09.009> Smith<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.580> was<00:01:09.700> really<00:01:09.940> easy

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
think of rock Smith it was really easy

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.820 
think of rock Smith it was really easy
to<00:01:10.300> pick<00:01:10.479> up<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.840> think<00:01:10.990> it's<00:01:11.229> really<00:01:11.350> important

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
to pick up I think it's really important

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.580 
to pick up I think it's really important
that<00:01:12.039> it's<00:01:12.789> not<00:01:13.000> just<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.509> button<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.350> an

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
that it's not just a button that an

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.960 
that it's not just a button that an
actual<00:01:14.890> guitar<00:01:15.039> and<00:01:15.550> you're<00:01:15.640> not<00:01:15.729> pressing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
actual guitar and you're not pressing

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.430 
actual guitar and you're not pressing
the<00:01:16.090> buttons<00:01:16.330> you're<00:01:16.450> actually<00:01:16.810> like<00:01:16.960> yeah

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
the buttons you're actually like yeah

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.980

of even use it as an amp but getting

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.980 

probably<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.760> most<00:02:44.880> badass<00:02:45.120> way<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.480> practice

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
probably the most badass way to practice

probably the most badass way to practice
guitar<00:02:46.140> crazy<00:02:46.890> man<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:48.000> best<00:02:52.130> lot<00:02:53.130> some<00:02:53.460> from

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
guitar crazy man the best lot some from

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.550 
guitar crazy man the best lot some from
the<00:02:53.760> joyful<00:02:54.180> middle

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.860 

I<00:02:57.620> think<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.819> would<00:02:58.940> be<00:02:58.970> really<00:02:59.300> useful<00:02:59.330> for

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
I think this would be really useful for

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.990 
I think this would be really useful for
people<00:03:00.380> who<00:03:00.650> want<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.920> pick<00:03:01.099> up<00:03:01.340> guitar<00:03:01.790> and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
people who want to pick up guitar and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.449 
people who want to pick up guitar and
like<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:02.810> start<00:03:03.200> out<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.709> maybe<00:03:03.980> just

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
like just start out and maybe just

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.030 
like just start out and maybe just
progressively<00:03:05.090> further<00:03:05.330> maybe<00:03:05.690> get<00:03:05.870> some

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
progressively further maybe get some

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.780 
progressively further maybe get some
solo<00:03:07.040> skills<00:03:07.340> going<00:03:07.550> on<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:09.250> think<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.580> lot

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
solo skills going on I think it's a lot

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.479 
solo skills going on I think it's a lot
more<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.180> actual<00:03:11.540> guitar<00:03:11.690> than<00:03:12.200> other<00:03:12.980> music

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
more like actual guitar than other music

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.449 
more like actual guitar than other music
games<00:03:13.670> because<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.510> has<00:03:14.780> things<00:03:15.019> like<00:03:15.459> notes

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
games because it has things like notes

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.729 
games because it has things like notes
and<00:03:16.880> chords<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.569> like<00:03:18.019> what<00:03:18.230> spread<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.590> play

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
and chords and like what spread to play

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.290 
and chords and like what spread to play
it<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:18.980> stuff<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.400> that's<00:03:19.849> actually<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.180> lot<00:03:20.269> of

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
it on stuff so that's actually a lot of

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.699 
it on stuff so that's actually a lot of
