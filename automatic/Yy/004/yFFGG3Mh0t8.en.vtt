needles on it and then there your

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.920 
needles on it and then there your
exhaust<00:01:53.770> right<00:01:54.549> there<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.510> first<00:01:55.720> thing

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
exhaust right there so the first thing

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.999 
exhaust right there so the first thing
you<00:01:56.140> want<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.380> check<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:59.200> air<00:01:59.439> filter

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
you want to check is your air filter

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.260 
you want to check is your air filter
opening

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
opening

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
opening
just<00:02:03.270> take<00:02:03.480> off<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.660> air<00:02:03.900> filter<00:02:04.520> it's<00:02:05.520> right

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
just take off your air filter it's right

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.690 
just take off your air filter it's right
there<00:02:05.850> only<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.690> able<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:08.009> one

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
there only be able to see a one

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880 
there only be able to see a one
millimeter<00:02:09.000> gap<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.770> good

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
millimeter gap and that's a good

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.870 
millimeter gap and that's a good
starting<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.610> there

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
starting right there

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.180 
starting right there
that<00:02:12.330> won't<00:02:12.720> allow<00:02:13.020> your<00:02:13.290> car<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.620> run<00:02:13.740> off<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
it'll start pretty easily

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.570 
it'll start pretty easily
so<00:02:15.990> make<00:02:16.680> sure<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.400> millimeter

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
so make sure you have a one millimeter

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.810 
so make sure you have a one millimeter
gap<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.360> your<00:02:18.750> two<00:02:19.440> needles<00:02:19.890> right<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
gap and your two needles right here and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.320 
gap and your two needles right here and
right<00:02:20.940> here

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
right here

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.480 
right here
all<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:22.200> default<00:02:22.680> settings<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.370> might
