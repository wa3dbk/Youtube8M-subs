00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.170
 Hello good Morning 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.309
 let's make a game and I say let's go 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.770
 with what we're going to do 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:18.220
 together you and me so take your 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.429
 deck draws from it 10 cards of the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.050
 to 10 the orders from lowest to highest 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.910
 as I have them I do not have to 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.380
 be of the same suit gives exactly the same 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.619
 The issue is that they are ordered from the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.359
 to ten and three figures any 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.370
 things that are figures to differentiate 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:39.399
 the numeric letter of the figure card 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.420
 Once ordered, we will check 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.210
 through the cards if we have a life 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.480
 ordered as the letters themselves to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.790
 despite everything because of cat hair that 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.070
 despite the disorder that we are going to give 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.190
 let's see how our life ends 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.769
 despite the ways I can take with 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 the letters in that order you're going to 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.550
 put back 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:10.659
 and you will place in the place where you 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.040
 you want the three cards where you want 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.580
 until you put in the same place where 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.580
 I put them 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.770
 the three figures put decade 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.170
 the position that is craving the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.810
 figures represent the obstructions 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 what can there be 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.560
 in the way of your life according to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.990
 located the cards inside each 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.110
 one of us has it in one place 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.770
 different each one of us stumbles 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.990
 in life at a certain time 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.439
 to start a mix you're going to make a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.390
 cut and complete if you want you can 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.579
 redo another cut and complete 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.460
 as many times as you want so much if you 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.060
 there is a letter 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.340
 turn up as if not when 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.920
 you want to stop and come from the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 next way he makes those heaps 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.259
 starting from the left and throwing 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.770
 letters one by one 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.650
 exactly as I do the letters 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.880
 what do they do to us 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.950
 this will start in life 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.020
 will be located some on the left to 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.460
 others to the right to me I have dropped two 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.550
 on the right 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.610
 the three gives exactly the same and once 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.430
 made the two heaps you collect the one from the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.260
 left or the one on the right that you 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.080
 you want and you put it on top of the other me 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.650
 I put over the right from the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.370
 left obviously I have done this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.990
 short and complete, you can see that our 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.600
 we are altering the course of life 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.900
 we are mixing the letters and we are 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.330
 messing up our life proceeds is 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.240
 again to give it more clutter in 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.630
 this time you make three piles one a 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.240
 one and from the center and right up 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.920
 finish the last one will fall on the engine 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.640
 from the left of accident mind equal 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.290
 but attentive now there are occasions in the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.200
 life that you have to take the road 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.900
 successful so this time in a way 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.070
 neat you are going to pick up the pile of the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.950
 left or you're going to put it in the center 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.080
 of the remaining pile 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.080
 on top of the one on the right 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.880
 pick up from left to right 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.050
 it does not stop being that each one of us 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.570
 in the cards in a totally 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.060
 different because we position the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.230
 trips in different places and 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.599
 we cut 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.400
 an amount of times indeterminate by 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.480
 completely different short and 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.790
 complete and for the third time you do what 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.950
 same two heaps starting with the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.650
 left depositing the letters one to 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.540
 one the me again I have been two 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.930
 stumbling two face cards on the side 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.090
 straight 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.890
 and before picked up and that the right then 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.930
 now pick up from left elche you 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.319
 you can do the opposite to repeat as 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.209
 you think convenient 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.870
 see if we have mixed sometimes in the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.139
 letters fall in different places 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.150
 probably now it's time to 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.730
 start looking for the right path of 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.100
 frank throw without altering the order 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.170
 letters 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.930
 that hinder us from making us 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.170
 stumble without altering the order 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.790
 you pick up again and watch if you want 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.760
 cut one more time too you can 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.470
 do come and a problem and observe the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.800
 letter that you have in the bottom 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.780
 I have 18 you can have or 6 17 15 12 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.790
 13 decently equal the number you get 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.280
 has come out at the bottom count 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.500
 the letters from above and from one to one or 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.690
 all together and exactly the same 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:52.550
 you pass under it throughout a life a 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:56.660
 two three four five six seven and eight 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:01.080
 done this we only have one single 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.970
 movement to redirect our life 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.420
 by a good path take the letter of 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.790
 down above 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.560
 you do the same thing exactly as 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.180
 I counted the letters that appeared 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.050
 you passed them under one all together and 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.810
 the below 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.710
 how not 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.020
 our letters to you and me tell us that 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.800
 we have a totally ordered life 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.630
 despite all the many setbacks 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.630
 thanks until the next video
