00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 was not here nobody is above 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.870
 law a possible suspect that there is no 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.710
 consensus on whether someone had hurt me 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 We used to think the work was normal. 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.210
 that the potatoes until arriving late very 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.410
 sold on the yield day better partly already 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:27.810
 You're late and you're going to be late. 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:30.500
 to worry or tip everything because the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.210
 machine group return to view and doubled 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.610
 sorry your colleague's attention is missing 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.469
 anyone who does not work on this machine is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.239
 here do not let any breezes pass 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.579
 Spanish is not what I've done it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.440
 this is what the machine is going to say 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.250
 we now only have to look for uses 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.710
 parts 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.710
 look for me and already sharing 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.140
 now is to start up since its 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.200
 clothing and Norway the best one 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.059
 here is the way the code is in 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.250
 a team debut at the stage that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.720
 described deck public connection is or 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.240
 It is not traveling what inspires the shirt 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.830
 in front of these whole people there is no 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.660
 has that the engineer has no witnesses 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.670
 for example, to give an example 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.100
 if he wants to travel lisbon to the port 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.590
 I 'm sure that the rules of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.900
 security not smile strict are the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.320
 safety standards on ships and aircraft 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:36.270
 all things but I have no other 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:38.659
 alternative is not positive 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.659
 stood 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.060
 by this motor road because 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:52.390
 curves released did not stop for the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.700
 playoff is something they even have 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.070
 so it 's not safety matter 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.090
 we have to go for pure pure for 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.649
 attempts 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.200
 This means I'm going to have to do it. 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.270
 one more try because it is seen that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.340
 it will be called who whistled we have to see 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.530
 the metal funk of the problem because the why 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.660
 I drank with these there are the companies 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.430
 they are nothing special on the second 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.180
 sorry sorry tell me two 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.610
 Sometimes it's all social and comes 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.799
 so she has a country skirt and was 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.019
 with the machine I was not going to try that prega 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.660
 This does not mean they have been practicing 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.250
 the buildings as such is the machine is not 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.349
 dumb before they find a project 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.269
 long and if it was he was not 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:41.319
 here I whistle does not mean that I do not 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.959
 You gotta take this, it's just for us to be. 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.790
 to be sure that it was this reading is that 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.950
 The machine made its folds so it's 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.019
 a drama to see the girl in the skirt 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.489
 back to 15 machines in upton 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.510
 and that the problem was in their 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.269
 folds I naum eh eh eh eh, then 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.760
 left in peace in peace and that the 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.250
 Sir, but the years 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:13.420
 so be it 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:16.150
 It is a medical problem that went wrong and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.410
 say that bia was conquered soon 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.220
 would have terzigno hiss 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.290
 lighthouse for another, nothing else, no Christ is going 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.630
 until the time I drill a hole in the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.520
 metacritic is to conclude these great people 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.150
 people who care about the company 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:39.340
 a vip room of the 2010 show room is 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:46.150
 important will be more or less vip 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:50.830
 Come on and pimp that we already know 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.620
 absence of the head of own house I think 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.950
 We've made a mistake and I'm going to spend second 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.950
 time 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.280
 it's part
