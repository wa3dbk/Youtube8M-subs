i<00:00:00.110> just<00:00:01.110> thought<00:00:01.290> i'd<00:00:01.439> show<00:00:01.800> you<00:00:02.360> some<00:00:03.360> of

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
i just thought i'd show you some of

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.889 
i just thought i'd show you some of
Chevrolet's<00:00:05.210> rather<00:00:06.210> interesting

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
Chevrolet's rather interesting

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.089 
Chevrolet's rather interesting
engineering<00:00:08.120> over<00:00:09.120> here<00:00:09.500> we<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.679> about<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
engineering over here we have about the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.810 
engineering over here we have about the
bolt<00:00:11.280> size<00:00:11.780> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.349> transmission<00:00:14.130> bolts<00:00:14.549> on

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
bolt size of the transmission bolts on

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
bolt size of the transmission bolts on
the<00:00:14.880> bell<00:00:15.690> housing<00:00:17.449> that<00:00:18.449> would<00:00:18.690> go<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.199> on

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the bell housing that would go here on

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.000 
the bell housing that would go here on
this<00:00:20.359> rod<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.050> an<00:00:22.289> extra<00:00:22.619> support

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
this rod here this is an extra support

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.779 
this rod here this is an extra support
rod<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> transfer<00:00:24.060> case<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:25.140> we're<00:00:25.289> here

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
rod for the transfer case now we're here

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.000 
rod for the transfer case now we're here
we<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> bolts<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:28.199> bolt<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
we have the bolts that bolt it to the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.870 
we have the bolts that bolt it to the
transfer<00:00:29.400> case<00:00:30.800> alright<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.610> window

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
transfer case alright and that window

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.799 
transfer case alright and that window
right<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> side<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:36.630> those

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
right on the side there so we got those

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
right on the side there so we got those
two<00:00:37.079> giant<00:00:37.500> bolts<00:00:39.290> securing<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.680> one

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
two giant bolts securing to this one

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.270 
two giant bolts securing to this one
little<00:00:42.180> bolt<00:00:44.390> now<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.600> smart<00:00:46.010> right<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
little bolt now that's smart right and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.569 
little bolt now that's smart right and
even<00:00:47.789> better<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.129> hole<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
even better this on this hole is a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.229 
even better this on this hole is a
pulling<00:00:51.030> force<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.480> pulls<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.960> way<00:00:53.239> over

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
pulling force it pulls this way over

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.799 
pulling force it pulls this way over
there<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.110> shearing<00:00:55.440> force<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> shearing

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
there it's a shearing force the shearing

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.069 
there it's a shearing force the shearing
force<00:00:58.109> required<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> break<00:00:59.160> bolts<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.640> I

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
force required to break bolts is I

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.549 
force required to break bolts is I
believe<00:01:01.079> far<00:01:01.590> higher<00:01:01.859> than<00:01:03.049> what<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
believe far higher than what it is to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.550 
believe far higher than what it is to
just<00:01:04.769> break<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> head<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.560> that's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
just break the head off so that's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.300 
just break the head off so that's
probably<00:01:08.040> why<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> pulled<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.840> apart

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
probably why when I pulled this apart

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.840 
probably why when I pulled this apart
this<00:01:11.310> boat<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.729> broken<00:01:13.610> that's<00:01:14.610> probably

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
this boat was broken that's probably

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.940 
this boat was broken that's probably
what<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.140> fact<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> ball

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
what it was see in fact I have the ball

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
what it was see in fact I have the ball
over<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.430> left<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:17.909> what's<00:01:18.150> left<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
over here left or what's left of it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.100 
over here left or what's left of it
anyway<00:01:19.700> because<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:21.090> Chevrolet's<00:01:21.570> wonderful

anyway because of Chevrolet's wonderful
engineering<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:24.600> happens<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
engineering this is what happens to the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
engineering this is what happens to the
bolt<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> side<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.900> head

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
bolt on that side it just the head

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.640 
bolt on that side it just the head
breaks<00:01:28.290> off<00:01:29.299> it's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> big<00:01:30.689> enough<00:01:30.720> bolt

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650

that hold this cover on these ones here

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.310 
that hold this cover on these ones here
are<00:01:58.280> actually<00:01:59.280> bigger<00:01:59.759> than<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:01.020> ones<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
are actually bigger than the ones that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
are actually bigger than the ones that
hold<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> transmission<00:02:02.219> itself<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
engine go figure that I mean that just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.360 
engine go figure that I mean that just
flat<00:02:08.489> doesn't<00:02:08.819> make<00:02:08.940> any<00:02:09.209> sense<00:02:09.479> whatsoever

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.560 

wonderful<00:02:13.370> engineering<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.270> this

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
wonderful engineering and this this

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.110 
wonderful engineering and this this
whole<00:02:14.780> frickin<00:02:15.350> crossmember<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.610> at<00:02:16.940> like

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
whole frickin crossmember it's at like

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.220 
whole frickin crossmember it's at like
that<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> old<00:02:17.930> trans<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.990> that's<00:02:20.990> just

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
that with the old trans but that's just

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.780 
that with the old trans but that's just
retarded<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:24.020> really<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.470> oh<00:02:24.710> well<00:02:27.790> lame

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
retarded it really is oh well lame

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.710 
retarded it really is oh well lame
Chevy's<00:02:30.550> engineers<00:02:31.550> they<00:02:31.670> must<00:02:32.000> be<00:02:32.180> smoking

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
Chevy's engineers they must be smoking

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.520 
Chevy's engineers they must be smoking
something<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:33.200> don't<00:02:33.410> know<00:02:33.590> like<00:02:35.170> oh<00:02:36.170> well

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
something I don't know like oh well

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.680 
something I don't know like oh well
we'll<00:02:36.890> make<00:02:37.070> up<00:02:37.220> for<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.580> thin<00:02:37.910> castings<00:02:38.510> on

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
we'll make up for the thin castings on

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.510 
we'll make up for the thin castings on
our<00:02:38.870> transmissions<00:02:39.560> by<00:02:39.740> putting<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.160> bunch<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
our transmissions by putting a bunch of

our transmissions by putting a bunch of
retarded<00:02:40.940> hold<00:02:41.330> downs<00:02:42.010> that'll<00:02:43.010> do<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:44.770> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
retarded hold downs that'll do it and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.150

versus Chevy this is a Ford c6 this was
off<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.290> diesel<00:02:54.580> okay<00:02:55.580> versus<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:57.040> 69<00:02:58.040> /<00:02:58.760> 73

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
IDI bell housing which is actually

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.900 
IDI bell housing which is actually
fairly<00:03:03.140> similar<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.190> ones<00:03:04.400> there<00:03:04.580> series

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
fairly similar to the ones there series

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.020 
fairly similar to the ones there series
but<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:07.400> then<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:07.880> is<00:03:09.310> chevrolet's<00:03:10.310> diesel

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
but and then this is chevrolet's diesel

bell housing quite a bit thinner and as

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.850 
bell housing quite a bit thinner and as
you<00:03:17.600> can<00:03:17.750> see<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.950> have<00:03:19.070> problems<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:20.860> again

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
you can see they have problems and again

chevrolet's<00:03:24.860> transmission<00:03:25.550> bolt<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:26.709> could<00:03:27.709> do

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
chevrolet's transmission bolt I could do

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.900 
chevrolet's transmission bolt I could do
not<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.150> actual<00:03:29.390> bolt<00:03:30.910> versus

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
not that is the actual bolt versus

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.180 
not that is the actual bolt versus
Ford's<00:03:32.410> which<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.740> somewhere<00:03:34.070> around

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190

here<00:03:34.510> actually<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.570> prank<00:03:35.870> probably<00:03:36.709> got<00:03:36.770> one

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
here actually the prank probably got one

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.630 
here actually the prank probably got one
in<00:03:37.070> there<00:03:38.320> versus<00:03:39.320> Ford's<00:03:41.140> significantly

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
in there versus Ford's significantly

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.170 
in there versus Ford's significantly
larger<00:03:44.140> just<00:03:45.489> see<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.670> size<00:03:47.150> difference

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
larger just see the size difference

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.960 
larger just see the size difference
there<00:03:48.280> yeah

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.929 

whyfor<00:03:55.970> doesn't<00:03:56.329> require<00:03:56.569> any<00:03:57.170> whole<00:03:57.379> bands

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.449 

that's<00:04:01.939> funny<00:04:02.439> I'll<00:04:03.439> enforce<00:04:03.860> difference<00:04:04.310> on

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
that's funny I'll enforce difference on

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.220 
that's funny I'll enforce difference on
their<00:04:04.640> torque<00:04:04.879> numbers<00:04:05.230> they<00:04:06.230> use<00:04:06.470> four<00:04:06.920> bolts

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
their torque numbers they use four bolts

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.020 
their torque numbers they use four bolts
for<00:04:09.230> all<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:09.500> gas<00:04:09.650> engines<00:04:10.189> and<00:04:10.489> for<00:04:10.939> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
for all the gas engines and for the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.899 
for all the gas engines and for the
early<00:04:11.420> diesels<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.959> ID<00:04:12.109> is<00:04:12.609> power<00:04:13.609> strokes

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
early diesels the ID is power strokes

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.400 
early diesels the ID is power strokes
went<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.269> six<00:04:14.890> studs<00:04:15.890> but<00:04:16.959> see<00:04:17.959> here<00:04:18.199> they're

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
went to six studs but see here they're

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.060 
went to six studs but see here they're
studs<00:04:18.829> as<00:04:20.620> opposed<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:22.449> standoffs<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:24.860> put

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
studs as opposed to standoffs to put

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.719 
studs as opposed to standoffs to put
bolts<00:04:25.280> into<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:26.979> for<00:04:27.979> whatever<00:04:28.130> reason<00:04:28.340> I

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
bolts into and for whatever reason I

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.250 
bolts into and for whatever reason I
originally<00:04:29.180> thought<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.630> would<00:04:29.960> be<00:04:30.080> easier

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
originally thought that would be easier

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.379 
originally thought that would be easier
to<00:04:30.500> line<00:04:30.770> up<00:04:31.360> not<00:04:32.360> really<00:04:33.220> that's<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:35.060> studs

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
to line up not really that's the studs

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.379 
to line up not really that's the studs
are<00:04:35.600> actually<00:04:36.229> easier<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:40.389> another

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
are actually easier so another

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.050 
are actually easier so another
interesting<00:04:41.960> thing<00:04:43.810> there<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:44.900> go
