00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
like this mission because kind of is

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.920 
like this mission because kind of is
something<00:00:21.150> different<00:00:21.359> or<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.750> you're

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
something different or if you're

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.359 
something different or if you're
standing<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> Sun<00:00:22.590> your<00:00:22.740> shields<00:00:23.130> will<00:00:23.250> go

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
standing in the Sun your shields will go

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.900 
standing in the Sun your shields will go
down<00:00:23.580> slowly<00:00:24.890> very<00:00:25.890> slowly<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:26.640> after

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
down slowly very slowly and then after

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.009 
down slowly very slowly and then after
they<00:00:27.029> run<00:00:27.180> out<00:00:27.330> they<00:00:27.480> won't<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.750> able<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
they run out they won't be able to

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.840 
they run out they won't be able to
recharge<00:00:28.410> until<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.820> out<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> Sun

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
recharge until you get out of the Sun

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.990 
recharge until you get out of the Sun
but<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.530> probably<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.850> this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
but this is you probably want to do this

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.690 
but this is you probably want to do this

recruit Ally recruit the justicar or
recruit<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> assassin<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.920> would<00:00:44.129> suggest

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
recruit the assassin I would suggest

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610 
recruit the assassin I would suggest
doing<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.090> first<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.500> will

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

assault rifle so I would really suggest

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.810 
assault rifle so I would really suggest
you<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.860> plus<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:56.610> too

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you do this one plus it's not too

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.959 
you do this one plus it's not too
difficult<00:00:58.550> first<00:00:59.550> thing<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.760> would<00:00:59.820> recommend

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
difficult first thing I would recommend

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.310 
difficult first thing I would recommend
is<00:01:00.390> switching<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.050> power<00:01:01.789> to<00:01:02.809> your<00:01:03.809> if

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
is switching your power to your if

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
is switching your power to your if
you're<00:01:04.619> playing<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.220> am<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:06.090> sure<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you're playing like I am make sure you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
you're playing like I am make sure you
have<00:01:06.600> overload<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.979> accessible<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:10.820> me<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
have overload very accessible so me I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.039 
have overload very accessible so me I
have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> hotkey<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:14.790> mouse<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:18.049> put

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
have to hotkey it to my mouse up and put

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.730 
have to hotkey it to my mouse up and put
warp<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.560> five<00:01:20.159> because<00:01:21.119> Geth<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:22.049> shields

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
warp on five because Geth have shields

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.429 
warp on five because Geth have shields
and<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.159> about<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.150> use<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> you're

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and that's about all they use so you're

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.310 
and that's about all they use so you're
gonna<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.710> using<00:01:25.830> overload<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.320> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
gonna be using overload a lot and just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.210 
gonna be using overload a lot and just
to<00:01:28.770> state<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> high<00:01:30.000> overload<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> level<00:01:30.930> one

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
to state it high overload is level one

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.789 
to state it high overload is level one
like<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.490> point<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:34.049> pretty<00:01:34.350> damn<00:01:34.560> weak

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
like one point so it's pretty damn weak

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550 
like one point so it's pretty damn weak
and<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.310> isn't<00:01:35.520> Sam<00:01:35.850> Dean<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:37.259> wasn't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and this isn't Sam Dean and this wasn't

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.660 
and this isn't Sam Dean and this wasn't
not<00:01:37.829> too<00:01:38.040> difficult<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.229> yes<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:41.070> rundown<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
not too difficult so yes my rundown of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.700 
not too difficult so yes my rundown of
things<00:01:42.390> I'm<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> talk<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.380> one

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
things I'm going to talk about one

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.770

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
2nd I think it is might be doing a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.069 
2nd I think it is might be doing a
single-player<00:02:21.930> guide<00:02:22.579> depends<00:02:23.579> if<00:02:24.390> there's<00:02:24.930> a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
single-player guide depends if there's a

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.819 
single-player guide depends if there's a
point<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.799> doing<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.549> because<00:02:27.349> bad<00:02:28.349> company

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
point in doing it it because bad company

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:35.660 
point in doing it it because bad company
one<00:02:31.040> there<00:02:32.040> was<00:02:32.430> no<00:02:33.360> way<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.720> fail<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.340> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
one there was no way to fail like it it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.910 
one there was no way to fail like it it
was<00:02:35.970> funny<00:02:36.390> because<00:02:36.630> if<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.049> died<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.739> don't

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
was funny because if you died you don't

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
was funny because if you died you don't
go<00:02:38.040> back<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> checkpoint<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.269> just<00:02:39.480> respawn

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
go back to a checkpoint you just respawn

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.110 
go back to a checkpoint you just respawn
it<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.680> mean<00:02:41.069> they<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.549> didn't<00:02:41.790> take<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.090> that

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
it I mean they just didn't take it that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.539 
it I mean they just didn't take it that
seriously<00:02:42.720> at<00:02:42.840> all<00:02:42.930> there<00:02:43.829> was<00:02:43.920> only<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.160> one

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
seriously at all there was only like one

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.770 
seriously at all there was only like one
part<00:02:44.819> in<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.970> entire<00:02:45.209> game<00:02:45.390> where<00:02:45.599> if<00:02:45.660> you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
part in the entire game where if you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.800 
part in the entire game where if you
died<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.709> mission<00:02:47.069> like<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.420> actually<00:02:48.720> had

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
died the mission like you actually had

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.600 
died the mission like you actually had
to<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:48.930> back<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.200> checkpoint<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.310> wasn't

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
to go back to a checkpoint so it wasn't

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.270 
to go back to a checkpoint so it wasn't
difficult<00:02:51.410> scan<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.530> pistol<00:02:52.889> right<00:02:53.040> there

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
difficult scan that pistol right there
