should get behind the manager fans have

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.520 
should get behind the manager fans have
to<00:00:54.059> accept<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.870> much<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.230> don't<00:00:55.440> like

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.020 
to accept it as much as we don't like
him<00:00:55.680> saying<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.309> wrong<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.610> him<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> say

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.240 
him saying it was wrong for him to say
it<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> fact<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.949> money<00:00:59.070> when

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you know a lot of fans would have been

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.760
