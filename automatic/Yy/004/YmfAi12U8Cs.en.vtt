00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.450 
this is a the lining fabric is lycra
which<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.549> stretchy<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.160> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
which is stretchy and what you can do is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.429 
which is stretchy and what you can do is
you<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.240> keep<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.600> slightly<00:00:18.840> shorter

you do have to keep it slightly shorter
because<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> hem<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.240> these<00:00:21.510> two<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.380> to

how to do dressing now one of these
fabrics<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:50.659> lycra<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.810> mica<00:01:52.649> has<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
fabrics is actually lycra and mica has a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.590 
fabrics is actually lycra and mica has a
stretch<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.329> bit<00:01:54.479> more

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
stretch so it's a little bit more

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
stretch so it's a little bit more
difficult<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.320> restage<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.680> find

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
difficult to restage so if you find

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
difficult to restage so if you find
something<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.579> like

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
something like like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.700 
something like like
I<00:02:00.869> wasn't<00:02:01.470> advised<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.330> lining<00:02:03.710> lycra

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
I wasn't advised to use a lining lycra

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.330 
I wasn't advised to use a lining lycra
as<00:02:04.890> lining<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.689> cause<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
as lining because you it would cause you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.130 
as lining because you it would cause you
difficulties<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:11.039> stick<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.390> normal<00:02:12.720> fabric

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
difficulties so stick to a normal fabric

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.729 
difficulties so stick to a normal fabric
for<00:02:13.380> lining<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.180> now<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.600> one<00:02:15.989> part<00:02:16.319> was

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
for lining and now because one part was

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.030 
for lining and now because one part was
slightly<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:18.020> than<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.230> other<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:19.860> cut

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
slightly more than the other and I cut

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.460 
slightly more than the other and I cut
the<00:02:20.160> lining<00:02:20.370> less<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:21.690> I've<00:02:21.810> done<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.230> I've

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the lining less what I've done is I've

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.540 
the lining less what I've done is I've
left<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.980> slightly<00:02:23.640> sort<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.980> more<00:02:25.980> than<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
left that slightly sort of more than the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.080 
left that slightly sort of more than the
other<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> chiffon<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:29.069> actually<00:02:29.580> folded

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
other so the chiffon is actually folded

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.300 
other so the chiffon is actually folded
onto<00:02:33.319> that's<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.709> side<00:02:34.920> when<00:02:35.160> we're

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
onto that's just one side when we're

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.190 
onto that's just one side when we're
gonna<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> exact<00:02:36.090> same<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.170> other

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
gonna do the exact same on the other

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.420 
gonna do the exact same on the other
side<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.800> well<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.069> what<00:02:38.250> we'll<00:02:38.400> probably

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
side and well then what we'll probably

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.449 
side and well then what we'll probably
do<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.300> seem<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.080> up<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:40.920> leave

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
do is just seem that up and just leave

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.210 
do is just seem that up and just leave
enough<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.209> an<00:02:42.330> opening<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:43.050> actually<00:02:43.950> makes

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
enough of an opening this actually makes

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.820 
enough of an opening this actually makes
it<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> lot<00:02:44.970> easier<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.600> do<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.230> then

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it a lot easier to do it like this then

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.280 
it a lot easier to do it like this then
doing<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.730> con<00:02:48.239> any<00:02:48.630> other<00:02:48.840> way<00:02:49.050> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
doing it the con any other way and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.250 
doing it the con any other way and
because<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.250> would<00:02:50.370> save<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:51.260> matching

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
because it would save you matching

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.500 
because it would save you matching
things<00:02:52.650> open<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.790> if<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.000> wanted<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.390> leave

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
things open and if you wanted to leave

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.360 
things open and if you wanted to leave
the<00:02:54.660> shirt<00:02:54.870> open<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:56.010> would<00:02:56.160> have

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the shirt open and then you would have

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:07.550 
the shirt open and then you would have
to<00:02:56.580> do<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.000> buttonholes<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.350> on

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.160 

this<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.829> attaching<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.489> lining<00:03:09.879> and

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.039 

together<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.650> it's<00:03:14.769> easy<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:15.280> stitch<00:03:16.049> what

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
together so it's easy just stitch what

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.000 
together so it's easy just stitch what
part<00:03:17.260> are<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.409> attaching<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:17.980> from

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
elasticated 8 the one over suggestion

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.210 
elasticated 8 the one over suggestion
that<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.760> would<00:03:36.790> make<00:03:37.030> at<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.629> point<00:03:38.159> is<00:03:39.159> you

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
that I would make at this point is you

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.360 
that I would make at this point is you
know<00:03:39.400> when<00:03:39.579> you've<00:03:39.730> done<00:03:40.389> this<00:03:40.629> a<00:03:41.409> side<00:03:42.010> seam

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
know when you've done this a side seam

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.929 
know when you've done this a side seam
and<00:03:42.609> you've<00:03:43.239> attached<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.930> two<00:03:44.260> together

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
and you've attached the two together

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.390 
and you've attached the two together
measure<00:03:45.939> four<00:03:46.500> from<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.530> top<00:03:47.799> of<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.159> dress

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
measure four from the top of the dress

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.879 
measure four from the top of the dress
put<00:03:49.359> it<00:03:49.480> against<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.959> individual<00:03:50.680> and

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
put it against the individual and

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.429 
put it against the individual and
measure<00:03:51.280> how<00:03:51.730> far<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.450> waist<00:03:52.629> line<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:53.200> down

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 
measure how far the waist line is down

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.379 
measure how far the waist line is down
and<00:03:53.739> then<00:03:54.629> just<00:03:56.400> not<00:03:57.400> share<00:03:57.639> something<00:03:58.060> on<00:03:58.209> the

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
and then just not share something on the

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.679 
and then just not share something on the
edges<00:03:59.139> and<00:03:59.519> then<00:04:00.519> iron<00:04:00.969> market<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:01.659> that

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
edges and then iron market so that

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.780 
edges and then iron market so that
you've<00:04:01.989> got<00:04:02.169> a<00:04:02.200> straight<00:04:02.469> line<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:05.609> this<00:04:06.609> is

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
you've got a straight line so this is

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.909 
you've got a straight line so this is
the<00:04:06.969> back<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.989> dress<00:04:08.200> that's<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.560> lining

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
the back of the dress that's the lining

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.219 
the back of the dress that's the lining
and<00:04:09.010> this<00:04:09.159> is<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> back<00:04:09.690> we're<00:04:10.690> gonna<00:04:10.810> do<00:04:11.019> is

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
and this is the back we're gonna do is

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.140 
and this is the back we're gonna do is
just<00:04:11.470> place<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:11.739> on<00:04:11.979> top<00:04:12.099> we're<00:04:12.940> not<00:04:13.030> gonna

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
just place that on top we're not gonna

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.670 
just place that on top we're not gonna
bother<00:04:13.329> attaching<00:04:14.019> this<00:04:14.169> because<00:04:14.560> we're

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
bother attaching this because we're

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.270 
bother attaching this because we're
gonna<00:04:14.799> directly<00:04:15.340> attach<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:16.030> shoulder<00:04:16.630> seams

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
gonna directly attach the shoulder seams

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.949 
gonna directly attach the shoulder seams
onto<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.430> do<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.180> little<00:04:19.449> bit<00:04:19.630> other<00:04:19.750> thing

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
onto this do a little bit other thing

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.680 
onto this do a little bit other thing
just<00:04:20.199> to<00:04:20.320> hold<00:04:20.500> them<00:04:20.620> together<00:04:20.829> while<00:04:21.190> you're

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
just to hold them together while you're

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.980 
just to hold them together while you're
placing<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.960> top<00:04:23.139> piece<00:04:23.349> on<00:04:23.560> top<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.159> this

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
placing the top piece on top of this

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.290 
placing the top piece on top of this
so<00:04:26.620> this<00:04:27.009> is<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.340> moment

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.370 

you

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.390 

so<00:04:39.870> that's<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.050> lining<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.680> that's<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.160> top

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
so that's the lining and that's the top

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.430 
so that's the lining and that's the top
piece<00:04:42.670> I'm<00:04:43.300> gonna<00:04:43.480> do<00:04:43.750> is<00:04:43.900> we're<00:04:44.050> just<00:04:44.200> gonna

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
piece I'm gonna do is we're just gonna

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.860 
piece I'm gonna do is we're just gonna
do<00:04:44.680> like<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.980> scale<00:04:45.400> sketch<00:04:45.730> all<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.780> way

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
do like a scale sketch all the way

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.870 
do like a scale sketch all the way
around<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.530> neckline<00:04:47.740> because<00:04:48.310> we<00:04:48.580> need<00:04:48.760> to

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
around the neckline because we need to

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.130 
around the neckline because we need to
trim<00:04:49.150> into<00:04:49.480> this<00:04:49.860> but<00:04:50.860> we<00:04:50.890> need<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.280> keep

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
trim into this but we need to keep

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.000 
trim into this but we need to keep
lighting<00:04:53.140> and<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.680> top<00:04:54.280> fabric<00:04:55.210> together<00:04:56.010> so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
lighting and the top fabric together so

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.260 
lighting and the top fabric together so
this<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:59.250> stitching<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.730> loosely

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
this is just like stitching a loosely

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.100 
this is just like stitching a loosely
cleaner<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.990> hold<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.560> pieces<00:05:02.770> together
