so<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:24.360> actually<00:02:25.360> fold<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.910> honey<00:02:28.150> bun<00:02:28.420> down

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
so you actually fold the honey bun down

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.770 
so you actually fold the honey bun down
towards<00:02:29.590> your<00:02:29.770> head<00:02:30.540> while<00:02:31.540> you're

towards your head while you're

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.270

it
and<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.480> does<00:02:37.690> take<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.500> bit<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
and it does take a little bit of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.750 
and it does take a little bit of
practice<00:02:40.210> at<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.050> beginning<00:02:41.410> but<00:02:42.340> that's<00:02:42.550> the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
practice at the beginning but that's the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.100 
practice at the beginning but that's the
most<00:02:42.940> important<00:02:43.600> part<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:45.840> learning<00:02:46.840> how<00:02:47.080> to

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
most important part and learning how to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.890 
most important part and learning how to
master<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.160> honey<00:02:48.370> bun<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.180> fold<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.660> down

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900

you can see all these little pieces are

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.410 
you can see all these little pieces are
kind<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:26.770> going<00:03:26.920> crazy<00:03:27.310> back<00:03:27.550> here<00:03:27.880> but<00:03:28.120> don't

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
kind of going crazy back here but don't

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.490 
kind of going crazy back here but don't
worry<00:03:28.630> about<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:29.050> we'll<00:03:29.200> fix<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.620> at<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.459> end

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
worry about it we'll fix it at the end

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.890 
worry about it we'll fix it at the end
but<00:03:32.500> I'm<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.890> going<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.720> start<00:03:34.720> to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
but I'm just going to start to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.240 
but I'm just going to start to
distribute<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:36.900> hair<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:39.670> other<00:03:41.250> side

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
distribute that hair to the other side

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.190 
distribute that hair to the other side
of<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.850> uncovered<00:03:43.540> honey<00:03:43.930> bun

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.260 

and<00:03:50.200> it's<00:03:50.350> important<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.890> be<00:03:51.070> slow<00:03:51.460> and<00:03:51.490> study

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
and it's important to be slow and study

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.990 
and it's important to be slow and study
at<00:03:52.600> this<00:03:52.810> point<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.230> process<00:03:53.850> because<00:03:54.850> you

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
at this point of the process because you

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.640 
at this point of the process because you
don't<00:03:55.180> want<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.390> twist<00:03:55.630> your<00:03:55.840> honeyBun<00:03:56.380> too

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
don't want to twist your honeyBun too

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.900 
don't want to twist your honeyBun too
much<00:03:57.930> because<00:03:58.930> then<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.380> loosens<00:03:59.830> it<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.520> you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
much because then it loosens it so you

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.690 
much because then it loosens it so you
can<00:04:01.090> definitely<00:04:01.600> feel<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.170> your<00:04:02.350> hands<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
can definitely feel with your hands the

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.610 
can definitely feel with your hands the
parts<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.150> are<00:04:04.390> covered<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.140> are<00:04:05.440> not

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
parts that are covered and that are not

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.500 
parts that are covered and that are not
covered<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.550> you<00:04:09.670> can<00:04:09.850> make<00:04:10.030> sure<00:04:10.240> that<00:04:10.270> you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
covered so you can make sure that you

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:24.540 
covered so you can make sure that you
get<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.930> all<00:04:13.380> perfect<00:04:15.510> okay<00:04:22.020> perfect<00:04:23.020> okay<00:04:23.650> and

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
get it all perfect okay perfect okay and

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.250 
get it all perfect okay perfect okay and
then<00:04:24.760> I'm<00:04:24.910> gonna<00:04:25.030> take<00:04:25.330> some<00:04:25.600> more<00:04:25.780> hairspray

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
then I'm gonna take some more hairspray

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.160 
then I'm gonna take some more hairspray
and<00:04:26.710> all<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.010> these<00:04:27.190> flyaways<00:04:27.700> I'm<00:04:28.630> going<00:04:28.990> to

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
and all of these flyaways I'm going to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.330 
and all of these flyaways I'm going to

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
spray and then as you can see I'm slowly

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.610 
spray and then as you can see I'm slowly
patting<00:04:34.120> down<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:35.190> flyways<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.960> positioning

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
patting down the flyways and positioning

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.020 
patting down the flyways and positioning
them<00:04:41.770> exactly<00:04:42.660> where<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.690> want<00:04:44.020> them<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.260> lay
