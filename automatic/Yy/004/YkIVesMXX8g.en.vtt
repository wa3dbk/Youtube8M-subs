00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.750
 If this is the case here and can 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.610
 to catch others we only have here 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.250
 including successes and not the theme of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.180
 Zebras' Africa for deadly kombat as well 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.350
 cool, I think, until then, it's down 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.979
 This is where I have to control the addiction. 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:38.180
 Legal systems good but I want to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:41.840
 coppe and I already did is download it 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.840
 then touch 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.770
 but anyway if you come here 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.060
 play on download it 's good you go 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.350
 need a thumb drive I do not know if 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.190
 I can work it but I think 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.119
 it works 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.180
 ok you will create two folders but the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.899
 first I already wanted this ps3 folder 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.160
 right click on the new pass ps3 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.470
 with capital letters and then inside the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.290
 pasta will be english 3 passes theme 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.510
 in case I'm here I'm talking about 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.569
 Portuguese more in his case here 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.060
 writing in English can not can not be 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.790
 themes can not be sentenced can not 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.250
 being with an s in the end has to be this 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.739
 this way because if it is otherwise 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.769
 does not work and if you do shit on 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.870
 your ps3 because it takes everything right but 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.910
 if you do crap and it can be a 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.790
 Shit, I do not blame myself for the shit. 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.330
 damage you are bringing yourself 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.569
 because that way that this method 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.850
 it works 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:52.430
 Okay good then you pass your theme 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.970
 here for the event in which you already have here 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.030
 Both good subjects now I 'll be 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.820
 passing on to me is a cell phone that I go 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.950
 record happened there is to show it to 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.510
 how do you install remembering that 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.329
 these folders here are all in my pen 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.329
 drive is depending has to be 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:14.859
 because otherwise it is possible to intervene 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.870
 means that if I do not know what my 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.120
 level of life has not detected anything my pen 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.060
 I do not know what drive program is here 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.880
 I do not know not but anyway 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.440
 every antivirus has a problem so much is 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.400
 When are you going to do a scut? 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.190
 something 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.140
 Some antivirus programs report viruses and other 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.640
 not being clearer they are not all 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.280
 antivirus have all the videos in the world 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.739
 understood then it is recommended 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.410
 but if you can not get out but 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.989
 happen to shit on your ps3 that will 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.829

 He had to stop my hand my music. 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.960
 trembling to make my mouth 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:17.770
 more strength in mobile to hear my 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:22.240

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:25.360

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:50.160
 maintenance of this maintenance 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.790
 because you want to play the existence of a 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.910
 fps time can yield one of three 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:20.040
 Maintenance ok but I do not care to see 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:22.930
 in settings and view and there are settings or 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.380
 connecting a pen drive will remove it 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.380
 they are going to start saying on ps3
