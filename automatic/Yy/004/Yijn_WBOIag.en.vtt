00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.470
 for the realization of a molding you 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.690
 will need four boards for 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.009
 to realize the formwork of plaster of a 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.110
 screwdriver and this renoir 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.539
 we start by doing the formwork at 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.650
 the dimension of the object that we are going 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.810
 mold and we take the different 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.330
 benchmarks in relation to our object for 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.910
 know where we are going to make the 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.460
 different parts of the mold is fixed 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:41.840
 so the different plates that are going 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:46.270
 to form the formwork for that we 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.270
 fixed using a screwdriver and davis 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.390
 then to prevent the plaster from 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:01.600
 sticks too much to marble and boards 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.600
 we will smear black soap but surface 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.870
 the plaster is prepared in quantity 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.190
 sufficient 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:14.900
 then stir so that it is poured by the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.580
 following the plaster must be cool and enough 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.350
 quickly 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.670
 we must then put the object in 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.680
 this one before he took this 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.340
 step is decisive in the realization 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.340
 of the mold 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.940
 the object has no counter 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.350
 major rainfall so it will be composed the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.270
 two-part mold once the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.540
 plaster which constitutes the first part 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.140
 of the mold hardened then we go high school 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.110
 surface do detain if necessary and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.700
 add black soap on the set of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.700
 the surface of the mold and the vase 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.280
 finally the mold will be finalized by pouring 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.440
 a sufficient amount of plaster 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.509
 liquid on the first part it will take 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.209
 so wait a few hours so that 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.220
 the plaster solidifies remove the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.420
 formwork and then we can 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.420
 open the mold
