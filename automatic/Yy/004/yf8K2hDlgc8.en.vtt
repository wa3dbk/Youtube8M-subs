actually want to introduce them in
pee-wee's<00:01:25.140> hatch<00:01:25.409> because<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.860> thought<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
pee-wee's hatch because I thought you

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.980 
pee-wee's hatch because I thought you
know<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> neutral<00:01:27.000> space<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.420> introduce<00:01:27.810> them

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.200 
know a neutral space to introduce them
but<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.680> lady's<00:01:29.040> introduced<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.759> many<00:01:29.970> balls

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
but this lady's introduced so many balls

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
but this lady's introduced so many balls
together<00:01:30.479> over<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.530> over<00:01:31.740> again<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.610> she

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
together over and over again that she

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
together over and over again that she
said<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.479> put<00:01:33.600> him<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.840> peace<00:01:34.049> hutch

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
said here just put him in peace hutch

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.920 
said here just put him in peace hutch
but<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.159> did<00:01:35.460> actually<00:01:35.670> give<00:01:36.060> peewee<00:01:36.540> such<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
but I did actually give peewee such a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.100 
but I did actually give peewee such a
big<00:01:37.350> clean-out<00:01:37.950> beforehand<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.329> everything

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
big clean-out beforehand to everything

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.969 
big clean-out beforehand to everything
out<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.759> made<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.180> clear<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.630> possible

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
out it just made it as clear as possible

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
out it just made it as clear as possible
so<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.700> less<00:01:45.570> likely<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.110> fight

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
so there would be less likely to fight

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.380 
so there would be less likely to fight
possibly<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.250> very<00:01:47.460> apprehensive<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.270> as

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
possibly I was very apprehensive but as

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.630 
possibly I was very apprehensive but as
you'll<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:49.140> went<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.920> well

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.910 

so<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.910> is<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.120> old<00:01:54.330> teddy<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.990> even<00:01:55.770> though

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
so this is an old teddy and even though

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.600 
so this is an old teddy and even though
he's<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.520> small<00:01:56.910> he<00:01:57.240> actually<00:01:57.900> scared<00:01:58.290> PE<00:01:58.620> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
he's so small he actually scared PE so

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
little guinea pig I don't think people

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.730

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
really knew what to do so he kept

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.530 
really knew what to do so he kept
running<00:02:10.950> down<00:02:11.280> stairs<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.060> run<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.480> he

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
running down stairs into the run and he

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.420 
running down stairs into the run and he
doesn't<00:02:12.900> usually<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.440> hardly<00:02:14.010> goes<00:02:14.250> in

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
doesn't usually do that hardly goes in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.070 
doesn't usually do that hardly goes in
his<00:02:14.550> run<00:02:14.790> he<00:02:14.910> goes<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.210> his<00:02:15.300> balcony<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.930> not

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
his run he goes on his balcony but not

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.920 
his run he goes on his balcony but not
in<00:02:16.200> his<00:02:16.350> run<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.880> picked<00:02:18.390> peewee<00:02:18.780> up

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
in his run and so I picked peewee up

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.960 
in his run and so I picked peewee up
putting<00:02:19.560> back<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.950> gave<00:02:20.220> them<00:02:20.400> some<00:02:20.550> lettuce<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
putting back in gave them some lettuce I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.210 
putting back in gave them some lettuce I
thought<00:02:21.150> they<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.360> eat<00:02:21.720> over<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.470> as

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
thought they can eat over that and as

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.690 
thought they can eat over that and as
you<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:24.410> teddy<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.950> confident<00:02:26.580> he

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you can see teddy is so confident he

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.160 
you can see teddy is so confident he
just<00:02:26.940> went<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.360> peewee<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.840> nicked<00:02:28.020> his

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
just went up to peewee and nicked his

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.860 
just went up to peewee and nicked his
lettuce<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.790> believe<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.630> Teddy

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
lettuce and then I believe that Teddy

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.440 
lettuce and then I believe that Teddy
wanted<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> go<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.770> sniff<00:02:32.160> peewee<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.120> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
wanted to go up and sniff peewee and you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.240 
wanted to go up and sniff peewee and you
know<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:33.810> interact<00:02:34.320> peewee<00:02:34.920> was<00:02:35.070> quite

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
know like interact peewee was quite

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.640 
know like interact peewee was quite
unsure<00:02:35.700> about<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.180> once<00:02:36.960> again<00:02:37.140> he<00:02:37.440> just

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
unsure about this once again he just

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.050 
unsure about this once again he just
goes<00:02:37.830> down<00:02:38.100> into<00:02:38.370> his<00:02:38.520> run<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:40.110> really

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
goes down into his run so it was really

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.940 
goes down into his run so it was really
completely<00:02:42.060> not<00:02:42.630> what<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> expected<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.710> thought

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
completely not what I expected I thought

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.860 
completely not what I expected I thought
it's<00:02:44.160> gonna<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.670> complete<00:02:45.060> opposite<00:02:45.690> way

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
it's gonna be the complete opposite way

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
it's gonna be the complete opposite way
round

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.520 

obviously<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.030> let<00:02:52.360> peewee<00:02:52.690> go<00:02:52.960> in<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.260> run<00:02:53.500> and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
obviously I let peewee go in the run and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.310 
obviously I let peewee go in the run and
have<00:02:54.370> his<00:02:54.520> time<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:55.030> his<00:02:55.210> own<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:56.050> then<00:02:56.230> I

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
have his time on his own but then I

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.630 
have his time on his own but then I
realized<00:02:56.680> he<00:02:56.770> wanted<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.070> come<00:02:57.190> back<00:02:57.430> upstairs

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
realized he wanted to come back upstairs

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.370 
realized he wanted to come back upstairs
but<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.330> little<00:02:58.570> woman<00:02:58.810> was<00:02:58.900> at<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.110> top<00:02:59.260> of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
but the little woman was at the top of

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.750 
but the little woman was at the top of
the<00:02:59.440> stairs<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.800> he<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.040> still<00:03:00.220> scared<00:03:00.640> of

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
the stairs and he was still scared of

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.030 
the stairs and he was still scared of
him<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.080> end<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.380> picked<00:03:02.710> him<00:03:02.830> up<00:03:02.890> and
