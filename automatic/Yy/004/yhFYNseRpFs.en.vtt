00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.550 
going to be successful and and I believe
that<00:02:21.480> we're<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.630> balanced<00:02:22.990> out<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.170> San<00:02:23.320> Jose

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
that we're so balanced out in San Jose

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.020 
that we're so balanced out in San Jose
we<00:02:23.680> made<00:02:23.830> some<00:02:24.040> some<00:02:24.280> big<00:02:24.430> deals<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.820> summer

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and like I said I'm just excited to get

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and like I said I'm just excited to get
back<00:02:27.280> out<00:02:27.430> there<00:02:27.490> with<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.790> guys<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.090> get

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
back out there with the guys and get

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.700 
back out there with the guys and get
this<00:02:28.300> season<00:02:28.630> started<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.110> believe<00:02:29.560> so

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
this season started I believe so

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.410 
this season started I believe so
back-to-back<00:02:30.550> years<00:02:30.700> making<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
back-to-back years making it to the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.880 
back-to-back years making it to the
Western<00:02:31.660> Conference<00:02:31.780> Finals<00:02:32.050> this<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.830> a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
Western Conference Finals this is a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.440 
Western Conference Finals this is a
pretty<00:02:33.100> awesome<00:02:33.730> accomplishment<00:02:33.820> for<00:02:34.330> an

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
pretty awesome accomplishment for an

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.360 
pretty awesome accomplishment for an
organization<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:36.040> with<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.190> deals

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
organization and I think with the deals

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.950 
organization and I think with the deals
that<00:02:36.460> we<00:02:36.580> made<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.850> summer<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:37.810> makes

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
that we made this summer it just makes

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.680 
that we made this summer it just makes
us<00:02:38.140> stronger<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:40.090> you're<00:02:40.270> going<00:02:40.420> back

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
us stronger so this you're going back

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.090 
us stronger so this you're going back
obviously<00:02:40.960> we<00:02:41.200> need<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.770> start<00:02:41.920> better

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
obviously we need to just start better

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.500 
obviously we need to just start better
than<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.340> did<00:02:42.460> last<00:02:42.520> year<00:02:42.820> we<00:02:43.030> were<00:02:43.120> we<00:02:43.450> were

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
than we did last year we were we were

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.570 
than we did last year we were we were
struggling<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.230> gate<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:45.010> cost

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
struggling out of the gate and that cost

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.000 
struggling out of the gate and that cost
us<00:02:45.760> down<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.000> stretch<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.720> think<00:02:47.320> from<00:02:47.530> from

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
us down the stretch so I think from from

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.950 
us down the stretch so I think from from
game<00:02:48.190> one<00:02:48.370> we<00:02:48.520> need<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.850> ready<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.270> we'll

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
game one we need to be ready and we'll

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.950 
game one we need to be ready and we'll
see<00:02:50.110> where<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.290> season<00:02:50.470> takes<00:02:50.770> us
