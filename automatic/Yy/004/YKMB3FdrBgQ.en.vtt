00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.680
 Welcome to the sunny 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.200
 california in san jose here is the place 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.640
 nvidia gpu technology conference held 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.150
 to show the latest developments 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.100
 in automotive so here we are in the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.440
 the current bmw 640 bmw used in the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.080
 navigation professional a nvidia gpu 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.070
 for the rendering of the card and often 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.050
 of the entire media entertainment system 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.760
 the focus of bmw lies mainly in 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.570
 fast margins will be the time 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.020
 gpu used here in bmw 640 we have 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.740
 3 d objects real time traffic we have 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 textured satellite images and shows 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.120
 very clear why at the gpu also in the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.420
 car is needed here on the margins 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.300
 can see speed set here 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.430
 we now in the new current audi a3 the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.250
 audi a3 here is equipped with the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.729
 great mmi multi media system what of 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.610
 nvidia tegra is operated and that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.230
 big mmi system on the ground so far too 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.050
 a lte connections we have the 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.450
 possibility roads in satellite images 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.580
 from google earth to integrate into the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.470
 navigation display what, of course, then 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.280
 again from our nvidia tegra 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.160
 is rendered 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.830
 and if we purely for we see beautiful 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.940
 graphic with nice animations in the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.620
 navigation system here have the now 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.750
 just satellite images and no 3d 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.490
 building but that can also be over 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.410
 select the menu accordingly 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.780
 Now we have switched the view 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.670
 on the 3d building where we have google 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.500
 earth deactivated and if we now 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.660
 purely attracted see them now here in 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.910
 downtown San Jesse the buildings 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.220
 corresponding 3d texture is wrong and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.599
 rendered 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.640
 here we are now in a jeep grand 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.440
 cherokee we work closely with sap 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.360
 together time and we have one 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.150
 normal production model taken 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.340
 have the dashboard and the middle date 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.260
 exchanged to show what we are up to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.930
 can do everything on our ticker k1 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.959
 it runs a demo with a ticket 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.430
 1 processor is fired on that 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.200
 a cherish ticker 1 module 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.880
 we are accommodated in the trunk 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.620
 have here 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.980
 and we can have different views 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.200
 switch to navigate navigation view 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.550
 fuel consumption we can do that 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.470
 complete dashboard toggle speedometer 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.030
 rev counter 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.950
 we have a terra view which we 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.870
 In this demo it is possible to switch over 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.810
 especially to show what you are doing 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.520
 could like the different functions 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.310
 look like and the whole in one 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.960
 vehicle itself looks like here we see 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.560
 the central display in the jeep grand 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.510
 cherokee 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.140
 we have a touchscreen here 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.640
 surface we can implement 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.750
 Music switches the navigation system 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.730
 switch 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.700
 we can turn on seat heaters and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.380
 switch off and the whole where we have 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.360
 from a standard grand cherokee 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.490
 we have modified the original of the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.920
 sport taken out our big 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.200
 the screen is one of a kind 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.060
 tegra k1 is fired and wants to do so 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.720
 In the first place we show what is possible 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.640
 is 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.440
 the car does not exist so buy that 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.570
 has our colleague dave anderson complete 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.390
 itself modified similar to one 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.370
 case mod in a pc and it looks 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.640
 great and shows what's possible 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.260
 in cars to conclude we also show 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.880
 the audi a7 of ours 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.460
 opening keynote plays a big role 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.230
 he has played demonstrates autonomous 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.030
 drive and for the first time he uses 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.190
 not a giant pc in the trunk 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.980
 is hidden but he uses one 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.870
 small module with nvidia tegra k1 the 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.560
 all the tasks are necessary 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.060
 to enable autonomous driving 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.620
 thank you for your interest i hope 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.740
 you liked it until the next one 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.740
 times
