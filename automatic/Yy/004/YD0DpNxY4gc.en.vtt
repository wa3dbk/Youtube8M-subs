00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:11.790
 I felt like anybody 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.790
 I'm fine 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.880
 beauty of the whole world as they are 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.860
 I hope you are having a day 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 very precious like all of you 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.520
 that for my part I'm super happy 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.380
 be with them once more and more 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.059
 this time because I bring you one day 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.400
 just as it is for itself or yes we did 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.559
 super trendy thinks that just like me 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.809
 very much excess in embargo speaks to them of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.250
 this beautiful accessory of this maximum already 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.170
 if you see at this time 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 silver that you're very intendancy in 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 these moments because what seen in 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.350
 many festivals of pages like 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.809
 tumblr better said in a lot of blogs 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.880
 fashion in stores like zara bershka 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.739
 forever they are equal or better 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.009
 countless stores and prices that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 it's a meeting of friends, not 80 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.630
 euros what is seen is saying is online 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.149
 at 80 euros I wrote two good ones and this one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.130
 preciousness but it's worth paying 80 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.450
 euros for an accessory that may not be 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.160
 we will place every day 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 obviously do not attend to study 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.910
 fantastic idea to do it with little things 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.710
 that I know we all have in our 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.200
 houses because we can acquire super 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.670
 easy at some mass in the haberdashery 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.380
 rather, just around the corner 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.649
 so you can not miss it because 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.649
 is 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.270
 and if I did it so I wanted to share 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.180
 this idea with all of you and hundreds of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.890
 kilos 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 for this day and today we will need a 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.270
 Thick transparent plastic piece 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.060
 gun with hot silicone necklaces 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.680
 that we already know gems chains everything 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.880
 silver that you have and if not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.100
 they have with their templates they can 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.680
 use an aerosol spray and to 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.729
 finish some tweezers let's start 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.830
 sticking the necklace on the plastic with 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.360
 hot silicone in this way by 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.399
 below so you do not go to see 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.930
 remember that if you do not have necklaces 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.209
 silvery what they can do is 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.520
 paint them with spray paint as 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.640
 I showed we're going to start sticking the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.410
 gemstones of I do not know what you guys 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.540
 have at your fingertips I am using 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.520
 these little rings that came by strip 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 I'm cutting are in plastic but 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.680
 It seems that it was like metal I'm going to go 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.630
 hitting like this around the necklace and now 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.790
 I'm going to add a string this too 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.040
 It was golden but I painted it I'm going to 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.530
 spend super well with hot silicone 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 around the whole necklace and so I'm going to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.130
 do 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.030
 with everything that has cancer whether they are 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.130
 gems stones pearls like in this 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.440
 case these pearls will be Christmas for 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.240
 I found them there and I cut them and they 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.980
 study using on my collar looks 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.080
 super cute the idea of this necklace is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 that looks super charged but everything in the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.600
 Same color in silver so you can see 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.360
 as well as very minimalist now I'm going to 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.970
 add again string again 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.860
 I'm going to add you how are you nuggets 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.470
 that were in flowers were black from the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.300
 paint in silver and to finish them 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.920
 I'm going to add these Semites that also 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.780
 they were from an old necklace that I no longer wore 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.390
 I painted it also so that everything 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.700
 so super uniform and to finish 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.580
 let's just cut the excess 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.350
 plastic so that it yields super well and for 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.350
 It seems that treading comes like this 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.480
 will be and this is the final result 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.830
 now it 's that I loved no one is going 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.290
 to realize that we ourselves 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.150
 we did and we are going to have a unique piece 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.290
 very stylish and that is in all 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.290
 gateways of the world 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.880
 if I'm well sheltered 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.670
 Yes really 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.129
 ah 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.630
 d 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.389
 but it is not like that
