00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
could care less and he certainly has a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.520 
could care less and he certainly has a
history<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:24.790> being<00:02:25.060> afraid<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.530> get

history of not being afraid to get
dunked<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:26.980> he's<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.640> contest<00:02:27.970> shots

dunked on he's going to contest shots
and<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:29.470> what<00:02:29.769> has<00:02:29.920> happened<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.519> that

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
and I think what has happened is that

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.059 
and I think what has happened is that
mentality<00:02:31.720> becomes<00:02:32.230> contagious<00:02:32.620> because

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
mentality becomes contagious because

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.809 
mentality becomes contagious because

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
Festus is he's gaining that he doesn't

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.190 
Festus is he's gaining that he doesn't

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
have it he gets out of there every now

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.770 
have it he gets out of there every now
and<00:02:38.410> then<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:39.670> he<00:02:39.790> does<00:02:39.970> those<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.750> the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
this see how much he expects that the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.940 
this see how much he expects that the
practice<00:04:01.280> really<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> rest<00:04:02.520> of<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.700> series

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
practice really the rest of the series

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.699 
practice really the rest of the series
well<00:04:04.879> we<00:04:05.360> don't<00:04:05.780> have<00:04:05.900> much<00:04:06.080> practice<00:04:06.319> time

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
well we don't have much practice time

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.820 
well we don't have much practice time
anyway<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.400> when<00:04:08.300> we<00:04:08.450> do<00:04:08.660> we<00:04:08.870> break<00:04:09.530> stuff

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
anyway and when we do we break stuff

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.610 
anyway and when we do we break stuff
down<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.459> we<00:04:11.450> get<00:04:11.599> up<00:04:11.750> shots<00:04:12.050> I<00:04:12.319> think<00:04:12.500> this

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
down and we get up shots I think this

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.690 
down and we get up shots I think this
time<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:13.069> year<00:04:13.099> is<00:04:13.849> not<00:04:14.330> important<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.140> be<00:04:16.040> in
