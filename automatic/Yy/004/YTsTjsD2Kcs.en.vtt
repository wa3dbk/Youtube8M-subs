00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
within it like the Blowfish when you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.970 
within it like the Blowfish when you
when<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> color<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.539> Blowfish<00:00:51.989> it'll<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260 

we<00:00:57.180> need<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.450> color<00:00:57.630> a<00:00:57.720> little<00:00:57.809> more

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.590 

and<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.590> other<00:01:02.739> does<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.790> you'll<00:01:04.000> see<00:01:04.180> that

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
and the other does and you'll see that

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.359 
and the other does and you'll see that
if<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.989> child<00:01:05.199> accidentally<00:01:05.890> touches<00:01:06.250> the
