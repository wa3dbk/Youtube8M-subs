00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.729
 good afternoon here we are going to teach you 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.660
 how to disassemble a radio from a nissan 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.180
 navara year 2013 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.760
 the main thing is to have the tool 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.990
 suitable for clearing these 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.689
 pieces this board looks compact but 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.340
 this part is very essential this 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.050
 part has to be disassembled with a lot 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.010
 careful hopefully with a screwdriver or 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.810
 a tip which allows us to access 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.899
 she easily 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.900
 upwards first when dismounting towards 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:41.670
 up comes back 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.020
 is the piece is hooked back 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.430
 and up 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.530
 it is very important to maintain the order of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.290
 the pieces then this screw is removed 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.850
 which is the one that states the entire console 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.970
 the screw that is here and here what 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.400
 we take and pull back 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.400
 We pulled back pulling back 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.060
 face to ride previously I had 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.310
 disconnected these 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.939
 these connectors that are the ones that go to 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.939
 air condition 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.630
 and there the console stays outside then 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.650
 we remove the four screws that are 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.130
 there 1 2 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.869
 3 and 4 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.869
 we have the radio organize the bar 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.869
 disassembled 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.850
 in case you want to change this device 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.940
 then we proceed with a poles search 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.670
 to search 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.560
 its current cables that all the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.090
 radios remember that we have the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 positive direct that would be that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.509
 we have 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.509
 the wire 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.160
 of the lights we turn on the first 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:14.020
 position and we look for the cable that 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.020
 corresponds to the lights 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.270
 what is the lights 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.540
 you have to identify the cables for 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.489
 know the three positives we have 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.329
 all the berries usually have 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.329
 these three cables 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:06.960
 it's 20 light signal 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.730
 the other is a positive director who does not 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.500
 I would be missing the positive 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.150
 sheet 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.230
 in this case I'm going to install a 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.230
 bluetooth system 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.880
 now we are looking for positive sheet metal feet 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.880
 we give him the contact he makes and we look 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.260
 l 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.260
 that's him 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:49.270
 I cut them off the tester that is 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.710
 the positive one called with that we had 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.690
 identified the cables and the rest of 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.860
 the parents the rest would be the hot ones 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:05.200
 veneer lights or direct site 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:08.319
 the negative negative 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.239
 and it would not be leaving the cables of the 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.950
 speakers would have been 2 467 say 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.130
 7 goods corresponding to the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.200
 speakers 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.340
 with that is the purpose of identifying the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.340
 cables but
