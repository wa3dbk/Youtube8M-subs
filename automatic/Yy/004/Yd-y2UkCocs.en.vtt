problem and then your cpu speed which is
very<00:02:49.890> simple<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.459> recommend<00:02:50.880> trying<00:02:51.060> this

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
very simple I recommend trying this

very simple I recommend trying this
first<00:02:51.600> change<00:02:52.050> your<00:02:52.200> CPU<00:02:52.620> speeds<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.190> 333<00:02:53.850> /

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
first change your CPU speeds to 333 /

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.430 
first change your CPU speeds to 333 /
166<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:56.850> either<00:02:57.000> use<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.450> VSH<00:02:57.870> menu<00:02:58.230> or

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
166 you can either use the VSH menu or

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.130 
166 you can either use the VSH menu or
the<00:02:58.470> recovery<00:02:58.950> menu<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.540> that's<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.750> it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the recovery menu and that's about it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.220 
the recovery menu and that's about it
that's<00:03:01.440> how<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:02.390> pretty<00:03:03.390> much<00:03:03.480> all<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:04.050> say

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that's how I pretty much all I can say

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
different firmware that could cause it

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.469 
different firmware that could cause it
to<00:04:27.350> freeze<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:28.090> anything<00:04:29.090> else<00:04:29.180> other<00:04:29.360> than

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
to freeze and anything else other than

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.379 
to freeze and anything else other than
others<00:04:30.110> like<00:04:30.199> that<00:04:30.410> that's<00:04:31.190> specifically<00:04:32.030> for

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
others like that that's specifically for

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.330 
others like that that's specifically for
specific<00:04:32.990> versions<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.530> homebrew<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.160> run

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
specific versions of homebrew that run

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.210 
specific versions of homebrew that run
on<00:04:34.490> separate<00:04:35.150> firmwares<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:36.710> have<00:04:36.860> an<00:04:36.949> SC

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
on separate firmwares and you have an SC

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.219 
on separate firmwares and you have an SC
plugin<00:04:37.610> for<00:04:37.759> that<00:04:37.940> that'll<00:04:38.419> also<00:04:38.690> cause<00:04:38.990> it<00:04:39.139> to

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
plugin for that that'll also cause it to

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.520 
plugin for that that'll also cause it to
freeze<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:40.599> that's<00:04:41.599> about<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:42.110> that's<00:04:42.229> all<00:04:42.380> the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
freeze so that's about it that's all the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.260 
freeze so that's about it that's all the
advice<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.919> can<00:04:43.069> really<00:04:43.250> give<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.699> I<00:04:43.940> can't

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
advice I can really give you I can't

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.689 
advice I can really give you I can't

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
really do any hands-on stuff because

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.020 
really do any hands-on stuff because
this<00:04:47.419> guy<00:04:47.569> didn't<00:04:48.020> tell<00:04:48.380> me<00:04:48.560> exactly<00:04:49.370> what<00:04:49.910> he

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
this guy didn't tell me exactly what he

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.950 
this guy didn't tell me exactly what he
has<00:04:50.210> installed<00:04:50.660> or<00:04:51.190> what<00:04:52.190> he<00:04:52.490> actually<00:04:53.479> uses

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
has installed or what he actually uses

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.800 
has installed or what he actually uses
his<00:04:54.259> PSP<00:04:54.560> for<00:04:54.740> or<00:04:55.400> whether<00:04:55.970> or<00:04:56.150> not<00:04:56.270> he's<00:04:56.539> used

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
his PSP for or whether or not he's used

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.990 
his PSP for or whether or not he's used
in<00:04:56.960> CSO's<00:04:57.560> or<00:04:58.039> or<00:04:59.050> iso's<00:05:00.050> things<00:05:00.440> like<00:05:00.590> that

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
in CSO's or or iso's things like that

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.730 
in CSO's or or iso's things like that
but<00:05:02.000> yeah<00:05:02.150> all's<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.750> can<00:05:02.810> basically<00:05:03.050> say<00:05:03.530> is

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
but yeah all's I can basically say is

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.249
