00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.170
 new video third part of our series 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.179
 rechargeable batteries 80 titanium against google nexus 7 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.070
 the spammers we use the tablets go 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.599
 into individual apps ryan and i show you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.309
 and explain yourself a little something 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.870
 me in the weeks of advertising use 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 so noticed 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 first google nexus 7 we never have 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.920
 a pure android operating system 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 speak from above down vision as well 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.070
 google that had thought 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.820
 About the tablet and we see here 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.929
 android version 4 points 2.2 at markus 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 it is a bit different 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.559
 they have such an easy one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.880
 Modifications made a bit 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.469
 getting used to it a bit 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.100
 unlike you just an android though 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.170
 not much 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.340
 So from below vision is down here 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.390
 then the notification bar settings 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 and here, too, we'll take a quick look 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.879
 over the tablet and seen android version 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 4.1.1 when and again such an update 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.410
 is not yet known 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.899
 but what should be noticed 7 should be 8 inches 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 tablet and how the cheap noticeable 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.260
 even if we have some apps 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.239
 now just split two spaces on the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.309
 archos and on the next stop only 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.900
 a funny thing then 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.799
 me at the hardware video totally 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.680
 gone through 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.110
 and if we go here once 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 go to the display and always up there 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.360
 display go brightness then there is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.130
 the nexus 7 the possibility the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.450
 to activate automatic brightness 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.560
 that is because that s.der 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 front camera 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 right next to it as a small 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.130
 Brightness sensor is the missing 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.200
 nexus s complete with marcos 80 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.430
 The team knows only a brightness if 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.930
 i want to adjust that i need that from 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.310
 but it does work a bit 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.810
 So just from the bottom high vision 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.990
 attitudes and then I have too 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.159
 already the brightness menu yes what else 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.560
 we noticed, but now we go 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.790
 but in some apps purely what you guys 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 could be so interested 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.110
 and we just grab one another 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.110
 such a google plus here for example 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.330
 so and so see the dinger then easy 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.040
 both are charged and here is mine 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.170
 google + feed and what is striking both are 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.060
 in the same wlan both jerk so one 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.789
 not really the arcus rocket 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.030
 always a bit more but the display 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.560
 it responds cd then you will now 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.900
 sometimes several examples see it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.750
 does not react as fluently as nice as 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.040
 you want that but only that time 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.290
 compares a few images side by side 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.090
 so also the little lexus shows you yet 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.190
 enough content to 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.330
 then we just go in 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.090
 Google Maps 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.220
 Here I have maps because I have maps 3 2 1 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.930
 and from now on, the archos is here 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.060
 a bit faster with his dual core 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.620
 processor and so was one 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.220
 we can stop playing around 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.459
 take the plains and go to the times 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.480
 Satellite setting 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.930
 maybe even get in sync 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.670
 3 21 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.630
 So that does not really matter 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.030
 if we differ a bit 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.799
 In and out can zoom in now 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.829
 Every man picture of it does something 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.739
 liquid acts both jerk of course 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:10.280
 but I think that nexus does it all 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.700
 a whole corner of liquid number for the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.010
 small comparison then let us 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.570
 I'll start a game 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.859
 on both such a shooter on this one 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:31.040
 bed son 3 2 1 and did not work 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.160
 321 and tip yes discover the arcus 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.470
 earlier also in the loading process what you 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.620
 Processor power sees if its quad 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.209
 core or dual core 1 6 gigahertz 1 2 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.650
 ghz 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.620
 they are pretty close together 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.019
 both have a gigabyte ram there 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.609
 somehow not really such a mega 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.829
 bombs difference so we have the 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:59.570
 home buttons course a horizontal 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:01.519
 mode just so you see how fast 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.630
 so the games data will be loaded if 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.750
 there are also times larger app 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.670
 then what interests so the otto normal 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.110
 users also the surf behavior 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.430
 wanted technology watch first I 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.430
 Here in there already comes up 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.540
 new tab google-side technique sloth 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.730
 good if i go here on google now 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:34.320
 inc press and there go on 3 2 1 good that 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.240
 was now I thought now would be well then 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.950
 Let's do the speed test from 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.830
 browser halt on the homepage is yes 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.410
 not as wild or 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.460
 Just want one 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.110
 see page relationship and there you see 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.790
 even like the different ones 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.340
 resolution is noticeable and that 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.500
 Size different 8 inches 7 inches 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.200
 Here I see with my website 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.580
 then the complete article here 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.340
 I see him but I still see 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.740
 what of the columns so krainer 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.690
 outside yes we can and the whole 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.520
 works a lot smoother 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.890
 you here how the arChOs bears left 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.870
 has already worked out and that's how it is 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.150
 things I do not know why it is 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.490
 is due to the software is on display 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.150
 that hangs up again and again 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.970
 scroll around clean or so yes that is 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.080
 that is now for a change 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.620
 not on my website 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.610
 those are things I press out 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.310
 the next 3 2 1 finally motto 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.750
 So they do not load up a lot 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.450
 both come up a bit more here 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.270
 the big picture first markus is ready 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.350
 nexus 7 is still loading so there are 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.460
 not much more, that's a quick one 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.100
 want that others faster 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.710
 but definitely me at markus 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.340
 exciting is the display and the reaction 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.410
 the touchscreen reacts by far 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.620
 not so gentle too cute and as accurate as 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.200
 at the nexus 7 and that's easy 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.180
 no fun in the use of can 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.130
 the thing still such a micro hdmi output 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.910
 sd card but have in the daily 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:09.390
 I would use it again at any time 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.480
 nexus 7 engage always press open 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.950
 this is my rss reader app 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.040
 then you see that again 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:20.070
 difference between 2 between the 18th 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.790
 you have only 22 years here then one 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.410
 two row and the update 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.230
 both quite not quite fix 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:32.160
 there is nothing happening so I am reading 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.080
 rather it I have to say it acts on 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.400
 67 ticks sharper it reads 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.170
 tick more pleasant and especially that has 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.220
 I got you the first video is to 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:44.700
 I find enjoyable, but intend the word 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.140
 Sorry what if you have one 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.090
 thing from the video in the middle of then can 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.740
 that has at times the one then the other 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.930
 Faster is not really there 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.440
 but what if I can tell you one thing 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.640
 then it is really real sometimes 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.360
 frustrating with this tablet too 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.160
 work 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.930
 that reacts to so many places 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.520
 inaccurate and if now a thing sets 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.120
 but back and so everything 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.920
 made 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.600
 I do not know if the software problems 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.270
 is if the archos with next update 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.810
 fixes but the thing is easy too 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.010
 inaccurate 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.780
 so that's it we're through here 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.210
 my clear recommendation reaches for the nexus 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.600
 7 if you are between these two tablet 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.610
 you hanging around and in the 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.460
 next week or next video then 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.190
 does that arChOs 80 times against athenaeum 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.960
 the apple ipad mini at the start and times 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.180
 look how the differences are there 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:38.240
 to look good makes it good and to the 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.240
 next video and just a look and
