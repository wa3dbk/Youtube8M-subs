00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.620
 tiles is not that the bathroom of times and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 made a very different special video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.250
 do not be what we spend most on play is 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.950
 Only Me 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.230
 anyway it's a special video today because 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.600
 because there are a lot of people who bought this 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.539
 new console xbox self control here already 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 new console and his problem was mine 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.439
 biggest problem is the control that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.980
 Comes with battery follow very late 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.829
 but anyway it because the console is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.690
 great very good so look at you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.910
 how do you use xbox control the year 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.910
 you can always see that it is without a stack 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.960
 works as well and also a charger 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.649
 or usb disease that one of the tips is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.030
 this format is O can see here 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.640
 which is a format that fits here then 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.229
 Ok cool, there's already a deal 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.010
 so the potential to grow in the table 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.140
 microsoft r $ 150 I will not pay the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.930
 things things so if you have one 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.979
 pendency works together with taking 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:30.329
 so much that I'm going to use now how 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:41.040
 everyone is there in the same outlet was 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:46.700
 the following you on the internet but this is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.729
 a cable to relate 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.890
 I'll plug the usb cable into the power outlet reminding 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.250
 which also works you have a font 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:03.590
 power that also works 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.590
 so I put it in my socket 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.079
 he has it offers cable was accident or 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.659
 whether to make the control vibrate 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.730
 happens guys but I will not spend 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.799
 both drums but as everything forces five 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.829
 and eight years that control with the beautiful 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.829
 lots of vibration and dirty battery pack 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.620
 completely then the video stayed for 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.610
