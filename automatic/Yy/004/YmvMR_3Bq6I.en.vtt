very close with kake play in showing you
how<00:00:16.570> easy<00:00:16.599> it<00:00:17.320> is<00:00:17.410> to<00:00:17.769> use<00:00:17.919> isomalt<00:00:18.640> and<00:00:18.820> it<00:00:19.330> is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
how easy it is to use isomalt and it is

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.329 
how easy it is to use isomalt and it is
pre-made<00:00:19.960> isomalt<00:00:20.499> so<00:00:20.679> all<00:00:20.800> you<00:00:20.890> have<00:00:21.039> to<00:00:21.070> do

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
pre-made isomalt so all you have to do

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.130 
pre-made isomalt so all you have to do
then<00:00:21.580> is<00:00:21.789> put<00:00:22.179> it<00:00:22.300> into<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.599> microwave<00:00:22.720> and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
then is put it into the microwave and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.960 
then is put it into the microwave and
heat<00:00:23.230> it<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:23.829> so<00:00:24.070> today<00:00:24.369> we're<00:00:24.609> going<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.880> be

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
heat it and so today we're going to be

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.419 
heat it and so today we're going to be
playing<00:00:25.210> with<00:00:25.419> ice<00:00:25.660> how<00:00:26.050> to<00:00:26.109> make<00:00:26.289> ice<00:00:26.439> so<00:00:27.130> this

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
playing with ice how to make ice so this

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.909 
playing with ice how to make ice so this
is<00:00:27.579> as<00:00:27.759> easy<00:00:27.999> as<00:00:28.240> this<00:00:28.480> is<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:29.079> need<00:00:29.289> to<00:00:29.320> have<00:00:29.470> a

metal bowl on the brush I have a little
bit<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.370> shortening<00:00:33.820> and<00:00:33.970> I'm<00:00:34.480> just<00:00:34.720> going<00:00:34.990> to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
bit of shortening and I'm just going to

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.030 
bit of shortening and I'm just going to
coat<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.560> bow<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:36.030> little<00:00:37.030> bit<00:00:37.830> you<00:00:38.830> want<00:00:38.920> to

make sure that you get all of your edges

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.010 
make sure that you get all of your edges
because<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.250> isomalt<00:00:42.760> will<00:00:43.030> stick<00:00:43.330> to<00:00:43.540> it<00:00:43.660> but

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
because the isomalt will stick to it but

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.780 
because the isomalt will stick to it but
with<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.320> coating<00:00:44.740> on<00:00:44.890> there<00:00:45.130> it'll<00:00:45.520> just

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
with that coating on there it'll just

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.160 
with that coating on there it'll just
slide<00:00:46.030> right<00:00:46.060> on<00:00:46.270> off<00:00:46.600> as<00:00:46.840> easy<00:00:47.830> as<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.190> I

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
slide right on off as easy as that I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.170 
slide right on off as easy as that I
have<00:00:50.170> crushed<00:00:50.410> ice<00:00:53.370> goes<00:00:54.370> into<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:54.790> bowl

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
have crushed ice goes into the bowl

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.200 
have crushed ice goes into the bowl
nothing<00:00:56.050> hard<00:00:56.550> let's<00:00:57.550> set<00:00:57.730> that<00:00:57.850> out<00:00:57.910> of<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
nothing hard let's set that out of the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.860 
nothing hard let's set that out of the
way<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:59.680> we<00:00:59.830> go<00:00:59.950> I've<00:01:00.550> heated<00:01:00.970> my<00:01:01.450> clear

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
way there we go I've heated my clear

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.170 
way there we go I've heated my clear
isomalt<00:01:02.500> in<00:01:02.740> the<00:01:02.950> microwave<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.610> every

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
isomalt in the microwave and every

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.910 
isomalt in the microwave and every
microwave<00:01:04.659> is<00:01:04.869> going<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.289> be<00:01:05.439> a<00:01:05.619> little

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
microwave is going to be a little

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.969 
microwave is going to be a little
different<00:01:06.100> because<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:06.850> wattage<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:07.979> test

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
different because of the wattage so test

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.639 
different because of the wattage so test
your<00:01:09.189> microwave<00:01:09.539> start<00:01:10.539> at<00:01:10.689> a<00:01:10.719> minute<00:01:11.109> go<00:01:11.409> from

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
your microwave start at a minute go from

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.620 
your microwave start at a minute go from
there<00:01:11.829> if<00:01:11.920> you're<00:01:12.070> using<00:01:12.219> a<00:01:12.490> full<00:01:12.759> cup<00:01:12.999> and<00:01:13.179> so

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
there if you're using a full cup and so

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.050 
there if you're using a full cup and so
I<00:01:13.659> needed<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:14.439> nice<00:01:14.649> liquid<00:01:14.979> form<00:01:15.399> this

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
I needed it to a nice liquid form this

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.230 
I needed it to a nice liquid form this
is<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.299> hard<00:01:16.569> part<00:01:17.429> see<00:01:18.429> how<00:01:18.670> easy<00:01:18.909> that<00:01:19.060> is

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
is the hard part see how easy that is

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.270 
is the hard part see how easy that is
I'm<00:01:19.569> just<00:01:19.630> pouring<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.530> all<00:01:20.649> I'm<00:01:20.890> doing<00:01:21.189> is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
I'm just pouring and all I'm doing is

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.190 
I'm just pouring and all I'm doing is
pouring<00:01:21.670> right<00:01:21.880> over<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.240> ice<00:01:22.600> just<00:01:22.960> going

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
pouring right over that ice just going

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.489 
pouring right over that ice just going
back<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.590> forth<00:01:24.359> so<00:01:25.359> that<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.990> will<00:01:26.170> melt<00:01:26.380> down

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
back and forth so that it will melt down

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.590 
back and forth so that it will melt down
inside<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.280> little<00:01:27.609> areas<00:01:28.030> for<00:01:28.359> the<00:01:28.450> ice

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
inside the little areas for the ice

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.370 
inside the little areas for the ice
isn't<00:01:29.259> and<00:01:29.469> then<00:01:30.249> when<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.520> pull<00:01:30.819> it<00:01:30.850> out<00:01:31.380> it'll

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
isn't and then when I pull it out it'll

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.609 
isn't and then when I pull it out it'll
be<00:01:32.469> fantastic<00:01:32.939> crushed<00:01:33.939> ice<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.229> over

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
be fantastic crushed ice and so over

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.770 
be fantastic crushed ice and so over
here<00:01:35.649> I'm<00:01:36.429> just<00:01:36.609> going<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.939> move<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.119> aside<00:01:37.389> I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
here I'm just going to move that aside I

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.209 
here I'm just going to move that aside I
have<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.920> ice<00:01:39.789> cube<00:01:40.119> tray<00:01:40.329> it<00:01:40.929> is<00:01:41.200> silicone<00:01:41.889> you

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
have a ice cube tray it is silicone you

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.039 
have a ice cube tray it is silicone you
don't<00:01:42.579> want<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.880> pour<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.389> any<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.899> ice

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
don't want to pour in any of the ice

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.020 
don't want to pour in any of the ice
cube<00:01:44.350> trays<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.859> you<00:01:45.039> would<00:01:45.399> normally<00:01:45.850> have

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
cube trays that you would normally have

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.459 
cube trays that you would normally have
in<00:01:46.090> your<00:01:46.450> freezer<00:01:46.749> you<00:01:47.049> know<00:01:47.350> the

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
in your freezer you know the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.139 
in your freezer you know the
old-fashioned<00:01:47.950> white<00:01:48.100> ones<00:01:48.310> it'll<00:01:48.939> go<00:01:48.999> right

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
old-fashioned white ones it'll go right

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.529 
old-fashioned white ones it'll go right
through<00:01:49.299> it

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
through it

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.010 
through it
so<00:01:49.840> silicone<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.679> best<00:01:51.149> same<00:01:52.149> thing<00:01:52.420> clear

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
so silicone is the best same thing clear

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.139 
so silicone is the best same thing clear
going<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.350> just<00:01:53.560> do<00:01:53.740> easy<00:01:54.100> pours<00:01:54.609> right<00:01:54.909> down

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
going to just do easy pours right down

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.169 
going to just do easy pours right down
in<00:01:55.329> here<00:01:55.359> and<00:01:55.719> then<00:01:56.529> you<00:01:56.770> decide<00:01:57.189> how<00:01:57.520> large<00:01:57.880> of

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
in here and then you decide how large of

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.190
