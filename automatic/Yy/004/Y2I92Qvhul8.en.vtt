something I found online and I just

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.760 
something I found online and I just
started<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.030> cardstock<00:01:00.030> paper<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.469> put

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
started with cardstock paper then I put

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.789 
started with cardstock paper then I put
fiberglass<00:01:02.550> resin<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.329> top<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> paper<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
fiberglass resin on top of the paper and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.420 
fiberglass resin on top of the paper and
then<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> inside<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> fiberglass<00:01:07.950> cloth

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
then on the inside the fiberglass cloth

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.690 
then on the inside the fiberglass cloth
after<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.409> add<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.799> bondo<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
after that you add the bondo and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.149 
after that you add the bondo and
sand<00:01:13.509> it<00:01:13.689> down<00:01:14.229> that's<00:01:14.469> probably<00:01:14.770> what

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
sand it down that's probably what

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.999 
sand it down that's probably what
consumed<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.030> most<00:01:16.270> amount<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.689> time<00:01:16.930> was<00:01:17.289> all

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
consumed the most amount of time was all

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.490 
consumed the most amount of time was all
the<00:01:18.340> bondo<00:01:18.820> sanding<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.570> down<00:01:19.600> adding<00:01:20.289> more

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
bondo and so on and so forth I didn't

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.289 
bondo and so on and so forth I didn't
get<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.539> perfect<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.710> see<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.399> couple

dents and dings in it and everything but

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.830 
dents and dings in it and everything but
for<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.679> most<00:01:32.920> part<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:33.819> actually<00:01:34.479> pretty

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
for the most part it is actually pretty

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.899 
for the most part it is actually pretty
smooth<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:37.869> said<00:01:38.289> I<00:01:38.319> don't<00:01:38.590> want<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.159> toot

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.809 
all nice and flush with the other half
of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> helmet<00:02:55.099> also<00:02:56.099> did<00:02:56.519> some<00:02:56.849> tabs<00:02:57.799> on<00:02:58.819> each

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
of the helmet also did some tabs on each

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.449 
of the helmet also did some tabs on each
side

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.000 

that's<00:03:06.459> basically<00:03:07.359> so<00:03:07.719> it<00:03:07.840> all<00:03:08.019> clips

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
that's basically so it all clips

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.559 
that's basically so it all clips
together<00:03:09.250> all<00:03:09.640> nice<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.500> kinda<00:03:12.159> hides<00:03:13.120> where

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
together all nice and kinda hides where

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.250 
together all nice and kinda hides where
I<00:03:14.549> dremeled<00:03:15.549> all<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.359> way<00:03:16.480> across<00:03:18.090> anyway<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
I dremeled all the way across anyway the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.030 
I dremeled all the way across anyway the
other<00:03:20.290> part<00:03:20.769> had<00:03:20.980> difficulty<00:03:21.639> with<00:03:21.959> was

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
other part had difficulty with was

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.979 
other part had difficulty with was
putting<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.219> visor<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.420> an<00:03:25.569> actual

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
putting the visor and this is an actual

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.039 
putting the visor and this is an actual
motorcycle<00:03:26.409> helmet<00:03:27.129> visor<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:28.389> I<00:03:28.420> Dremel

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
motorcycle helmet visor that I Dremel

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.670 
motorcycle helmet visor that I Dremel
down<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.980> used<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.609> heat<00:03:30.819> gun<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.420> kind<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:32.109> bend

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
down and used a heat gun to kind of bend

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.550 
down and used a heat gun to kind of bend
in<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.040> shape<00:03:33.689> it<00:03:34.689> was<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:35.200> rather<00:03:35.530> large<00:03:36.040> visor

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
in the shape it was a rather large visor

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.210 
in the shape it was a rather large visor
so<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:39.579> was<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> lot<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.510> cutting<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.230> heat<00:03:41.980> gun

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
so it was a lot of cutting and heat gun

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.429 
so it was a lot of cutting and heat gun
to<00:03:42.250> fit<00:03:42.609> in<00:03:42.760> such<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.180> small<00:03:43.329> helmet<00:03:46.169> the<00:03:47.169> hinge

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
to fit in such a small helmet the hinge

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.080 
to fit in such a small helmet the hinge
here<00:03:48.389> let<00:03:49.389> me<00:03:49.569> switch<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.079> macro<00:03:50.530> mode<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:52.060> is

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
here let me switch to macro mode this is

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.209 
here let me switch to macro mode this is
all<00:03:52.480> fiber<00:03:53.469> fiberglass<00:03:54.930> resin<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.769> keep<00:03:56.980> in

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
all fiber fiberglass resin to keep in

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.890 
all fiber fiberglass resin to keep in
place

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.030 

actually<00:04:01.900> turned<00:04:02.140> out<00:04:02.260> really<00:04:02.319> good<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.739> saw

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.750 

yeah<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.549> just<00:04:15.579> turned<00:04:16.000> out<00:04:16.090> really<00:04:16.299> nice

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760

add some foam in the top here so it's

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.620

how<00:04:38.080> you<00:04:38.139> do<00:04:38.410> put<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.770> on<00:04:38.919> is<00:04:39.250> you<00:04:40.210> guys<00:04:40.389> slip

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
how you do put it on is you guys slip

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.270 
how you do put it on is you guys slip
your<00:04:40.930> head<00:04:41.130> in<00:04:42.130> at<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.000> weird<00:04:43.330> angle<00:04:44.100> because<00:04:45.100> it

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
your head in at a weird angle because it

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.270 
your head in at a weird angle because it
is<00:04:45.400> such<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:45.699> tight<00:04:46.000> hole<00:04:46.300> for<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:47.620> neck<00:04:47.889> to<00:04:48.070> fit

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
is such a tight hole for the neck to fit

00:04:48.280 --> 00:05:24.300 
is such a tight hole for the neck to fit
in<00:04:49.169> try<00:04:50.169> this<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.500> best<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.830> can

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.740 

there<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.670> it<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:28.550> does<00:05:28.760> fog<00:05:29.120> up<00:05:29.390> quite<00:05:29.720> a

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
there you have it it does fog up quite a

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.360 
there you have it it does fog up quite a
bit<00:05:30.050> but<00:05:31.300> I<00:05:32.300> did<00:05:32.930> do<00:05:33.140> some<00:05:33.410> ventilation<00:05:33.770> holes

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
bit but I did do some ventilation holes

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.600 
bit but I did do some ventilation holes
in<00:05:34.640> there<00:05:35.440> not<00:05:36.440> sure<00:05:36.710> if<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:36.920> can<00:05:37.130> see<00:05:37.400> it

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.640 

probably<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:41.030> do<00:05:41.240> bigger<00:05:41.570> holes<00:05:41.870> eventually

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
probably to do bigger holes eventually

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.500 
probably to do bigger holes eventually
but<00:05:43.220> for<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.930> most<00:05:45.110> part<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.800> think<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:46.850> like<00:05:47.420> I

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
but for the most part I think it like I

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.650 
but for the most part I think it like I
said<00:05:47.720> turned<00:05:48.080> out<00:05:48.200> pretty<00:05:48.350> good<00:05:49.300> first<00:05:50.300> time

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
said turned out pretty good first time

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.659 
said turned out pretty good first time
