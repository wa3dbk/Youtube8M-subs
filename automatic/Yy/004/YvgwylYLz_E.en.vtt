00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.360
 and this is the plant space that 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.519
 we are with with and how you walk with and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.799
 barbarian very well I'm very glad that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.570
 you brought today look today we work with 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.820
 silks artificial cities like to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.070
 that the 3 can do it in the market 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 since natural silk is that it is for 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.689
 excellence the best fabric and costs 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 get it and if we get it is in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 a price that is differentiated is a little 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.300
 more expensive and secondly the issue of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.550
 drop and paints 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.149
 and here I will make an emphasis on 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.059
 different types that are looking to 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.309
 water that everyone uses in the water but the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.250
 difference is that the transparent one 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.220
 time that ball of lines when fixing the 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.670
 colors with the iron you are washing 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.589
 they get up is the bottom instead the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.589
 of color that can be any kind of 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.559
 tones and the isolated ones there are more in this 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.360
 white gold copper case once 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 Grilled let those remaining in the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.710
 work 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.140
 Well here about 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 to peak types this is important 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.080
 according to the size of work surfaces 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.280
 time what is the delicacy to look for 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.080
 work and then work directly 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.120
 applying 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.909
 of the knob 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.310
 look at the thickness 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.420
 the stroke yes 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.520
 considered whether you work fast 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.810
 and applying a pressure x that is not that 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.149
 do not squeeze much the stroke is not there 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.130
 well I understand myself but suppose 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.080
 that you do not like that trans are 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.180
 rather I think it's thick 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.220
 I want something more finite finite 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.789
 then ready applicator bottles 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.820
 where you in case you have different 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.500
 types of holes if you smell cut here 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.509
 in the minutes as well as robert bands 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.789
 besides that but you can apply 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.489
 this metallic peak that in turn comes 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.890
 with like a needle like the needle that 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.049
 clean at the beginning you're going to have to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.420
 do a little more pressure that's 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.580
 logical because you're going through a 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.950
 surface let's say to a hole very 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.989
 fine and look at the fine line that comes with 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.100
 this you can much more control the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.470
 stroke 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.730
 if you are not going to escape so much the drop 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.060
 yes 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.489
 now and you're going to take longer because as 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.379
 it has less precision 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.840
 good and another thing that unleashed new 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.319
 friends it seems that this region is by 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.440
 example directly apply to the powder 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.349
 that comes has two parts if the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.830
 floor plus an adapter then I'll 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.860
 you can apply directly are not to the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.370
 like for let's say to pongo al pongo men 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.599
 without having to use clear this pipette 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.599
 and the same 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.490
 and we began to hunt look all 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.340
 variants 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.340
 when options is to use how many 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.710
 strokes take the different strokes a 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.680
 Once you like it physically what you're going to 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.530
 is how long it takes to do that nato 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.830
 It depends on the temperature 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.080
 for example today we have a time 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.810
 quite humid it's likely that 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.060
 the drop that takes longer to dry but is 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.840
 where is the trace of the drop of this 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.069
 transparent the color does not come out and if I 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.700
 I want to give you for example a nuance of 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.160
 green I do it before clinton that's 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.800
 dry as transferred this drawing 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.390
 directly with a pencil a soft pencil 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.670
 if I am a there is also a pencil 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.850
 special that is the fantasy api where 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.920
 you transfer yes and you have different 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.200
 in the plantations the fantasies 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.350
 directly as well as you paint 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.269
 the stroke disappears you do not have to 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.329
 wash it we do not have to record it instead the 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.479
 pencil will be clear if the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.120
 mark you can erase it with a good rubber 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.280
 of pencil that's what he managed to eliminate but 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.700
 it's a step more like them 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.540
 the drop is absolutely controlled and 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.830
 here I have another example for you to see 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.240
 how is a stroke this is much thinner 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.790
 with and while you finish doing that 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.910
 sheet tell me what seminars we are going to 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.460
 be where you look, we really want to 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.400
 because for the previous seminar 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.870
 that we have given my workshop is the people not 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.150
 step we have very much fun 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.280
 we sold a lot between all of them and I 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.790
 they gave please to repeat it again 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.350
 and it's going to be on April 26 if the same 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.630
 schedule of 10 a 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.930
 at 4 in the afternoon 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.790
 where are we going apart from working laugh and 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.790
 have a good time with surely
