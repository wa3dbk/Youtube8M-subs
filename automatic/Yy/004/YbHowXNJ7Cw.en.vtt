not a city at all that is a highway and

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.880 
not a city at all that is a highway and
if<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.909> look<00:00:43.089> close<00:00:43.390> enough<00:00:43.690> look<00:00:44.559> if<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.800> go

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
if you look close enough look if you go

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.850 
if you look close enough look if you go
up<00:00:45.070> here<00:00:45.309> and<00:00:45.579> look<00:00:45.790> like<00:00:46.000> this<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.710> can

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
up here and look like this and you can

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.549 
up here and look like this and you can
see<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.339> cars<00:00:49.409> moving<00:00:50.409> in<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:52.180> on<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.350> roads

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
see the cars moving in like on the roads

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.710 
see the cars moving in like on the roads
out<00:00:53.739> there<00:00:53.920> it's<00:00:54.100> kind<00:00:54.369> of<00:00:54.430> animated<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.299> it's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
out there it's kind of animated and it's

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.320 
out there it's kind of animated and it's
also<00:00:56.339> horizontally<00:00:57.339> mirrored<00:00:57.729> because<00:00:58.059> you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
also horizontally mirrored because you

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.660 
also horizontally mirrored because you
know<00:00:58.479> it's<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:58.900> highway<00:00:59.439> and<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.189> like<00:01:00.369> water

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
know it's a highway and it's like water

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.899 
know it's a highway and it's like water
next<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.360> so<00:01:01.750> it's<00:01:02.589> a<00:01:02.830> bit<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.519> Awesome

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
next to it so it's a bit of Awesome

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.140 
next to it so it's a bit of Awesome
design<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.750> over<00:01:05.140> there<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.610> has<00:01:06.729> like<00:01:06.939> no

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
design so that over there it has like no

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.270 
design so that over there it has like no
connection<00:01:07.689> with<00:01:08.229> other<00:01:08.439> cities<00:01:08.799> that's<00:01:09.040> no

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
connection with other cities that's no

Camden<00:01:09.850> Beach<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.390> anything<00:01:10.600> like<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.900> it's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
Camden Beach and anything like that it's

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.580 
Camden Beach and anything like that it's
not<00:01:11.380> going<00:01:11.799> anywhere<00:01:12.250> as<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:12.880> yet<00:01:13.320> I've<00:01:14.320> done<00:01:14.560> a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
not going anywhere as of yet I've done a

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.770 
not going anywhere as of yet I've done a
lot<00:01:14.799> of<00:01:14.860> research<00:01:15.100> on<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.880> we've<00:01:16.509> all

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
lot of research on this and we've all

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.600 
lot of research on this and we've all
done<00:01:17.020> but<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.320> research<00:01:17.770> on<00:01:17.920> this<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.369> the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
done but a research on this and the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.130 
done but a research on this and the
first<00:01:18.820> be<00:01:18.939> theories<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.479> that<00:01:19.630> or<00:01:19.810> there<00:01:19.990> is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
first be theories and that or there is

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.859 
first be theories and that or there is
nothing<00:01:20.829> interesting<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.579> particular<00:01:21.780> let<00:01:22.780> me

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
nothing interesting in particular let me

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.830 
nothing interesting in particular let me
tell<00:01:23.079> you<00:01:23.289> is<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.759> still<00:01:25.240> is<00:01:25.390> something

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
tell you is that it still is something

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.349 
tell you is that it still is something
because<00:01:25.929> that's<00:01:26.170> like<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> highway<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.399> source

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
because that's like a highway and source

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.109 
because that's like a highway and source
I'm<00:01:28.539> assuming<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.289> is<00:01:29.590> leading<00:01:30.249> out<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
I'm assuming it is leading out of the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.469 
I'm assuming it is leading out of the
city<00:01:31.240> like

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
city like

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.870 
city like
pretty<00:01:34.020> much<00:01:34.200> let's<00:01:34.979> say<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pretty much let's say we go up here and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.929 
pretty much let's say we go up here and
there's<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> couple<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.409> roads<00:01:37.939> leading

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
there's like a couple of roads leading

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.240 
there's like a couple of roads leading
down<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:40.109> other<00:01:40.289> side<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.890> mountain

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
down and the other side of the mountain

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
down and the other side of the mountain
here<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.479> fuck-off<00:01:42.960> gar

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
here of a fuck-off gar

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
here of a fuck-off gar
 off<00:01:44.100> car<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.960> know

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
 off car this is like you know

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.309 
 off car this is like you know
there's<00:01:46.289> like<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.469> huge<00:01:47.420> side<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:49.049> mean

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
there's like a huge side up here I mean

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.950 
there's like a huge side up here I mean
we<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.979> only<00:01:50.100> explore<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:51.030> side<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.569> Jackson

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
we can only explore one side of Jackson

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.419 
we can only explore one side of Jackson
Heights<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> other<00:01:52.709> side<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.069> Jackson

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
Heights and the other side of Jackson

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.910 
Heights and the other side of Jackson
Heights<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:54.539> where<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> Bayview<00:01:55.289> sign<00:01:55.709> is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
Heights like where the Bayview sign is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.319 
Heights like where the Bayview sign is
and<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.969> far<00:01:57.630> side<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.009> not<00:01:59.520> explorable

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and the far side of it is not explorable

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.539 
and the far side of it is not explorable
so<00:02:00.929> I<00:02:00.959> probably<00:02:01.200> am<00:02:01.500> assuming<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
so I probably am assuming that the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.419 
so I probably am assuming that the
highway<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.530> pretty<00:02:04.530> much<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.709> way<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.189> of

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
highway is a pretty much a way out of

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.609 
highway is a pretty much a way out of
the<00:02:05.579> city<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.239> is<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.539> course<00:02:06.869> unaccessible

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the city that is of course unaccessible

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
the city that is of course unaccessible
so<00:02:08.429> when<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.670> let<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.910> guys<00:02:09.060> know<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.329> that

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so when to let you guys know that that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.539 
so when to let you guys know that that
over<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.049> is<00:02:10.079> not<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> city<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.099> has<00:02:11.280> no

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
over there is not a city and has no

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.800 
over there is not a city and has no
connections<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.180> other<00:02:12.360> Need<00:02:12.599> for<00:02:12.630> Speed

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
connections with other Need for Speed

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.160 
connections with other Need for Speed
games<00:02:13.230> also<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.190> should<00:02:14.690> expect<00:02:15.690> some<00:02:15.810> more

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
games also you should expect some more

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.319 
games also you should expect some more
videos<00:02:16.920> from<00:02:17.010> underground<00:02:17.430> too<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:17.970> on

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
videos from underground too from now on

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.940 
videos from underground too from now on
because<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.200> many<00:02:19.349> mind-blowing
