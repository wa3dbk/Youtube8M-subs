00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because ever since he's been out I've

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.569 
because ever since he's been out I've
lost<00:01:42.060> about<00:01:42.500> 40<00:01:43.500> subscribers<00:01:43.740> i<00:01:44.310> don't<00:01:44.460> know

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
lost about 40 subscribers i don't know

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.740 
lost about 40 subscribers i don't know
why<00:01:44.850> i<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.420> easy<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
why i think it's just easy to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
why i think it's just easy to
unsubscribe<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.799> i'm<00:01:47.490> guessing<00:01:47.820> they're

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
unsubscribe and i'm guessing they're

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.330 
unsubscribe and i'm guessing they're
just<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.840> active<00:01:49.470> sub<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.130> don't

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
just like in active sub so they don't

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100 
just like in active sub so they don't
want<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> watch<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.060> videos<00:01:51.390> anymore<00:01:51.689> but

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
want to watch my videos anymore but

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.810

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.020 
was in a really close game and it was me
defending<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.390> flag<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.019> think<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.560> game

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
defending the flag but I think this game

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.729 
defending the flag but I think this game
this<00:03:54.030> game<00:03:54.150> might<00:03:54.660> be<00:03:54.690> over<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.440> it's<00:03:55.620> not

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
this game might be over so it's not

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.020 
this game might be over so it's not
online<00:03:55.980> about<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.519> like<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> minute<00:03:57.060> left<00:03:57.680> I

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
online about it's like a minute left I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.490 
online about it's like a minute left I
really<00:04:00.030> need<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.209> learn<00:04:00.480> about<00:04:00.720> what<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.290> talk

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
really need to learn about what to talk

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.780 
really need to learn about what to talk
about<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.860> commentaries<00:04:02.370> because<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.610> never

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
about in commentaries because I never

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.400
