00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.500 
a disconnection Caesars what we've done
here<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.780> combined<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.830> large<00:03:13.549> enough<00:03:13.880> steel

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
here is combined a large enough steel

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.110 
here is combined a large enough steel
pellets<00:03:14.810> then<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.410> duplicated<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.250> energy<00:03:16.880> of

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
pellets then we duplicated the energy of

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.180 
pellets then we duplicated the energy of
that<00:03:17.360> steel<00:03:17.750> pellet<00:03:18.170> with<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> heavy<00:03:18.920> shot

that steel pellet with a heavy shot
coming<00:03:19.489> okay<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:20.870> much<00:03:21.049> smaller<00:03:21.410> gives

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
coming okay so it's much smaller gives

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.729
