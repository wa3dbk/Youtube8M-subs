let<00:02:37.290> me<00:02:37.380> those<00:02:37.500> power-ups<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.640> think<00:02:38.850> if

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
let me those power-ups like I think if

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.130 
let me those power-ups like I think if
you<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.090> maximum<00:02:39.450> power<00:02:39.570> up<00:02:39.810> then<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.110> i

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you have maximum power up then it i

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.750 
you have maximum power up then it i
guess<00:02:40.410> gives<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.770> like<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> colon<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.550> five

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
