can<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.640> look<00:00:30.060> at<00:00:30.179> other<00:00:30.300> games<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.750> use

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
can you look at other games that use

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.110 
can you look at other games that use
cell<00:00:31.320> shaders<00:00:31.710> most<00:00:32.400> of<00:00:32.580> the<00:00:32.669> time<00:00:32.879> it<00:00:33.089> doesn't

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
cell shaders most of the time it doesn't

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.720 
cell shaders most of the time it doesn't
work<00:00:33.510> perfectly<00:00:34.129> this<00:00:35.129> is<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.580> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
work perfectly this is because the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
work perfectly this is because the
shadows<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.420> applied<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> same<00:00:36.960> way<00:00:37.350> no

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
shadows are all applied the same way no

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100 
shadows are all applied the same way no
matter<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.309> part<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> body<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.089> but<00:00:40.050> if

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
matter what part of the body is but if

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
matter what part of the body is but if
you're<00:00:40.260> watching<00:00:40.410> anime<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:42.000> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you're watching anime you can see that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
you're watching anime you can see that
that<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:42.690> how<00:00:42.839> they<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.049> it<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:44.129> actually

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that is not how they do it they actually

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.090 
that is not how they do it they actually
apply<00:00:45.059> shadows<00:00:45.540> in<00:00:45.720> different<00:00:46.080> ways<00:00:46.199> if<00:00:46.949> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
apply shadows in different ways if you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.829 
apply shadows in different ways if you
often<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.879> shadows<00:00:48.299> on<00:00:48.449> their<00:00:48.600> faces

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
often don't see shadows on their faces

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.140 
often don't see shadows on their faces
and<00:00:49.229> there<00:00:49.920> are<00:00:49.979> never<00:00:50.159> any<00:00:50.280> strokes<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.940> go

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
and there are never any strokes that go

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.719 
and there are never any strokes that go
into<00:00:51.299> the<00:00:51.479> hair<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.650> is<00:00:52.830> why<00:00:52.979> we<00:00:53.159> decided<00:00:53.339> to

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
into the hair this is why we decided to

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.119 
into the hair this is why we decided to
have<00:00:53.820> multiple<00:00:54.180> kinds<00:00:54.479> of<00:00:54.689> shaders<00:00:54.949> we<00:00:55.949> have

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
have multiple kinds of shaders we have

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
have multiple kinds of shaders we have
one<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.549> hair<00:00:56.729> one<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.689> skin<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
one for the hair one for the skin and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.009 
one for the hair one for the skin and
one<00:00:58.769> for<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> clothes<00:00:59.689> combining<00:01:00.689> this

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
one for the clothes combining this

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.920 
one for the clothes combining this
allowed<00:01:01.799> us<00:01:01.830> to<00:01:02.040> get<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.460> 3d<00:01:02.790> models<00:01:03.210> looking

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
allowed us to get the 3d models looking

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.390 
allowed us to get the 3d models looking
really<00:01:04.110> close<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> enemy<00:01:04.860> homewood<00:01:05.369> al

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
while the backgrounds have a more

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.400 
while the backgrounds have a more
hand-drawn<00:01:17.950> field<00:01:18.660> so<00:01:19.660> we<00:01:19.960> went<00:01:20.110> with<00:01:20.230> the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
hand-drawn field so we went with the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.270 
hand-drawn field so we went with the
same<00:01:20.620> idea<00:01:21.010> for<00:01:21.310> arguing<00:01:22.050> this<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.230> why<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:24.100> our

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
same idea for arguing this is why in our

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.910 
same idea for arguing this is why in our
game<00:01:24.520> our<00:01:24.940> characters<00:01:25.870> are<00:01:26.140> cell<00:01:26.530> shaded

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
game our characters are cell shaded

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.880 
game our characters are cell shaded
while<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.820> backgrounds<00:01:28.420> are<00:01:28.540> not<00:01:28.890> this

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
while the backgrounds are not this

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.770 
while the backgrounds are not this
actually<00:01:30.130> worked<00:01:30.520> very<00:01:30.850> well<00:01:30.940> for<00:01:31.150> us<00:01:31.390> because

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
actually worked very well for us because

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.230 
actually worked very well for us because
it<00:01:32.110> made<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.440> characters<00:01:32.650> pop<00:01:33.130> out<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.790> at

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
it made the characters pop out and at

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.570 
it made the characters pop out and at
the<00:01:34.360> same<00:01:34.540> time<00:01:34.600> we<00:01:35.530> were<00:01:35.680> able<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.010> add<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.190> lot
