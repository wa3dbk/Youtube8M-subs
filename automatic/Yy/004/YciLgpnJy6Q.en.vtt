put the camera down now here is the
inside<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> computer<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.640> what<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> have

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
inside of the computer so what we have

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.760 
inside of the computer so what we have
is<00:00:58.170> RAM<00:00:58.469> down<00:00:58.710> there's<00:00:58.980> four<00:00:59.340> slots<00:01:00.770> chipset

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
is RAM down there's four slots chipset

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.440 
is RAM down there's four slots chipset
there<00:01:02.840> ordinals<00:01:03.840> card<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.500> cpu<00:01:05.250> does<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
there ordinals card and cpu does like a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.320 
there ordinals card and cpu does like a
pretty<00:01:06.720> nice<00:01:06.869> cooler<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.440> can<00:01:08.100> remove<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
pretty nice cooler I can remove this and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.980 
pretty nice cooler I can remove this and
yes<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.200> needs<00:01:10.289> kind<00:01:11.000> but<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
yes I know it needs kind but you have a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
yes I know it needs kind but you have a
fan<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.619> sucks<00:01:13.890> cool<00:01:14.190> air<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.700> from<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
fan that sucks cool air in from the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.719 
fan that sucks cool air in from the
outside<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.009> then<00:01:17.009> blows<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.460> onto

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
outside and then blows it right onto

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.450 
outside and then blows it right onto
this<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.030> chassis<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:19.009> then<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.039> span

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this little chassis here then that span

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.900 
this little chassis here then that span
over<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.970> sucks<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.539> out<00:01:22.729> even<00:01:23.729> though<00:01:23.789> it's

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
over here sucks it out even though it's

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.359 
over here sucks it out even though it's
not<00:01:24.000> very<00:01:24.240> loud<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.709> bit<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.009> fans<00:01:26.190> are

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
not very loud it's a bit of fans are

not very loud it's a bit of fans are
moving<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.849> them<00:01:26.940> out<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:29.780> then<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
moving I get them out of here then you

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.749 
moving I get them out of here then you
also<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.349> a<00:01:31.410> power<00:01:31.619> supply<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> big<00:01:32.550> fan

also have a power supply with a big fan

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
also have a power supply with a big fan
that<00:01:33.410> keeps<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.560> hard<00:01:34.770> drive<00:01:35.009> cool<00:01:36.229> pretty

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that keeps the hard drive cool pretty

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
that keeps the hard drive cool pretty
cool<00:01:37.410> design<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.880> slips<00:01:39.060> over<00:01:39.179> like

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
cool design this just slips over like

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.770 
cool design this just slips over like
this<00:01:40.520> sort<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:44.360> actually<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.509> take<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this sort of actually it's take the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
front cover off but that will flip over

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:57.490 
front cover off but that will flip over
the<00:01:49.619> front<00:01:49.890> cover<00:01:50.009> comes<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.459> this

and that's one down there oops that

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.880 
and that's one down there oops that
comes<00:02:04.259> off<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
comes off like that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.910 
comes off like that
and<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.840> there's<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.110> LEDs<00:02:09.920> power

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and you see there's two LEDs power

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.850 
and you see there's two LEDs power
switch<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.870> year<00:02:13.050> being<00:02:13.200> hard<00:02:13.440> drive<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
switch one year being hard drive the one

switch one year being hard drive the one
you're<00:02:14.099> beating<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.310> power<00:02:15.050> connections

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
you're beating the power connections

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.710 
you're beating the power connections
including<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:18.120> high-quality

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
including to be high-quality

including to be high-quality
because<00:02:19.290> rest<00:02:19.650> area<00:02:20.010> mean<00:02:20.819> headphones<00:02:21.720> let's

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
because rest area mean headphones let's

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:31.370 
because rest area mean headphones let's
even<00:02:22.410> get<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.650> whole<00:02:22.800> thing<00:02:29.150> here<00:02:30.150> comes<00:02:30.380> and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
even get this whole thing here comes and

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.240 
even get this whole thing here comes and
that<00:02:31.470> flips<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.799> like<00:02:31.920> that

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
that flips up like that

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.570 
that flips up like that
I<00:02:32.599> can<00:02:33.599> almost<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.900> very<00:02:34.080> far<00:02:34.380> because<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
I can almost a very far because of the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.059 
I can almost a very far because of the
hard<00:02:35.880> drive<00:02:36.150> cable<00:02:36.630> I'm<00:02:37.470> gonna<00:02:37.769> put<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.010> back

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
hard drive cable I'm gonna put that back

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.460 
hard drive cable I'm gonna put that back
down<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.090> goes<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.390> crazy<00:02:40.019> it

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
down and it goes like that crazy it

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.570 
down and it goes like that crazy it
makes<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.799> pretty<00:02:40.890> easy<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.130> change<00:02:41.310> disk

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
makes it pretty easy to change disk

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.890 
makes it pretty easy to change disk
drive<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:44.420> actually<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> little<00:02:45.660> logo

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
drive and this actually the little logo

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.380 
drive and this actually the little logo
on<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> front<00:02:46.230> comes<00:02:47.010> out<00:02:47.099> if<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.430> push

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
on the front comes out if you just push

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.229 
on the front comes out if you just push
that<00:02:48.720> out<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.319> whole<00:02:49.560> thing<00:02:49.799> comes<00:02:50.010> out

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
that out so this whole thing comes out

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.910 
that out so this whole thing comes out
it's<00:02:51.239> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.450> funny<00:02:51.720> how<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.319> works

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
it's kind of funny how that works

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
these two little grills here on the fan

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.400 
these two little grills here on the fan
that<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.170> slips<00:03:10.319> over<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.859> like<00:03:11.640> that

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
it's pretty nice machine CPU runs out

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.970 
it's pretty nice machine CPU runs out
there<00:03:32.670> very<00:03:32.819> low<00:03:32.970> temperature<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.590> that's

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
there very low temperature and so that's

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.479 
there very low temperature and so that's
about<00:03:35.130> it
