00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:13.230
 tec notebook tested this week 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.020
 the sos in book that is the first one the trabuco 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.000
 of iso trabuco is a category of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.699
 laptops developed by intel 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.140
 basically are ultrathin laptops as well 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 Lightweight and with long lasting design 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.640
 he remembers the macbook air I think it is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 impossible not to think about macbook air when 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 look or this without book the main 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.850
 differences with macbook air that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.680
 the macbook air has a more sober look 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 them in book 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.620
 It has a lighter color here but 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 here it is finished in brushed aluminum 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 so many embu dot macbook air presents 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 a good resistance 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 zen book it takes advantage here in this 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.890
 area through the skin is more resistant 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.739
 here you clear December one of the points 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.109
 he is very shallow it makes him 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.640
 the less rapid typing of the cult than 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.500
 with macbook air keyboard the keyboard 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.570
 saying that it has no backlight or 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.489
 or to type in the dark 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 illuminated by what happens 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:14.280
 the latest version of the macbook is the one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.530
 spectra embu that at first sight 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 is also very similar to that of the macbook 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.610
 air but the experience of use is very 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.070
 frustrating and this may be the point 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 the weakest of the embu sometimes gives 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.180
 clicks unintentionally select why not 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.939
 You want to select the crosses does not work 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.470
 right compared the touchpad 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.470
 macbook air is one of the best on the market 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.420
 equipment like the ones in looks are 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.340
 commissioned for those seeking the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.170
 portability because ultimately the main 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.770
 characteristic of them is to be 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 light 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.690
 isata offers a good level of performance 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.640
 it is not recommended for anyone to 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.370
 really very advanced users who 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.420
 use a lot of heavy 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.030
 same time and also for gamers 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.130
 the ultrabooks the macbook was they have 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.740
 relatively well high prices is the price 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.790
 you pay for portability is that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.450
 type of equipment 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.940
 If you prefer mac os x windows a 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.720
 obvious choice you should opt for 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.260
 macbook 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.600
 if you prefer the windows the choice is 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.630
 more complicated because you can buy 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.790
 a macbook is to install windows on it 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.780
 this 13-inch model the price 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.209
 suggested it is 55 1999 six thousand reais 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.200
 the macbook was set up way 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.770
 similar 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.470
 Exit by 5549 I think it's worth the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.019
 user to try to see if it's worth 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.019
 he bought it without mouth or not
