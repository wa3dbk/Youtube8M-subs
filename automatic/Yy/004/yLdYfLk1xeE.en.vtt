00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:01.182
If you want your husband to be like mine,

00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:06.585
Do this: put him here to watch this video...

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:08.794
That is what everyone should be doing!

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.290
THE MOUSTACHE IN THE KITCHEN

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:19.441
And today I'm going to teach Paulo and you, how to make a Chocolate Cream!

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:21.107
Moustache: Wonderful!

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:23.686
TODAY'S EPISODE

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:26.532
CHOCOLATE CREAM

00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:32.554
We're going to make the Chocolate cream to fill those delicious Eclairs

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:34.338
That we made on the last episode.

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:34.981
The Moustache

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:38.777
Moustache: You didn't make any delicious Eclair, you made Pâte à Choux to turns into Eclairs.

00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:43.163
Exactly. I made the Pâte à Choux, which will become Eclairs.

00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:47.590
And today, we're going to make the cream that will fill our Eclairs!

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:49.545
To make this cream, we'll need:

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:52.484
A pastry cream, which is already done and is the one we made on the second episode.

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:53.372
500g of pastry cream

00:00:55.094 --> 00:01:00.724
So, if you need to know how to make the pastry cream, click here on the video!

00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:04.903
And it's here today and we're going to use it to make the Chocolate cream, ok?

00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:07.018
Moustache: Wonderful! It has to add chocolate into it, I suppose...

00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:08.523
Almost that!

00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:12.564
To make this cream, we'll have to make a ganache to join the cream.

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:16.854
We'll have a ganache episode, where I'll explain three different tipes of ganaches.

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:21.725
Today I'm going to make the one I always make, and that is the easiest one for me.

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:26.975
So, we're going to heat the pan and you'll put the milk here.

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:27.920
130g of milk.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.373
This milk cannot boil! It will just heat.

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:34.581
Ideally, for the purists, the milk should be at 85°C.

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.426
As this is annoying, we only have to heat the milk, ok?

00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:44.364
Here there's 130g of milk and we're going to put here inside, 120g of dark chocolate 60%.

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:46.839
120g of Dark chocolate

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:48.666
Moustache: Sixty per cent.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.785
And then you'll say me: "Oh Dani, but I don't like dark chocolate, can I use another one?"

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:55.617
"Can I use milk chocolate?" Yes, you can!

00:01:55.755 --> 00:02:02.372
But as the milk chocolate has less cocoa, the consistency of your cream will be a little bit less dense

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.469
So you need to add more chocolate. About 30, 40g more.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.455
Moustache: It's at 85°C

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.864
May I measure?

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:19.955
And here is done, I'm going to dump here inside.

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:25.846
Moustache: You have a machine...

00:02:25.907 --> 00:02:27.303
And you mix.

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:31.301
Moustache: Ops...

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:42.688
My ganache is ready, but I'll have to clean a little bit because...

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:43.659
Moustache: I'm always making the things difficult.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.270
Paulo always difficults my life.

00:02:49.623 --> 00:02:53.912
And then you'll take the pastry cream and put...

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:54.514
Moustache: Do you have a technique?

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:55.199
No.

00:02:55.538 --> 00:03:02.413
And we're going to heat a little bit the pastry cream so it will be easier to emulsify with the ganache.

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:05.223
Moustache: Only to emulsify, isn't it?

00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:08.469
I have emulsified a lot...

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.949
You have emotioned people's heart!

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:27.296
Here it's warm, so you can add the ganache inside it.

00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:31.145
MIX

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:39.017
KEEP IT IN THE FRIDGE FOR 6 HOURS

00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:42.190
Our Chocolate cream just went out of the fridge.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.605
It was there for 6 hours, more or less...

00:03:44.605 --> 00:03:47.288
Moustache: Bullshit. It's another day, we put the same clothes.

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:50.579
It's another day, we put the same clothes.

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.522
This is the consistency that it should be!

00:03:55.053 --> 00:03:56.985
Consistency for you.

00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:59.889
And consistency for you too!

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:00.727
Moustache: Wonderful!

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.171
It's quite creamy.

00:04:05.263 --> 00:04:08.724
And now, just to give a... Do you wanna try?

00:04:08.724 --> 00:04:09.742
Moustache: I do.

00:04:09.742 --> 00:04:11.615
I like to try it without anything just to see if it's good.

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:15.998
Tell me if its tasty.

00:04:15.998 --> 00:04:17.140
Is it tasty?

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.217
Moustache: Wonderful!

00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:21.421
If you want to put it in the mixer just for it became creamier.

00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:23.505
Because it was compacted in the fridge...

00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:24.459
Moustache: To smooth it?

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:26.518
It will become smoother.

00:04:26.518 --> 00:04:27.482
Really, really fast, quickly!

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.004
Moustache: Is it fast?

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:32.585
No, here... It's good!

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:33.519
Moustache: Medium velocity.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.631
Medium velocity.

00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:36.415
Moustache: You were trying to say: it'll be quickly

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:37.335
Thirty seconds!

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:38.514
thirty little seconds and it's done.

00:04:38.606 --> 00:04:39.715
It's good, already.

00:04:39.715 --> 00:04:42.085
Moustache: It's less than thirty seconds...

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:46.091
PREPARE A PASTRY BAG

00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:47.525
Can I make one and then you can make the others?

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:48.187
Moustache: Go ahead...

00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:53.964
You'll take... I'm going to get a bigger one, which I made later.

00:04:53.964 --> 00:04:58.043
You can see that we already did the little holes in the eclairs, on the other episode.

00:04:58.043 --> 00:04:59.546
Did you remember? So the air can get out.

00:04:59.546 --> 00:05:05.465
You'll put in the little hole and press until it pops out the other side, there.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.971
Can you see?

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:10.849
Moustache; Wonderful!

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:13.601
It looks cute!

00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:15.245
Did you see?

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.241
And then you let it like this because we're going to clean the bottom.

00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:30.324
Oh oh oh my Lord!

00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:32.340
Moustache: It's because this one shouldn't be so good...

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.211
My goodness! This one that isn't so good is that you want to eat later, right?

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:40.835
Well, and you'll put them in the fridge as they are like this.

00:05:40.835 --> 00:05:43.061
Let them cool down for two hours.

00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:44.155
2 HOURS

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:48.811
And on the next episode I'm going to make the Fondant, which is the covering of the Eclair.

00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:52.044
And then we can finalize the Eclair!

00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:53.284
So, what was your difficulty?

00:05:53.284 --> 00:05:56.565
Moustache: Well, as the pastry cream was already done, the difficulty of this one is a fouet and a half.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:57.737
A fouet and a half?

00:05:57.737 --> 00:06:03.647
Moustache: But the step of filling the Eclair... I'd chose 4 little fouets.

00:06:05.647 --> 00:06:09.493
You saw that filling is not a problem, neither making the cream.

00:06:09.493 --> 00:06:14.748
You can use this cream in many other things! You can use it to fill pies, cakes...

00:06:14.748 --> 00:06:17.501

Moustache: Can we eat one, already?

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.794
No, love! Otherwise there's no Eclairs for the next episode!

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:40.308
CHOCOLATE CREAM
