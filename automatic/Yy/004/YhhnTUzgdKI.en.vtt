00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and 16 runs courses so you're basically

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.620 
and 16 runs courses so you're basically
doubling<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.890> game<00:01:11.100> experience<00:01:11.280> yeah<00:01:12.090> which

plus<00:06:21.700> I'm<00:06:21.880> making<00:06:21.910> the<00:06:22.210> assumption<00:06:22.690> that<00:06:22.720> this

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
plus I'm making the assumption that this

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.659 
plus I'm making the assumption that this
is<00:06:23.080> not<00:06:23.230> the<00:06:23.410> LLC<00:06:23.740> already<00:06:24.100> on<00:06:24.220> the<00:06:24.340> freakin

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
is not the LLC already on the freakin

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.210 
is not the LLC already on the freakin
discs<00:06:24.910> you<00:06:24.970> just<00:06:25.180> unlock<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:26.010> highly<00:06:27.010> doubt

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
discs you just unlock I highly doubt

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.610 
discs you just unlock I highly doubt
that<00:06:27.280> I<00:06:27.580> think<00:06:28.180> that<00:06:28.450> was<00:06:28.780> the<00:06:28.960> case<00:06:29.169> it<00:06:29.500> would

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
that I think that was the case it would

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.990 
that I think that was the case it would
have<00:06:29.770> been<00:06:29.890> exposed<00:06:30.280> I<00:06:30.550> would<00:06:30.700> think<00:06:30.880> that

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
have been exposed I would think that

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.370 
have been exposed I would think that
with<00:06:31.840> with<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.500> amount<00:06:33.390> wrecks<00:06:34.390> are<00:06:34.630> that

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
with with the amount wrecks are that

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.800 
with with the amount wrecks are that
they<00:06:35.710> weren't<00:06:36.100> working<00:06:36.340> on<00:06:36.610> 32<00:06:37.240> tracks<00:06:37.539> at<00:06:37.690> one

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
they weren't working on 32 tracks at one

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.180 
they weren't working on 32 tracks at one
time<00:06:37.960> would<00:06:38.050> be<00:06:38.169> insane<00:06:38.530> about<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.890> work<00:06:39.039> on

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
time would be insane about the work on

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.559 
time would be insane about the work on
versus<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.640> 60<00:06:39.850> there's

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
versus the 60 there's

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.169 
versus the 60 there's
way<00:06:40.809> that<00:06:41.110> this<00:06:41.319> is<00:06:41.559> on<00:06:41.860> disk<00:06:42.279> and<00:06:42.879> if<00:06:43.029> I'm

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:43.179 
way that this is on disk and if I'm

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:45.119 
way that this is on disk and if I'm
wrong<00:06:43.389> I'll<00:06:43.689> eat<00:06:43.899> my<00:06:44.080> words<00:06:44.259> but<00:06:44.710> I<00:06:44.740> just<00:06:44.949> don't

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
wrong I'll eat my words but I just don't

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.270 
wrong I'll eat my words but I just don't
see<00:06:45.429> it<00:06:45.520> as<00:06:45.610> being<00:06:45.639> on<00:06:45.999> disk
