considerably quick I used to have you
gonna<00:03:07.360> do<00:03:07.570> once<00:03:07.990> before<00:03:08.260> where<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.220> was<00:03:09.400> running

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
gonna do once before where I was running

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.640 
gonna do once before where I was running
that<00:03:09.730> Windows<00:03:10.060> XP<00:03:10.150> video<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:13.110> when<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.410> tried

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
that Windows XP video and when I tried

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.640 
that Windows XP video and when I tried
one<00:03:14.830> two<00:03:14.950> seven<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.610> was<00:03:15.760> very<00:03:16.080> slow<00:03:17.080> and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
one two seven and it was very slow and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.350 
one two seven and it was very slow and
very<00:03:18.040> laggy

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
very laggy

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.290 
very laggy
now<00:03:20.050> that's<00:03:20.290> whenever<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.770> set<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:22.060> most

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
now that's whenever you set the most

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.120 
now that's whenever you set the most
grand<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:22.840> possible<00:03:23.410> can't<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:23.770> your<00:03:23.860> thing

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
grand as possible can't do your thing

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.910 
grand as possible can't do your thing
like<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.300> set<00:03:25.510> 9:36<00:03:26.260> which<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.710> most

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
like if you set 9:36 which is the most

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.340 
like if you set 9:36 which is the most
that<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.220> can<00:03:27.250> set<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:28.050> VirtualBox<00:03:29.050> on<00:03:29.260> the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
that you can set to VirtualBox on the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.080 
that you can set to VirtualBox on the
HTC<00:03:29.620> 7<00:03:30.040> with<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.210> what's<00:03:31.510> RAM<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.960> have

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
HTC 7 with a to do what's RAM you have

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.500 
HTC 7 with a to do what's RAM you have
if<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:35.770> said<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.910> you're<00:03:37.150> gonna<00:03:37.300> have

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
if you said that and you're gonna have

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.270 
if you said that and you're gonna have
lagging<00:03:38.140> crashing<00:03:38.739> problem<00:03:39.070> because

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
lagging crashing problem because

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.040 
lagging crashing problem because
apparently<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:41.050> do<00:03:41.470> uses<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:43.300> much<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:43.870> it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
apparently you do uses that much so it

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.070 
apparently you do uses that much so it
needs<00:03:45.000> enough<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.180> running<00:03:46.390> background<00:03:46.600> so

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
needs enough to running background so

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.380 
needs enough to running background so
what<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.560> got<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:48.040> do<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:49.650> stock<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.890> lagging

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
what you got to do to stock the lagging

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.360 
what you got to do to stock the lagging
like<00:03:52.390> three<00:03:52.690> problems<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.320> stuff<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:54.520> to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
like three problems and stuff is to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.720 
like three problems and stuff is to
download

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
download

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.260 
download
I<00:03:57.760> mean<00:03:58.300> don't<00:03:59.230> download<00:03:59.470> nothing<00:04:00.280> excuse<00:04:01.060> me

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
I mean don't download nothing excuse me

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.090 
I mean don't download nothing excuse me
but<00:04:02.080> you<00:04:02.230> want<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.560> set<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.010> RAM<00:04:03.610> at<00:04:05.100> 812

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
but you want to set the RAM at 812

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.330 
but you want to set the RAM at 812
megabytes<00:04:06.700> that's<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.900> run<00:04:08.860> it's<00:04:09.040> pretty

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340

also<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.820> know<00:04:39.540> once<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.139> guys<00:04:40.290> get<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:41.720> tunnel

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
also I know once you guys get the tunnel

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
also I know once you guys get the tunnel
configured<00:04:43.669> you<00:04:44.669> guys<00:04:44.790> are<00:04:44.910> gonna<00:04:45.060> wonder

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
configured you guys are gonna wonder

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.620 
configured you guys are gonna wonder
after<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.830> get<00:04:47.040> windows<00:04:47.400> installed<00:04:47.790> how<00:04:48.570> to

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
after you get windows installed how to

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.700 
after you get windows installed how to
run<00:04:49.080> dual<00:04:49.530> core<00:04:49.889> CPU<00:04:50.520> because<00:04:50.900> by<00:04:51.900> default<00:04:52.440> it

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
run dual core CPU because by default it

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.740 
run dual core CPU because by default it
can<00:04:52.860> only<00:04:53.040> run<00:04:53.310> one<00:04:53.370> if<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.060> try<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.300> set<00:04:54.540> two

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
can only run one if you try to set two

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.620 
can only run one if you try to set two
it<00:04:55.110> will<00:04:55.260> not<00:04:55.440> work<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:56.070> you'll<00:04:57.000> have<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.330> look

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
it will not work so you'll have to look

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.250 
it will not work so you'll have to look
another<00:04:58.410> way<00:04:58.740> up<00:04:58.980> or<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.730> will<00:05:00.060> show<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:00.870> guys

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
another way up or I will show you guys

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.430 
another way up or I will show you guys
how<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.590> do<00:05:01.980> so<00:05:02.360> another<00:05:03.360> video<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.840> have<00:05:04.230> to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
how to do so another video you have to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.510 
how to do so another video you have to
default<00:05:04.919> Li<00:05:05.600> set<00:05:06.600> and<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:07.080> terminal<00:05:07.650> it's<00:05:08.430> a

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
default Li set and the terminal it's a

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.880 
default Li set and the terminal it's a
lot<00:05:08.700> VirtualBox<00:05:09.450> use<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.169> other<00:05:10.320> one<00:05:10.620> and

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
lot VirtualBox use the other one and

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.530 
lot VirtualBox use the other one and
then<00:05:10.979> you<00:05:11.040> set<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.460> up<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.700> two<00:05:11.880> processors

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
then you set it up the two processors

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.980 
then you set it up the two processors
and<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.650> work<00:05:13.950> great<00:05:14.720> so<00:05:15.740> here<00:05:16.740> we<00:05:16.860> are<00:05:16.889> I

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
and I work great so here we are I

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.800 
and I work great so here we are I

started to give you guys an overview and

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.580 
started to give you guys an overview and
hopefully<00:05:21.810> I<00:05:21.840> will<00:05:22.200> have<00:05:22.229> a<00:05:23.810> kernel<00:05:24.810> configure

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
hopefully I will have a kernel configure

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.110 
hopefully I will have a kernel configure
video<00:05:26.220> coming<00:05:26.700> soon<00:05:28.520> possibly<00:05:29.520> later<00:05:29.790> today
