00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.480
 Good growth follower and hen 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:16.740
 Though it is good that it becomes cheaper to put it into action when it comes to the habit of segmenting and sticking a sticky note 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.599
 Now the sticky notes will keep increasing in your notebook 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:26.920
 Or you no longer know good with the hand from any and come this happens 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:29.410
 You may feel tired and tired that there are too many failures to do 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 At that time the Jan' 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.829
 I will try to use the matrix like this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.829
 Create a matrix of urgency and importance 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.829
 And urgent and important things 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.610
 Important note 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.630
 Go down a little 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.990
 Not urgent but important 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:01:00.530
 And we will sort into people who are neither urgent nor important 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.530
 I will divide all the sticky notes that I once printed on my notebook in this 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.730
 q It is good from the important thing 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.470
 Do not be also important in the local express 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.760
 I want to do it as soon as possible, but it is not important 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760
 Even though it is important 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.950
 A little later is ok 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.159
 Like this 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.159
 Organize in your own priority order 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.080
 And we should do now is either that of 99 a few important 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:41.210
 It is priority 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.850
 The degree of urgency has fallen next week, but do we have to get hold of important things ? 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:50.330
 May 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.730
 I would like to do something if this is either, so I'll have a hand when it gets over 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:00.450
 I will put on 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:03.960
 If you are busy right now, it may be possible to postpone things that are neither urgent nor important 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.390
 For more information on how to use this matrix 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.390
 We introduce even follow-up courses
