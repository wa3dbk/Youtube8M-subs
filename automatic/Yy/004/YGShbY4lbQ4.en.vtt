well you know it's funny is that window
they<00:00:32.430> were<00:00:32.489> clearly<00:00:32.820> doing<00:00:33.390> their<00:00:33.600> best<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
they were clearly doing their best to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
they were clearly doing their best to
mark<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> galaxy<00:00:34.649> were<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.160> he

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
mark in the galaxy were because he

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.709 
mark in the galaxy were because he
didn't<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.700> many<00:00:35.850> touches<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> first

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
didn't get many touches in the first

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.940 
didn't get many touches in the first
half<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:37.110> knew<00:00:37.260> he<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.559> were<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> be

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
half they knew he they were going to be

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.290 
half they knew he they were going to be
trying<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> ball<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.940> him<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
trying to get to the ball to him and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
trying to get to the ball to him and
every<00:00:39.510> single<00:00:39.809> opportunity<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.559> quakes<00:00:40.980> had

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
every single opportunity that quakes had

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.260 
every single opportunity that quakes had
already<00:00:41.309> clinched<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> supporters<00:00:42.239> shield

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
already clinched the supporters shield

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
already clinched the supporters shield
so<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.260> honestly<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.920> result<00:00:44.250> didn't

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
so really honestly this result didn't

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040 
so really honestly this result didn't
matter<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.450> embedded<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
matter for them but embedded to the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
matter for them but embedded to the
galaxy<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> mattered<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
galaxy it mattered to the get the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
galaxy it mattered to the get the
earthquakes<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> ball<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.289> it's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
earthquakes get the ball to one so it's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
earthquakes get the ball to one so it's
about<00:00:50.250> wondering<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.030> huh<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.960> kept<00:00:52.350> thinking

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
about wondering what huh I kept thinking

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
about wondering what huh I kept thinking
there's<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.640> penalty<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.210> some

point<00:00:54.660> well<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.320> take<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
point well I'm not going to take the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.139 
point well I'm not going to take the
penalties<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.250> no<00:00:56.370> matter<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.760> happens

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
this is a galaxy team that do you think

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.039 
this is a galaxy team that do you think
they<00:01:11.670> made<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> statement<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.840> was

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
they made a statement with this or was

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.380

this<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.320> San<00:01:14.040> Jose<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.909> their

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
this just San Jose you know their

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.429 
this just San Jose you know their
through<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.750> don't<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> worry<00:01:16.380> about

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
through they don't have to worry about

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
through they don't have to worry about
it<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.860> think<00:01:17.850> Santa's<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:18.840> wanted<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
it I think Santa's they really wanted to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
it I think Santa's they really wanted to
show<00:01:19.350> well<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.250> they<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> support

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
show well because they are the support

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.429 
show well because they are the support
of<00:01:21.119> shield<00:01:21.299> champions<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.080> clinched

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
of shield champions they just clinched

play the ball on the ground they've got

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.679 
play the ball on the ground they've got
very<00:04:39.099> dynamic<00:04:39.610> playmaking<00:04:40.029> players<00:04:40.419> and

the history of that series last year

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.649 
the history of that series last year
which<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.169> insane<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.069> I<00:04:45.210> think<00:04:46.210> Seattle<00:04:46.449> is

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
which was insane and I think Seattle is

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.089 
which was insane and I think Seattle is
really<00:04:46.870> going<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.050> want<00:04:47.139> some<00:04:47.229> payback<00:04:47.469> a<00:04:47.860> for

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
really going to want some payback a for

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.469 
really going to want some payback a for
that<00:04:48.219> one<00:04:48.370> but<00:04:48.400> be<00:04:48.729> for<00:04:48.939> the<00:04:48.999> fact<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.270> they

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
that one but be for the fact that they

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.420 
that one but be for the fact that they
in<00:04:49.719> there<00:04:49.990> in<00:04:50.469> force<00:04:50.800> these<00:04:50.979> they've<00:04:51.219> never

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
in there in force these they've never

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.679 
in there in force these they've never
made<00:04:51.639> it<00:04:51.789> past<00:04:51.819> the<00:04:52.090> first<00:04:52.270> round<00:04:52.419> of<00:04:52.629> the

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
made it past the first round of the

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.179 
made it past the first round of the
playoffs<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.199> you<00:04:53.289> figure<00:04:53.590> they<00:04:53.889> got<00:04:54.009> to<00:04:54.099> go

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
playoffs so you figure they got to go

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.129 
playoffs so you figure they got to go
for<00:04:54.340> broke<00:04:54.520> now<00:04:54.729> not<00:04:55.210> only<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.539> they<00:04:55.990> don't

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
for broke now not only that they don't

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.510 
for broke now not only that they don't
have<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.289> single<00:04:56.469> trophy<00:04:56.770> this<00:04:57.039> season<00:04:57.099> they

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
have a single trophy this season they

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.339 
have a single trophy this season they
didn't<00:04:57.699> get<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:57.879> US<00:04:58.090> Open<00:04:58.419> Cup<00:04:58.449> right<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.259> get
