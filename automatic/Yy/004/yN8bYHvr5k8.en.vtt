00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.969 
the plastic bag okay so I know this
probably<00:03:27.720> isn't<00:03:27.989> gonna<00:03:28.139> be<00:03:28.319> too<00:03:28.349> good<00:03:28.769> right

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
probably isn't gonna be too good right

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:34.300 
probably isn't gonna be too good right
out<00:03:29.129> of<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.310> box<00:03:29.549> but<00:03:30.060> um<00:03:30.500> yeah<00:03:31.500> first<00:03:31.769> turn

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.979 

well<00:03:35.310> already<00:03:35.760> it's<00:03:36.000> better<00:03:36.180> than<00:03:36.329> my<00:03:36.449> QJ

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
well already it's better than my QJ

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.270 
well already it's better than my QJ
which<00:03:37.349> sucks<00:03:38.040> it's<00:03:39.000> also<00:03:39.209> very<00:03:39.690> tight<00:03:40.470> as<00:03:40.919> I

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
which sucks it's also very tight as I

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.789 
which sucks it's also very tight as I
can<00:03:41.340> see<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:43.139> is<00:03:43.290> probably<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:43.709> to

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
can see so this is probably going to

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.399 
can see so this is probably going to
need<00:03:43.859> some<00:03:43.949> work<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.729> um<00:03:45.060> I'm<00:03:45.780> willing<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.229> put

that in plus the logo is placed really

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.129 
that in plus the logo is placed really
badly<00:03:48.449> you<00:03:49.349> guys<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.680> probably<00:03:50.010> see<00:03:50.190> that
