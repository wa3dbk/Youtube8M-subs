00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
on an xbox live and land it always is a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
on an xbox live and land it always is a
little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.450> differently<00:01:39.900> even<00:01:40.530> though<00:01:40.680> when

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
little bit differently even though when

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.859 
little bit differently even though when
we<00:01:40.979> get<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.280> event<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> no<00:01:42.689> more

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
we get to the event there is no more

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.050 
we get to the event there is no more
land<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.229> halo<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.369> still<00:01:44.579> some<00:01:44.820> sort

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
land for halo but it's still some sort

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
land for halo but it's still some sort
of<00:01:45.090> land<00:01:45.299> that'll<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:45.899> better<00:01:46.079> than<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
of land that'll be a lot better than the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.170 
of land that'll be a lot better than the
internet<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.729> probably<00:01:47.939> play<00:01:48.149> a
