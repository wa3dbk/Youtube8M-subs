00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
up the center lines on the back and in

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.140 
up the center lines on the back and in
the<00:02:20.330> front<00:02:21.340> draw<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.490> in<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> little<00:02:22.910> bit<00:02:23.000> so

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the front draw that in a little bit so

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.350 
the front draw that in a little bit so
you<00:02:23.209> can<00:02:23.300> see<00:02:23.630> where<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.150> once

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
you can see where it's at and then once

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.100 
you can see where it's at and then once
you've<00:02:29.540> got<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.760> centered<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.959> going

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
you've got it centered in I'm just going

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.810 
you've got it centered in I'm just going
to<00:02:33.170> draw<00:02:33.380> an<00:02:33.530> outline<00:02:33.650> around<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.820> tenon<00:02:36.820> so

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
to draw an outline around the tenon so

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:48.949 
to draw an outline around the tenon so
I'll<00:02:37.970> know<00:02:38.150> where<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.480> mortise<00:02:38.840> goes

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.690 

now<00:02:49.959> I'm<00:02:50.019> going<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.230> take<00:02:50.439> a<00:02:51.959> drill<00:02:52.959> bit<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
now I'm going to take a drill bit and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.869 
now I'm going to take a drill bit and
I'm<00:02:55.659> going<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.049> mark<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.920> depth<00:02:57.189> with<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.579> piece

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
I'm going to mark the depth with a piece

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.429 
I'm going to mark the depth with a piece
of<00:02:58.120> tape<00:02:59.519> equal<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.700> what<00:03:00.939> the<00:03:01.239> depth<00:03:02.079> of<00:03:02.319> the

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
of tape equal to what the depth of the

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:22.000 
of tape equal to what the depth of the
tenon<00:03:02.829> is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.670 

see<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.790> depth<00:03:23.060> there's<00:03:23.360> about<00:03:23.780> an<00:03:23.959> inch<00:03:24.230> and

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
see the depth there's about an inch and

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.759 
see the depth there's about an inch and
that's<00:03:24.830> about<00:03:25.190> what<00:03:25.400> we're<00:03:25.730> gonna<00:03:25.909> mark<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
that's about what we're gonna mark the

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.059 
that's about what we're gonna mark the
drill<00:03:27.769> bit<00:03:27.980> at<00:03:28.750> I'll<00:03:29.750> go<00:03:29.959> slightly<00:03:30.799> less<00:03:31.040> than

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
drill bit at I'll go slightly less than

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.360 
drill bit at I'll go slightly less than
that<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.760> can<00:03:32.030> finish<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.659> into<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:34.040> actual

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
that so I can finish it into the actual

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:44.770 
that so I can finish it into the actual
shape<00:03:39.549> I'm<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:40.610> gonna<00:03:40.910> drill<00:03:41.180> this<00:03:41.330> out<00:03:43.780> if

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
shape I'm just gonna drill this out if

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.750 
shape I'm just gonna drill this out if
you<00:03:44.810> haven't<00:03:45.049> used<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.470> tape<00:03:45.709> on<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.069> dev<00:03:46.400> stop

as soon as it starts brushing the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.569 
as soon as it starts brushing the
shavings<00:03:49.549> away<00:03:49.910> you'll<00:03:50.690> notice<00:03:50.900> stop<00:03:51.579> then

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
shavings away you'll notice stop then

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.000 
shavings away you'll notice stop then
just<00:03:52.760> take<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:52.970> small<00:03:53.180> chisel<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.650> get<00:03:54.890> the

down<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.940> your<00:04:02.060> pencil<00:04:02.450> line

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.480

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.510 

now<00:05:12.070> periodically<00:05:12.760> just<00:05:13.090> check<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.570> fit<00:05:14.520> to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
now periodically just check the fit to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:25.909 
now periodically just check the fit to
see<00:05:15.700> if<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:15.880> can<00:05:16.060> get<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.360> neck<00:05:16.570> in<00:05:16.780> there
