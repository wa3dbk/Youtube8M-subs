00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 no no 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.430
 one 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello that such welcome once again to 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.260
 a new video of give magic your life and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
 today we will be seeing how they are made 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.050
 an extension of cards on the table 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 let's go in the video 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.210
 very good to do an extension of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.880
 letters let's take the deck of this 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.149
 thumb shape with one of the ridges 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.989
 annular and major shorts by the side 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.010
 opposite and the index finger we're going to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.839
 place or slightly support on the one 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 of the long edges this is towards 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.530
 up in this position we will support 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.430
 The deck 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.820
 in one of the corners and if we have a 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.269
 carpet in one of the corners of the rug 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.809
 and if not if there was no mat in shape 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.579
 opposite to our arm yes yes what 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.700
 we hold with the left hand what 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.920
 we would do from here to there we grabbed it 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.619
 by the right hand from here to there and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 so what we do is like I said 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.110
 just this way we take the deck 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:29.440
 we support diagonally or not so 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:32.590
 nor is it like that but there and there 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.950
 we take shape as I just told you and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.119
 let's go carrying the letters 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.189
 towards the middle and asia here not doing 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.610
 a triangle but strong one hundred in average 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.250
 Moon 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.850
 and for that we are talking about this 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.720
 side here some pressure 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.720
 thus 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.850
 the pressure to defend how the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.580
 letters will depend on the pressure that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.030
 let's put him there 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.030
 Y 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.590
 this is a way of giving lessons other 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.780
 will always depend on the pressure as 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.870
 a lot of pressure here I am loading 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.370
 few mark I have a lot of letters left 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.390
 because I squeezed learn a lot in someone 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.300
 few letters the opposite of this would be 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:31.340
 Do not put anything in print or not 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.120
 anybody something disarmed then not what 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.560
 make it so soft because it will not come out is 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.560
 an intermediate pressure 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.140
 this is a way of doing the other way 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.320
 is to record it in a straight line 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.750
 Another way is to start playing by 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.900
 a kind of s that is very nice to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.620
 I eat a lot of this 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.620
 this as you like it if well then 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.480
 to repeat we take there in a corner 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.030
 we press and turn 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.520
 we close always joining the two 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.610
 sides 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.500
 in the corner and degrees 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.990
 from both sides towards the center 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.950
 we put together 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.590
 once they have this they will be able to 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.800
 try to extend the deck 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.670
 pulling out the last card and playing 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.450
 in this way doing what is called 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.450
 the surfer 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:44.890
 so I can also do this here 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.069
 I want to do another side and try a 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.739
 lots of things with the deck but 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.040
 for that so he can leave 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.430
 the extension on the table the only thing 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.349
 they have to do is nothing more and nothing 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.590
 less than practicing again and again one and 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.319
 together again and again and again and 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.200
 together 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.790
 once it comes out the way that 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.650
 you want in a half moon 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.389
 in 1 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.150
 but a straight line and making shapes 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:26.560
 random as you like may already 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.310
 start to try the possibility of a 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.310
 domino effect 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.310
 but for that the letters also go to 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.820
 have to be relatively new 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.370
 then we will be able to do this effect 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.010
 dominoes we take the letter from here from the bottom 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.880
 with the same letter we raise we bow 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.880
 there and we do 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.970
 well that's all for today 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.920
 and we will be seeing each other in the next 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.350
 video and something that you always follow me 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.460
 dismissal and I tell you not to forget and 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.460
 give you margin dublin
