00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
get upset don't get it confused I'm just

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.020 
get upset don't get it confused I'm just
saying<00:05:46.920> that<00:05:47.310> if<00:05:48.260> nobody<00:05:49.260> camped<00:05:49.740> in<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:50.030> MLG

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
game and they all rushed you know it

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.340 
game and they all rushed you know it
would<00:05:53.430> be<00:05:53.550> stupid<00:05:53.880> but<00:05:54.450> if<00:05:54.600> they<00:05:54.720> did<00:05:54.960> then<00:05:55.230> the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
would be stupid but if they did then the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.700 
would be stupid but if they did then the
mp7<00:05:55.820> would<00:05:56.820> be<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.090> best<00:05:57.300> weapon<00:05:57.810> in<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.530> game

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
mp7 would be the best weapon in the game

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.750

that sometimes you know but overall I
mean<00:06:07.470> it's<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:08.190> don't<00:06:08.790> see<00:06:08.940> how<00:06:09.060> people<00:06:09.210> can

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
mean it's I don't see how people can

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.260
