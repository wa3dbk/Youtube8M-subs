00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
it just made the recipe taste better and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.500 
it just made the recipe taste better and
we're<00:02:29.920> also<00:02:30.070> going<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.519> be<00:02:30.610> adding<00:02:30.910> four<00:02:31.180> cups

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.660 
we're also going to be adding four cups
of<00:02:31.720> confectioner's<00:02:31.840> sugar<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.489> want

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
to add a little bit at a time and then

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.410 
to add a little bit at a time and then
begin<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.769> blend<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.459> once<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.180> all

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.449 
blended we can take one cup of cotton
candy<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.900> now<00:02:41.470> I'm<00:02:41.590> gonna<00:02:41.739> be<00:02:41.890> adding<00:02:42.280> in

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
candy and now I'm gonna be adding in

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.509 
candy and now I'm gonna be adding in
five<00:02:42.850> tablespoons<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.959> heavy<00:02:44.890> cream<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
five tablespoons of heavy cream to it

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.890 
five tablespoons of heavy cream to it
and<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.730> will<00:02:45.910> help<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.300> dissolve<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
and this will help to dissolve the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.990 
and this will help to dissolve the
cotton<00:02:47.200> candy<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:48.130> as<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.459> guys<00:02:48.519> can<00:02:48.670> see<00:02:48.730> when

cotton candy so as you guys can see when

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.540 
cotton candy so as you guys can see when
I'm<00:02:49.090> adding<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.750> kind<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.080> just<00:02:50.680> melts<00:02:51.250> the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
I'm adding it it kind of just melts the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.580 
I'm adding it it kind of just melts the
cotton<00:02:51.850> candy<00:02:51.970> down<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.350> we<00:02:53.470> can

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
cotton candy down a little bit so we can

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.410 
cotton candy down a little bit so we can
just<00:02:53.709> take<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.920> whisk<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.400> keep<00:02:54.760> whisking<00:02:55.120> this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
just take a whisk and keep whisking this

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.080 
just take a whisk and keep whisking this
together<00:02:55.780> until<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.739> formed<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.610> liquid

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
together until it is formed in a liquid

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.570 
together until it is formed in a liquid
and<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.930> may<00:02:59.140> seem<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.530> little<00:02:59.680> clumpy<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:00.250> if

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
and it may seem a little clumpy but if

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.890 
and it may seem a little clumpy but if
you<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.790> keep<00:03:01.000> whisking<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> will<00:03:01.810> turn

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
you just keep whisking it it will turn

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.260 
you just keep whisking it it will turn
out<00:03:02.110> great

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.000 

so<00:03:07.270> now<00:03:07.390> I'm<00:03:07.540> just<00:03:07.720> taking<00:03:07.900> our<00:03:08.260> cotton<00:03:08.710> candy

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
so now I'm just taking our cotton candy

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.950 
so now I'm just taking our cotton candy
mixture<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.730> adding<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.180> into<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.780> rest

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
mixture and adding it into it the rest

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.750 
mixture and adding it into it the rest
of<00:03:11.110> our<00:03:11.230> frosting<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.220> we've<00:03:12.340> made<00:03:12.610> before

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
of our frosting that we've made before

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.050 
of our frosting that we've made before
and<00:03:13.330> we<00:03:14.080> can<00:03:14.200> also<00:03:14.410> add<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:14.800> half<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> teaspoon

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
and we can also add in half a teaspoon

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180 
and we can also add in half a teaspoon
of<00:03:16.240> vanilla<00:03:16.470> once<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.620> have<00:03:17.770> this<00:03:17.950> we<00:03:18.160> can

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
of vanilla once you have this we can

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.280 
of vanilla once you have this we can
feed<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.580> up<00:03:18.820> again<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.390> we<00:03:19.780> will<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.080> our

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
feed it up again and we will have our

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.610 
feed it up again and we will have our
frosting<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.480> didn't<00:03:22.930> add<00:03:23.050> any<00:03:23.260> food

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
frosting so I didn't add any food

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.020 
frosting so I didn't add any food
coloring<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.310> because<00:03:24.700> mine<00:03:25.000> was

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
coloring to this because mine was

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.060 
coloring to this because mine was
already<00:03:25.420> pink<00:03:25.960> so<00:03:26.230> depending<00:03:26.710> on<00:03:26.800> what<00:03:26.920> type

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
already pink so depending on what type

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.040 
already pink so depending on what type
of<00:03:27.100> cotton<00:03:27.430> candy<00:03:27.460> you<00:03:27.790> use<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.570> will<00:03:28.720> be<00:03:28.750> that

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
of cotton candy you use it will be that

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.860 
of cotton candy you use it will be that
color<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.560> I'm<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:30.460> using<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:31.000> plain<00:03:31.240> piping

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
color and I'm just using a plain piping

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.410 
color and I'm just using a plain piping
bag<00:03:32.050> for<00:03:32.320> this<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.710> just<00:03:33.520> piping<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.030> onto<00:03:34.330> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
bag for this and just piping it onto the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:55.620 
bag for this and just piping it onto the
cupcakes<00:03:53.550> now<00:03:54.550> when<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.730> was<00:03:54.910> at<00:03:55.030> Rite<00:03:55.240> Aid<00:03:55.270> I

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
cupcakes now when I was at Rite Aid I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.590 
cupcakes now when I was at Rite Aid I
saw<00:03:55.990> these<00:03:56.380> cotton<00:03:56.890> tail<00:03:57.100> cotton<00:03:58.060> candy<00:03:58.390> balls

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
saw these cotton tail cotton candy balls

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.150 
saw these cotton tail cotton candy balls
and<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.290> thought<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.650> they<00:03:59.770> were<00:03:59.830> going<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.070> be

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
and I thought that they were going to be

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.890 
and I thought that they were going to be
actual<00:04:00.580> balls<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:01.030> cotton<00:04:01.300> candy<00:04:01.330> but<00:04:01.780> they

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
actual balls of cotton candy but they

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.570 
actual balls of cotton candy but they
weren't<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.650> was<00:04:02.740> kind<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.070> all<00:04:03.340> mashed

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
weren't it was kind of just all mashed

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.820 
weren't it was kind of just all mashed
in<00:04:03.820> together<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:04.840> formed<00:04:05.320> them<00:04:05.470> into

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
in together so I just formed them into

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.710 
in together so I just formed them into
little<00:04:05.980> balls<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.610> put<00:04:06.850> them<00:04:06.880> on<00:04:07.150> top<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.420> each

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
little balls and put them on top of each

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.690 
little balls and put them on top of each
cupcake<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.590> think<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.950> came<00:04:09.070> out<00:04:09.220> super

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
cupcake and I think it came out super

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:19.720 
cupcake and I think it came out super
cute

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.130
