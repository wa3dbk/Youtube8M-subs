hey<00:00:00.810> guys<00:00:00.989> proper<00:00:01.410> English<00:00:01.620> here<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:01.979> what

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey guys proper English here and what

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.730 
hey guys proper English here and what
I've<00:00:02.370> got<00:00:02.399> here<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:02.939> my<00:00:03.270> first<00:00:03.659> attempt<00:00:04.259> at<00:00:04.319> an

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
I've got here is my first attempt at an

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.579 
I've got here is my first attempt at an
analog<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.730> binary<00:00:06.029> converter<00:00:06.660> so<00:00:07.319> we've<00:00:07.440> got

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
analog to binary converter so we've got

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.350 
analog to binary converter so we've got
an<00:00:07.680> analog<00:00:08.040> input<00:00:08.309> over<00:00:08.639> here<00:00:08.849> based<00:00:09.150> on

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
an analog input over here based on

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.110 
an analog input over here based on
signal<00:00:09.750> strength<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.170> course<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.700> a<00:00:11.700> binary

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
signal strength of course and a binary

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.209 
signal strength of course and a binary
output<00:00:12.840> over<00:00:13.019> here<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.440> let's<00:00:13.590> test<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.920> out

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
output over here so let's test it out

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.420 
output over here so let's test it out
we'll<00:00:14.400> start<00:00:14.910> by<00:00:15.179> testing<00:00:15.480> 15<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.279> can

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
we'll start by testing 15 and you can

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
we'll start by testing 15 and you can
see<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.510> outputs<00:00:18.900> turn<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.470> we've<00:00:19.680> got

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
see all of the outputs turn on we've got

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.359 
see all of the outputs turn on we've got
one<00:00:20.100> two<00:00:21.029> four<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> eight<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.920> add<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.189> up

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
one two four and eight we add that up

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.750 
one two four and eight we add that up
it's<00:00:24.029> 15<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> test<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.650> couple<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:26.070> we'll<00:00:26.609> do

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
it's 15 and test a couple more we'll do

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.500 
it's 15 and test a couple more we'll do
13<00:00:27.510> next<00:00:28.699> we've<00:00:29.699> got<00:00:29.730> 1<00:00:30.619> plus<00:00:31.619> 4<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.920> 5<00:00:32.329> plus<00:00:33.329> 8

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
13 next we've got 1 plus 4 is 5 plus 8

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.150 
13 next we've got 1 plus 4 is 5 plus 8
is<00:00:33.989> 13<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:36.000> let's<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.899> more<00:00:36.930> we'll<00:00:37.590> grab<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
is 13 and let's do one more we'll grab a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.440 
is 13 and let's do one more we'll grab a
low<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.850> how<00:00:39.030> about<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> 6<00:00:39.950> insane<00:00:40.950> we've<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.450> 2

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
low one how about a 6 insane we've got 2

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
low one how about a 6 insane we've got 2
and<00:00:42.800> 4<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.040> 6<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:46.140> thing<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.620> preening

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and 4 is 6 and so this thing is preening

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.700 
and 4 is 6 and so this thing is preening
I'm<00:00:47.399> sure<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> compacted<00:00:48.870> quite<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
I'm sure this can be compacted quite a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.709 
I'm sure this can be compacted quite a
bit<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> fact<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bit in fact I know it can because I can

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.500 
bit in fact I know it can because I can
use<00:00:51.870> dispensers<00:00:52.530> over<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.820> generate<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
use dispensers over here to generate the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.939 
use dispensers over here to generate the
appropriate<00:00:54.600> signal<00:00:55.379> strength<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.739> just

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
appropriate signal strength I just

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
appropriate signal strength I just
wanted<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.699> lines<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
wanted to have these lines so you can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.670 
wanted to have these lines so you can
see<00:00:57.780> exactly<00:00:58.559> what's<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.910> here<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
see exactly what's going on here and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.290 
see exactly what's going on here and
yeah<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:01.980> probably<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> go<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
yeah so I'm probably going to go in and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
yeah so I'm probably going to go in and
see<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.019> find<00:01:04.290> any<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:04.979> methods<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
see if I can find any other methods to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.789 
see if I can find any other methods to
do<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.060> let's<00:01:06.689> take<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> look<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.350> exactly

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
do this but let's take a look at exactly

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.240 
do this but let's take a look at exactly
what's<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.420> circuit<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.830> for

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
what's going on in this circuit so for

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
what's going on in this circuit so for
our<00:01:11.400> demonstration<00:01:11.549> we'll<00:01:12.330> set<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.750> input<00:01:13.170> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
our demonstration we'll set an input of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800 
our demonstration we'll set an input of
9<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.210> first<00:01:15.450> thing<00:01:15.720> we're

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
9 all right so the first thing we're

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.390 
9 all right so the first thing we're
going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> send<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> over<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
going to do is send it over here to a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
going to do is send it over here to a
subtractor<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.840> I've<00:01:18.930> set<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
subtractor all right so I've set this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
subtractor all right so I've set this
comparator<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.729> subtract<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.570> we're

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
comparator to subtract and we're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.399 
comparator to subtract and we're
attempting<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.710> subtract<00:01:23.159> 8<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.880> 9<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.290> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
attempting to subtract 8 from 9 and of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.130 
attempting to subtract 8 from 9 and of
course<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.520> output<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.060> 1<00:01:27.810> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
course we can we get an output of 1 so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
course we can we get an output of 1 so
this<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.220> has<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> signal<00:01:29.820> strength<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
this over here has a signal strength of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.660 
this over here has a signal strength of
1<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> try<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> extend<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> any<00:01:31.680> further<00:01:32.009> we

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
1 if I try to extend it any further we

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.770 
1 if I try to extend it any further we
don't<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.540> anything<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> what<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.720> does

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
don't get anything and so what this does

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.219 
don't get anything and so what this does
is<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:38.820> shuts<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.869> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
is it actually shuts off this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
is it actually shuts off this
alternative<00:01:41.070> pathway<00:01:41.610> over<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.270> we'll

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
alternative pathway over here and we'll

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
alternative pathway over here and we'll
take<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.740> shortly

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
take a look at what this is for shortly

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.840 
take a look at what this is for shortly
now<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:46.530> next<00:01:46.770> thing<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.950> happens<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.579> we

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
now the next thing that happens is we

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.990 
now the next thing that happens is we
attempt<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> subtract<00:01:48.960> 4<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.850> we

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
attempt to subtract 4 all right so if we

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.319 
attempt to subtract 4 all right so if we
subtract<00:01:51.570> 4<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.110> 1<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> 0<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
subtract 4 from 1 we get a 0 but that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.950 
subtract 4 from 1 we get a 0 but that
doesn't<00:01:54.720> tell<00:01:54.869> us<00:01:54.930> anything<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.610> case

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
doesn't tell us anything so in this case

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.600 
doesn't tell us anything so in this case
this<00:01:57.960> pathway<00:01:58.290> over<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.189> because

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
this pathway over here is on because

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.569 
this pathway over here is on because
when<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.909> subtract<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.659> 0<00:02:01.280> okay<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.310> so

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
when we subtract we get a 0 okay and so

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.180 
when we subtract we get a 0 okay and so
what<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.390> happen<00:02:03.630> now

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
what can happen now

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.970 
what can happen now
is<00:02:04.250> we<00:02:05.240> can<00:02:05.510> send<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.870> signal<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:06.380> here<00:02:06.530> and

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
is we can send the signal over here and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.430 
is we can send the signal over here and
bypass<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:08.270> unit<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.900> goes<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.260> next

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
bypass this unit so it goes to the next

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.990 
bypass this unit so it goes to the next
one<00:02:09.650> you<00:02:09.740> can<00:02:09.770> see<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.070> exact<00:02:10.490> same<00:02:10.729> thing

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
one you can see the exact same thing

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.700 
one you can see the exact same thing
happens<00:02:11.420> over<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.690> when<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.470> try<00:02:12.650> to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
happens over here when we try to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.700 
happens over here when we try to
subtract<00:02:13.190> two<00:02:13.400> we<00:02:13.700> get<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> 0<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.930> bypass<00:02:15.410> it

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
subtract two we get a 0 so we bypass it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.520 
subtract two we get a 0 so we bypass it
come<00:02:16.430> over<00:02:16.640> here<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:17.840> we<00:02:18.260> try<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
come over here and now we try to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.220 
come over here and now we try to
subtract<00:02:19.070> 1<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.510> brings<00:02:20.720> us<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
subtract 1 and so this brings us to the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.480 
subtract 1 and so this brings us to the
final<00:02:21.500> part<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:23.390> circuit<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:24.860> when<00:02:25.460> I

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
final part of this circuit now when I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.880 
final part of this circuit now when I
subtract<00:02:26.000> 1<00:02:26.300> from<00:02:26.330> 1<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:27.020> get<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> 0<00:02:27.530> over<00:02:27.620> here

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
subtract 1 from 1 we get a 0 over here

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.160 
subtract 1 from 1 we get a 0 over here
and<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.790> no<00:02:29.060> good<00:02:29.090> because<00:02:29.570> we<00:02:29.690> can't<00:02:29.930> use

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
and that is no good because we can't use

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.190 
and that is no good because we can't use
that<00:02:30.200> signal<00:02:30.890> well<00:02:31.790> what<00:02:32.150> I've<00:02:32.270> done<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.810> I've

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that signal well what I've done is I've

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.950 
that signal well what I've done is I've
set<00:02:33.500> up<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.890> bypass<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.300> performs<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
set up the bypass so that it performs a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.110 
set up the bypass so that it performs a
second<00:02:36.410> subtraction<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.160> we<00:02:37.280> try<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.580> subtract

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
second subtraction so we try to subtract

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.950 
second subtraction so we try to subtract
1<00:02:38.780> from<00:02:39.050> 1<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.190> if<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.450> torch<00:02:41.780> can

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
1 from 1 and if we can this torch can

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.140 
1 from 1 and if we can this torch can
turn<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.380> we<00:02:43.070> send<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.460> over<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.910> our<00:02:43.940> output

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
turn on we send that over to our output

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.310 
turn on we send that over to our output
and<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.920> turn<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.520> 1<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.170> how

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
and we turn the 1 on and that is how

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.760 
and we turn the 1 on and that is how
this<00:02:48.500> works<00:02:48.770> it's<00:02:49.460> not<00:02:49.730> too<00:02:50.240> bad<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:51.200> like<00:02:51.740> I

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
this works it's not too bad this like I

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.310 
this works it's not too bad this like I
said<00:02:51.890> can<00:02:52.250> probably<00:02:52.520> be<00:02:52.850> compacted<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.660> made

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
said can probably be compacted and made

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.840 
said can probably be compacted and made
a<00:02:54.350> bit<00:02:54.680> more<00:02:54.860> efficient<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.490> I'm<00:02:55.580> going<00:02:55.760> to

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
a bit more efficient and I'm going to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.520 
a bit more efficient and I'm going to
try<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> do<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.020> thought<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.320> would

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
try to do that but I thought I would

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.550 
try to do that but I thought I would
show<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:57.800> my<00:02:58.130> concept<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.290> yeah<00:03:00.290> so

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
show you my concept and yeah so

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.290 
show you my concept and yeah so
hopefully<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.130> guys<00:03:01.190> enjoy<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:02.000> and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
hopefully you guys enjoy this and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.540 
hopefully you guys enjoy this and
hopefully<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.290> learned<00:03:03.470> something<00:03:03.560> thanks

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
hopefully you learned something thanks

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.190 
hopefully you learned something thanks
for<00:03:04.760> watching<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.570> will<00:03:05.750> see<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:06.020> guys
