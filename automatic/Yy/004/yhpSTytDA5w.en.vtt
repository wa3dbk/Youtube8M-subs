00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.940
 today we think we are new 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.490
 tutorial this time it's still for 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.679
 crack finally cracked I do not like that word 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.920
 vegas wallis and yes frankly that's 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.510
 very simple again then in 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.150
 the description of the video in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.010
 the aveyron on video there will be the link of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.580
 download so that's not it 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.939
 that's it's las vegas here and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.279
 then there it will be the serial codes 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.290
 cloud application 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.180
 so I'll show you everything except 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.829
 an all show you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 that is to say that I met what 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.860
 here you go download this the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.710
 software that there will be here that's going to be 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.420
 that so you put on desk you 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.950
 do not run it you put on the desk 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.039
 it'll show up like that you're going 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.129
 right click and then run in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.960
 as an administrator so I'm going to 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.270
 make 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.020
 it's been a while for me 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.159
 I'm why I'm doing a little bit 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.580
 just what opens up to the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.070
 follow and well everyone 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.280
 so that's when you want 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.659
 to run as administrator and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.580
 It's going to be a beard 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.080
 you have it there too as you want 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.970
 so I want you no because I 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.619
 know in video is normally when you 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.490
 go bcsa you're going to have a little 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.420
 window that will tell you to validate 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.470
 your account you will continue 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.950
 then I was going to have to go home 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.789
 normally the code that is here you 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.729
 make a lil copy paste here the 1st 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:48.649
 8-50 2g h- and 93 fw j then pull wdg 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.970
 to ask you first name's name of you 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.009
 put the country 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.530
 and then I think that after you 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.850
 can you check 15 years old low and you 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.360
 then continue and if it works 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.729
 not finally for example that will score 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.649
 fail or savor all stops 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.549
 mark and if that normally they 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.890
 should notice that it's okay 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.670
 take another thing to another 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.709
 way 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.120
 you will then cancel his va 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.250
 then ask you for another code 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.049
 alaut activation code that is pop 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.209
 you copied it and pasted all 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.650
 especially so yesterday my self does not judge 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.750
 how hungry I am, three ways 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.799
 when you copied you will not be able 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.470
 click on simply finish 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.340
 because here there are two bars for 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.569
 for 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.379
 I will not put it to you so 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.019
 especially do not look for it will come 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.550
 besides, I'm recording like that 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.890
 good at the unjust to copy paste and 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.959
 it's okay I say why it works 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.269
 not that I 'm going to shoot you I'm ok 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.180
 I delete 1 and it's good to finish 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.019
 and then you have access to software 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.060
