00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.080
 My name is Sandra Suarez from the team 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.630
 of work how to lose weight easily 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.720
 in this video I want to share with you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.580
 whey to burn fat the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.100
 Whey protein is a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.189
 supplement usually used when 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.740
 seeks to hypertrophy or gain muscle mass 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.020
 however recent studies seem 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.570
 indicate that it could also be a good 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.630
 supplement to burn fat 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.850
 scientific evidence in a study that 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.280
 was done for 12 weeks with 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.640
 people who had a reduced diet 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.950
 in 500 daily calories it was found that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.900
 the intake of a protein shake 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 whey before breakfast and 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.700
 after dinner, he promoted the burning 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.680
 of fat compared to intake 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.110
 of another drink with equal caloric intake 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.400
 but without the nutrients of the shake 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.830
 protein 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.290
 while the whey protein not 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.200
 increased the weight loss since in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.810
 both groups the decline was similar if 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.210
 It favored the burning of fats and decreased 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.159
 the loss of muscle mass which 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 can be key to sustaining the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.520
 activity 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.159
 metabolic and thus reduce the percentage 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.439
 of body fat over time for another 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.659
 side although it is known that proteins 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 in general they help to lose fat 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.950
 body in an investigation is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 proved that not all proteins 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.929
 have the same effect when looking 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.149
 enhance the burning of fats when 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.640
 compared the effect of a diet rich in 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.100
 proteins in rodents derived from the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.679
 meat or whey was checked 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 that the latter are more effective for 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.569
 reduce adiposity and increase 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.119
 insulin sensitivity which 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.490
 it could be especially beneficial 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.099
 for the treatment of obesity something 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.229
 similar was found in a study that 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:03.659
 compared the effect of whey protein 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.360
 of soy milk and a preparation to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.030
 carbohydrate base where it was concluded 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.160
 that without dietary restrictions who 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.680
 They drank twice daily milkshake 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.110
 whey protein had less 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.049
 hungry they lost more fat and weight and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.579
 decreased the 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.680
 waist circumference with respect 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.140
 to the rest of the groups that consumed 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.200
 other proteins 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.450
 then science tells us that if 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.090
 well all the proteins help the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.340
 moment to lose weight some more than 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.590
 others can help reduce fat and 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.230
 apparently the whey protein 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 is very useful and not only could 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.000
 be used to hypertrophy but 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.120
 it could also be a good supplement 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.330
 to burn fat if the information that 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.090
