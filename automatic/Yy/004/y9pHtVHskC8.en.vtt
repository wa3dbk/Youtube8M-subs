millimeters long each outside as you can

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
millimeters long each outside as you can
see<00:01:36.500> goes<00:01:37.500> pretty<00:01:37.680> quick

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.550 

of<00:01:47.290> course<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:47.860> outside<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:50.290> don't

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
of course this is the outside now don't

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800 
of course this is the outside now don't
really<00:01:50.890> worry<00:01:51.040> about<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.340> jigging<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:51.939> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
really worry about the jigging of the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.870 
really worry about the jigging of the
distances<00:01:53.380> at<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:53.680> point<00:01:53.920> what<00:01:54.850> you're

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
distances at this point what you're

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.249 
distances at this point what you're
going<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.240> want<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.420> do<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.659> actually<00:01:55.810> make

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
going to want to do is actually make

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.690 
going to want to do is actually make
sure<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.920> go<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.740> full<00:02:00.130> length<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.640> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
sure to go out to the full length of the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.670 
sure to go out to the full length of the
rod<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.570> can<00:02:01.720> go<00:02:01.899> ahead<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.080> step<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.500> in

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
rod and you can go ahead and step it in

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:21.030 
rod and you can go ahead and step it in
a<00:02:02.950> little<00:02:03.909> bit<00:02:04.270> later<00:02:06.060> anyway<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.119> do<00:02:07.299> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.319 

now<00:02:21.579> this<00:02:21.819> part<00:02:22.750> besides<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:24.000> fact<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.120> only

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
now this part besides the fact that only

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.330 
now this part besides the fact that only
has<00:02:25.569> one<00:02:25.840> long<00:02:26.170> screw<00:02:26.650> he's<00:02:27.159> basically

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
has one long screw he's basically

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.880 
has one long screw he's basically
identical<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.359> salesman<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.769> not

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
identical to the salesman it's not

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.920 
identical to the salesman it's not
really<00:02:30.069> been<00:02:30.370> much<00:02:30.579> change<00:02:30.909> here<00:02:31.150> only

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
really been much change here only

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.280 
really been much change here only
difference<00:02:32.349> is<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.560> Russia<00:02:33.280> has<00:02:33.989> used<00:02:34.989> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
difference is that Russia has used a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.530 
difference is that Russia has used a
trick<00:02:35.829> that<00:02:35.859> Vic<00:02:36.400> came<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.849> with<00:02:37.090> where<00:02:37.359> he

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
trick that Vic came up with where he

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.160 
trick that Vic came up with where he
came<00:02:37.720> up<00:02:37.780> with<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.109> leg<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:39.090> vertex<00:02:40.170> pressure

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
came up with a leg to vertex pressure

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.259 
came up with a leg to vertex pressure
when<00:02:41.560> he<00:02:41.680> redesigned<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.340> all<00:02:42.519> he<00:02:42.700> really<00:02:42.879> did

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
when he redesigned it all he really did

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.110 
when he redesigned it all he really did
was<00:02:43.959> he<00:02:44.079> took<00:02:44.349> pressure<00:02:44.799> or<00:02:45.129> he<00:02:45.370> took<00:02:45.670> Vic's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
was he took pressure or he took Vic's

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.679 
was he took pressure or he took Vic's
idea<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:46.870> he<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:48.040> made<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.150> vertexes<00:02:49.629> a

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
idea and he just made the vertexes a

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.479 
idea and he just made the vertexes a
little<00:02:50.019> thinner<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.920> if<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.069> look<00:02:51.189> at<00:02:51.310> him

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
little thinner so if you look at him

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.059 
little thinner so if you look at him
from<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:51.700> sides<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:53.260> only<00:02:53.379> about<00:02:53.590> four

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
from the sides there's only about four

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.819 
from the sides there's only about four
layers<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.459> plastic<00:02:54.819> holding<00:02:55.209> on<00:02:55.379> just<00:02:56.379> plenty

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
layers of plastic holding on just plenty

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.289 
layers of plastic holding on just plenty
because<00:02:56.950> there's<00:02:57.220> not<00:02:57.370> really<00:02:57.549> much<00:02:57.790> axial

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
because there's not really much axial

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.800 
because there's not really much axial
forces<00:02:58.629> on<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.989> part<00:03:02.379> of<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> printer<00:03:02.889> so

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
forces on this part of the printer so

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.850 
forces on this part of the printer so
nothing<00:03:04.810> really<00:03:04.840> lose<00:03:05.409> their<00:03:05.620> besides<00:03:06.010> time

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:24.290 

right<00:03:13.490> there

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.150 

now<00:03:24.870> once<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.200> get<00:03:25.350> done<00:03:25.530> putting<00:03:25.950> this

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
now once you get done putting this

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.040 
now once you get done putting this
together<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.850> will<00:03:27.530> then<00:03:28.530> need<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:30.050> repeat

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
together you will then need to repeat

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.140 
together you will then need to repeat
the<00:03:31.170> process<00:03:31.610> identically<00:03:32.610> for<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.970> other

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
the process identically for the other

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.630 
the process identically for the other
side<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.720> no<00:03:33.930> difference<00:03:34.380> between<00:03:34.650> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
side there is no difference between the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.450 
side there is no difference between the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
because we don't have all those Z parts
