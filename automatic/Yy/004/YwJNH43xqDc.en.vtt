00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990 

looking<00:00:13.210> at<00:00:13.330> a<00:00:13.360> very<00:00:13.720> common<00:00:14.220> bush<00:00:15.220> in<00:00:15.430> my<00:00:15.460> area

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
looking at a very common bush in my area

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.019 
looking at a very common bush in my area
that's<00:00:16.270> the<00:00:16.570> with<00:00:17.080> rod<00:00:17.380> or<00:00:18.060> Indian<00:00:19.060> raisin<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that's the with rod or Indian raisin and

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.550 
that's the with rod or Indian raisin and
this<00:00:22.029> is<00:00:22.119> how<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.300> berries<00:00:22.779> start<00:00:23.080> out<00:00:23.230> on<00:00:23.410> it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
this is how the berries start out on it

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.650 
this is how the berries start out on it
is<00:00:23.740> edible<00:00:23.920> but<00:00:24.369> there's<00:00:24.580> a<00:00:24.640> large<00:00:24.880> seed<00:00:25.330> in<00:00:25.510> it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
is edible but there's a large seed in it

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.570 
is edible but there's a large seed in it
so<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:28.060> not<00:00:28.210> like<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.980> raisin<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.190> get<00:00:30.340> from

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
so it's not like a raisin you get from

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.220 
so it's not like a raisin you get from
the<00:00:30.850> grocery<00:00:31.119> store<00:00:31.210> for<00:00:31.420> grapes<00:00:31.810> or<00:00:31.990> whatever

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
the grocery store for grapes or whatever

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.060 
the grocery store for grapes or whatever
so<00:00:33.070> from<00:00:33.280> this<00:00:33.400> it<00:00:33.580> changes<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:34.360> kind<00:00:34.660> of<00:00:34.750> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
so from this it changes to kind of a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.670 
so from this it changes to kind of a
reddish<00:00:36.070> color<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.960> see<00:00:38.170> one<00:00:38.320> there<00:00:38.500> that's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
reddish color and see one there that's

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.590 
reddish color and see one there that's
kind<00:00:39.580> of<00:00:39.670> ripening<00:00:40.059> from<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:40.900> they<00:00:41.080> go<00:00:41.230> dark

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
kind of ripening from that they go dark

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.149 
kind of ripening from that they go dark
look<00:00:43.600> at<00:00:43.690> that<00:00:43.840> one<00:00:44.019> there<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.470> blue<00:00:44.890> goes

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
look at that one there it's blue goes

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.549 
look at that one there it's blue goes
almost<00:00:45.460> black<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:46.229> whistled<00:00:47.229> up<00:00:47.320> like<00:00:47.530> a

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559
