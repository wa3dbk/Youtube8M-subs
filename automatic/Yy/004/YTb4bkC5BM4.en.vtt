defenders<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> first<00:01:18.420> day<00:01:18.600> first<00:01:19.049> two

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
defenders are at the first day first two

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
defenders are at the first day first two
days<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.189> midfielders<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.210> then

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
days then we have midfielders and then

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.850 
days then we have midfielders and then
we<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.780> strikers<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> end<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
we have strikers in the end so at the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
we have strikers in the end so at the
sixth<00:01:23.189> day<00:01:23.220> we're<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.119> when<00:01:24.240> Messi<00:01:24.540> are

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
sixth day we're now that when Messi are

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
sixth day we're now that when Messi are
going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> basically<00:01:25.979> they're

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
going to be here and basically they're

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
going to be here and basically they're
probably<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.420> they're

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
probably going to go down to they're

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.330 
probably going to go down to they're
probably<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.220> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
probably going to go down a lot for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
probably going to go down a lot for
example<00:01:29.579> Ronaldo<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.299> 4.5

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
example Ronaldo now it's about 4.5

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.719 
example Ronaldo now it's about 4.5
million<00:01:31.290> coin<00:01:31.530> she's<00:01:31.650> probably<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> go

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
million coin she's probably going to go

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
million coin she's probably going to go
down<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.509> three<00:01:33.780> million<00:01:33.960> coins<00:01:34.229> me<00:01:34.380> see

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
down to about three million coins me see

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
down to about three million coins me see
what<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:34.799> saying<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.220> when<00:01:35.460> these<00:01:35.700> guys

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
what I'm saying is that when these guys

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
what I'm saying is that when these guys
here<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.299> cheap<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:37.079> ahead<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> pick<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:38.070> up

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
here are cheap go ahead and pick them up

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
here are cheap go ahead and pick them up
there's<00:01:38.729> still<00:01:38.970> many<00:01:39.329> months<00:01:39.630> left<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> e15

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
there's still many months left of e15

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
there's still many months left of e15
and<00:01:40.560> these<00:01:40.799> cards<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> rise

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and these cards there are going to rise

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.490 
and these cards there are going to rise
even<00:01:42.240> though<00:01:42.659> there's<00:01:42.840> team<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> season

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
even though there's team of the season

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
even though there's team of the season
as<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:43.770> these<00:01:44.040> cards<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.939> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
as well these cards there are in it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
as well these cards there are in it
going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> rise<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.689> before<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> would

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
going to rise way before that so I would

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.990 
going to rise way before that so I would
say<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.130> though<00:01:47.310> he<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.640> probably<00:01:47.880> go

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
say right now though he can probably go

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.179 
say right now though he can probably go
down<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.450> about<00:01:48.600> three<00:01:49.049> million<00:01:49.649> coins<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
down to about three million coins and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.020 
down to about three million coins and
then<00:01:50.369> maybe<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.240> month<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.780> after<00:01:52.290> um<00:01:53.030> similar

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
then maybe a month to after um similar

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.670 
then maybe a month to after um similar
is<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.540> up<00:01:54.570> against<00:01:55.079> about<00:01:55.290> four<00:01:55.530> min

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
is going to go up against about four min

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.810 
is going to go up against about four min
including<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.340> an<00:01:56.490> easy<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
including so that's like an easy a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
including so that's like an easy a
million<00:01:57.210> coins<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.630> obviously<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.409> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
million coins there obviously this is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.170 
million coins there obviously this is
just<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> coins<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.969> just

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just if you have the coins this is just

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.760 
just if you have the coins this is just
probably<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> best<00:02:00.840> method<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> have

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
probably the best method if you have

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709 
probably the best method if you have
like<00:02:01.979> tons<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.430> coins<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.509> go<00:02:03.630> ahead

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
like tons of coins to do just go ahead

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
like tons of coins to do just go ahead
when<00:02:03.990> Ronaldo<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.680> Messi<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.310> cheapest

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
when Ronaldo and Messi are the cheapest

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
when Ronaldo and Messi are the cheapest
when<00:02:05.969> they<00:02:06.060> are<00:02:06.210> extremely<00:02:06.719> cheap<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.409> ahead

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
when they are extremely cheap go ahead

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.869 
when they are extremely cheap go ahead
and<00:02:07.590> invest<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.069> them<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:08.520> sell<00:02:08.789> them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and invest in them and then sell them

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.580 
and invest in them and then sell them
all<00:02:09.000> obviously<00:02:09.450> after<00:02:09.629> team<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.379> when
