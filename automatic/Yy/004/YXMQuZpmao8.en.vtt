00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.960
 hello girls and guys fans of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.569
 show that in this video I bring you the 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.050
 tutorial on how to make this washing machine 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.150
 for your monsters let's start I'll 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.040
 occupy a tetrapack container I have this 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 that is of milk has marked it to the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.650
 height of about the waist of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.960
 the doll and I cut it now I'm going to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.419
 cut out this part here to do 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.400
 the back of the washer 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.589
 you can see it is already cut the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.019
 Top of our base tetra pak 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.899
 that will be part of the backing of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.379
 the washing machine now I have marked here with a 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.030
 ballpoint pen a circle that well with the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.100
 cutter help asks for help from an adult 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 you have to cut out and extract this 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.070
 circle that is a bit smaller than this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.530
 container that I will use myself because 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 I want that this is what I used here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.440
 the one that you have in your country that I have this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 which it is yogurt 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 so I'm going to cut it out and I'll show you 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.030
 already cut the circle of my washing machine in 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 such course I have to paste a piece 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.920
 of cardboard here because this was hollow 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.860
 and I opened this area in my glass but 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 if you use any other container, 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.130
 you're going to need to do that as you can 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.409
 see goes perfectly now what I 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.450
 fact is that I have taken a piece of a 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.619
 box they want to recycle I have this 15 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.450
 serial and taking advantage of one of these 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.810
 ears of this fold 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810
 I have marked 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.030
 a cover here 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.570
 leaving half a centimeter equipment in the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.719
 fold so that it forms the lid of our 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.990
 washing machine as you can observe took us 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:49.130
 until the bottom because he remembers that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.960
 let's put this here then no no 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.479
 can get to the bottom you have to 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.240
 be a space and then now I'm going to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.790
 proceed to line you can form it with the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.140
 paper you have at home 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.190
 I will proceed to file a little 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.840
 to give it a better finish and I'm going to 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.110
 cover it with this paper in platinum color 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.560
 to give it that aspect of a 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.510
 real artifact and I show you 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.670
 if you are going to make this the time for your 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.340
 barbies or for another doll like the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.890
 costume zebras uses another type of lining 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.300
 I eat like you know the house I 'm 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.290
 doing is for monster high so 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 I decided to cover it with this colored fabric 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.900
 black with spiderweb design here I have 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.410
 put a piece of black felt and then 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.340
 now I have a felt band 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.840
 black that I'm going to paste leaving aside 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.840
 open and I'm going to stick to back here 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.610
 and then on this other side I'm going to paste 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.830
 this stage that I painted with paint 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.390
 silver color and here I have put paper 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.340
 silver 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.010
 why is it the lid on our 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.739
 washing machine I show you 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.010
 already have the back of the washing machine 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.099
 I put hot silicone and then like 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.680
 you can see it's like this now here I've 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.269
 put the felt bit 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.190
 and what I'm going to do is I'm going to 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.030
 put some hot silicone here 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:26.100
 and I'll stick my stage washer 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.100
 this way I show you 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.910
 make sure you fit well a little bit 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.910
 Pressure 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.860
 you have to wait for it to cool 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.870
 and I'm going to put the decoration here 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.900
 which are the control buttons of the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.959
 washing machine 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.720
 is almost finished to close in the 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.780
 bottom of your washer I've 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.000
 caught a cardboard 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.950
 of these thick and I've stuck it double 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.440
 with hot silicone and then preside 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.760
 cover with a black tape of 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.520
 very simple way so I'm going to take 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.310
 hot silicone here and I'm going to stick to 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.260
 the base to close our washing machine 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.300
 this is the final result as you can 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.389
 observe him stick three beads behind 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.580
 I hit platinum paper remaining 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.950
 line with an indelible down to give it 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.480
 a contrast note and I put here a 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.970
 guarantee now bigger than after the 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.840
 programming button and on and 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.120
 off of the washing machine I also have 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.820
 a platinum paper on top and behind for 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.490
 so give much contrast from behind 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.319
 I hit a sorbet 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.620
 of those that give you in the jukeboxes 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.930
 when you buy thick juices this 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.729
 stage opens to the inside as you can see 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.420
 the deposit where you throw your clothes for 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.850
 to wash 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.460
 because underneath as I told you to hit him 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.420
 the cardboard lined with tape and that's it 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.240
