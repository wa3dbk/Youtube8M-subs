this year the kind of objective right
from<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.880> beginning<00:00:31.000> was<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.420> actually<00:00:31.750> match

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
from the beginning was to actually match

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.680 
from the beginning was to actually match
what<00:00:32.590> you<00:00:32.950> have<00:00:33.100> in<00:00:33.220> real<00:00:33.250> life<00:00:33.550> if<00:00:34.239> you<00:00:34.300> want

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
what you have in real life if you want

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.720 
what you have in real life if you want
that<00:00:34.810> Formula<00:00:35.230> one<00:00:35.350> experience<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.430> stuff

that Formula one experience the stuff

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.670 
that Formula one experience the stuff
we've<00:00:36.880> been<00:00:37.000> doing<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.300> 2012<00:00:38.050> has<00:00:38.230> moved<00:00:38.530> that

weather scenario system has really been
refined<00:00:46.720> this<00:00:46.870> year<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:47.410> you'll<00:00:47.739> get<00:00:47.890> where

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
refined this year so you'll get where

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.470 
refined this year so you'll get where
the<00:00:48.190> friends<00:00:48.460> come<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:48.699> now<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.210> could<00:00:49.360> be

really unpredictable now it's really

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.520 
really unpredictable now it's really
matching<00:01:04.420> what<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.690> people<00:01:05.110> are<00:01:05.199> seeing<00:01:05.350> on

change on the feel of the car you can

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.859 
change on the feel of the car you can
really<00:01:17.320> attack<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.680> track<00:01:18.300> many<00:01:19.300> people<00:01:19.690> will

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
really attack the track many people will

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.499 
really attack the track many people will
watch<00:01:19.899> fastest<00:01:20.560> laps<00:01:20.800> or<00:01:21.070> pole<00:01:21.340> laps<00:01:21.610> on<00:01:21.880> TV<00:01:22.330> at

watch fastest laps or pole laps on TV at

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.180 
watch fastest laps or pole laps on TV at
the<00:01:22.600> weekend<00:01:23.050> now<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.770> really<00:01:23.950> get<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
the weekend now you can really get the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.529 
the weekend now you can really get the
sense<00:01:24.399> of<00:01:24.580> doing<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:24.880> same<00:01:25.060> things<00:01:25.330> as<00:01:25.509> the

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
sense of doing the same things as the

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.810 
sense of doing the same things as the
drivers<00:01:26.229> it's<00:01:26.440> just<00:01:26.649> those<00:01:26.770> extra<00:01:27.369> elements

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
drivers it's just those extra elements

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.100 
drivers it's just those extra elements
and<00:01:27.970> make<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.180> feel<00:01:28.360> like<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.570> real<00:01:28.750> Formula

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
and make you feel like a real Formula

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.260 
and make you feel like a real Formula
One<00:01:29.259> driver<00:01:32.549> we've<00:01:33.549> got<00:01:33.700> some<00:01:33.850> really<00:01:34.090> cool

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
One driver we've got some really cool

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.570 
One driver we've got some really cool
engine<00:01:34.750> audio<00:01:35.020> what's<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.860> drive<00:01:36.070> in<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.369> car

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
engine audio what's to drive in the car

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580 
engine audio what's to drive in the car
the<00:01:37.299> other<00:01:37.420> cars<00:01:37.690> were<00:01:37.810> out<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:38.080> circuit<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
the other cars were out in circuit and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.750 
the other cars were out in circuit and
particularly<00:01:38.950> on<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.130> pass<00:01:39.340> wires<00:01:39.610> and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
particularly on the pass wires and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.450 
particularly on the pass wires and
things<00:01:39.880> are<00:01:40.060> just<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:40.330> much<00:01:40.479> more<00:01:40.690> realistic<00:01:40.840> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
things are just so much more realistic I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460 
things are just so much more realistic I
think<00:01:42.460> players<00:01:42.939> who<00:01:43.090> played<00:01:43.360> f1<00:01:43.659> 2010<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.229> f1

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
think players who played f1 2010 and f1

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.780 
think players who played f1 2010 and f1
2011<00:01:44.710> are<00:01:45.070> really<00:01:45.250> going<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.430> see<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.610> big

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
2011 are really going to see a big

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.240 
2011 are really going to see a big
uplift<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.270> area<00:01:46.450> issue

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.860 

we've<00:01:50.850> had<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> bit<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.360> change<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.750> direction

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
we've had a bit of a change in direction

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.860 
we've had a bit of a change in direction
for<00:01:52.140> 2012<00:01:53.010> in<00:01:53.460> 10<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> 11th<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.660> player

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
for 2012 in 10 and the 11th the player

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.690 
for 2012 in 10 and the 11th the player
had<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.380> main<00:01:55.560> user<00:01:55.770> interface<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.520> main

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
had the main user interface the main

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
had the main user interface the main
menu<00:01:56.880> sitting<00:01:57.690> inside<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.050> paddock<00:01:58.380> whether

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
menu sitting inside the paddock whether

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.860

you<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:58.950> interviews<00:01:59.400> but<00:01:59.580> for<00:01:59.970> 2012<00:02:00.720> we

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
you have the interviews but for 2012 we

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.750 
you have the interviews but for 2012 we
wanted<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> try<00:02:01.350> something<00:02:01.560> different<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.610> now

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
wanted to try something different so now

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.760 
wanted to try something different so now
it's<00:02:02.940> about<00:02:03.210> projecting<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:04.140> passion<00:02:04.620> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
it's about projecting the passion and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.530 
it's about projecting the passion and
the<00:02:04.860> technicality<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.700> forming<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.390> make

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the technicality of forming on to make

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.060 
the technicality of forming on to make
it<00:02:06.660> really<00:02:06.870> look<00:02:07.020> cool<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.410> also<00:02:07.560> ease
