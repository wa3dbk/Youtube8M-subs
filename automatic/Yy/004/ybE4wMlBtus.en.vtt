00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi girls is like that with a new video e 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.690
 sorry if I'm not in the conditions 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.750
 better but lately 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
 so today I didn't feel like proposing to you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.370
 a video tutorial also because veil 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.310
 the last two proposals were precisely i 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.710
 more rich tutorials so quite a lot here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.510
 in toga they reproduce my new and why 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 new lipsticks have come out of the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.670
 collection to the output of essence or a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.980
 found star veils as I possess 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.380
 all wrinkles always ovations therefore if 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 at 5 am they will be part of the line e 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.370
 they of multiple realities, however, do 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 part of the permanent range and is 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 the one with the packaging is normal that I have 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 in pink to barbie very nice but 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.800
 according to me with wearable at least on me 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 and not between the end of video if you like so 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 maybe with quests with review vi 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.260
 I also show the writing of these 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.570
 the commissioner of two of these lipsticks or 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.489
 same those that I think result 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.320
 more mongelli then two colors that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.670
 now I show you while the others are there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.949
 I only show the swatch on the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 hand because at least on 2000 song 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.700
 they were for a homogeneous and therefore it is 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.310
 just throw it to see on video 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.409
 short is not much 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 so I avoided showing these 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.049
 scenes or blues and but you have noticed more 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.780
 changed the neck of the hair is anyway 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.790
 let's talk about the objects which is better 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.509
 I have seven in question are these here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.150
 and as you can see they are all colors 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.030
 here you see they are pretty breakfasts and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.549
 we have two colors more mauve than this 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.920
 central this one on the left and then 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.930
 all google news and those that you 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.640
 like the most as a draft on 13 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.680
 even if at the end of the show I'll show you 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.700
 only two because I know it but I love them 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.070
 lot 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.130
 or these two are not the ones who 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.140
 they all are more homogeneous 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 in addition a shiny finish therefore if there is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.990
 like the opal finish with these lipsticks 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.440
 they are not for you, but those they are 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.300
 all 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.190
 the genes that are well spent on 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.840
 Lips are the three I also did the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.740
 number 02 that this is yes 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.570
 sees that this beautiful flesh-colored them 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.220
 I use this almost every day 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.350
 sincere when I don't want to use too much 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.730
 maybe already made a darker trick more 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.930
 black sea on the eyes then 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.570
 at the University 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.090
 I want to stay hate on my lips e 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.500
 it tends a little bit coral therefore 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.210
 I like this because even where to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.570
 swords maybe you want right with 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.360
 touch of color and then sardegna then like 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.820
 I told you of these two colors that you 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:41.100
 I also say the numbers in number 0 5 with 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:43.290
 you of the number 030 natural calm o 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.810
 extended that hour instead darker then 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.730
 more mauve than purple because yes 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.130
 they really look a lot like gods 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.900
 members, I show them that way 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.270
 which in reality is not the gas they are for 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.560
 nothing just as they spread out 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.390
 in evidence the direct folds 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.170
 maybe in the various for dozens are places 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.020
 these turn out to be very little like 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.420
 just not a nice full color then 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.320
 they really really disappointed me too 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.940
 if what I like so much 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.350
 this is well pink beautiful pink that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.910
 following but the holidays suisse we paid 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.950
 since from so many games with 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.290
 this color of lipstick between second and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.560
 obviously this lipstick because this 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.530
 it sucks and then this is the number 01 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.180
 what a record so obviously and this one 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.560
 instead the number 0 4 which instead more 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.440
 berlin and slightly resembles cream 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.750
 of multimac and also that but I like it 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.400
 because it is not so homogeneous therefore also 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.980
 I do not recommend this here because precisely 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.870
 if you are recovering a little bit of 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.390
 cuticles or in general 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.299
 lips with pussies for 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.200
 another one is not recommended 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.700
 color that instead the usual package in 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.459
 black then with the strip more 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.000
 colored then normal the packaging 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.769
 this newspaper is the number 20 jet 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.840
 look this pink nicki minaj 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.640
 really numerous very very eccentric 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.590
 that personally on my lips does not 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.049
 I see nothing like a big fat color 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.370
 of me negligible I can't try 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.320
 wear 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.720
 obviously de gustibus it is a lot 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.449
 subjective however it is very very nice and 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.840
 Also this here in my opinion is not 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.150
 very much the color yes 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.419
 presents in this way maybe I leave you 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.300
 the photo in which the photo in which I have it 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.380
 worn and on me this wine a lot a 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.840
 lilac 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.240
 there is a shocking pink also here from the 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.729
 but on me it turns out more 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.380
 lilac and make my face go so gray 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.380
 that is, I don't like it at all 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.120
 I repeat, they are foundations that up 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.840
 these tiles and I'm using them all 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.030
 in most days almost every day e 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.220
 in short, for the university in everyday life 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.230
 and I can tell you that also for how much 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.880
 regards the golden are no longer even though 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.950
 I'm back in the long line 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.770
 lasting do not last more than two or three hours 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.380
 in great detail not studio films or for 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.700
 at least I recommend the colors a lot 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.040
 beard because they are also those who 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.010
 I think they are more wearing them than 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.600
 all if I hope this video can 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.700
 be useful from time to time for what I have 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.040
 I said because I'm trying them 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.450
 relatively recently so I don't 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.640
 I feel like giving a first one is beautiful 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.170
 precise now maybe then I do 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.120
 a more detailed opinion in one 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.190
 more internet lesson on the blog though 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.870
 right now the breakfasts there 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.240
 I recommend more are these place at 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.860
 tour in comic colors or if it makes you 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.500
 pleasure to see the video 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.670
 because finally videos I will show you 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.720
 precisely these two worn here 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.670
 they also apply a pencil below 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.890
 to do it the longest and therefore how 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.750
 they can be on the lips and escape them 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.840
 of all the lipsticks then before 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.430
 these five of the air line there 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.230
 I repeat, they will always be part of mine 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.200
 permanent and then those of the line 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.550
 classical explains and I hope therefore video vi 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.380
 both liked I recommend not 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.880
 forget to put a like because 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.880
 unfortunately youtube keeps us going 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.370
 only if you are active in my channel 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.290
 I refer then with pato and see you 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.340
 soon with other video sphere in 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.880
 better conditions 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.880
 Hello
