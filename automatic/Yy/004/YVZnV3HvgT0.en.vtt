00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
I don't know what it is then a predator

I don't know what it is then a predator
and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.560> juggernaut<00:01:26.070> you'll<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> flash

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and then juggernaut you'll see the flash

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.010 
and then juggernaut you'll see the flash
in<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> landmine<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.600> everything's<00:01:27.869> pretty

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
in a landmine so everything's pretty

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.929 
in a landmine so everything's pretty
normal<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.009> new<00:01:29.159> point<00:01:29.490> counter<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
normal but the new point counter is

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.300 
normal but the new point counter is
totally<00:01:30.390> different<00:01:30.720> he<00:01:31.650> switches<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.159> gun

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
totally different he switches to a gun

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
totally different he switches to a gun
here<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> secondary<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:33.659> assuming

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
here this is a secondary I'm assuming

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.170 
here this is a secondary I'm assuming
the<00:01:34.079> fmg9<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> foldable<00:01:35.400> submachine<00:01:36.030> gun

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the fmg9 it's a foldable submachine gun

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.870 
the fmg9 it's a foldable submachine gun
made<00:01:36.689> by<00:01:36.840> Magpul<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> real<00:01:38.490> gun<00:01:38.700> though

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
made by Magpul it is a real gun though

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.819 
made by Magpul it is a real gun though
it's<00:01:39.000> only<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> prototype<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.780> real<00:01:39.900> life<00:01:40.110> it's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
it's only a prototype in real life it's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's only a prototype in real life it's
actually<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> pretty<00:01:41.640> simple<00:01:41.850> gun<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> shoots

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
actually a pretty simple gun it shoots

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
actually a pretty simple gun it shoots
nine<00:01:42.570> millimetre<00:01:42.960> parabellum<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
nine millimetre parabellum and it's a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440 
nine millimetre parabellum and it's a
lot<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.430> shooting<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> Glock<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.210> actually

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
lot like shooting a Glock it's actually

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.289 
lot like shooting a Glock it's actually
based<00:01:45.659> off<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> Glock<00:01:46.259> 17<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.979> 18<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
based off at the Glock 17 or 18 it's a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
based off at the Glock 17 or 18 it's a
cool<00:01:48.659> looking<00:01:49.020> gun<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
cool looking gun it's really not that

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.550 
cool looking gun it's really not that
amazing<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.970> pretty<00:01:51.180> simple<00:01:51.420> gun<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
amazing it's a pretty simple gun so it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.389 
amazing it's a pretty simple gun so it
sounds<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.280> some

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
sounds like we are gonna have some

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
sounds like we are gonna have some
pretty<00:01:53.520> cool<00:01:53.640> secondaries<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.750> pistols

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
pretty cool secondaries not just pistols

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.170 
pretty cool secondaries not just pistols
so<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.219> either<00:01:56.369> good<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.640> bad<00:01:56.729> depending

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
so that is either good or bad depending

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.649 
so that is either good or bad depending
on<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.450> like

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
on what you like

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.899 
on what you like
so<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> landmine<00:01:58.920> goes<00:01:59.130> off<00:01:59.310> before<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.820> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
so the landmine goes off before I get to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.550 
so the landmine goes off before I get to
the<00:02:00.000> juggernaut<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> focus<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the juggernaut I want to focus on the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
the juggernaut I want to focus on the
mini-map<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.250> does<00:02:02.460> look<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.729> it's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
mini-map it does look like it's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.830 
mini-map it does look like it's
three-dimensional

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
three-dimensional

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
three-dimensional
that<00:02:04.500> could<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.799> huge<00:02:05.100> guys<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.579> how

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that could be huge guys you know how

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.889 
that could be huge guys you know how
sometimes<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.509> guys<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
sometimes you don't know if guys on the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.050 
sometimes you don't know if guys on the
first<00:02:07.079> floor<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> second<00:02:07.799> floor<00:02:08.060> hopefully

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
first floor the second floor hopefully

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 
first floor the second floor hopefully
they<00:02:09.750> put<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.410> some<00:02:10.649> way<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.039> can

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
they put in some way that we can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.589 
they put in some way that we can
differentiate<00:02:11.550> between<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.090> two<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
differentiate between the two because I

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.800 
differentiate between the two because I
know<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:12.930> been<00:02:13.110> kind<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> an

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
know that's been kind of an

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.910 
know that's been kind of an
same<00:02:13.989> thing<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.319> you're<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> two-story

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
same thing if you're in a two-story

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.809 
same thing if you're in a two-story
building<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.750> next<00:02:16.959> parts<00:02:17.230> much<00:02:17.470> bigger

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
building so the next parts much bigger

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.370 
building so the next parts much bigger
the<00:02:18.819> juggernaut<00:02:19.420> he<00:02:19.599> hits<00:02:19.870> his<00:02:19.989> juggernaut

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
the juggernaut he hits his juggernaut

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.680 
the juggernaut he hits his juggernaut
kill<00:02:20.620> streak<00:02:20.890> at<00:02:20.980> 14<00:02:21.400> points<00:02:21.730> remember<00:02:22.450> it

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
kill streak at 14 points remember it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.780 
kill streak at 14 points remember it
doesn't<00:02:22.900> say<00:02:23.140> kills<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.770> does<00:02:24.010> say<00:02:24.220> points<00:02:24.640> now

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
doesn't say kills it does say points now

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.640 
doesn't say kills it does say points now
I'm<00:02:25.209> hoping<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.959> based<00:02:26.140> on<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.440> home

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
I'm hoping this is based on the home

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.559 
I'm hoping this is based on the home
front<00:02:26.830> system<00:02:27.310> which<00:02:27.790> basically<00:02:28.090> means<00:02:28.360> let's

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
front system which basically means let's

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.240 
front system which basically means let's
say<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.750> cap<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.050> flag<00:02:29.349> maybe<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.890> equals<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
say you cap a flag maybe that equals a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.620 
say you cap a flag maybe that equals a
point<00:02:30.519> or<00:02:30.700> two<00:02:30.730> points<00:02:31.209> even<00:02:31.300> or<00:02:31.510> if<00:02:31.569> you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
point or two points even or if you

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.479 
point or two points even or if you
defend<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.050> flag<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.709> don't<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.190> kill

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
defend a flag you don't just get a kill

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.650 
defend a flag you don't just get a kill
maybe<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:33.849> two<00:02:34.030> points<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:34.450> just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
maybe you get two points so that's just

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.199 
maybe you get two points so that's just
speculation<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.890> clearly<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:36.670> not<00:02:36.849> just

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
speculation but clearly it's not just

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.600 
speculation but clearly it's not just
gonna<00:02:37.360> be<00:02:37.540> about<00:02:37.750> kills<00:02:38.220> juggernaut<00:02:39.220> if<00:02:39.489> you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
gonna be about kills juggernaut if you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.040 
gonna be about kills juggernaut if you
want<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:40.030> rest<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.269> survival<00:02:40.690> trailer

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
want to rest a survival trailer

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.290 
want to rest a survival trailer
juggernaut<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:41.980> basically<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.430> giant<00:02:42.970> suit

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
juggernaut is basically this giant suit

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.479 
juggernaut is basically this giant suit
that<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.959> put<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.680> makes<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.069> gives<00:02:45.400> you

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
that you put on and makes you gives you

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.340 
that you put on and makes you gives you
basically<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.090> ton<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.299> power<00:02:46.510> that's<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.200> most

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
basically a ton of power that's the most

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.009 
basically a ton of power that's the most
likely<00:02:47.709> outcome<00:02:47.860> because<00:02:48.819> it's<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.600> care

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
likely outcome because it's a care

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.840 
likely outcome because it's a care
package<00:02:50.170> drop<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.709> how<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.220> comes<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.640> sounds

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
package drop is how it comes it sounds

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.199 
package drop is how it comes it sounds
like<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.060> comes<00:02:52.209> in<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.390> care<00:02:52.600> package<00:02:52.720> drop<00:02:53.110> so

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
like it comes in a care package drop so

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.400 
like it comes in a care package drop so
next<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.660> huge<00:02:55.870> part<00:02:56.080> guys<00:02:56.230> if

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
next and this is the huge part guys if

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.600 
next and this is the huge part guys if
you<00:02:56.500> look<00:02:56.650> at<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.890> bottom<00:02:57.190> right<00:02:57.310> hand<00:02:57.459> corner

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
you look at the bottom right hand corner

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.509 
you look at the bottom right hand corner
this<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.180> huge<00:02:58.510> change<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:59.739> looks<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.370> you

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
this is a huge change it looks like you

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.920 
this is a huge change it looks like you
could<00:03:00.640> now<00:03:00.760> pick<00:03:01.060> which<00:03:01.239> kill<00:03:01.510> streak<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:01.840> you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
could now pick which kill streak if you

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.420 
could now pick which kill streak if you
look<00:03:02.080> at<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> juggernaut<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.099> he<00:03:03.190> just

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
look at the juggernaut that he just

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.920 
look at the juggernaut that he just
achieved<00:03:03.790> there's<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.209> right<00:03:04.450> arrow<00:03:04.630> button

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
achieved there's a right arrow button

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.870 
achieved there's a right arrow button
which<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.140> assume<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.680> d-pad<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.430> looks

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
which I assume is the d-pad it looks

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.670 
which I assume is the d-pad it looks
like<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.209> press<00:03:07.510> right<00:03:07.540> on<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.049> right<00:03:08.260> if

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
you put right on the d-pad you get to

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.759

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
still build up I wonder how they're

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.050 
still build up I wonder how they're
gonna<00:04:20.680> handle<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:21.250> maybe<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.669> drops<00:04:21.909> a

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
gonna handle that maybe it drops a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.130 
gonna handle that maybe it drops a
little<00:04:22.180> bit<00:04:22.330> because<00:04:22.599> they're<00:04:22.720> keeping<00:04:22.900> a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
little bit because they're keeping a

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.040 
little bit because they're keeping a
meter<00:04:23.409> now<00:04:23.680> it's<00:04:23.890> a<00:04:24.010> meter<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.360> could<00:04:25.930> maybe

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
meter now it's a meter so it could maybe

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.240 
meter now it's a meter so it could maybe
drop<00:04:26.409> I<00:04:26.560> think<00:04:26.710> it'd<00:04:26.800> be<00:04:26.830> cool

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
drop I think it'd be cool

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.100 
drop I think it'd be cool
you<00:04:27.310> guide<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.790> goes<00:04:28.030> down<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.450> three<00:04:28.720> spots

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
you guide it goes down like three spots

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.240 
you guide it goes down like three spots
instead<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.590> every<00:04:29.830> spot

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
instead of every spot

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.190 
instead of every spot
who<00:04:30.610> knows<00:04:30.850> that's<00:04:31.180> just<00:04:31.330> speculation<00:04:31.570> but

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
who knows that's just speculation but

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.360 
who knows that's just speculation but
like<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.440> said<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.770> definitely<00:04:33.220> looks<00:04:33.340> like

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
like I said it definitely looks like

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.470 
like I said it definitely looks like
they're<00:04:33.580> going<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:33.760> more<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.060> homefront

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
they're going to more of a homefront

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.980

I<00:04:35.020> love<00:04:35.650> homefront<00:04:36.220> if<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.430> had<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.580> feel<00:04:36.850> of

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
I love homefront if it had the feel of

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.220 
I love homefront if it had the feel of
