00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.520 
version got a little scuff on the window
that's<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:49.010> fortunate<00:01:49.970> but<00:01:50.510> i<00:01:50.930> guess<00:01:51.320> that's

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
that's a fortunate but i guess that's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.310 
that's a fortunate but i guess that's
the<00:01:51.620> way<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.890> goes<00:01:52.510> these<00:01:53.510> things<00:01:53.690> are<00:01:53.900> still

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
the way it goes these things are still

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.970 
the way it goes these things are still
mass-produced

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.520 

I<00:02:01.390> thought<00:02:02.390> this<00:02:02.600> might<00:02:02.750> be<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.960> sticker<00:02:03.290> inside

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.780 
I thought this might be a sticker inside
that<00:02:03.800> would<00:02:03.920> have<00:02:04.010> been<00:02:04.070> cool<00:02:04.130> but<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:04.610> just

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
that would have been cool but it's just

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:13.600 
that would have been cool but it's just
a<00:02:04.910> piece<00:02:05.120> of<00:02:05.150> cardboard<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.740> 50<00:02:12.980> 70<00:02:13.430> board

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
a piece of cardboard so the 50 70 board

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.400
