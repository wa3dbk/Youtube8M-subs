00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that it will be in the 30 miles per

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.160 
that it will be in the 30 miles per
gallon<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.850> very<00:00:39.030> impressive<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.719> Alexis

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170

gallon it's very impressive for Alexis
not<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.590> impressive<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> Toyota

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
not so impressive for a Toyota

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.150 
not so impressive for a Toyota

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
but in this segment you might expect

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.220 
but in this segment you might expect
some<00:00:44.490> things<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:45.060> more<00:00:45.240> important<00:00:45.750> than<00:00:45.810> fuel

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
some things are more important than fuel

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.520 
some things are more important than fuel
economy<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.950> raw<00:00:47.790> beauty<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.200> takes<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
economy like raw beauty it takes a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.960 
economy like raw beauty it takes a
little<00:00:49.680> bit<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> styling<00:00:50.370> from<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> Prius

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
little bit of the styling from the Prius

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.820 
little bit of the styling from the Prius
a<00:00:51.180> lot<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.600> same<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.230> aerodynamic<00:00:52.800> shape

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
a lot of the same more aerodynamic shape

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.860 
a lot of the same more aerodynamic shape
but<00:00:53.130> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.400> tell<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.880> they've<00:00:54.450> made<00:00:54.660> more

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
but you can tell that they've made more

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
but you can tell that they've made more
compromises<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.650> terms<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> efficiency<00:00:56.220> for

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
compromises in terms of efficiency for

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.420 
compromises in terms of efficiency for
styling<00:00:57.540> moving<00:00:58.110> out<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> lexus<00:00:58.860> area<00:00:59.220> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
styling moving out of the lexus area and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
styling moving out of the lexus area and
into<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> toyota<00:01:00.120> area<00:01:00.540> i<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.900> guarantee<00:01:01.110> you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
into the toyota area i can guarantee you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.610 
into the toyota area i can guarantee you
something<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.620> minimalist

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
something a little bit more a minimalist

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.520 
something a little bit more a minimalist
but<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.210> too<00:01:06.570> much<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:07.050> minimal

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
but we can get too much more minimal

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.150 
but we can get too much more minimal
than<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.970> toyota<00:01:09.420> ft<00:01:09.990> EV<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:11.010> is
