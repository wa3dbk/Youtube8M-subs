this is set for the mph 50 or mkh 60 or

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.800 
this is set for the mph 50 or mkh 60 or
MK<00:01:50.200> 70<00:01:50.939> these<00:01:51.939> ones<00:01:52.299> are<00:01:52.570> for<00:01:52.840> like<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.810> octave

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
MK 70 these ones are for like the octave

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.669 
MK 70 these ones are for like the octave
ah<00:01:55.840> or<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.549> NOI<00:01:57.729> minh<00:01:57.999> are<00:01:58.350> sinking<00:01:59.350> or<00:01:59.469> any<00:01:59.590> of

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
ah or the NOI minh are sinking or any of

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.010 
ah or the NOI minh are sinking or any of
the<00:01:59.740> round<00:02:00.009> ones<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.299> want<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.600> kind<00:02:01.719> of<00:02:01.840> go

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
the round ones so you want to kind of go

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.910 
the round ones so you want to kind of go
to<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.319> site<00:02:02.499> but<00:02:02.590> there's<00:02:02.740> only<00:02:02.799> two

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
to the site but there's only two

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.230 
to the site but there's only two
different<00:02:03.280> mounts<00:02:03.490> I've<00:02:03.579> seen<00:02:03.789> is<00:02:03.939> just<00:02:04.090> these

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
different mounts I've seen is just these

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.419 
different mounts I've seen is just these
ones<00:02:04.420> here<00:02:04.840> at<00:02:05.619> least<00:02:05.829> stretched<00:02:06.009> pretty<00:02:06.130> far

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
ones here at least stretched pretty far

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.070 
ones here at least stretched pretty far
so<00:02:06.609> you<00:02:06.640> go<00:02:06.759> from<00:02:06.939> 25<00:02:07.270> millimeter<00:02:07.689> 20

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
so you go from 25 millimeter 20

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.650 
so you go from 25 millimeter 20
millimeter<00:02:08.470> whatever<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.250> between<00:02:09.550> for<00:02:10.450> that

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
millimeter whatever in between for that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.850 
millimeter whatever in between for that
and<00:02:10.990> they

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
and they

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.610 
and they
to<00:02:12.250> here<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:13.960> do<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.440> there's<00:02:14.590> a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to here and so what you do is there's a

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.230 
to here and so what you do is there's a
little<00:02:14.710> tiny<00:02:14.920> screw<00:02:15.310> thing<00:02:15.790> here<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.090> kind

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
little tiny screw thing here it's kind

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.730 
little tiny screw thing here it's kind
of<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> hexagonal<00:02:16.930> kind<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> hex<00:02:17.500> key

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
of like a hexagonal kind like a hex key

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.040 
of like a hexagonal kind like a hex key
you<00:02:17.920> probably<00:02:18.280> use<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.790> hex<00:02:19.300> key<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.570> do<00:02:19.840> this

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
you probably use a hex key to do this

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.510 
you probably use a hex key to do this
but<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.350> very<00:02:20.380> small<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.160> need<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.370> find

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
but it's very small so you need to find

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.430 
but it's very small so you need to find
the<00:02:21.610> right<00:02:21.760> size<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.020> probably<00:02:23.170> look<00:02:23.320> it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
the right size you can probably look it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.170 
the right size you can probably look it
up<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.650> Google<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.280> you'll<00:02:24.730> find<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> right

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
up on Google and you'll find the right

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.370 
up on Google and you'll find the right
size<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.630> what<00:02:25.720> these<00:02:25.870> screws<00:02:26.110> are<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.290> don't

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
size of what these screws are I don't

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.690 
size of what these screws are I don't
know<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:26.680> happen<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.070> this<00:02:27.370> tool

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
know I just happen to have this tool

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.890 
know I just happen to have this tool

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.940 
the trick I do is because when you put
them<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.530> slide<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.130> here<00:03:45.489> I

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
them in and you slide this in here I

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.380 
them in and you slide this in here I
like<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> microphone<00:03:48.700> right<00:03:48.970> here

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.630 
the end of the mic right at the edge of
this<00:03:51.850> so<00:03:52.840> all<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.140> did<00:03:53.560> was<00:03:53.830> put<00:03:54.100> them<00:03:54.160> at<00:03:54.310> this

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640
