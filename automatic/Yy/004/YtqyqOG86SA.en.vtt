the problem, sport?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.468
BOBBY: It was a monster.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:55.928
A big green monster
with lots of arms.

00:00:55.928 --> 00:01:00.356
It was the same one
I saw before.

DAD: Bobby, we've talked
about this before.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.730
There's no such thing
as monsters.

BOBBY: No daddy, it's true.

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:11.406

says it's going to get me.

to happen.

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:22.580
Your mom and I are just
downstairs, and we're not

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.470

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.670
You're a big boy now.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.620
You need to stop being
afraid of the dark.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.010
Monsters don't appear just
because the light goes out.

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:37.390
Goodnight son.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.040
