moves just like that flash topper is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.490 
moves just like that flash topper is
amazingly<00:00:59.640> useful<00:01:00.000> even<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:00.840> its<00:01:01.050> name<00:01:01.290> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
amazingly useful even if its name is

amazingly useful even if its name is
kind<00:01:01.740> of<00:01:01.860> stupid<00:01:02.100> seeing<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.820> already<00:01:03.150> had

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
kind of stupid seeing as we already had

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.350 
kind of stupid seeing as we already had
a<00:01:03.390> flash<00:01:03.930> man<00:01:04.140> who<00:01:04.380> had<00:01:04.700> time<00:01:05.700> stopper<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.300> a

a flash man who had time stopper as a
weapon<00:01:06.680> anyway<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.490> too<00:01:08.759> useful<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.300> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
weapon anyway it's not too useful in the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
weapon anyway it's not too useful in the
next<00:01:09.660> part<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.170> yeah<00:01:10.440> enemy<00:01:10.770> gauntlets

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

and<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.550> Mets<00:01:11.729> simply<00:01:12.210> aren't<00:01:12.450> vulnerable<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and the Mets simply aren't vulnerable to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
and the Mets simply aren't vulnerable to
eat<00:01:13.440> while<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.820> their<00:01:15.090> heart<00:01:15.300> head<00:01:15.479> form

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
almost meant this life is quite the trap

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.499 
almost meant this life is quite the trap
because<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.800> have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.759> edge<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.149> what<00:01:39.300> like

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
because you have to edge for what like

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
jump it's deceptively it seems

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
jump it's deceptively it seems
deceptively<00:01:45.479> simple<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.649> very

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
deceptively simple but really it's very

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.070 
deceptively simple but really it's very
easy<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> bonk<00:01:47.940> your<00:01:48.090> head<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.420> fall<00:01:48.690> into<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.919 
way purely psychological spikes on top I
could<00:01:56.610> also<00:01:56.729> use<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:57.270> missile<00:01:57.660> on<00:01:57.780> those

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
could also use that missile on those

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.169 
could also use that missile on those
guys<00:01:58.170> we've<00:01:58.470> seen<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.800> work<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:59.340> well<00:01:59.369> but

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
guys we've seen it work quite well but

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.760 
guys we've seen it work quite well but
considering<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> dive<00:02:01.110> missile<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> the

considering the dive missile is the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.320 
considering the dive missile is the
weakness<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.340> boss<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.759> might<00:02:02.970> want<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
weakness of the boss you might want to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.760 
weakness of the boss you might want to
