00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:04.770
 Carriers also show rising fuel prices 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.050
 I'm together 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.710
 Truckers across the country 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.129
 I made it a simultaneous action mouth today 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.879
 Demonstrating a demonstration march at a truck carrier in the Kanto area 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.630
 did 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.579
 Hamada 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.399
 Naturally a little worse 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.779
 this is 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.109
 Expressway fare reductions and 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.109
 Placard to sue for a reduction in fuel tax etc. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.360
 Including Tokyo 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.990
 Kanagawa and Saitama etc 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.560
 Truck carrier of 1 prefecture 7 prefectures 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.150
 About hundreds of people marched 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.140
 Oh, I'm in the country 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.110
 I asked for the same measure 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 A light oil that was stable at around 64 yen per liter until 2003 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.580
 the price is 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.540
 Rising equal 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.989
 In the summer of the night 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.050
 Over 100 yen 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.810
 It has risen sharply from May this year when the provisional tax rate has recovered 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.060
 It rose about 35 yen per liter in these 4 months 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 Edit ks 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.060
 Condition that does not receive driver's salary 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.250
 Became 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.370
 So the other army consul general and Makoto Kobayashi of Nanjing Shisha will play really 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.150
 It is big 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.070
 The pond was not injured 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.930
 The company owns approximately 160 trucks 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.790
 If the price of diesel oil rises by 1 yen, the burden on the annual increase of approximately 600,000 yen will increase 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.890
 about it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.359
 Simple calculation 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.889
 The cost of the private sector increased by about 20 million yen due to the soaring price of these four months 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.889
 Will be 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.760
 In this company 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.910
 Drive recorders across the company as a measure to save fuel costs 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.970
 Installing 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.970
 2 points ahead 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 It is calmed down by one item 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.370
 The time when the idling was stopped is not recorded 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.750
 Driver's awareness to drive for good fuel economy 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.749
 It means that it leads to improvement 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:18.209
 But these efforts can reduce the number of civilians 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.729
 About one million yen 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:24.379
 We can not catch up with the cost burden by soaring dolls very much 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.469
 This is already 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.849
 Peep effort 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:30.929
 Here 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:35.699
 I wonder if it was the situation of the frozen ground that bounced the limit battle 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.189
 It wasn't very much, but I owed it 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 I'm not here 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.599
 I'm in trouble 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.280
 One of the times that the trucking industry calls for government 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.750
 From the cost of the fuel 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.340
 Get this year 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.209
 We are promoting the introduction of fuel surcharges. 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.009
 I think this doll is surcharge 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.939
 Unlike the airline industry, it is difficult to introduce 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:04.909
 there is 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:05.770
 English introduction 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.220
 I made it current 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.119
 I can not hear you even if you are in the west 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.399
 Even if you don't know 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.139
 Work is halved from ahf 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.969
 Surcharge toilet is here 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.760
 Even if my life is 1.7, it won't tell me to hit it 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.370
 It doesn't hold true, who is that? 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.379
 In the industry, this is another way to reduce highway charges 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.819
 Decision 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.929
 I asked for an emergency tax reduction etc. of light oil takeover tax 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.429
 Government urgently prepared for emergency economic measures 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:45.049
 Support measures in the city where insurance burden burden is big including transportation 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.479
 It is a policy to incorporate
