00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
people ever come home exist together I

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.819 
people ever come home exist together I
can<00:00:50.480> see<00:00:50.629> why<00:00:50.780> people<00:00:50.809> would<00:00:51.170> think<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.620> we

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
can see why people would think that we

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.189 
can see why people would think that we
would<00:00:51.949> be<00:00:52.010> total<00:00:52.429> opposites<00:00:53.030> but<00:00:53.210> once<00:00:53.960> we<00:00:54.079> got

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
would be total opposites but once we got

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.049 
would be total opposites but once we got
to<00:00:54.350> know<00:00:54.469> each<00:00:54.500> other<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.949> chemistry<00:00:55.370> was<00:00:55.399> so

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
to know each other the chemistry was so

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.209 
to know each other the chemistry was so
on<00:00:56.390> point<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.870> definitely<00:00:57.199> think<00:00:57.710> Derek<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:58.190> I

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
on point I definitely think Derek and I

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.770 
on point I definitely think Derek and I
make<00:00:58.399> each<00:00:58.519> other<00:00:58.640> better<00:00:58.879> this<00:00:59.329> week<00:00:59.570> we're

dance five six seven eight maybe big

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.040

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
make the arms big big I felt like it was

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.080 
make the arms big big I felt like it was
enough<00:01:15.470> arms<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:15.950> said<00:01:16.130> bigger<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.729> jive

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
enough arms but you said bigger the jive

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.149 
enough arms but you said bigger the jive
is<00:01:17.299> definitely<00:01:18.020> more<00:01:18.229> challenging<00:01:18.860> than<00:01:18.890> I

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
is definitely more challenging than I

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.160 
is definitely more challenging than I
thought<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:19.430> would<00:01:19.579> be<00:01:19.909> I<00:01:20.149> struggle<00:01:20.780> with<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
thought it would be I struggle with the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.319 
thought it would be I struggle with the
character<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.100> dance<00:01:22.369> because<00:01:22.939> it's<00:01:23.149> from

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
character of the dance because it's from

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.030 
character of the dance because it's from
an<00:01:23.420> arrow<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.840> I'm<00:01:23.990> not<00:01:24.320> too<00:01:24.560> familiar<00:01:24.740> with
