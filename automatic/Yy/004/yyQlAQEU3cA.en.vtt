00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
LG's like custom UI on top and let it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.170 
LG's like custom UI on top and let it
take<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> three<00:00:37.680> clock<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.280> 1.5<00:00:38.700> gigahertz

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
take a three clock that 1.5 gigahertz

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.020 
take a three clock that 1.5 gigahertz
now<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> my<00:00:40.739> transformer<00:00:41.190> prime<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
now I think that my transformer prime is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.280 
now I think that my transformer prime is
being<00:00:42.480> clocked<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.020> point<00:00:43.170> three

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
being clocked at one point three

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.459 
being clocked at one point three
gigahertz<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.750> powered

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
gigahertz so this one will be powered

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.600 
gigahertz so this one will be powered
with<00:00:46.710> little<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.309> boost<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> optimus<00:00:49.050> 4x<00:00:49.610> 4x4

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
with little more boost so optimus 4x 4x4

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.709 
with little more boost so optimus 4x 4x4
course<00:00:51.320> last<00:00:52.320> year<00:00:52.440> LG<00:00:52.949> optimus<00:00:53.250> 2x<00:00:53.719> dual-core

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
course last year LG optimus 2x dual-core

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.260 
course last year LG optimus 2x dual-core
to<00:00:55.079> course<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:56.489> simple<00:00:56.789> name<00:00:57.059> then

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to course very very simple name then

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.410 
to course very very simple name then
also<00:00:57.510> HD<00:00:58.289> n<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.859> optimus<00:00:59.250> 4x<00:00:59.280> HD<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
also HD n so optimus 4x HD is because it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.709 
also HD n so optimus 4x HD is because it
comes<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> IPS<00:01:01.320> display<00:01:01.739> 1280<00:01:02.550> x<00:01:02.879> 720<00:01:03.329> p

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I do find any closer pictures I may make

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
I do find any closer pictures I may make
a<00:01:14.280> video<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.630> 16<00:01:16.080> gigabytes

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
a video about as well but 16 gigabytes

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.120 
internal memory and also 4.7 inch screen
milliamps<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.820> 2150<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.380> would

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
milliamps is 2150 so you know it I would

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.120 
milliamps is 2150 so you know it I would
ask<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.060> fun<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> had<00:01:27.780> like

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
ask you would be fun if you had like

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.200 
ask you would be fun if you had like
2,500<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.400> galaxy<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.850> something<00:01:30.119> like

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
2,500 like my galaxy know something like

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.760 
2,500 like my galaxy know something like
that<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.570> course<00:01:30.810> my<00:01:30.840> guys<00:01:31.079> notice<00:01:31.560> bigger

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that but of course my guys notice bigger

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
that but of course my guys notice bigger
screen<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> think<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> battery

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
screen so I think the battery

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940 
screen so I think the battery
performance<00:01:33.450> will<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> same<00:01:34.740> on

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
performance will be kind of the same on

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.249 
performance will be kind of the same on
my<00:01:35.040> guys<00:01:35.220> note<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.210> know<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.570> phone<00:01:36.810> or

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
my guys note and you know this phone or

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.740 
my guys note and you know this phone or
the<00:01:37.619> galaxy<00:01:37.950> s2<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.579> comes<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.360> 1600

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the galaxy s2 that comes with like 1600

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.469 
the galaxy s2 that comes with like 1600
but<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.439> has<00:01:40.619> only<00:01:40.829> 4.3<00:01:41.310> inch<00:01:41.610> screen<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
but it has only 4.3 inch screen but

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300 
but it has only 4.3 inch screen but
they're<00:01:42.840> very<00:01:43.020> exciting<00:01:43.619> about<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.009> device

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
they're very exciting about this device

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
they're very exciting about this device
because<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.850> LG's<00:01:45.180> first<00:01:45.420> quad-core<00:01:45.750> device

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
because it's LG's first quad-core device

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
because it's LG's first quad-core device
and<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.979> fun<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.640> companies

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.700 
is announcing their smartphones not
before<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> week<00:01:50.909> before<00:01:51.119> MVC<00:01:51.869> use

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
before like a week before MVC use

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560
