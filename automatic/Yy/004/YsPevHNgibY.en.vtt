00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 the ram 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.029
 Hey, everyone . 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 well we're back here through 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 abc news channel bringing more news from 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 world to the eyes and today I want to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.490
 collecting the people who are there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.300
 request on the matter 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.960
 complete talking about the new round cb 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.239
 300 that was recently launched in the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 United States, that's it 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.680
 finally the bike was released to us 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.080
 was presenting some images that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.150
 assemblies were snow as really 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.100
 death could be we saw there that 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.559
 really the result was not much 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.290
 different from the crew team 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.159
 moto blast presented on your site 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.019
 official 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.780
 complementing personal information 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.670
 information does not really leak. 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.360
 of what has already been said in the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.820
 previous to the new cb 300 efect 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 brings exactly the same engine and the same 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 platform of the newly launched rounds and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.410
 r 300 r was launched at the end of 2013 in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.430
 China and it basically follows the same 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.770
 configuration of the cbr having a motor of 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.930
 286 cylinders have a rate of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.430
 compression ratio of 10.7 per engine has 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.450
 liquid refrigeration has the exchange of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.830
 six gears behind the hc system and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.729
 Total motor can generate a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.010
 power of 30.4 horsepower to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.040
 8,500 turns and maximum torque is 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.250
 2.7 kilograms-force meter at 7,000 rpm 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 the new cb 300 is about a motorcycle 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.880
 more urban compared to the cbr 300 and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.430
 was lighter four pounds in relation to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.270
 Your brother's tank is somewhat 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.280
 has a capacity of only 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.170
 12.8 liters of fuel 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.980
 the bike will have two versions of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.200
 brakes bearing the version are 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.890
 I think it 's the simple disc brake and the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.569
 abs version in the United States to staff 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.319
 motorcycle was launched as equivalent value 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.450
 to $ 3,999 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.640
 converting into Brazilian currency the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.769
 value will be around 8 thousand and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.970
 eight hundred reais but we know that 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.920
 this is just an illusion 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.959
 on this bike really comes here for the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.379
 the Brazilian market is very likely to 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.430
 it arrives costing around the 16 to 19 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.739
 one thousand reais 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.780
 as well as with the smaller brother 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.849
 cbr 250r 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.220
 I've been going to Brazil for some time. 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:53.260
 and is opening space for the entrance of the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.150
 cbr 300 r together with cb 300 ef 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.980
 So this is personal with regard to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.470
 entrance of this fashion here in Brazil does not 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.599
 we have no confirmation yet the wave 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.510
 did not comment on 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.720
 but I particularly believe that so 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.390
 as the cbr 300 r is about to give 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.739
 market entry it should also come 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.780
 for the Brazilian market 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.239
 we do not yet know whether it will be through 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.040
 import or intend to rue 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.290
 with which it will eventually replace 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.419
 the current cb 300 r already shows a certain 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.180
 fatigue in the market by offering a 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:31.690
 replacement or update leaving 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.840
 thus looking more modern in my 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.060
 personal opinion the entrance of cb 300 efect 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.579
 in the Brazilian market by replacing 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.739
 Current is 300 r would really be a 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.139
 a good move because the 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.120
 current cd 2 and 3 already suffers with many 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.639
 criticism of both failures in the project 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.530
 with respect to defects and problems in the 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.510
 head as well as appearance 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 technology where the bike already leaves 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.769
 much to be desired compared to 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.769
 some competitors 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.690
 then certainly the round re-evaluating 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.750
 by this concept and giving input here 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.849
 in brazil with cb 300 is a great 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.370
 opportunity she has to match 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.099
 or even surpassing most of the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.470
 streets and going out in relation to technology 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.030
 then this bike undoubtedly has a 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.109
 very good configuration 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.819
 This rue made a miracle. 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.250
 and that in the Brazilian market with 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:24.349
 fair price competitive price with 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.909
 sure the ball succeeds here in the 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.909
 Brazilian market 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.379
 personal beauty 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:35.840
 these are the information and my 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.210
 opinions about this recent 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.030
 launch of the round and we wait and 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.750
 I'm in the crowd so the deep bet 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.139
 finally Brazilian to the market 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.930
 with competitive and fair price 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.560
 for the whole Brazilian class in this 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.110
 folks 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.219
 This is it, thank you. 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.580
 everyone's attention 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:57.580
 Thank you, do not forget that joinha. 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 thanks
