00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
go at the hip a checkpoint before all

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
go at the hip a checkpoint before all
your<00:01:00.180> run<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.719> cuz<00:01:00.930> makes<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.620> much

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
easier if you just out of the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.240 
easier if you just out of the
checkpoints<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.449> quicker<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
checkpoints this quicker I like to do it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800 
checkpoints this quicker I like to do it
anyway<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.210> fast<00:01:06.420> place<00:01:06.630> to

of his last videos he doesn't like this
place<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.229> actually<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.670> because<00:01:59.790> he

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
place I actually do just because he

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.130 
place I actually do just because he
doesn't<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.270> them<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> lot

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
doesn't like them because there's a lot

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
doesn't like them because there's a lot
about<00:02:01.399> monsters<00:02:02.399> who<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.610> low<00:02:02.850> drop<00:02:03.119> rates

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
about monsters who have low drop rates

about monsters who have low drop rates
but<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:04.590> also<00:02:04.710> i<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.670> reward<00:02:06.149> for

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
but there's also i think the reward for

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.950 
but there's also i think the reward for
getting

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
getting

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.650 
getting

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
but again more experience is great for

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.120

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you're still going to hit paragon of it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.590 
you're still going to hit paragon of it
faster<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.680> my<00:02:53.130> opinion<00:02:53.370> there's<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.269> number<00:02:54.450> of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
faster in my opinion there's a number of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.870 
faster in my opinion there's a number of
elites<00:02:54.959> actually<00:02:55.530> make<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.800> worth<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.100> next

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
elites actually make it worth it next

loot but for experience i'm going to
empty<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.709> zero<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.519> simply<00:03:56.670> because

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
empty of zero and that's simply because

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.520 
empty of zero and that's simply because
of<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> bonus<00:03:57.540> items<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.019> get<00:03:58.200> out<00:03:58.470> of

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
that drop and it kind of scales up if a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.170 
that drop and it kind of scales up if a
lot<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.680> people<00:04:01.769> don't<00:04:02.100> know<00:04:02.250> about<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.519> the

lot of people don't know about it the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.720 
lot of people don't know about it the
way<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.720> works<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.380> i'm<00:04:04.920> also<00:04:05.220> drops<00:04:05.579> an

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
way it works is if i'm also drops an

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.050 
way it works is if i'm also drops an
item

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
item

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.630 
item
and<00:04:07.180> you're<00:04:07.599> on<00:04:07.720> mp3<00:04:08.700> each<00:04:09.700> MP<00:04:10.209> has<00:04:10.480> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
and you're on mp3 each MP has a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.430 
and you're on mp3 each MP has a
percentage<00:04:12.640> drop<00:04:13.000> bonus<00:04:13.360> item<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:13.690> mp3<00:04:13.989> would

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
percentage drop bonus item so mp3 would

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.250 
percentage drop bonus item so mp3 would
be<00:04:14.560> seventeen<00:04:15.310> percent<00:04:15.459> i<00:04:15.790> believe<00:04:16.139> chance<00:04:17.139> to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
be seventeen percent i believe chance to

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.629 
be seventeen percent i believe chance to
drop<00:04:17.410> low<00:04:17.620> inside<00:04:17.829> them<00:04:17.950> so<00:04:18.070> when<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.220> monster

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
drop low inside them so when a monster

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.069 
drop low inside them so when a monster
drops<00:04:18.880> an<00:04:19.030> item<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.480> have<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.630> seventeen

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
drops an item you have a seventeen

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.200 
drops an item you have a seventeen
percent<00:04:20.350> chance<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.980> drop<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.220> bonus<00:04:21.579> item<00:04:21.820> and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
percent chance to drop a bonus item and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.810 
percent chance to drop a bonus item and
over<00:04:22.480> time<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:24.160> number<00:04:24.190> actually

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
over time this this number actually

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.210 
over time this this number actually
makes<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.240> huge<00:04:25.419> difference<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:25.960> your<00:04:26.050> runs<00:04:26.260> if

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
makes a huge difference in your runs if

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.620 
makes a huge difference in your runs if
you're<00:04:27.340> on<00:04:27.430> MP<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.880> its<00:04:28.120> only<00:04:28.240> eight<00:04:28.480> percent

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you're on MP to its only eight percent

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.780 
you're on MP to its only eight percent
so<00:04:29.260> it<00:04:29.350> was<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.530> huge<00:04:29.830> scale<00:04:30.100> there<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.550> huge

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
so it was a huge scale there is a huge

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.360 
so it was a huge scale there is a huge
difference<00:04:30.970> which<00:04:31.960> is<00:04:32.080> why<00:04:32.260> i<00:04:32.290> go<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.160> the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
difference which is why i go to the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.450 
difference which is why i go to the
harder<00:04:33.669> monitors<00:04:33.970> on<00:04:34.120> me<00:04:34.270> three<00:04:34.510> MP<00:04:35.230> one<00:04:35.590> it's

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
harder monitors on me three MP one it's

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.330 
harder monitors on me three MP one it's
really<00:04:36.880> low<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.389> 2<00:04:37.600> percent<00:04:37.960> i<00:04:38.050> believe<00:04:38.340> MP

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
really low it's 2 percent i believe MP

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.460 
really low it's 2 percent i believe MP
to<00:04:39.820> go<00:04:40.270> right<00:04:40.630> up<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.840> eight<00:04:40.990> if<00:04:41.200> you're<00:04:41.320> going

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470
