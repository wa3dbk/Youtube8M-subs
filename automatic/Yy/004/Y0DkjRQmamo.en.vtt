00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
pave low the chopper gunners will

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.830 
pave low the chopper gunners will
actually<00:01:59.789> take<00:01:59.909> two<00:02:00.119> Stinger<00:02:00.420> missiles<00:02:00.750> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
actually take two Stinger missiles to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.230 
actually take two Stinger missiles to
take<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.590> tougher<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> here

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
take out a little bit tougher so here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.949 
take out a little bit tougher so here
enemy<00:02:03.929> calls<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.350> chopper<00:02:04.679> gunner<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.869> know

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
enemy calls in a chopper gunner you know

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.539 
enemy calls in a chopper gunner you know
i<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.229> i<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.409> gunned<00:02:07.679> down<00:02:07.709> by<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.190> right<00:02:08.429> away

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
i get i get gunned down by it right away

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.440 
i get i get gunned down by it right away
i<00:02:08.970> switch<00:02:09.690> over<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.019> my<00:02:10.500> na<00:02:10.679> aircraft<00:02:11.129> class

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
i switch over to my na aircraft class

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.509 
i switch over to my na aircraft class
and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:13.319> i<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.709> pull<00:02:13.950> up<00:02:13.980> my<00:02:14.129> stinger

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
and then i can just pull up my stinger

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.910 
and then i can just pull up my stinger
fire<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.810> counter<00:02:16.140> measures<00:02:16.440> within<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
fire one the counter measures within the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.910 
fire one the counter measures within the
the<00:02:16.950> aircraft<00:02:17.750> make<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> first<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.380> miss<00:02:19.620> but

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the aircraft make the first one miss but

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.440 
the aircraft make the first one miss but
then<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> second<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.489> will<00:02:20.670> take<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
then the second one will take it out and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.110 
then the second one will take it out and
by<00:02:21.840> taking<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.799> probably<00:02:23.280> save<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:23.880> team

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
by taking it out I probably save my team

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.809 
by taking it out I probably save my team
10<00:02:24.480> deaths<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.890> definitely<00:02:26.370> want<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
10 deaths so definitely want to

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.800 
10 deaths so definitely want to
eliminate<00:02:26.910> those<00:02:27.239> right<00:02:27.450> away<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.630> mean

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
eliminate those right away I mean

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
eliminate those right away I mean

these three and the reason why I don't
is<00:03:09.030> because<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.480> random<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.709> wait

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
is because the random you have to wait

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.309 
is because the random you have to wait
for<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.130> airdrop<00:03:11.639> you<00:03:11.880> have<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.720> drop<00:03:13.170> can

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
for the airdrop you have to the drop can

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.500 
for the airdrop you have to the drop can
kill<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.709> can<00:03:14.340> be<00:03:14.430> stolen<00:03:14.639> it's<00:03:15.030> distracting

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
kill you can be stolen it's distracting

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.789 
kill you can be stolen it's distracting
from<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.690> game<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.230> doesn't<00:03:16.470> add<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.680> your

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
from the game and it doesn't add to your

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.620 
from the game and it doesn't add to your
kill<00:03:16.980> Street<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> lot<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.480> work

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
kill Street so it's like a lot of work

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.900 
kill Street so it's like a lot of work
for<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.870> little<00:03:18.959> bit<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.260> reward<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.519> instead<00:03:20.849> of

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
for a little bit of reward so instead of

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.449 
for a little bit of reward so instead of
you<00:03:21.660> know<00:03:21.690> calling<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.500> air<00:03:22.680> drop<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.220> and

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
you know calling that air drop in and

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.949 
you know calling that air drop in and
when<00:03:23.670> waiting<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.239> make<00:03:24.599> sure<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.840> doesn't

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959
