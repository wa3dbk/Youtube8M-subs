opening and the highest aasa possible so
that<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.620> make<00:01:01.829> images<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.850> areas<00:01:03.300> where<00:01:03.449> it's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that can make images in areas where it's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.090 
that can make images in areas where it's
often<00:01:03.870> difficult<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> human

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
often difficult to see with the human

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
often difficult to see with the human
eye<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:06.180> camera<00:01:06.540> allows<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
eye this camera allows me to do that and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
eye this camera allows me to do that and
you're<00:01:07.680> amazed<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.369> quality<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.850> image<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
you're amazed the quality of image that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.899 
you're amazed the quality of image that
you<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.510> back<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.229> 1d<00:01:10.710> Mark<00:01:10.920> 3<00:01:11.159> one

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you get back from the 1d Mark 3 one

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
you get back from the 1d Mark 3 one
example<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.869> photographing<00:01:13.650> from<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
example is as photographing from a

example is as photographing from a
helicopter<00:01:14.900> after<00:01:15.900> sunset<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
helicopter after sunset it's one of the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.800 
helicopter after sunset it's one of the
most<00:01:17.549> difficult<00:01:17.700> things<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
most difficult things to do the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.080 
most difficult things to do the
helicopter<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.439> vibrating<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:20.100> heavily<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
helicopter is vibrating very heavily so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.670 
helicopter is vibrating very heavily so
you<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> faster<00:01:22.229> shutter<00:01:22.350> speed

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you have to have a faster shutter speed

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.550 
you have to have a faster shutter speed
as<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.689> wide<00:01:24.990> open<00:01:25.020> usually

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
as you can and you're wide open usually

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
as you can and you're wide open usually
at<00:01:25.619> 1.4<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.909> even<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.750> 30th<00:01:28.200> or

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
at 1.4 but even there you're at 30th or

40th of a second at 1,600 aasa and
you're<00:01:32.340> constantly<00:01:32.700> pushing<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> technical

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you're constantly pushing that technical

you're constantly pushing that technical

many<00:02:28.330> frames<00:02:28.600> per<00:02:28.750> second<00:02:29.110> your<00:02:29.200> camera

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
many frames per second your camera

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.440 
many frames per second your camera
shoots<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.890> how<00:02:30.100> big<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.400> buffer<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.880> all

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
shoots that how big the buffer is all

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.910 
shoots that how big the buffer is all
they<00:02:31.690> care<00:02:31.900> about<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.140> whether<00:02:32.560> or<00:02:32.650> not<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
they care about is whether or not you

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.190 
they care about is whether or not you
got<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.280> image<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.850> for<00:02:34.360> me<00:02:34.510> what's<00:02:35.020> most

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
got the image and for me what's most

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.780 
got the image and for me what's most
important<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.890> use<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.220> system<00:02:36.400> that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
important is that I use the system that

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.090 
important is that I use the system that
allows<00:02:37.569> me<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.840> capture<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.470> moment<00:02:38.800> time

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
allows me to capture the moment time

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740 
allows me to capture the moment time
after<00:02:39.640> time<00:02:39.819> after<00:02:40.150> time

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
after time after time

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.540 
after time after time
a<00:02:40.780> camera<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.410> allows<00:02:41.800> me<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.220> make<00:02:42.370> better

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
a camera that allows me to make better

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.800 
a camera that allows me to make better
pictures<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.209> allows<00:02:43.360> me<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.540> push<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
pictures it allows me to push the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.720 
pictures it allows me to push the
envelope<00:02:44.080> but<00:02:44.800> more<00:02:45.010> importantly<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.459> camera

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
envelope but more importantly a camera

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.670 
envelope but more importantly a camera
doesn't<00:02:46.000> fail<00:02:46.300> me<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.810> 1d<00:02:47.200> Series<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
doesn't fail me the 1d Series and the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.500 
doesn't fail me the 1d Series and the
mark<00:02:47.860> three<00:02:48.160> continuously<00:02:48.819> bring<00:02:49.030> back<00:02:49.239> some

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
mark three continuously bring back some

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.210 
mark three continuously bring back some
the<00:02:49.569> most<00:02:49.690> fantastic<00:02:50.230> images<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.830> allow<00:02:51.010> me

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the most fantastic images and allow me

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.680 
the most fantastic images and allow me
to<00:02:51.340> push<00:02:51.549> that<00:02:51.700> envelope<00:02:51.850> further<00:02:52.420> and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
to push that envelope further and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.479 
to push that envelope further and
further<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.350> that's<00:02:53.650> why<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:53.799> use<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:53.950> system<00:02:54.340> it

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
further and that's why I use a system it

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.009 
further and that's why I use a system it
allows<00:02:54.730> me<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.000> bring<00:02:55.120> back<00:02:55.180> images<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.930> are

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
allows me to bring back images that are

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.720 
allows me to bring back images that are
memorable<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.680> what<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.370> really<00:02:57.610> like<00:02:57.700> about

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
memorable and what I really like about

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.340 
memorable and what I really like about
the<00:02:57.970> Canon<00:02:58.269> system<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:58.750> they<00:02:58.900> have<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.170> right

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
the Canon system is they have the right

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.220 
the Canon system is they have the right

now<00:03:10.090> try<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.299> make<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.630> image<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.049> I<00:03:11.110> know<00:03:11.319> is

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
now try to make the image that I know is

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.620 
now try to make the image that I know is
very<00:03:11.920> difficult<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.459> make<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.880> has<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.299> very

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
very difficult to make it has a very

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.050 
very difficult to make it has a very
very<00:03:13.870> small<00:03:14.230> room<00:03:14.560> for<00:03:14.799> error<00:03:14.980> but<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:15.850> can

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
very small room for error but I can

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.210 
very small room for error but I can
depend<00:03:16.359> on<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.450> camera<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.470> mark<00:03:17.709> 3<00:03:17.980> or<00:03:18.130> the

depend on that camera the mark 3 or the

are<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:21.100> help<00:03:21.340> me<00:03:21.489> make<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:22.090> image<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:23.410> I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
are to help me make that image that I

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.520 
are to help me make that image that I
thought<00:03:24.760> was<00:03:24.940> impossible<00:03:25.329> to<00:03:25.660> make<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.260> these

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
thought was impossible to make and these

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.520 
thought was impossible to make and these

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
camera you don't even know it's there

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.830 
camera you don't even know it's there
it's<00:03:45.579> then<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:45.940> way<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.180> your<00:03:46.269> hands<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
it's then in the way of your hands the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's then in the way of your hands the
functionality<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.560> camera<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.790> fact

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
functionality of the camera and in fact

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.640 
functionality of the camera and in fact
you<00:03:49.060> can<00:03:49.150> just<00:03:49.299> leave<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.510> on<00:03:49.600> full<00:03:50.140> time<00:03:50.350> it

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
you can just leave it on full time it

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.020 
you can just leave it on full time it
doesn't<00:03:50.769> really<00:03:50.890> bother<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.430> at<00:03:51.549> all<00:03:51.730> and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
doesn't really bother you at all and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.420 
doesn't really bother you at all and
it's<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.019> much<00:03:53.140> more<00:03:53.410> powerful<00:03:54.010> than<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
it's so much more powerful than the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.699 
it's so much more powerful than the
previous<00:03:54.760> version<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:56.290> gives<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.620> many

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
previous version it gives you so many

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.440 
previous version it gives you so many
different<00:03:56.799> abilities<00:03:57.370> different<00:03:58.090> ways<00:03:58.209> to

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
different abilities different ways to

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.699 
different abilities different ways to
get<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.720> images<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.200> your<00:03:59.350> computer

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
get the images to your computer

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.120 
get the images to your computer
different<00:04:00.100> protocols<00:04:00.810> it's<00:04:01.810> faster<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
different protocols it's faster and the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.640 
different protocols it's faster and the
software<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.150> much<00:04:04.359> better<00:04:04.600> it's<00:04:05.260> very

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
software is so much better it's very

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.920 
software is so much better it's very
very<00:04:05.920> easy<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.280> use<00:04:06.430> right<00:04:07.120> from<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.600> camera

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
very easy to use right from the camera

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.180 
very easy to use right from the camera
you<00:04:08.079> can<00:04:08.230> do<00:04:08.319> everything<00:04:08.560> from<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.889> camera

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
you can do everything from the camera

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.729 
you can do everything from the camera
and<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:10.239> found<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:10.780> incredibly<00:04:11.260> useful<00:04:11.410> it's

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
and I found this incredibly useful it's

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:12.750 
and I found this incredibly useful it's
gonna<00:04:11.829> change<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.130> way<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.340> do<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:12.549> lot<00:04:12.730> of

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
gonna change the way I do a lot of

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.789 
gonna change the way I do a lot of
things<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.660> this<00:04:13.959> transmitter<00:04:14.440> also<00:04:14.590> is

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
things and this this transmitter also is

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:15.990 
things and this this transmitter also is
powered<00:04:15.069> by<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.220> camera<00:04:15.609> so<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.790> don't<00:04:15.910> have

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
powered by the camera so you don't have

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.509 
powered by the camera so you don't have
to<00:04:16.090> worry<00:04:16.239> about<00:04:16.419> batteries<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.709> it<00:04:18.160> has<00:04:18.489> a

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
to worry about batteries and it has a

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.640 
to worry about batteries and it has a
range<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.970> 150<00:04:19.539> feet<00:04:19.720> which<00:04:20.200> is<00:04:20.229> more<00:04:20.560> than

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
range of 150 feet which is more than

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.330 
range of 150 feet which is more than
sufficient<00:04:20.859> for<00:04:21.250> almost<00:04:21.669> any<00:04:21.820> application

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
sufficient for almost any application

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.100 
sufficient for almost any application
you<00:04:22.490> might<00:04:22.639> come<00:04:22.820> up<00:04:22.910> with<00:04:22.940> four<00:04:23.930> remote

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
you might come up with four remote

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.390 
you might come up with four remote
cameras<00:04:24.470> for<00:04:24.620> example<00:04:24.650> if<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.100> want<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.280> use

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
cameras for example if you want to use

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.520 
cameras for example if you want to use
it<00:04:25.520> in<00:04:25.669> conjunction<00:04:25.790> with<00:04:26.150> live<00:04:26.419> view<00:04:26.600> one<00:04:27.440> of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
it in conjunction with live view one of

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.930 
it in conjunction with live view one of
the<00:04:27.590> fantastic<00:04:27.860> features<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.460> mark<00:04:28.639> 3<00:04:28.850> is

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
the fantastic features of the mark 3 is

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.790 
the fantastic features of the mark 3 is
the<00:04:29.060> ability<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.360> use<00:04:29.660> live<00:04:29.960> view<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.470> what

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
the ability to use live view and what

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.689 
the ability to use live view and what
this<00:04:30.949> means<00:04:31.190> is<00:04:31.310> if<00:04:31.430> you're<00:04:31.550> shooting

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
this means is if you're shooting

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.820 
this means is if you're shooting
something<00:04:31.820> like<00:04:32.030> macro<00:04:32.419> photography<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.740> you

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
something like macro photography and you

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.530 
something like macro photography and you
really<00:04:34.010> want<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.250> extremely<00:04:34.699> precise<00:04:35.090> focus

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
really want to extremely precise focus

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.330 
really want to extremely precise focus
go<00:04:35.900> ahead<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:36.260> use<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.530> camera<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.949> its<00:04:37.070> full

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
go ahead and use the camera to its full

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.719 
go ahead and use the camera to its full
potential<00:04:38.680> let's<00:04:39.680> go<00:04:39.830> ahead<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.100> open<00:04:40.280> up<00:04:40.610> the

potential let's go ahead and open up the
live<00:04:40.880> view<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.030> you're<00:04:41.210> seeing<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.540> live<00:04:41.780> image

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
live view and you're seeing a live image

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.170 
live view and you're seeing a live image
that's<00:04:42.770> being<00:04:42.979> captured<00:04:43.220> for<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.610> lens<00:04:43.820> and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
that's being captured for the lens and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.990 
that's being captured for the lens and
what<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:44.990> can<00:04:45.139> do<00:04:45.290> of<00:04:45.440> course<00:04:45.470> is<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:46.850> can

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
what you can do of course is you can

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.060 
what you can do of course is you can
compose<00:04:47.300> differently<00:04:47.810> see<00:04:48.590> as<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.770> move<00:04:48.919> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
compose differently see as I move the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.450 
compose differently see as I move the
camera<00:04:50.169> obviously<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.290> can<00:04:51.440> focus<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.280> see

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
camera obviously you can focus and see

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.650 
camera obviously you can focus and see
the<00:04:52.550> effect<00:04:52.880> immediately

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
the effect immediately

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.950 
the effect immediately
and<00:04:53.780> then<00:04:54.710> even<00:04:55.700> better<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.630> ability<00:04:56.810> to

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
and then even better is the ability to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.520 
and then even better is the ability to
zoom<00:04:57.110> in<00:04:57.490> 10<00:04:58.490> times<00:04:58.729> power<00:04:59.350> and<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.440> can

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
zoom in 10 times power and you can

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.500 
zoom in 10 times power and you can
actually<00:05:00.620> move<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.040> set<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.729> area<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.360> it's

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
actually move the set the area that it's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.740 
actually move the set the area that it's
sampling<00:05:03.130> anywhere<00:05:04.130> on<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.340> chip<00:05:04.610> so<00:05:05.540> you<00:05:05.630> can

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
sampling anywhere on the chip so you can

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.560 
sampling anywhere on the chip so you can
see<00:05:05.900> an<00:05:05.960> incredible<00:05:06.440> level<00:05:06.560> of<00:05:06.740> detail<00:05:07.100> and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
see an incredible level of detail and

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.950 
see an incredible level of detail and
focus<00:05:08.570> just<00:05:09.370> an<00:05:10.370> insane<00:05:11.000> level<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.600> detail

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
focus just an insane level of detail

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.960 
focus just an insane level of detail
that<00:05:12.229> I<00:05:13.040> don't<00:05:13.190> think<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.460> possible<00:05:13.789> with<00:05:13.910> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
that I don't think is possible with the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.600 
that I don't think is possible with the
human<00:05:14.180> eye<00:05:14.860> one<00:05:15.860> of<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.010> best<00:05:16.160> benefits<00:05:16.310> of

human eye one of the best benefits of

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.279 
human eye one of the best benefits of
