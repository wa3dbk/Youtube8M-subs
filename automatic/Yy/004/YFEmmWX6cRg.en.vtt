00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
200 200 watt amp the first two channels

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.259 
200 200 watt amp the first two channels
are<00:00:54.500> basically<00:00:54.949> voiced<00:00:55.250> like<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.730> amp<00:00:56.000> where

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
are basically voiced like that amp where

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.960 
are basically voiced like that amp where
it<00:00:56.360> gets<00:00:56.480> special<00:00:56.900> is<00:00:57.320> there's<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.190> fire<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:58.879> a

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
it gets special is there's a fire and a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.720 
it gets special is there's a fire and a
fury<00:00:59.360> channel<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.860> fire<00:01:01.070> channel<00:01:01.580> is

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
fury channel and the fire channel is

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.850 
fury channel and the fire channel is
often<00:01:02.030> when<00:01:02.150> he<00:01:02.269> uses<00:01:02.449> on<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.930> Aussie<00:01:03.320> set<00:01:03.620> and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
often when he uses on the Aussie set and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.340 
often when he uses on the Aussie set and
then<00:01:04.850> we<00:01:05.030> have<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.269> fury<00:01:05.570> channel<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.170> those

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
then we have the fury channel and those

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.710 
then we have the fury channel and those
circuits<00:01:07.040> are<00:01:07.190> kind<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.790> little<00:01:08.270> bit<00:01:08.450> of<00:01:08.480> a

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
circuits are kind of a little bit of a

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.380 
circuits are kind of a little bit of a
take<00:01:09.230> off<00:01:09.440> of<00:01:09.470> his<00:01:09.740> signature<00:01:10.250> pedal<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.240> they

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
take off of his signature pedal so they

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.690 
take off of his signature pedal so they
get<00:01:11.540> extremely<00:01:12.230> high<00:01:12.560> gain<00:01:12.860> more<00:01:13.159> high<00:01:13.400> gain

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
get extremely high gain more high gain

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.930 
get extremely high gain more high gain
than<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:15.080> other<00:01:15.200> production<00:01:15.770> model<00:01:16.100> you

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
than the the other production model you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.760 
than the the other production model you
wanna<00:01:17.090> show<00:01:17.840> us<00:01:17.990> some<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.440> different

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
wanna show us some of the different

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.170 
wanna show us some of the different
sounds<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.100> can<00:01:19.220> get<00:01:19.370> out<00:01:19.490> yeah<00:01:19.760> so<00:01:19.970> here's
