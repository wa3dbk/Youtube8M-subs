00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.610
 In this tutorial I'll show you the one 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.770
 this beautiful paper plane 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.939
 tinkering even lights up in the end 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.800
 many tried this one here 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.500
 of course that is super easy 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 but does not float so well the duty 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.849
 Somehow I'm after ten 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.200
 minutes patience lost and yes how 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.790
 You see I have a few planes 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.329
 tested and this one is definitely the one 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.090
 best 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 it is a so-called like them 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.340
 does not shoot through the air but 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.540
 exactly 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.280
 yes i take it yellow paper knows it 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:55.989
 boring and kink the whole of this 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:02.980
 corner on the halve 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:07.050
 the paper all over again on the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.050
 open the other side 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:18.160
 nor can anyone follow me because of that 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:24.210
 It's totally easy for me to have that 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.210
 fold two dots on these 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.170
 5 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.010
 now it gets a bit tricky that 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.010
 leaf around and lead the and the point 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:55.399
 then forms here are funnels 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:57.500
 then press the down triangle now 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.130
 namely this point and fold it up 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.299
 the summit 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.509
 I do the same with the other one 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:26.720
 already be careful that the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:28.489
 whole clean and symmetrical is now 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.860
 does that happen to some of you? 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.209
 probably click back several times 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.830
 It's a bit complicated, though 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.200
 I hope to do that very slowly 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.200
 here is the one of these mediocre stripes 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:57.620
 i open this all repeat this 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.620
 step in this direction and 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 quietly firm press the paper at this 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:14.689
 I mark the box I have open 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.760
 here these folds are formed 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.510
 they are for orientation because of me 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:28.329
 here with the finger technique and that 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:31.819
 whole little cross would still be 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.389
 I would put the whole thing together and push 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.389
 that then here 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.500
 With 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.000
 I hope you can follow me 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.000
 quickly press firmly 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:56.070
 now that was also the heaviest partie 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:00.240
 and so we have masters with me 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:09.530
 the two heads nod the rear part 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:13.680
 just to take care of that now 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:18.470
 Tail fin that simply fold up 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.470
 and orient ourselves on this line here 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.099
 Not 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.000
 halve this strip 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:41.539
 or I was standing half a day 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 the back here approximate thumb 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.160
 place and tears the whole one to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.120
 help 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.120
 to click 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.160
 is 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.490
 the whole 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.490
 the middle once folded 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.639
 then here at these crossings part 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.639
 orientate and bend over again 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.400
 other side 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.430
 if you want you can go for the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.430
 now buoyed up 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.570
 push this so-called rear wing 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.570
 I'm just Iran 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:03.120
 and that keeps the craft 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.090
 Luminous paint on the outside of the bastelladen 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.350
 I'll do it all now 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.590
 You have to pay attention to it 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.020
 not too fat because otherwise he flies 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.670
 no more 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.670
 not for the moment 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.770
 for those who are not the whole day 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.930
 time have also goes much 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:38.440
 faster you can see the leaf in the 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.620
 in the middle then fold a triangle on the right 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.550
 form 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.550
 that's right on the left side 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.590
 because here 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.830
 the whole again your side 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.040
 I would like to have the high here 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.810
 again restrained with it one must 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.810
 make her look pretty 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:27.510
 very simple fast number the good 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.510
 is 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:36.880
 he does not just look like a torpedo 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:39.270
 he flies aim is the window she will 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.270
 to meet
