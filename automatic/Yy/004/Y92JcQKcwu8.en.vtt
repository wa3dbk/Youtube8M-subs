you want to do is spawn into a game on

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.830 
you want to do is spawn into a game on
plaza<00:00:22.439> any<00:00:22.949> game<00:00:23.369> mode<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.689> want

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
to use a submachine rifle because that

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.169 
to use a submachine rifle because that
is<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> best<00:00:27.570> accuracy<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.310> trick<00:00:29.609> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
is the best accuracy for this trick so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.370 
is the best accuracy for this trick so
what<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.599> guys<00:00:30.660> want<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> come<00:00:31.349> down

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
what you guys want to do is come down

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.430 
what you guys want to do is come down
very<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:32.279> slowly<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.780> basketball<00:00:34.200> court

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
very very slowly to the basketball court

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.889 
very very slowly to the basketball court
now<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.120> possible<00:00:36.540> court<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
now you see that this possible court is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
now you see that this possible court is
confirmed<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.559> black<00:00:37.739> ops<00:00:37.920> 2<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.000> not

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
confirmed in black ops 2 so this is not

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.440 
confirmed in black ops 2 so this is not
a<00:00:39.180> glitch<00:00:39.420> whatsoever<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:40.920> these

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
a glitch whatsoever so you see these

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.049 
a glitch whatsoever so you see these
three<00:00:42.450> balls<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:44.450> dose<00:00:45.829> for<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.520> three<00:00:47.850> balls

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
three balls one dose for so three balls

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.410 
three balls one dose for so three balls
and<00:00:48.860> what<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.010> want<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.789> line<00:00:51.390> up

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and what you want to do is line up

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.500 
and what you want to do is line up
perfectly<00:00:52.129> not<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.610> bit<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> left<00:00:54.000> not

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
perfectly not little bit to the left not

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.549 
perfectly not little bit to the left not
a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.719> bit<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.379> just

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
a little bit to the right but just

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.729 
a little bit to the right but just
perfectly<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:57.120> middle<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.410> what

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
perfectly in the middle and then what

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.810 
perfectly in the middle and then what
you<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> probably<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> most

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you want to do this is probably the most

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.020 
you want to do this is probably the most
important<00:01:00.300> thing<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.020> glitch<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:02.030> you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
want to do this a couple of times for

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.649 
want to do this a couple of times for
practice<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.220> perfectly<00:01:11.610> fine<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.450> then

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
practice that's perfectly fine but then

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.380 
practice that's perfectly fine but then
you<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.549> tiny

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you want to back up just a little tiny

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.630 
you want to back up just a little tiny
tiny<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.830> until<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.580> could<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:19.110> rim<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
tiny bit until you could see the rim of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.340 
tiny bit until you could see the rim of
the<00:01:20.640> basketball<00:01:20.970> court<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.020> basketball

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the basketball court or the basketball

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
the basketball court or the basketball
hoop<00:01:22.530> sorry<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.970> I'm

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
hoop sorry I don't get out that much I'm

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.390 
hoop sorry I don't get out that much I'm
not<00:01:24.360> very<00:01:24.570> athletic<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> do

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
not very athletic so what you want to do

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330 
not very athletic so what you want to do
is<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> move<00:01:27.330> back<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.829> shoot<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
is a move back up and then shoot the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.380 
is a move back up and then shoot the
ball<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.900> then<00:01:31.549> usually<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.850> goes<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.210> there

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
ball and then usually it goes in there

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
ball and then usually it goes in there
but<00:01:33.840> sometimes<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.650> even<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.310> pros

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
but sometimes you know even the pros

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.270 
but sometimes you know even the pros
miss<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:37.110> ball<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.650> usually<00:01:38.130> more

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
miss so this ball is usually more

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.600 
miss so this ball is usually more
consistent<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.140> is

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
consistent so what you want to do is

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.870 
consistent so what you want to do is
line<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.640> perfectly<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:43.460> rip<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> shot

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
line up perfectly and then rip the shot

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.929 
line up perfectly and then rip the shot
and<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.310> might<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.790> went

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and you see that it might have went

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.730 
and you see that it might have went
through<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.299> hoop<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.229> sure<00:01:49.439> I'll<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
through this hoop I'm not sure I'll to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
through this hoop I'm not sure I'll to
go<00:01:49.770> back<00:01:49.860> through<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> replay<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.939> but

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
go back through the replay with this but

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.160 
go back through the replay with this but
um<00:01:51.899> yeah<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.159> third<00:01:53.369> ball<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.170> then

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
um yeah so then the third ball and then

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
um yeah so then the third ball and then
it's<00:01:55.649> actually<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.130> consistent<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's actually the more consistent one so

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
it's actually the more consistent one so
I<00:01:57.299> probably<00:01:57.630> missed<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.560> don't<00:01:58.649> miss
