00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
insoles they told me this was shock

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.370 
insoles they told me this was shock
absorbent<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.980> thought<00:00:26.490> okay<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.269> thought<00:00:27.930> maybe

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
absorbent I thought okay I thought maybe

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.830 
absorbent I thought okay I thought maybe
it's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:29.880> shock<00:00:30.090> absorbers<00:00:30.510> anyway

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's a little bit shock absorbers anyway

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
it's a little bit shock absorbers anyway
i'll<00:00:31.050> show<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> others<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.430> who

i'll show you the others right who

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.090 
i'll show you the others right who
pretend<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.420> shock<00:00:33.660> absorbent<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.320> then

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
pretend to be shock absorbent and then

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.430 
pretend to be shock absorbent and then
i'll<00:00:35.219> show<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:36.180> material<00:00:37.430> after<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
i'll show you this material after that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.190 
i'll show you this material after that
okay<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.930> top-of-the-range<00:00:43.430> gel

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
okay here we have a top-of-the-range gel

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
okay here we have a top-of-the-range gel
insole<00:00:46.250> supposedly<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> best<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
insole supposedly one of the best on the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.490 
insole supposedly one of the best on the
market<00:00:48.829> with<00:00:49.829> all<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> gel<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.500> extra

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
market with all the gel and extra

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
market with all the gel and extra
padding<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> other<00:00:53.370> side<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.480> has

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
padding on the other side and this has

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
padding on the other side and this has
been<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.899> absorb<00:00:55.320> shock<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
been to absorb shock right so it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.200 
been to absorb shock right so it
shouldn't<00:00:56.820> bounce<00:00:57.059> too<00:00:57.390> much<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> i'll<00:00:59.219> show

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
shouldn't bounce too much so i'll show

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
shouldn't bounce too much so i'll show
you<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> first<00:01:00.600> test<00:01:00.960> I'll<00:01:01.500> put<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you the first test I'll put it on the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.090 
you the first test I'll put it on the
ground<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.090> sit<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.420> ground<00:01:04.100> right

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
ground can you sit on the ground right

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
ground can you sit on the ground right
now<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> front<00:01:06.060> part<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.409> how

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
now the front part right this is how

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.039 
now the front part right this is how
high<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> bouncer<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:10.340> yeah<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:12.060> can

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
high a bouncer right yeah the back can

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.330 
high a bouncer right yeah the back can
you<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.530> part<00:01:14.960> right<00:01:16.130> right<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you see the back part right right it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.880 
you see the back part right right it
bounces<00:01:17.850> very<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.540> high<00:01:18.799> here's<00:01:19.799> another

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
bounces very very high here's another

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.130 
bounces very very high here's another
one<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> bit<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> bit<00:01:22.049> cheaper

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
one this is a bit this is a bit cheaper

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
one this is a bit this is a bit cheaper
now<00:01:25.140> basically<00:01:25.619> these<00:01:25.890> guys<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.150> very

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
now basically these guys are not very

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
now basically these guys are not very
they<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.320> absorb<00:01:28.619> shock<00:01:28.979> very<00:01:29.250> much<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.640> all

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
they don't absorb shock very much at all

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.940 
they don't absorb shock very much at all
right<00:01:30.950> all<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.689> okay<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:33.900> here's<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> Nano

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
right all right okay now here's the Nano

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
right all right okay now here's the Nano
stop<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:36.390> freak<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
stop now this will freak you out this is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.240 
stop now this will freak you out this is
amazing<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:38.280> right

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.380 

you<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> I'll<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> again<00:01:44.390> basically

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you see that I'll do it again basically

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
you see that I'll do it again basically
it<00:01:45.660> stops<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:48.000> stops<00:01:48.510> it's<00:01:49.320> about

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it stops the back is stops it's about

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.210 
it stops the back is stops it's about
ninety-eight<00:01:50.610> percent<00:01:52.220> shock-absorbing

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
ninety-eight percent shock-absorbing

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.880 
ninety-eight percent shock-absorbing
yeah<00:01:54.140> which<00:01:55.140> would<00:01:55.320> probably<00:01:55.650> be<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
yeah which would probably be the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.040 
yeah which would probably be the
greatest<00:01:56.220> thing<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.729> feet<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.210> ever<00:01:57.360> known<00:01:57.630> i

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
greatest thing your feet at ever known i

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.940 
greatest thing your feet at ever known i
guess<00:01:59.000> i'll<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.300> again<00:02:00.510> at<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.750> back<00:02:01.700> yeah

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
guess i'll do it again at the back yeah

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.810 
guess i'll do it again at the back yeah
so<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.280> he<00:02:05.670> told<00:02:05.940> me<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.210> basically<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.820> it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
so and he told me that basically the it

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.180 
so and he told me that basically the it
could<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.240> hundred<00:02:09.509> percent<00:02:10.190> shop

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
could be a hundred percent shop

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.550 
could be a hundred percent shop
absorbance<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.570> need<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.959> little<00:02:13.230> bit<00:02:13.500> of

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
absorbance but you need a little bit of

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.550 
absorbance but you need a little bit of
spring<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.400> your<00:02:14.459> step<00:02:14.670> when<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.390> walk<00:02:15.660> i<00:02:16.020> mean

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
spring in your step when you walk i mean

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.130 
spring in your step when you walk i mean
if<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.040> get<00:02:17.190> hold<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.610> these<00:02:17.790> things

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
if you can get hold of these things

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.690 
if you can get hold of these things
there<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.410> again<00:02:20.959> simply<00:02:21.959> amazing<00:02:22.700> yeah
