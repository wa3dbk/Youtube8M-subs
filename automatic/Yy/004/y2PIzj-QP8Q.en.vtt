00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.340
 the sixth series of telephones elji 2014 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.290
 so many models that run up eyes 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.139
 they even have them on several mini-series 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 shared let's watch it starts 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 it's all a matter of the same as last year from two 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.119
 models one of which only with 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.900
 smarttv 631 and the second only with 3d without 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.439
 smart tv 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.660
 620 and accordingly 620 model does not have 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.609
 built-in wi-fi module and because 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.170
 he just does not want and can not be well 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.480
 connect to it on bluetooth all sorts 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.899
 wireless devices like headphones but 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.390
 but she shows 3d and has four 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.480
 pairs of glasses included 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.579
 3d 3d 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 naturally polarized that is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.350
 passive by the way starting with this model and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.020
 higher kiliki support code 2k speech 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 and all 60 and that means what if you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 Download the movie online with a resolution of 2 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.329
 repent in frame per second then this telly 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 he will pull 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 but the truth shows will sail 620 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
 the model exists diagonal at forty two 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.030
 forty seven and 55 inches whereas 31 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.610
 only 42 and 49 have full hd resolution 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.610
 and here is mc and different 500 in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.729
 models 626 models 631 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.600
 they also differ in 620 connectors 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.009
 model this is thrice may 3rd 3rd beating 631 1st 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.170
 and in the battle with dima 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.320
 well, of course they are different 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.960
 further down the list is the so-called 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.570
 mini series 65 imagine two 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.880
 previous models combined into one and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.590
 get a telly and 6 5 series 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.950
 models called 650 652 and 653 between 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.570
 they differ only in design 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.140
 includes the chips of the previous two 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.170
 models 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.520
 connectors like the model 631 and between themselves 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.290
 differ only in design 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 Well, so in what diagonal 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.810
 67 series includes 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.119
 as many as seven models among themselves they 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.310
 traditions differ only in design and 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.710
 those in which diagonal are issued 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.870
 By the way here is the design of the cinema screen 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.110
 have telly name 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:14.930
 super thin frames from the previous series 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.650
 eat from the stove and besides the design first 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.590
 mc increased to 700 I, of course 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.470
 the difference between 500 and 700 is not really see but 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.770
 maybe something is 100 and 700 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.810
 once in the second starting with the 671 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.300
 and above in the set appears magic 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.670
 Remote magic repair which we already 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.220
 told in previous videos as well 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.680
 the sound has changed now the telly is built in 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.340
 subwoofer so the sound is now here 21 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.600
 not bad on this the difference is all 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.520
 end with this really 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.080
 the last two models end 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.940
 that start at 6 680 and 690 between 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.790
 they differ only in design 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.340
 not only on the 67 series models 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.760
 functionally they are no different then 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.670
 there is as you understood from model 671 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.410
 on 690 in model differ only 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.230
 by design 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.540
 let's look at model 690 design 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.940
 cinema screen means thin frames 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 Well, they are really cool thin 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.480
 stand makes the telly as in 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.300
 hanging in the air but what if you really 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.640
 want something in the air that's the case please 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.950
 wall mounted design i like it 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.500
 suitable for any interior and indeed 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.540
 telly just looks cool with 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.500
 magic magic repair console you can 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.970
 enjoy all the charms in wasps and 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.150
 control the TV so that you have 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.600
 comfortable and convenient just in case 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.700
 the second remote also has a lot of technology 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.220
 image enhancement makes movement in 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.040
 The main colors are juicy and bright and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.810
 the picture is compact however brightness 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.780
 contrast and all these things can 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.730
 adjust the 3d polarization ie 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.879
 passive 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.590
 but again this 3d doesn't allow your 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.360
 eyes get tired and this is me the most and 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.610
 like it so if you choose between 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.440
 passive and active 3d I of course 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.830
 always choose passively 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.540
 Sense useful here telly with picture 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.430
 copes fine as in mode 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.440
 normal image and in mode 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.660
 2D to 3D conversion 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.359
 Well, at the end I will tell you about what 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.579
 These TVs are going to Russia but 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.410
 the main part which is called the board 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.740
 management is going to Ukraine in the city 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.080
 really games for the company scored in total 6 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.150
 This year's series is even more extensive, but how 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.639
 usually basically a difference model only 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.760
 in the design, adding a remote and enhancing 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.500
 m7 however this will allow you without special 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.590
 thinking about the difference between models 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.419
 choose a suitable design 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.699
 image on the top five everything else to me 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.970
 also like a post in my opinion 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.830
 generally the best that lg came up with in 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.780
 body like this year on it all with you 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.550
 there was an online store for photos of him and me 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.289
 call maxim subscribe to our channel
