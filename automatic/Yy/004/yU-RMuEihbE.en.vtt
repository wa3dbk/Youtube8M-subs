00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.140 

I<00:00:26.720> wanted<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> play<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.890> something<00:00:29.160> truly

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I wanted to play with something truly

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900 
I wanted to play with something truly
unconventional<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> unusual<00:00:32.129> because<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
unconventional and unusual because it to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.259 
unconventional and unusual because it to
me<00:00:33.030> winter<00:00:33.449> is<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.750> only<00:00:34.019> dark<00:00:34.890> sky<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.850> only

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
me winter is not only dark sky and only

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.209 
me winter is not only dark sky and only
dark<00:00:36.600> vision<00:00:37.110> might<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.860> also<00:00:38.040> very

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
dark vision might be also very

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.410 
dark vision might be also very
optimistic<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> very<00:00:39.590> bright<00:00:40.790> in<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.030> idea

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
optimistic and very bright in the idea

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
optimistic and very bright in the idea
of<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.780> collection<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.379> color<00:00:43.589> and<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
of this collection the color and the the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850 
of this collection the color and the the
use<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.540> color<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:46.379> important

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
use of the color was very important

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
use of the color was very important
because<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.190> wanted<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.730> mention<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.180> mix<00:00:48.540> more

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
because I wanted to mention to mix more

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.439 
because I wanted to mention to mix more
color<00:00:49.260> than<00:00:49.530> possible<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:51.059> unusual

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
color than possible in a very unusual

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.719 
color than possible in a very unusual
way<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.290> said<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.519> very

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
way as I said and in a very

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.850 
way as I said and in a very
sophisticated<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.229> I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
sophisticated way so I think that the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
sophisticated way so I think that the
biggest<00:00:56.070> achievement<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.360> play<00:00:57.600> with

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
biggest achievement was to play with

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
biggest achievement was to play with
different<00:00:57.960> materials<00:00:58.769> which<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.519> only

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
different materials which are not only

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.049 
different materials which are not only
fabrics<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.750> easier<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.170> die<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.280> into

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
fabrics which are easier to die and into

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.150 
fabrics which are easier to die and into
paint<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.719> different<00:01:04.080> colors<00:01:04.410> but<00:01:04.440> also<00:01:04.830> need

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
paint in different colors but also need

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.930 
paint in different colors but also need
special<00:01:05.640> tools<00:01:05.910> like<00:01:06.420> Fox<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:07.289> picanha<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
special tools like Fox as picanha or and

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.570 
special tools like Fox as picanha or and
Mongolia<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.640> goat<00:01:12.080> longer<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.710> again<00:01:14.070> also<00:01:14.310> in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
Mongolia or goat longer or again also in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.300 
Mongolia or goat longer or again also in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the Python so precious skin a completely

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
the Python so precious skin a completely
home<00:01:17.820> paint<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.450> they're<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:19.229> through<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
home paint and they're going through the

home paint and they're going through the
healing<00:01:20.190> with<00:01:20.550> these<00:01:20.670> beautiful<00:01:21.179> flowers

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
healing with these beautiful flowers

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.669 
healing with these beautiful flowers
that<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.789> petals<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:24.240> single<00:01:24.929> petal<00:01:25.200> some

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
that are all petals a single petal some

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:43.670 
that are all petals a single petal some
paint<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.340> shaded<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.479> applied<00:01:27.899> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.520 

craftsmanship<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.850> collection<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:46.260> took

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
craftsmanship in this collection it took

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.500 
craftsmanship in this collection it took
a<00:01:46.560> very<00:01:46.800> important<00:01:47.610> role<00:01:47.760> because<00:01:48.090> this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
a very important role because this

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.330 
a very important role because this
collection<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:49.140> very<00:01:49.230> complicated<00:01:50.010> to<00:01:50.130> put

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
collection was very complicated to put

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.610 
collection was very complicated to put
together<00:01:50.550> because<00:01:51.240> every<00:01:51.630> single<00:01:51.810> visa<00:01:52.230> is<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
together because every single visa is a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.240 
together because every single visa is a
piece<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.980> take<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:54.150> long<00:01:54.690> time<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.920> be

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
piece that take a very long time to be

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.150 
piece that take a very long time to be
realized<00:01:56.910> for<00:01:57.300> example<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:58.020> idea<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.800> doing

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
realized for example the idea of doing

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.490 
realized for example the idea of doing
this<00:01:59.520> case<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.060> flowers<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> painted<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this case with flowers and painted the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.710 
this case with flowers and painted the
petal<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:02.760> another<00:02:02.940> thing<00:02:03.330> that

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
petal so this was another thing that

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.990 
petal so this was another thing that
putting<00:02:04.590> together<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.190> entire<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.730> some

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
putting together the entire and some

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.960 
putting together the entire and some
other<00:02:06.450> things<00:02:07.040> has<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.550> than<00:02:08.790> two

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
other things has the more than two

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:30.660 
other things has the more than two
months

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.080 

I<00:02:30.930> had<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.050> mind<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.560> idea<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.280> diva<00:02:33.700> from

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
I had in mind this idea of the diva from

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.440 
I had in mind this idea of the diva from
Hollywood<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.750> 40s<00:02:35.319> or<00:02:35.590> again<00:02:35.890> our<00:02:36.450> movies

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
Hollywood in the 40s or again our movies

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.620 
Hollywood in the 40s or again our movies
like<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.620> Heysel<00:02:39.130> Laura<00:02:39.370> Marceau<00:02:40.000> pictures

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
like the Heysel Laura Marceau pictures

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.570 
like the Heysel Laura Marceau pictures
from<00:02:40.900> Angelica<00:02:41.500> Houston<00:02:41.980> Bob<00:02:42.160> Richardson

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
from Angelica Houston Bob Richardson

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.380 
from Angelica Houston Bob Richardson
taken<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.480> 70s<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:45.120> overall<00:02:46.120> this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
taken in the 70s and so overall this

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.920 
taken in the 70s and so overall this
idea<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.200> mean<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:47.950> uses<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.730> line<00:02:49.360> silhouettes

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
idea I mean this uses a line silhouettes

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.990 
idea I mean this uses a line silhouettes
for<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.260> cause<00:02:50.530> for<00:02:50.860> example<00:02:51.430> or<00:02:51.640> for<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
for the cause for example or for the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.870 
for the cause for example or for the
white<00:02:52.300> pants<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.500> accessories<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> bags

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
white pants the accessories and the bags

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.460 
white pants the accessories and the bags
especially<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:55.720> collection<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.260> think

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
especially in this collection I think

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.050 
especially in this collection I think
they<00:02:56.590> played<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> very<00:02:57.220> important<00:02:57.940> role

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
they played a very important role

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.440 
they played a very important role
because<00:02:58.450> they<00:02:59.080> defined<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.370> entire<00:03:00.760> look<00:03:01.030> and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
because they defined the entire look and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.360 
because they defined the entire look and
to<00:03:01.630> me<00:03:01.750> was<00:03:01.930> very<00:03:02.170> important<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:02.769> example<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
to me was very important for example to

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.850 
to me was very important for example to
play<00:03:03.489> with<00:03:03.730> two<00:03:03.940> bags<00:03:04.260> because<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> was<00:03:05.560> really

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
play with two bags because I was really

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.430 
play with two bags because I was really
inspired<00:03:06.040> by<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.640> by<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.440> beautiful

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
inspired by that by the beautiful

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.270 
inspired by that by the beautiful
pictures<00:03:09.069> taken<00:03:10.380> from<00:03:11.380> our<00:03:11.650> archive<00:03:12.250> of
