00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 all former leathers of course factory 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.910
 there are always just a few museums 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.710
 make friends modern 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.059
 art in which we are going now 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.780
 couple until the house of the future of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.780
 submission 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.920
 here it is the future here is such a house 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.759
 future as you imagine if 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.730
 everyone lived in such houses inside there is nothing 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 special there was no closet anything 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.270
 this habitual our not to the eye of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.399
 see here these types of chairs dash 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 beds and here are located in a circle 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.850
 a huge number of people are shifting here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 although I personally can not imagine how 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.469
 so many people get along together look 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.780
 how many beds are there a house 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.539
 divided into a sleeping area in the kitchen area 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.539
 toilet area and and he's pretty 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.760
 small and this is a modern museum 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.780
 art here are exhibits 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.430
 which are just sometimes shocked but 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.170
 that's why he and modern art 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.260
 To be honest, I'm not very strong on this. 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.720
 I understand and most of the exhibits as 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.790
 We understood made from some henchmen 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.210
 materials that is there clay or 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.369
 some wives and trees or what will close 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.180
 on these pieces of some kind of plastic 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 incomprehensible 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.119
 or burst balloons just on 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.369
 the paper is glued on he whore in general 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.320
 quite interesting was and of course 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.290
 work that is right here before the goosebumps 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.900
 sneaks but unfortunately such works 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.270
 it was not so much though but again 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.570
 again I am not a connoisseur anyway 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.850
 I regret that we went here and 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.680
 very bright impressions left 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.270
 the exhibition seems to me worth it sometimes 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.240
 visit the museum of modern art 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.550
 to at least be informed 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.410
 but honestly some of my work 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.630
 Veronica, too, the signal could be 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.170
 give back and I think they would use 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 huge demand 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.660
 art teacher but you know better 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.220
 than i thought i thought it would absolutely be nonsense 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:37.480
 but there are exhibits that stain i 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.709
 not a connoisseur of course among here I will not fly 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.910
 it means it's cool and swing to believe 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.830
 the next place we visited 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.560
 this is a toy museum here are toys 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.069
 distributed over the years the camera there 30 years 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.200
 forties 50-60 and so on for every 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.030
 10 years has a separate stand 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.370
 it's very interesting because I 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.549
 watched my 90s toys there 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.830
 childhood and also toys there my moms 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.319
 grandmothers and so on basically everything 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.420
 toys is behind the glass to them and 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.160
 the kids didn't hurt but with some 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.319
 toys can be played and children are here 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.870
 spend evenings after school 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.350
 also here there is such a real one 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.069
 town layout with trains that goes 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.860
 on rails 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.810
 with little men who is very well straight 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.390
 very believable I adore such 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.989
 things I was just delighted by this 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.700
 layout I did not move away from him here the museum 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.590
 toys every month are different 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.570
 thematic exhibitions and here's the mind and to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.640
 example was the theme of the circus and we even 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.829
 managed to feel no which circus 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.829
 prop ferry costume. 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.239
 the last place we visited 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.250
 it was something like a natural center 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.840
 although to be honest I did not really understand 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.579
 the purpose of this whole building here 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.680
 huge rooms where you can 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.170
 example here in this look what you can 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.930
 engage in different seasons in this 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.090
 the terrain also has a scarecrow target here 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.579
 different animals and here there is a huge 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.549
 conference rooms here are rooms for 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.070
 Occupation but here for example to see it 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.650
 you this room for classes 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.329
 schoolchildren are told here I donâ€™t know 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.490
 what nature probably introduces them 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.810
 some hiking but overall i can 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.310
 say that a huge huge amount 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.800
 the halls of these ones are occupied well 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.190
 it is not clear what for example there is a sauna 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.500
 and I do not really understand the meaning of the sauna at all 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.810
 in such an institution, although everything is done very much 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.360
 beautiful here absolutely everything is made of 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.520
 wood right up even to the elevator here the system 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.320
 floors and ceilings 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.690
 In general, everything is all everything is furniture 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.900
 all made of natural wood 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.150
 but this is the only natural thing here 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.040
 there is the most vivid impression 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.770
 These here are swans in general there 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.020
 the room is completely black without light 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.880
 just with benches you can go in there 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.440
 listen to the sounds of nature do not know me 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.630
 it seems to the Russian people completely 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.970
 irrational to allocate huge huge 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.430
 hall in order to make it into black 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.740
 a room where you can listen to sounds so 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.410
 it seems to me that this whole place is calculated 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.300
 on Europeans who can come 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.240
 relax listen to the sounds of nature 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.400
 sit in silence in the atmosphere of this 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.580
 this tree go somewhere in 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.090
 hike but generally don't know it seems to me that 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.010
 there is nothing special to do here like this 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.630
 we spent another day in Finland 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.639
 there is still a lot of interesting 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.889
 join my channel put 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.030
 likes and so on thank you all for 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.030
 attention and all the while
