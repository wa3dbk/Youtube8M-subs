00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 Hello. 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
 It is Hariom. 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.040
 today 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.280
 Keema curry. 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.140
 I will teach you the easiest way to make it in Northern India. 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.329
 please look. 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380
 Put salad oil in the pot 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.440
 I will cook until the garlic is colored. Be careful not to burn it. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.760
 Add ginger and onion. Until the onions soften. 

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:35.694
 Stir until the water is gone. 

00:00:35.694 --> 00:00:37.694
 Stir until the water is gone. 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.860
 Put in the spices. 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 Chile, salt, turmeric, paprika. I put it in one go. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.420
 Please mix well. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 I think that you do not need to burn the low heat. 

00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:14.153
 If you mix well, add tomatoes. 

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:23.046
 It is OK to cut tomatoes into large pieces. 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.760
 Mix well. 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.120
 It is the best point to mix well. 

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:56.163
 Where the shape of the tomato is about half gone 

00:01:58.142 --> 00:02:01.422
 Put the minced chicken. 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.620
 Heat the chicken. 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.400
 There are many ways to make it in North India 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.240
 I think it is the easiest and simplest way to make it. It is delicious even with less spice. 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.580
 When the fire comes through, the water is gone. 

00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:26.473
 Where the shape of the tomato is almost gone 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.380
 Put in water. 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's important to boil the water and put it on fire. 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.720
 In addition, I will introduce how to make this curry delicious. 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.620
 Cumin seeds and coriander seeds. 

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.208
 The coriander seeds are the source of pakuchi. 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.100
 Both are a very sweet and sweet spice. Cumin is kind to the stomach. 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.940
 Warm in a frying pan. 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.460
 The most important point is not to burn too much. 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.720
 I think it is better to do it on low heat. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:04.000
 Heat until aroma comes out. 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:31.460
 Use a cutting board and a rolling pin to make it finely. 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:41.080
 Spices may splash, but don't worry. 

00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:52.141
 Please be as detailed as possible. 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.840
 That smell is better. 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.600
 I put this spice in curry. 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:45.160
 When I put in a spice, I get a very good smell. 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.660
 It will be done when the fire passes. 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.100
 This is the easiest way to make it. 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:25.140
 If it is good, please make it at home.
