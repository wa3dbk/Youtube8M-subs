needed to get this off this uses

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.740 
needed to get this off this uses
Phillips<00:02:36.569> screws<00:02:37.640> instead<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.819> like<00:02:39.360> regular

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750

impact driver there we go you know about
this<00:02:50.010> Mac<00:02:50.430> 60<00:02:51.150> bucks<00:02:52.100> we<00:02:53.100> borrowed<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.610> at

this Mac 60 bucks we borrowed it at
first<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.600> thought<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.840> spun<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> bearing<00:02:55.319> but

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040
