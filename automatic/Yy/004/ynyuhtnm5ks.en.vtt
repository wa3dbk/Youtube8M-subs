00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
then when it comes down to it there's a

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.450 
then when it comes down to it there's a
high<00:00:30.910> chance<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:31.329> won't<00:00:31.570> actually<00:00:31.689> go<00:00:32.339> you<00:00:33.339> know

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
high chance I won't actually go you know

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.770 
high chance I won't actually go you know
it's<00:00:33.820> hard<00:00:34.059> when<00:00:34.120> you<00:00:34.300> have<00:00:34.330> a<00:00:34.449> friend<00:00:34.690> that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
it's hard when you have a friend that

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.060 
it's hard when you have a friend that
gets<00:00:35.019> annoyed<00:00:35.290> when<00:00:35.320> you<00:00:35.559> don't<00:00:35.769> turn<00:00:36.010> off

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
gets annoyed when you don't turn off

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.780

things
then<00:00:37.660> this<00:00:37.839> it's<00:00:38.290> hard<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.710> get<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.920> balance

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
then this it's hard to get the balance

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.040 
then this it's hard to get the balance
because<00:00:39.430> then<00:00:39.940> you're<00:00:40.120> torn<00:00:40.360> between<00:00:40.690> goings

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
because then you're torn between goings

the rate of which the game is growing
our<00:05:05.900> part<00:05:06.139> control<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:07.010> been<00:05:07.190> so

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
our part control and it's been so

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.300 
our part control and it's been so
different<00:05:08.150> leading<00:05:08.690> up<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.840> this<00:05:09.310> but

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
different leading up to this but

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.980 
different leading up to this but
