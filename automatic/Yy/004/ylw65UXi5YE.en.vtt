00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 but love people genie von hergÃ© photogenic 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 I am and I want to be today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.950
 Although you do not cook something tells you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.400
 about fish sauce you might have 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.020
 someday on TV any one 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 seen and then everyone was 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.019
 namely spectator times under the fish 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 held and everyone says fey 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.340
 but asia is, so to speak, the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 Fish sauce is a very important part 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.090
 from the whole meal 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.450
 I have a porch with fish 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.020
 pants and these violations as I said 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.510
 simply a must in the asian kitchen 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.680
 especially thailand myanmar laos vietnam 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.800
 and I have the swear on it 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.050
 This fish sauce violates is namely 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.320
 a production from actually 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.270
 inferior fish species and that is it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.120
 Most of such fishing in the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 Past has the fisherman's bun 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.900
 you were not so small yet 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 go far to the sea so they have now 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.909
 they have been fighting a coast and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 because the fish were the whole 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.420
 small fish were only one coast 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.299
 there and have of course to have so 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.170
 dick caught after they caught that 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.200
 have of course brought the ashore and 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.909
 on land it is then left in such 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.790
 big bucket it is then done in and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 about 100 kilos of fish 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.049
 about 35 40 kilos of salt was done so 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.680
 It already became clear how big that was 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 Ratio is fish and salt on everyone 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.530
 case is not there for two years in the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.479
 I have sun and three times a week 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.220
 because my lid up and that should be there 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.220
 purely 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.920
 we look and my fermentation process we 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.360
 thereby, so to speak, supported by the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.490
 heat from the sun after about that 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.350
 Two years and will be the first 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.140
 squeeze and the first squeeze 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.410
 from this sentence and fish that becomes 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.140
 mostly not sold but the second 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.630
 and third that is sold and should 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.940
 the third places for example 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.710
 do not have the quality 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.620
 then something comes from the first 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.959
 what will it be then 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 then sold as loose but so to speak 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.700
 before he gets to the market he becomes 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.370
 of course cleaned first and 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.680
 is then pasteurized and is for me 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.820
 it's actually more of a fish then 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.780
 use replacement 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.200
 but as said the asians in the corner 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.170
 she hears that without this offense 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.840
 so to speak the food does not taste 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.680
 Of course, a hint of fishy smell 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.810
 it is there are many brands that hold 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.350
 is offered in the different 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.600
 asia stores in the world and one of the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.310
 many brands knows that white here 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.190
 what I have right here in my hand 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.230
 and that is this 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.140
 squid brand please if you are 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.019
 Run through an asia store and you 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.140
 do not want to buy fischer social since 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.269
 unsettled that the white wise one 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.880
 squid sauce is but that is 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.160
 bump but it is simply the brand of 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.450
 this company so that simply have a 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.900
 Cuttlefish taken as a brand 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.060
 For me personally, this brand is one 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.959
 very nice brand because the other 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.360
 makes an empty cash register something stronger and that 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.180
 comes some who have high 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.700
 strength in the aroma of fortune 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.150
 something less strong in the European and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.530
 this way a very likeable corner 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.540
 it is the aroma that affects the flavors 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.470
 I'll say this about the facility 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.060
 so after 15 50 kilometer run then have 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.580
 I have done my shoes in the locker 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.019
 this one's just five kilometers 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.870
 run in other words it is 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.750
 bearable and you can just stop 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.519
 to say that they like ours 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.360
 corner so here in Germany so 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.579
 use 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.150
 As I said, it actually is for me 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.040
 more a set if your at home 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.950
 namely want to buy 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.860
 it was similarly cold that it was 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.070
 so much salt the race is so 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.430
 as I said on 100 kilos fish is one 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.139
 htm 35 to 40 kilo sat on it so 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.050
 my salt is more or less mine 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.750
 guarantee that it is ok and good 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.639
 Of course, this amount is still for 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.260
 not every day as yes this 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.289
 cook a little too big there is 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.789
 smaller areas here and then 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.370
 there is a bottle left 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.039
 between these two is and how 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.590
 actually not worried that it is 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.569
 my sweetheart will be bad in it 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.559
 already for it 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:03.809
 it is eternally durable and maybe can 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.969
 that's another facial massage 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.619
 use or so I do not have it yet 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.740
 but tried maybe can you 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:13.169
 Let's see each other when we do 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.709
 Buy it sometime and on 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.709
 bye bye
