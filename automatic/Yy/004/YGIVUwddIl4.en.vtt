00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.860
 now let's take this combination 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.840
 we get up a little further from the pion so 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.930
 way to move forward to it 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.990
 take a step right at this time left 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.229
 the handle goes up the body take a step 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.460
 the left and right handle connects further 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.550
 we put the right leg and the left leg at us 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.160
 leans to the side and make a move 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.410
 in such a way that opens a little 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.619
 upward diagonally lean back 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:56.360
 slightly back and through the deflection 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:02.410
 we'll open back do two 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:06.910
 the waves from here move back and forth 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:11.140
 right foot forward on dad we 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:15.280
 throw back in the head back 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.209
 pass move on the right foot 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.600
 we throw back the body as if 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.730
 close slightly forward and hips too 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.190
 further back again head and hips and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 again forward as if we are closing 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.290
 once again turned back to the right foot 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:38.269
 sales spinning on the right foot left 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.959
 straight and put the handle up from here both 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.720
 legs on a piece of bend in the right 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.900
 be dropping back from here sharp 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.000
 movement of the hips and legs open 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.829
 forward two legs and hips up 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.640
 from here two waves up or down two 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.860
 and go down the speakers close 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.590
 farther 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.870
 right leg on the pylon left leg 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.480
 opens on itself and clears up 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.190
 from here we close the legs to the pole 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.500
 in this way more about Vovochka 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.660
 up left in a low pore raise ourselves 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.750
 get up on the right shoulder and on the left ear 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:32.460
 from here the grip of the legs opens from here 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:38.160
 wave kicked four feet and 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:44.760
 descends the thigh down gently lowered 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.760
 raise the head right leg forward 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.220
 pulled up legs and climb up 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.239
 let's talk separately about small stands 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.100
 make this stand very neat and 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.160
 necessarily with preparation it is better that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.870
 you are safe when you do this 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.650
 the rack for the first time and so when we are with you 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.739
 move the head 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.920
 get up in your ear we're standing on the floor 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.820
 here on this part that is from ear to 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.890
 shoulder 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.769
 we try to make a straight line and 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.660
 we put it on the floor also we are very good 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.060
 do it by doing this 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.430
 smooth stand to 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.110
 train and and for starters you can not 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.990
 take your feet off the wing for that is 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.330
 keep the candle on 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.220
 when you entrenched a candle you can 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.470
 already stand up and quietly 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.470
 open one foot when you feel 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.020
 that you stand well you can open two 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.450
 legs and keep your legs open 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.670
 slightly ahead and the tass was turned around then 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:05:19.930
