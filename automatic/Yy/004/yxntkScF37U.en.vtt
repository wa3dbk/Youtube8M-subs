innovative<00:00:17.630> tool<00:00:18.110> by<00:00:18.290> Dewalt<00:00:18.680> it's<00:00:19.310> a

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
innovative tool by Dewalt it's a

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.070 
innovative tool by Dewalt it's a
screwdriver<00:00:19.730> it's<00:00:20.210> an<00:00:20.270> 8<00:00:20.360> volt<00:00:20.570> screwdriver

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
screwdriver it's an 8 volt screwdriver

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.109 
screwdriver it's an 8 volt screwdriver
the<00:00:21.830> cool<00:00:22.220> thing<00:00:22.460> about<00:00:22.520> this<00:00:22.849> and<00:00:23.000> what

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
the cool thing about this and what

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.120 
the cool thing about this and what
separates<00:00:23.570> it<00:00:23.779> from<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:24.050> competition<00:00:24.740> is<00:00:24.920> it

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
separates it from the competition is it

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.999 
separates it from the competition is it
works<00:00:25.369> off<00:00:25.580> a<00:00:25.610> gyroscopic<00:00:26.450> technology<00:00:27.410> what

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
works off a gyroscopic technology what

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.460 
works off a gyroscopic technology what
that<00:00:28.189> means<00:00:28.430> is<00:00:28.700> they're<00:00:28.939> a<00:00:28.970> gyroscopic<00:00:29.660> gyros

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
that means is they're a gyroscopic gyros

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.799 
that means is they're a gyroscopic gyros

little<00:00:59.990> bummed<00:01:00.260> out<00:01:00.410> about<00:01:00.470> that<00:01:00.800> I<00:01:00.860> would

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
little bummed out about that I would

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.340 
little bummed out about that I would
think<00:01:01.250> with<00:01:01.460> all<00:01:01.700> this<00:01:02.180> technology<00:01:02.480> Dewalt

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
think with all this technology Dewalt

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.079 
think with all this technology Dewalt
would<00:01:03.530> come<00:01:03.710> out<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.280> make<00:01:04.579> this<00:01:04.790> little

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
would come out and and make this little

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.450 
would come out and and make this little
battery<00:01:05.269> charge<00:01:05.720> in<00:01:05.869> 15<00:01:06.290> or<00:01:06.439> 20<00:01:06.710> minutes<00:01:06.890> what

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
battery charge in 15 or 20 minutes what

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.760 
battery charge in 15 or 20 minutes what
would<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:07.670> be<00:01:07.880> great<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:08.810> look<00:01:09.259> kind<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.680> an

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
would that be great so look kind of an

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.770 
would that be great so look kind of an
itchy<00:01:09.950> tool<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.579> see

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
itchy tool I see

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.600 
itchy tool I see

bit<00:01:25.280> Michie<00:01:25.540> really<00:01:26.540> innovative<00:01:27.020> really<00:01:27.500> fun

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
bit Michie really innovative really fun

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.710 
bit Michie really innovative really fun
technology<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.340> must<00:01:28.580> have<00:01:28.700> been<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:28.940> ball<00:01:29.390> to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
technology it must have been a ball to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.710 
technology it must have been a ball to
work<00:01:29.870> on<00:01:30.049> this<00:01:30.200> project<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.610> weighs<00:01:31.790> 1.1

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
work on this project so it weighs 1.1

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.070 
work on this project so it weighs 1.1
pounds<00:01:33.290> really<00:01:33.979> light<00:01:34.159> weight<00:01:34.510> has<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.540> no<00:01:35.840> load

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
pounds really light weight has a no load

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.560 
pounds really light weight has a no load
speed<00:01:36.409> of<00:01:36.590> 0<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.040> 430<00:01:37.880> rpms

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
speed of 0 to 430 rpms

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.590 
speed of 0 to 430 rpms
it<00:01:39.350> has<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.619> quarter<00:01:40.190> inch<00:01:40.369> metal<00:01:41.030> collet<00:01:41.570> Chuck

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
it has a quarter inch metal collet Chuck

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.770 
it has a quarter inch metal collet Chuck
but<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.140> can<00:01:42.320> actually<00:01:43.090> load<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.299> one-handed

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
but you can actually load it one-handed

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.960 
but you can actually load it one-handed
and<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.290> actually<00:01:45.440> will<00:01:45.680> fit<00:01:45.950> one<00:01:46.340> inch<00:01:46.640> chuck

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
and it actually will fit one inch chuck

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.570 
and it actually will fit one inch chuck
one<00:01:47.450> inch<00:01:47.630> bit<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.110> then<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.710> easily<00:01:48.979> unloads

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
one inch bit and then it easily unloads

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.880 
one inch bit and then it easily unloads
with<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.880> metal<00:01:50.420> collar<00:01:50.659> very<00:01:51.080> simple<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.710> deal

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
with a metal collar very simple to deal

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.410 
with a metal collar very simple to deal
with<00:01:52.100> two<00:01:52.939> LEDs<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.979> fuel<00:01:55.670> gauge<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:56.090> top

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
with two LEDs the fuel gauge on top

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.770 
with two LEDs the fuel gauge on top
actually<00:01:57.700> goes<00:01:58.700> on<00:01:58.970> when<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.240> activate<00:01:59.659> the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
actually goes on when you activate the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.690 
actually goes on when you activate the
trigger<00:01:59.990> now<00:02:00.680> there<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:01.040> trigger<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.430> have

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
trigger now there is a trigger you have

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.399 
trigger now there is a trigger you have
to<00:02:01.820> hold<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.180> trigger<00:02:02.420> down<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.840> activate<00:02:03.290> the

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
to hold the trigger down to activate the

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.410 
to hold the trigger down to activate the
gyro<00:02:03.680> sensors<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.790> when<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.030> hold<00:02:05.299> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
gyro sensors so when you hold the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.260 
gyro sensors so when you hold the
trigger<00:02:05.600> down<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.140> turn<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.189> left

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
trigger down and turn to the left

really<00:02:10.700> interesting<00:02:11.240> two<00:02:12.140> positions<00:02:12.710> on<00:02:13.010> this

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
really interesting two positions on this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.370 
really interesting two positions on this
driver<00:02:13.490> there's<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> 90<00:02:14.510> degree<00:02:14.750> pistol<00:02:15.170> grip

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380

inline<00:02:18.280> driver<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:19.760> two<00:02:19.880> different

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
inline driver so you get two different
