00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.560
 Made on tv 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.470
 People who were the first in volume were revised and lost 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.439
 Yearly 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.319
 Probably chosen 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:20.169
 The Diet did not go the first time 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.200
 The offer 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.140
 Of each team 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.510
 And it was raining but recently it is not possible 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.140
 Recently broken sites no.1 but various sites 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.450
 And fire alarm 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.360
 I want to order and step up further 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030
 I think so 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.310
 We are not really only Koshien but 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.120
 It is natural to protect the data after the story after the eyelids 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.330
 And 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.520
 After all obstacle 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.990
 If Taylor Wimpy says he is a champion 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.350
 Continue to Ozaki 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 As the player has not retired to cake now 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.480
 What a clear paradise clearly 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.660
 It is not now or Ozaki before all means 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.310
 I want you to escape the pack game 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.440
 The further deterioration to here is the cost 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.850
 We must agree that we should defend and follow 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.690
 I have to go forward 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.030
 truly 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.040
 As I said earlier, 8 minutes 3 seconds Ami Gakuen High School One day 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.120
 Announced 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.280
 Us Akaoni and Aoni 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.860
 But recently it's the new best I've been through a personal interrogation 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.220
 why 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.420
 To the customers in a book I do not know the end made 2 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.880
 You can not miss it by all means 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 And then 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.190
 There was a scene of collagen 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.100
 Jipasean human rights-ic kicker released 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.640
 11 was done 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 The wish came true 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.440
 General 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.700
 jprs expectation 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 But not worth 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.359
 Hokuto 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:14.230
 It's okay 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.299
 Keita Hayashi 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.179
 I got a purchase 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.139
 This is more 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.319
 last month 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.559
 Yes 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.619
 What happens in July to Canada in October 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.619
 Decided 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.619
 In addition it is still undecided 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.509
 Countermeasures against earthquakes 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.559
 I was nervous as well 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.809
 Previously 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.719
 1. I was nervous 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.519
 Secure 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.020
 Still 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.179
 Why do you think that is good now 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.410
 chara 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.380
 I have seen this 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.699
 What do you want to ask 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.209
 What is your favorite food 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.479
 What is your favorite food 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.829
 It is delicious 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.469
 I used medicine 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.549
 Akaho released a decision to leave 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.309
 It was rigged for the purpose of making me feel that I wanted to get momentum 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.849
 Doubt 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.550
 September 1 Sat 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.190
 100% modest Kanagawa Ayase draw while sticking to your favorite numbers

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.349
 I think it will be great again again 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:37.669
 Happy 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.089

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.229
