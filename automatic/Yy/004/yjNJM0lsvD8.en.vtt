00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 um 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.760
 hello guys and girls from youtube me 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.340
 I have to make a mini tutorial very 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.099
 quickie del x king mod good we have 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.300
 updated with version 1.5 point 1 and 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.849
 good is a mod for those who do not 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.470
 know that it adds several functions to the 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.449
 search for minecraft resources on 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.250
 everything to find the subject of the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.330
 envelopes worth to look for materials 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.789
 basically it's a very used mode in 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.210
 servers and I have to warn for those 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.210
 who want it 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790
 use fraudulently they usually 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 vary from the servers and if I do not do 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.339
 responsible for its use so take care 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.570
 if you put yourself in a server to form 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.780
 a lot of material because it's possible that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.600
 have an anti x king because fix 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 simply by touching the x key I see 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.370
 automatically where are all the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.890
 envelopes all materials and good 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.710
 look out there at the bottom of a dungeon 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.769
 and well, you do not have to look much 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 to get to find diamond we are going to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.009
 see if we see around here and sure there 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.990
 a lot I'm not seeing it but without 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.830
 look at you there there is diamond that's 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.300
 diamond and this is diamond too and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.979
 well there's a lot there's a lot of 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.340
 diamond here there are also more 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.200
 diamond there are a lot 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.539
 with the X, we have it again as 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.870
 It was worth it and it reloads us 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.510
 generate the map 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.520
 tell you that it is not compatible at the moment 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.680
 neither with forge nor with module ader so 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.540
 you have to have the ice minecraft if 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.730
 You have forge or mod loader is not going to 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.830
 to work is worth knowing that you do not 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 would work another of the plugins that 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.070
 we will see later at the time of 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.510
 installation is the fly mode that is 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.510
 hitting the key f 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.280
 I can fly without having to put in 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.830
 game of and without having to use the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.490
 I'm not directly, it's already the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.110
 authentic cheto and good to fix 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:07.950
 there I have a good dungeon a better 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.950
 one answers these away and whenever 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.270
 whenever we give the x we're going to see 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.920
 the theme of enemies and such and fix 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.180
 progressive in some clippers and such and such 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.860
 we give to the r 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.920
 let's see only the enemies and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.440
 the chests and the zone d 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.700
 of dungeons like the one we have just 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.370
 below but good with the x key set 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.020
 how much diamond here good diamond already 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.080
 it would be itching down and 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.600
 finding how fast we are going to look 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.170
 this to see if we arrive then what 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.420
 cool this does not 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.420
 the clippers about to explode 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.590
 How cool is this, this is not very 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.590

 for all those who want to know the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.640
 seed is that you ask me many 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.950

 here this has been generated automatically 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.390
 and well, it's cool, well, well, 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.000
 we would have the benefit of flying and 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.220
 to be able to see the materials above all 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.450

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.150

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.010
 we wait five seconds and we give 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.900
 to jump advertising 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.209
 we save it we can close the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.159
 window and we wait again for 5 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.040
 seconds for us to download the 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.790
 fly mode is optional, you do not have why 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.239

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.270
 we skip advertising 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.979
 we save them we can close here and 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.259
 well let's unzip the two 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.340
 files that have been downloaded and we 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.289

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.009
 the same 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.440
 very important that you delete this folder

 the goal and so that the game does not leave my 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.520
