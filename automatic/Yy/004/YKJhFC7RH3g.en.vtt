now i'm just gonna be running a 3d mark
fire<00:00:43.739> strike<00:00:44.100> test<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.760> kind<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.210> flaps<00:00:45.539> open<00:00:45.750> so

fire strike test I kind of flaps open so
you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.129> crash<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you can see because it will crash the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.840 
you can see because it will crash the
test<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.710> I'll<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.789> able

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
to zoom in on the frame rate a little

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
to zoom in on the frame rate a little
bit<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> might<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:53.010> able<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.270> um<00:00:54.890> we<00:00:55.890> run<00:00:56.219> five

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
bit I might be able to so um we run five

yeah<00:01:20.869> i've<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.590> i've<00:01:22.979> also<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.580> all

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
yeah i've also i've also got this all

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.100 
yeah i've also i've also got this all
running<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.619> 760<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.600> 750<00:01:27.600> watt<00:01:27.810> power

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
running on a 760 what so 750 watt power

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.100 
running on a 760 what so 750 watt power
supply<00:01:28.939> it's<00:01:29.939> about<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.150> five<00:01:30.390> year<00:01:30.689> old<00:01:30.720> power

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
supply it's about a five year old power

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.670 
supply it's about a five year old power
supply<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.479> don't<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> guess<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.439> long

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
supply so I don't know I guess as long

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.100 
supply so I don't know I guess as long
as<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> 750<00:01:36.150> watt<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:36.930> one

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
as you have a 750 watt it's a good one

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.679 
as you have a 750 watt it's a good one
though<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.740> 80<00:01:38.070> plus<00:01:38.369> bronze<00:01:38.640> i<00:01:39.360> think<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
though some 80 plus bronze i think it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.350 
though some 80 plus bronze i think it
was<00:01:39.750> expensive<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.380> time<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> I've

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
was expensive at the time and so I've

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840 
was expensive at the time and so I've
just<00:01:43.020> been<00:01:43.619> using<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> past<00:01:44.490> five

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
just been using that for the past five

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
just been using that for the past five
years<00:01:45.090> every<00:01:45.780> single<00:01:46.110> upgrade<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.770> been

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
years every single upgrade it's been

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.179 
years every single upgrade it's been
fine<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.570> um<00:01:49.909> yeah<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.829> as<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.040> see

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
fine with so um yeah so as you can see

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.830 
fine with so um yeah so as you can see
in<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.369> first<00:01:53.670> test<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> was<00:01:54.180> very<00:01:54.420> smooth

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
in that first test it was very smooth

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.789 
in that first test it was very smooth
averaging<00:01:55.500> about<00:01:55.860> 30<00:01:56.490> frames<00:01:57.000> or<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:58.590> one

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
averaging about 30 frames or so this one

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.410 
averaging about 30 frames or so this one
it<00:01:59.250> becomes<00:01:59.670> not<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.869> smooth<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:02.090> still<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it becomes not so smooth but still it is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.410 
it becomes not so smooth but still it is
running<00:02:03.719> extreme<00:02:04.320> which<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:06.180> um

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
running extreme which is I think at um

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
running extreme which is I think at um
pretty<00:02:09.420> sure<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.810> at

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
pretty sure it's at

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.300 
pretty sure it's at
whatever<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.700> hmm<00:02:14.450> 2560<00:02:15.450> x<00:02:15.660> 1<00:02:16.230> 140<00:02:17.130> or

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
whatever it is hmm 2560 x 1 140 or

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.830 
whatever it is hmm 2560 x 1 140 or
something<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.819> for<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> resolution

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
something like that for the resolution

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.470 
something like that for the resolution
on<00:02:18.990> extreme<00:02:19.819> pretty<00:02:20.819> sure<00:02:20.970> that's<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
on extreme pretty sure that's just the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.710 
on extreme pretty sure that's just the
main<00:02:21.630> difference<00:02:22.050> between<00:02:22.490> extreme<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.850> just

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
main difference between extreme and just

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.150 
main difference between extreme and just
fire<00:02:25.140> strike<00:02:25.500> oh

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.270 

now<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.960> looks<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:35.010> say<00:02:35.160> what

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
now it it looks like you can say what

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.090 
now it it looks like you can say what
happened<00:02:35.670> what's<00:02:36.300> happening<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.100> but

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
happened what's happening with this but

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.790 
happened what's happening with this but
I<00:02:38.370> think<00:02:38.810> mind<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.020> just<00:02:40.080> move<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.440> Khitomer

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
I think mind if I just move the Khitomer

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.670 
I think mind if I just move the Khitomer
over<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.280> way<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> bit<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:43.050> they<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.440> get<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
over this way a bit so they can get the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.300 
over this way a bit so they can get the
whole<00:02:43.800> screen<00:02:44.040> um<00:02:45.320> yeah<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.470> looks<00:02:46.620> smooth<00:02:47.040> ish

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
whole screen um yeah it looks smooth ish

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.260 
whole screen um yeah it looks smooth ish
and<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:49.070> don't<00:02:50.070> know<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.550> can<00:02:51.090> definitely

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
and I don't know but you can definitely

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
and I don't know but you can definitely
tell<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.720> something's<00:02:52.590> not<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.300> don't

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
tell that something's not but I don't

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.350 
tell that something's not but I don't
know<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.470> I'm<00:02:55.590> saying<00:02:55.800> right<00:02:55.890> now<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.370> it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
know what I'm saying right now but it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.360 
know what I'm saying right now but it
looks<00:02:57.540> smoother<00:02:57.900> more<00:02:58.440> smooth<00:02:58.800> on<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.950> camera

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
looks smoother more smooth on the camera

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.710 
looks smoother more smooth on the camera
than<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.640> does<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.410> on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.830> screen<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
than it does on on the screen and it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.630 
than it does on on the screen and it
also<00:03:03.870> makes<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.290> colors<00:03:04.530> look<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.860> bread

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.500 

this<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> physics<00:03:12.930> test<00:03:13.350> this<00:03:13.710> is<00:03:13.920> um

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
this is the physics test this is um

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.020 
this is the physics test this is um
nothing<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.630> do<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> graphics<00:03:16.410> card

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
nothing to do with the graphics card

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.490 
nothing to do with the graphics card
well<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.450> does<00:03:18.600> have<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:18.990> with<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.200> little

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
well it does have to do with a little

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.830 
well it does have to do with a little
bit<00:03:19.710> but<00:03:19.920> not<00:03:20.280> much<00:03:20.310> that's<00:03:20.790> all<00:03:20.970> my<00:03:21.150> processor

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
bit but not much that's all my processor

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.610 
bit but not much that's all my processor
going<00:03:22.080> there<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.870> here's<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.290> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
going there and so here's just a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.680 
going there and so here's just a
combined<00:03:26.010> test<00:03:26.280> which<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.700> both<00:03:26.910> processor

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
combined test which is both processor

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.570 
combined test which is both processor
and<00:03:27.930> graphics<00:03:28.260> cards<00:03:30.980> now<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.310> look<00:03:32.430> up

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
and graphics cards now if you look up

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.240 
and graphics cards now if you look up
the<00:03:32.610> back<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.270> these<00:03:33.450> are<00:03:33.690> big<00:03:34.170> things<00:03:34.470> there

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
the back see these are big things there

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.150 
the back see these are big things there
they<00:03:35.880> begin<00:03:36.270> falling<00:03:36.600> all<00:03:37.110> these<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.650> fight<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
they begin falling all these to fight it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.040 
they begin falling all these to fight it
off<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:39.890> yeah<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.450> get<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.480> pre<00:03:42.720> hectic

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
off and yeah you just get a pre hectic

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.640 
off and yeah you just get a pre hectic
Batna<00:03:43.500> are<00:03:43.800> measures<00:03:44.490> lags<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.720> hard<00:03:46.050> normally

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
Batna are measures lags so hard normally

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.030 
Batna are measures lags so hard normally
like<00:03:47.550> with<00:03:47.820> my<00:03:47.970> old<00:03:48.090> 7970<00:03:48.990> got<00:03:49.140> about<00:03:49.290> six

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
like with my old 7970 got about six

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.220 
like with my old 7970 got about six
frames<00:03:50.340> per<00:03:50.610> second<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.540> looks<00:03:51.930> like<00:03:52.020> an

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
frames per second and it looks like an

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.160 
frames per second and it looks like an
absolute<00:03:52.680> mess<00:03:52.980> here<00:03:53.730> i'm<00:03:53.850> getting<00:03:54.090> about<00:03:54.180> 11

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
absolute mess here i'm getting about 11

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.740 
absolute mess here i'm getting about 11
10<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.120> um<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.870> looks<00:03:58.080> I'm<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.650> lot<00:03:59.100> better

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
10 and um it looks I'm a lot better

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.520 
10 and um it looks I'm a lot better
that's<00:04:00.750> my<00:04:00.959> mom<00:04:01.940> about<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.120> get<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.239> score<00:04:06.530> 5.1

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
that's my mom about to get a score 5.1

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.600 
that's my mom about to get a score 5.1
18<00:04:08.040> now<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:09.030> with
