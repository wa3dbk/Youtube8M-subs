in<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.789> sense<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.119> you<00:01:13.360> don't<00:01:13.539> need<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.810> cook

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
in the sense that you don't need to cook

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.320 
in the sense that you don't need to cook
it<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:15.009> can<00:01:15.190> always<00:01:15.459> simply<00:01:15.789> throw<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:16.209> and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
it you can always simply throw it and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.210 
it you can always simply throw it and
then<00:01:16.420> keep<00:01:16.750> moving<00:01:17.140> but<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.590> cost<00:01:17.830> of<00:01:18.009> that<00:01:18.069> is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
then keep moving but the cost of that is

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.419 
then keep moving but the cost of that is
the<00:01:18.610> loss<00:01:18.819> of<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.179> precision<00:01:19.600> detonation<00:01:20.470> get

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
the loss of a precision detonation get

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.010 
the loss of a precision detonation get
used<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.910> distance<00:01:22.330> at<00:01:22.539> which<00:01:22.569> you<00:01:22.869> can

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
used to the distance at which you can

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.719 
used to the distance at which you can
throw<00:01:23.289> and<00:01:23.560> cause<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.950> semtex<00:01:24.160> grenade<00:01:24.610> to
