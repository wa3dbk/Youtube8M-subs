00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.300 
lighting control and offered much scope
for<00:01:56.780> exploring<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.680> developing<00:01:57.800> our

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
for exploring and developing our

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.889 
for exploring and developing our
technical<00:01:58.759> expertise<00:01:59.270> well<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.630> was<00:01:59.810> an

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
technical expertise well it was an

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.359 
technical expertise well it was an
awkward<00:02:00.020> little<00:02:00.229> said<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.160> actual

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
awkward little said in the actual

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.330 
awkward little said in the actual
filming<00:02:02.050> it's<00:02:03.050> very<00:02:03.289> small<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.590> compact<00:02:03.950> and

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
filming it's very small and compact and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.940 
filming it's very small and compact and
had<00:02:04.490> had<00:02:04.850> had<00:02:05.060> door<00:02:05.630> my<00:02:05.780> windows<00:02:06.740> which

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
had had had door my windows which

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.410 
had had had door my windows which
created<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.490> few<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:07.910> problems<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
created a few little problems in

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.240 
created a few little problems in
lighting<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.899> might<00:02:09.560> not<00:02:09.770> have<00:02:09.860> occurred<00:02:10.100> in

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
lighting that might not have occurred in

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.699 
lighting that might not have occurred in
a<00:02:10.310> simpler<00:02:10.670> set<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:12.110> thought<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.560> know

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
a simpler set and I thought that know

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.210 
a simpler set and I thought that know
there<00:02:13.130> were<00:02:13.220> different<00:02:13.900> climatic<00:02:15.220> conditions

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
there were different climatic conditions

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.720 
there were different climatic conditions
really<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.880> snow<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:17.569> night<00:02:18.310> day<00:02:19.310> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
really like snow and night day and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.390 
really like snow and night day and
things<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:21.140> we<00:02:21.380> could<00:02:21.530> do<00:02:21.680> out<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.010> windows

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
things that we could do out the windows

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.000 
things that we could do out the windows
the<00:02:22.819> smallness<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.630> set<00:02:23.870> core<00:02:24.500> caused

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
the smallness of a set core caused

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.040 
the smallness of a set core caused
problems<00:02:25.490> will<00:02:25.700> mean<00:02:25.880> we<00:02:26.000> did<00:02:26.150> 360<00:02:26.810> degree

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
problems will mean we did 360 degree

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.550 
problems will mean we did 360 degree
pans<00:02:27.319> inside<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.950> little<00:02:28.040> set<00:02:29.560> but

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
pans inside that little set but

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.650 
pans inside that little set but
obviously<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:31.100> can't<00:02:31.340> fly<00:02:31.459> walls<00:02:31.790> for<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> 360

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
obviously you can't fly walls for a 360

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.780 
obviously you can't fly walls for a 360
so<00:02:33.020> you're<00:02:33.170> stuck<00:02:33.380> inside<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.920> reality<00:02:34.760> of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
so you're stuck inside the reality of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.480 
so you're stuck inside the reality of
that<00:02:35.060> that's<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.040> thought<00:02:37.220> if<00:02:37.370> we

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
that that's it and so I thought if we

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.390 
that that's it and so I thought if we
did<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.630> then<00:02:38.810> watch<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.260> film<00:02:39.560> then<00:02:40.280> we

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
did that and then watch the film then we

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.380 
did that and then watch the film then we
could<00:02:40.550> see<00:02:40.610> how<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:42.110> problems<00:02:42.760> occurred<00:02:43.760> by

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
could see how the problems occurred by

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.449 
could see how the problems occurred by
using<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.810> little<00:02:45.020> set<00:02:45.230> how<00:02:45.950> we<00:02:46.010> lit<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.340> and

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
using the little set how we lit it and

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.370 
using the little set how we lit it and
then<00:02:46.910> what's<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.270> film<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.810> see<00:02:47.959> how<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.200> came

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
then what's the film to see how it came

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.440 
then what's the film to see how it came
out
