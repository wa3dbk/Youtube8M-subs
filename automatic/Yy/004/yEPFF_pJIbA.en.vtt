00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.590 
there reverse coloring of it because
first<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> want<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.360> told

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
them I don't want to make a copy this I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.700 
them I don't want to make a copy this I
want<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.380> something<00:01:37.619> different<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.710> it's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
want to see something different so it's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
want to see something different so it's
pretty<00:01:41.070> much<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> opposite

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
pretty much going to be the opposite

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.469 
pretty much going to be the opposite
I've<00:01:42.780> noticed<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.380> few<00:01:43.759> flaws<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:45.299> would

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I've noticed a few flaws that i would

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.649 
I've noticed a few flaws that i would
like<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.369> different<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
like to be different so some of the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560 
like to be different so some of the
colors<00:01:48.930> will<00:01:49.170> end<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.619> being<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> same<00:01:50.570> but

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
colors will end up being the same but

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
colors will end up being the same but
the<00:01:51.750> majority<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> be

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the majority of it is going to be

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.719 
the majority of it is going to be
different<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:55.950> opposite<00:01:57.619> so

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
different it's going to be opposite so

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.649 
different it's going to be opposite so
yeah<00:02:00.110> just<00:02:01.110> put<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.439> aside

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
yeah just put this aside

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.630 
yeah just put this aside

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
sometimes i get the thinner parts and I

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.140 
sometimes i get the thinner parts and I
just<00:02:21.110> rather<00:02:21.709> not<00:02:21.890> cut<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.519> down<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.940> middle
