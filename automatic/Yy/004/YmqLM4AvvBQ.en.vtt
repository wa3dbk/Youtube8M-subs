00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.269 

all<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> wires<00:00:19.050> are<00:00:19.289> hooked<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:19.590> properly<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
all the wires are hooked up properly and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.580 
all the wires are hooked up properly and
then<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.240> aren't<00:00:21.750> able<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.109> hold<00:00:22.260> hear

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
then you are aren't able to hold hear

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
then you are aren't able to hold hear
the<00:00:22.710> sound<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.600> may<00:00:24.600> ask<00:00:24.869> why<00:00:25.849> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the sound you may ask why this is the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.740 
the sound you may ask why this is the
reason<00:00:27.359> why<00:00:28.340> econ<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.880> car<00:00:30.240> comes<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
reason why econ do this car comes with a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.130 
reason why econ do this car comes with a
built-in<00:00:31.230> amplifier<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.540> other<00:00:33.780> cars

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
built-in amplifier as so do other cars

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.130 
built-in amplifier as so do other cars
and<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.640> only<00:00:35.790> reason<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> can't<00:00:36.989> really

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and the only reason why you can't really

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
and the only reason why you can't really
hear<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:38.010> hear<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.399> sound<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> because

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
hear you can hear the sound is because

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.900 
hear you can hear the sound is because
you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.219> connected<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you can do you have not connected the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.229 
you can do you have not connected the
wire<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.600> turns<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> amplifier<00:00:43.910> in<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
wire that turns on the amplifier in this

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.610 
wire that turns on the amplifier in this
case<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.820> 1997<00:00:47.820> Nissan<00:00:48.539> Caravan

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
case for this one 1997 Nissan Caravan

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.600 
case for this one 1997 Nissan Caravan
I<00:00:50.239> mean<00:00:51.239> Nissan<00:00:51.539> Quest<00:00:52.160> this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> wire

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
I mean Nissan Quest this is the wire

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.220 
I mean Nissan Quest this is the wire
that<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.879> need<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> connect

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.100 

it's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.100> gray<00:01:02.670> wire<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.140> hook<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:06.110> blue

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's a gray wire you hook up the blue

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
it's a gray wire you hook up the blue
wire<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> antenna<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:10.220> remote<00:01:11.220> wire

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
wire which is the antenna or remote wire

on your stereo to the gray wire in the
car<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.860> should<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:18.590> connection

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
car it should be on this connection

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.500 
car it should be on this connection
right<00:01:19.620> here<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.550> connection<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.180> from<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
right here this connection is from you

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.880 
right here this connection is from you
original<00:01:22.940> connected<00:01:23.940> from<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> stereo<00:01:27.890> for

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
original connected from the stereo for

original connected from the stereo for
this<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.550> cannot<00:01:30.090> find<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.660> wire<00:01:31.410> harness

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
this one I cannot find the wire harness

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.080 
this one I cannot find the wire harness
way<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:32.970> had<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> tap<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> wires

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
way so I had to tap into the wires

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.490 
way so I had to tap into the wires
except<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.450> exception<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.229> speaker

actually had a wire harness it was not

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.940 
actually had a wire harness it was not
made<00:01:42.690> for<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.080> one<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.880> similar

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
made for this one but it was similar

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.749

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the rare one that would be the orange

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.660 
the rare one that would be the orange
cable<00:02:36.350> that's<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.620> switch<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.520> will

cable that's the switch on that will

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.770 
cable that's the switch on that will
switch<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> stereo<00:02:40.140> enough<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.750> I

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
switch on the stereo enough but like I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.330 
switch on the stereo enough but like I
said<00:02:43.110> if<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.380> can't<00:02:43.620> hear<00:02:43.740> no<00:02:43.860> sound<00:02:44.069> it's

said if you can't hear no sound it's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.370 
said if you can't hear no sound it's
most<00:02:44.580> likely<00:02:44.640> after<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.870> hook<00:02:46.080> up<00:02:46.230> all<00:02:46.349> the

it's<00:02:48.690> because<00:02:48.780> most<00:02:49.170> likely<00:02:49.349> you're<00:02:49.560> going<00:02:49.800> to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
it's because most likely you're going to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.400 
it's because most likely you're going to
end<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.069> having<00:02:50.430> an<00:02:50.630> amplifier<00:02:51.630> or<00:02:51.870> stock

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
end up having an amplifier or stock

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.900 
end up having an amplifier or stock
amplifier<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> came<00:02:53.400> with<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> radio

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
amplifier that came with the radio

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.870

factory<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.980> what<00:02:56.069> we<00:02:56.160> really<00:02:56.400> need<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:56.760> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
factory so what we really need to do is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.400 
factory so what we really need to do is
hook<00:02:57.030> up<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.420> one<00:02:57.569> cable<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.990> got<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.200> find

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
hook up that one cable you got to find

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.710 
hook up that one cable you got to find
it<00:02:58.500> first

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
it first

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.300

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
all the kid was on other cars may be

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.580 
all the kid was on other cars may be
different<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.300> one<00:03:03.680> Nissan

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.740 

in<00:03:08.590> some<00:03:08.860> quest<00:03:09.420> 1997<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.349> gray<00:03:11.590> wire<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
in some quest 1997 is the gray wire that

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.520 
in some quest 1997 is the gray wire that
one<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.019> going<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.290> turn<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.709> your<00:03:15.300> amplifier

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
one is going to turn on your amplifier

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:29.220 
one is going to turn on your amplifier
and<00:03:17.530> as<00:03:17.860> soon<00:03:18.010> as<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:21.120> turn<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.390> car<00:03:28.230> you

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
and as soon as you turn on the car you

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.440 
and as soon as you turn on the car you
get<00:03:29.410> some<00:03:29.680> with<00:03:29.890> it
