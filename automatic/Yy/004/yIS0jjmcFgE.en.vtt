another<00:00:03.899> separate<00:00:04.350> testing<00:00:04.770> from<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.190> wall

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310

another separate testing from the wall
of<00:00:05.370> Draenor<00:00:05.700> beta<00:00:05.730> we're<00:00:06.330> here<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
of Draenor beta we're here with the

of Draenor beta we're here with the
butcher<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.620> Erick<00:00:07.859> from<00:00:08.760> Homer<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> think

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
butcher on Erick from Homer one I think

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.080 
butcher on Erick from Homer one I think
this<00:00:10.050> may<00:00:10.380> well<00:00:10.410> be<00:00:10.620> our<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:11.250> upload<00:00:11.790> from

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this may well be our first upload from

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.549 
this may well be our first upload from
high<00:00:12.330> more<00:00:12.540> but<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.809> butcher<00:00:13.080> himself<00:00:13.440> was

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
high more but the butcher himself was

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.320 
high more but the butcher himself was
actually<00:00:13.830> tested<00:00:14.219> twice<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.820> first<00:00:15.000> set<00:00:15.240> of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
actually tested twice the first set of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.230 
actually tested twice the first set of
testing<00:00:15.660> was<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.080> very<00:00:16.410> first<00:00:16.730> raid<00:00:17.730> test<00:00:18.000> on

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
testing was the very first raid test on

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.080 
testing was the very first raid test on
the<00:00:18.449> beta<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.340> incredibly

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the beta and it was just incredibly

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.390 
the beta and it was just incredibly
unstable<00:00:21.480> most<00:00:22.410> people<00:00:22.710> even<00:00:22.800> struggle<00:00:23.310> just

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
unstable most people even struggle just

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.800 
unstable most people even struggle just
to<00:00:23.490> get<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> instance<00:00:24.420> let<00:00:24.630> alone

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to get in the instance let alone

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.140 
to get in the instance let alone
actually<00:00:25.019> pull<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> boss<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:26.910> hear

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
actually pull the boss and we all hear

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150 
actually pull the boss and we all hear
background<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.840> another<00:00:28.080> set<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.980> went

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
background with another set and it went

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.320 
background with another set and it went
a<00:00:29.220> lot<00:00:29.250> better<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.730> time<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:30.090> did<00:00:30.240> actually

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
a lot better this time we did actually

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.209 
a lot better this time we did actually
manage<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> test<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> boss<00:00:31.349> however<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
manage to test the boss however one of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
manage to test the boss however one of
his<00:00:32.309> main<00:00:32.520> abilities<00:00:32.969> wasn't<00:00:33.390> working<00:00:33.780> as

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
his main abilities wasn't working as

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.540 
his main abilities wasn't working as
intended<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> bit<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> letdown

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
intended which was a bit of a letdown

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340 
intended which was a bit of a letdown
bit<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> shame<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.870> really<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
bit of a shame so we can really see the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.959 
bit of a shame so we can really see the
fight<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.649> its<00:00:37.770> full<00:00:37.920> glory<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> fight

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
fight in its full glory but the fight

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.340 
fight in its full glory but the fight
yourself<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.629> reminiscent<00:00:40.079> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
yourself is very reminiscent of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
yourself is very reminiscent of
patchwork<00:00:40.640> half<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.790> his<00:00:41.910> abilities<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.540> all

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
patchwork half of his abilities are all

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
patchwork half of his abilities are all
pointed<00:00:43.379> towards<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> tanks<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
pointed towards the tanks and as a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
pointed towards the tanks and as a
ranged<00:00:45.329> dps<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.079> fight<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> essentially<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
ranged dps this fight is essentially a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520 
ranged dps this fight is essentially a
target<00:00:48.030> dummy<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.170> very<00:00:49.440> little

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
target dummy you have very very little

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470 
target dummy you have very very little
to<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> range<00:00:50.340> dps<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.000> fight<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to do as a range dps in this fight and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
to do as a range dps in this fight and
arguably<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.890> do

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
arguably you have very very little to do

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
arguably you have very very little to do
as<00:00:53.070> Mellie<00:00:53.309> dps<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.000> fight<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.329> well<00:00:54.539> now

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
as Mellie dps in this fight as well now

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.040 
as Mellie dps in this fight as well now
before<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.680> conclude<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.460> fight

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
before I do actually conclude this fight

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.000 
before I do actually conclude this fight
which<00:00:58.050> I'm<00:00:58.199> almost<00:00:58.469> doing<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
which I'm almost doing right at the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.470 
which I'm almost doing right at the
start<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> video<00:00:59.430> let's<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
start the video let's go for the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.670 
start the video let's go for the
mechanics<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.079> course<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.500> said

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
mechanics and of course like I said

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
mechanics and of course like I said
there<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> lot<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> tank<00:01:02.760> mechanics<00:01:03.239> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
there is a lot of tank mechanics so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
there is a lot of tank mechanics so
throughout<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> entire<00:01:04.320> fight<00:01:04.589> every<00:01:04.979> single

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
throughout the entire fight every single

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.429 
throughout the entire fight every single
melly<00:01:05.610> swing<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> boss<00:01:06.270> does<00:01:06.570> will<00:01:07.110> actually

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
melly swing the boss does will actually

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
melly swing the boss does will actually
perform<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.890> second<00:01:08.369> mel<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> swing<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
perform a second mel a swing on the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450 
perform a second mel a swing on the
closest<00:01:09.720> target<00:01:09.960> within<00:01:10.290> five<00:01:10.650> yards<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
closest target within five yards of the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640 
closest target within five yards of the
tank<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:12.180> no<00:01:12.360> target<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> within<00:01:12.930> those<00:01:13.409> five

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
tank if no target is within those five

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.530 
tank if no target is within those five
yards<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.400> primary<00:01:14.670> target<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.270> struck

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
yards the primary target will be struck

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.940 
yards the primary target will be struck
again<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> tank<00:01:16.290> will<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.560> double<00:01:16.830> hit

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
again so the tank will take double hit

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
again so the tank will take double hit
patchwork<00:01:17.700> essentially<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.869> important

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
patchwork essentially so it's important

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.450 
patchwork essentially so it's important
the<00:01:19.290> tank<00:01:19.500> stand<00:01:19.799> close<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.280> each<00:01:20.340> other

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the tank stand close to each other

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
the tank stand close to each other
pretty<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> entire<00:01:21.240> fight<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
pretty much the entire fight now the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
pretty much the entire fight now the
boss<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> cleaver<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> tanks

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
boss will also do a cleaver on the tanks

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
boss will also do a cleaver on the tanks
this<00:01:24.479> causes<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.259> bleed<00:01:25.799> effect<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this causes a bleed effect on the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
this causes a bleed effect on the
primary<00:01:27.060> target<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.810> stack<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
primary target and this stack so this is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
primary target and this stack so this is
your<00:01:28.799> tank<00:01:29.070> dot<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> need<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> turn<00:01:29.939> on

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
your tank dot that you need to turn on

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640 
your tank dot that you need to turn on
there's<00:01:30.720> another<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.170> well<00:01:31.259> bore<00:01:31.470> talked

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
there's another one as well bore talked

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
there's another one as well bore talked
about<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.950> moment<00:01:32.130> however<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.090> dot<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
about a moment however this dot that is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
about a moment however this dot that is
going<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.290> cleaver<00:01:34.590> dot<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.340> actually

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
going on the cleaver dot it can actually

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100 
going on the cleaver dot it can actually
be<00:01:35.640> avoided<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> dodge<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
be avoided so if you have dodge and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.690 
be avoided so if you have dodge and
parry<00:01:37.259> ups<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.680> completely<00:01:38.159> avoid<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
parry ups you can completely avoid this

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
parry ups you can completely avoid this
spell<00:01:38.970> ultimately<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.930> need<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> avoid

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
spell ultimately you don't need to avoid

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.690 
spell ultimately you don't need to avoid
it<00:01:40.500> at<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.130> damage<00:01:41.340> from<00:01:41.460> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it at all and the damage from this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.429 
it at all and the damage from this
ability<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.090> pull<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> pretty<00:01:42.899> much<00:01:43.110> every

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
ability is pull is pretty much every

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.719 
ability is pull is pretty much every
operability<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.189> hitting<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> tanks

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
operability that was hitting the tanks

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
operability that was hitting the tanks
it<00:01:44.850> wasn't<00:01:45.210> doing<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> lot<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.689> damage<00:01:45.899> anyway

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it wasn't doing a lot of damage anyway

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
it wasn't doing a lot of damage anyway
but<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> idea<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.000> try<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
but in the idea is that you try and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.580 
but in the idea is that you try and
dodge<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.659> parry<00:01:48.780> esben<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> possibly

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
dodge and parry esben as you possibly

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.190 
dodge and parry esben as you possibly
can<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.399> torn<00:01:50.720> once<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.930> stack

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
can and then just torn once your stack

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
can and then just torn once your stack
has<00:01:52.380> dropped<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.460> other<00:01:53.579> step<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
has dropped and the other step for you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
has dropped and the other step for you
to<00:01:54.030> worry<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.689> also<00:01:54.930> need<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
to worry about you also need to kind of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
to worry about you also need to kind of
torn<00:01:55.799> when<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> drops<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.700> tenderizer<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
torn when it drops is tenderizer this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.330 
torn when it drops is tenderizer this
just<00:01:58.200> deals<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.619> large<00:01:58.860> amount<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.219> physical

just deals a large amount of physical

just deals a large amount of physical
damage<00:01:59.850> while<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.210> supposed<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.750> least

you do take from this ability by fifty
percent<00:02:04.439> which<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> why<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.399> need<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> talk

dodge your parry this ability at

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.940 
dodge your parry this ability at
so<00:02:12.090> yeah<00:02:12.269> simple<00:02:12.780> simple<00:02:13.109> mechanical<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.799> need

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so yeah simple simple mechanical we need

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.890 
so yeah simple simple mechanical we need
to<00:02:14.040> make<00:02:14.159> sure<00:02:14.189> as<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.579> told<00:02:15.030> once<00:02:15.450> your<00:02:15.659> stack

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to make sure as you told once your stack

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.449 
to make sure as you told once your stack
has<00:02:16.079> dropped<00:02:16.379> now<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.709> main<00:02:16.920> ability<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.340> this

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
has dropped now the main ability in this

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.309 
has dropped now the main ability in this
fight<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.849> deadly<00:02:18.269> ability<00:02:18.719> at<00:02:18.810> least<00:02:19.049> is

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
fight the deadly ability at least is

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.110 
fight the deadly ability at least is
Cleve<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.489> was<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.700> mechanic<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
Cleve and this was the mechanic that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.509 
Cleve and this was the mechanic that
sadly<00:02:21.540> wasn't<00:02:22.049> working<00:02:22.439> how<00:02:23.129> it's<00:02:23.310> supposed

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
sadly wasn't working how it's supposed

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.860 
sadly wasn't working how it's supposed
to<00:02:23.609> work<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.209> mechanic<00:02:24.719> will

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
to work is that this mechanic will

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.360 
to work is that this mechanic will
target<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.260> largest<00:02:25.709> clump<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.040> players<00:02:26.250> in

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
target the largest clump of players in

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.280 
target the largest clump of players in
melee<00:02:26.790> range<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.359> will<00:02:27.840> build<00:02:28.049> physical

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
melee range and will build physical

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.050 
melee range and will build physical
damage<00:02:28.859> to<00:02:29.040> them<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> damage<00:02:29.639> is<00:02:29.849> split

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
damage to them and the damage is split

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.729 
damage to them and the damage is split
between<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:30.480> targets<00:02:30.930> within<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.409> clump

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
between all targets within that clump

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.679 
between all targets within that clump
and<00:02:32.010> when<00:02:32.549> they<00:02:32.670> are<00:02:32.819> hit<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.150> also<00:02:33.269> receive

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
and when they are hit they also receive

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.479 
and when they are hit they also receive
a<00:02:33.719> debuff<00:02:34.109> called<00:02:34.290> Russian<00:02:34.500> wounds<00:02:34.829> which

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
a debuff called Russian wounds which

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.490 
a debuff called Russian wounds which
just<00:02:36.030> causes<00:02:36.359> them<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> take<00:02:36.840> physical

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
just causes them to take physical

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.530 
just causes them to take physical
ticking<00:02:37.769> damage<00:02:38.010> every<00:02:38.310> 15<00:02:38.670> seconds<00:02:39.060> 15

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
ticking damage every 15 seconds 15

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.209 
ticking damage every 15 seconds 15
seconds<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.019> bit<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.409> a<00:02:40.439> weird<00:02:40.650> number<00:02:40.829> and

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
seconds I know bit of a weird number and

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.890 
seconds I know bit of a weird number and
the<00:02:41.459> door<00:02:41.609> itself<00:02:41.849> doesn't<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.480> deal<00:02:42.719> that

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the door itself doesn't really deal that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.599 
the door itself doesn't really deal that
much<00:02:43.049> damage<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> main<00:02:44.189> reason<00:02:44.220> why<00:02:44.549> this

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
much damage but the main reason why this

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.069 
much damage but the main reason why this
debuff<00:02:44.939> is<00:02:45.090> deadly<00:02:45.419> is<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.629> once<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.989> do

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
debuff is deadly is that once you do

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.319 
debuff is deadly is that once you do
actually<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.590> fact<00:02:46.620> reach<00:02:47.069> 5<00:02:47.370> stacks<00:02:47.760> you'll

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
actually in fact reach 5 stacks you'll

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.179 
actually in fact reach 5 stacks you'll
just<00:02:48.540> instantly<00:02:49.079> die<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.650> can't<00:02:49.859> immune

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
just instantly die and you can't immune

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.949 
just instantly die and you can't immune
this<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.549> can't<00:02:50.760> damage<00:02:51.120> reduction<00:02:51.359> this<00:02:51.750> is

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
this you can't damage reduction this is

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.830 
this you can't damage reduction this is
just<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.590> flat-out<00:02:52.859> def<00:02:53.310> mechanic<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.540> idea

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
just a flat-out def mechanic the idea

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.149 
just a flat-out def mechanic the idea
they<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.139> behind<00:02:55.409> for<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.859> deal<00:02:56.040> with

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
they have behind for you to deal with

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.349 
they have behind for you to deal with
this<00:02:56.219> mechanic<00:02:56.639> is<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.909> you<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.120> two

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
this mechanic is that you have two

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.629 
this mechanic is that you have two
groups<00:02:57.719> in<00:02:57.989> Mellie<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:59.040> then<00:02:59.219> you<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.459> make

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
groups in Mellie and then you just make

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.190 
groups in Mellie and then you just make
one<00:02:59.879> group<00:03:00.120> larger<00:03:00.450> than<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.659> other<00:03:00.810> using

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
one group larger than the other using

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.929 
one group larger than the other using
range<00:03:01.409> dps<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:02.069> actually<00:03:02.310> decided<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:02.790> use<00:03:02.909> a

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
range dps we actually decided to use a

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.490 
range dps we actually decided to use a
hunter<00:03:03.329> because<00:03:03.689> hunt<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> really<00:03:04.379> good

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
hunter because hunt is a really good

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.990 
hunter because hunt is a really good
doing<00:03:05.040> damage<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.489> movement<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.819> course

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
doing damage on the movement of course

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
doing damage on the movement of course
they<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.239> disengage<00:03:06.540> out<00:03:06.870> once<00:03:07.139> one<00:03:07.469> of<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
they can disengage out once one of the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.039 
they can disengage out once one of the
groups<00:03:08.219> does<00:03:08.519> reach<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:09.000> stacks<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:09.599> then

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
groups does reach for stacks and then

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.390 
groups does reach for stacks and then
100<00:03:10.349> will<00:03:10.469> then<00:03:10.590> move<00:03:10.739> into<00:03:10.919> the<00:03:11.069> other<00:03:11.189> group

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
100 will then move into the other group

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.979 
100 will then move into the other group
to<00:03:11.609> make<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.909> group<00:03:12.090> larger<00:03:12.510> than<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.750> first

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
to make that group larger than the first

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.479 
to make that group larger than the first
so<00:03:13.349> then<00:03:13.469> one<00:03:13.650> group<00:03:13.799> will<00:03:13.919> get<00:03:14.010> four<00:03:14.219> stacks

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
so then one group will get four stacks

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.920 
so then one group will get four stacks
the<00:03:14.790> other<00:03:14.909> group<00:03:15.030> then<00:03:15.239> get<00:03:15.359> four<00:03:15.540> stacks<00:03:15.780> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
the other group then get four stacks and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.180 
the other group then get four stacks and
by<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.079> time<00:03:16.169> the<00:03:16.349> other<00:03:16.409> group<00:03:16.590> has<00:03:16.799> got<00:03:17.010> four

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
by the time the other group has got four

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.129 
by the time the other group has got four
stacks<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.790> first<00:03:18.000> group<00:03:18.180> stacks<00:03:18.690> would<00:03:18.989> have

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
stacks the first group stacks would have

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.719 
stacks the first group stacks would have
dropped<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:20.099> that's<00:03:20.280> all<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.699> just

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
dropped so that's all you do you just

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.069 
dropped so that's all you do you just
keep<00:03:20.970> doing<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.299> throughout<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.750> entire

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
keep doing that throughout the entire

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.199 
keep doing that throughout the entire
fight<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:23.159> when<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.400> were<00:03:23.430> testing<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:24.030> boss

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
fight but when we were testing this boss

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.520 
fight but when we were testing this boss
that<00:03:24.479> mechanic<00:03:24.870> wasn't<00:03:25.109> working<00:03:25.349> at<00:03:25.440> all

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that mechanic wasn't working at all

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.719 
that mechanic wasn't working at all
there<00:03:25.709> was<00:03:25.769> blue<00:03:25.979> posting<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.519> would<00:03:26.639> be

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
there was blue posting that would be

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.670 
there was blue posting that would be
fixed<00:03:27.000> we<00:03:27.329> left<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.629> instance<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.169> reset<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
fixed we left the instance we reset the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.409 
fixed we left the instance we reset the
instance<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.099> came<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:30.180> still

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
instance we came back in and it still

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.059 
instance we came back in and it still
wasn't<00:03:30.510> working<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:30.989> I'm<00:03:31.470> not<00:03:31.620> sure<00:03:31.769> they<00:03:31.919> did

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
wasn't working so I'm not sure they did

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.349 
wasn't working so I'm not sure they did
actually<00:03:32.220> fix<00:03:32.579> that<00:03:32.729> mechanic<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.180> that's

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
actually fix that mechanic but that's

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.569 
actually fix that mechanic but that's
how<00:03:33.479> it's<00:03:33.629> supposed<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.959> work<00:03:34.220> very<00:03:35.220> very<00:03:35.280> very

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
how it's supposed to work very very very

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.189 
how it's supposed to work very very very
simple<00:03:35.879> mechanic<00:03:36.359> it<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.810> happens<00:03:37.079> it

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
simple mechanic it just so happens it

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.809 
simple mechanic it just so happens it
wasn't<00:03:37.319> working<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.919> day<00:03:38.099> now<00:03:38.430> as<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.609> may

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
wasn't working on the day now as you may

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.129 
wasn't working on the day now as you may
have<00:03:38.849> noticed<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.359> boss<00:03:39.510> actually<00:03:39.750> does<00:03:39.989> have

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
have noticed the boss actually does have

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.140 
have noticed the boss actually does have
an<00:03:40.259> energy<00:03:40.650> ball<00:03:40.799> once<00:03:41.189> he<00:03:41.310> does<00:03:41.489> reach<00:03:41.669> 100

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
an energy ball once he does reach 100

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.059 
an energy ball once he does reach 100
energy<00:03:42.479> he'll<00:03:42.959> start<00:03:43.259> doing<00:03:43.470> his<00:03:43.620> bounding

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
energy he'll start doing his bounding

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.860 
energy he'll start doing his bounding
cleave<00:03:44.280> sequence<00:03:44.759> and<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.150> starts<00:03:45.509> off<00:03:45.659> by

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
cleave sequence and that starts off by

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.420 
cleave sequence and that starts off by
him<00:03:46.019> knocking<00:03:46.259> all<00:03:46.620> players<00:03:46.859> back<00:03:47.159> in<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
him knocking all players back in the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.069 
him knocking all players back in the
room<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.819> then<00:03:48.239> he'll<00:03:48.449> charge<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
room and then he'll charge to the

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.319 
room and then he'll charge to the
largest<00:03:49.799> clump<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.250> players<00:03:50.519> within<00:03:50.939> the<00:03:51.150> room

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
largest clump of players within the room

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.789 
largest clump of players within the room
and<00:03:51.569> do<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> cleave<00:03:52.139> on<00:03:52.290> them<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.560> cleve

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
and do a cleave on them the cleve

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.259 
and do a cleave on them the cleve
ability<00:03:53.189> that<00:03:53.310> applies<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.699> gushing<00:03:53.909> words

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
ability that applies the gushing words

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.240 
ability that applies the gushing words
so<00:03:55.259> it's<00:03:55.409> at<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.590> point<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.009> melia

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
so it's at this point that the melia

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.649 
so it's at this point that the melia
will<00:03:56.400> want<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.639> spread<00:03:56.909> out<00:03:57.060> especially<00:03:57.299> the

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
will want to spread out especially the

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.449 
will want to spread out especially the
guys<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.019> have<00:03:58.169> four<00:03:58.439> stacks<00:03:58.739> because<00:03:59.280> they

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
guys that have four stacks because they

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.189 
guys that have four stacks because they
would<00:03:59.579> have<00:03:59.699> just<00:03:59.729> had<00:04:00.060> four<00:04:00.299> stacks<00:04:00.540> all<00:04:00.720> 36

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
would have just had four stacks all 36

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.710 
would have just had four stacks all 36
maybe<00:04:01.470> from<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.799> cleave<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.879> all<00:04:03.030> ranged<00:04:03.389> dps

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
maybe from the cleave and all ranged dps

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.210 
maybe from the cleave and all ranged dps
just<00:04:03.959> group<00:04:04.109> up<00:04:04.229> on<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.409> single<00:04:04.590> spot<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.040> boss

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
damage and will attack thirty percent

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.510 
damage and will attack thirty percent
faster<00:04:39.200> so<00:04:39.590> it's<00:04:39.710> at<00:04:39.800> this<00:04:39.890> point<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.280> tanks

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
faster so it's at this point the tanks

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.590 
faster so it's at this point the tanks
are<00:04:40.610> just<00:04:40.760> going<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.940> take<00:04:41.060> more<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.450> more

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
are just going to take more and more

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.480 
are just going to take more and more
damage<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.500> you<00:04:42.830> probably<00:04:42.890> want<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.280> save<00:04:43.400> your

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.800 
damage so you probably want to save your
cooldowns<00:04:43.850> for<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.150> point<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.600> fight

tanks was taking was very very minimal I
think<00:04:51.470> someone<00:04:51.680> even<00:04:51.860> joked<00:04:52.130> while<00:04:52.370> we<00:04:52.490> were

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
think someone even joked while we were

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.310 
think someone even joked while we were
testing<00:04:52.820> at<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.240> nella<00:04:53.510> mental<00:04:53.870> shaman<00:04:54.230> could

testing at the nella mental shaman could

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.380 
testing at the nella mental shaman could
probably<00:04:54.500> heal<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:54.860> site<00:04:55.130> which<00:04:55.790> wasn't<00:04:56.030> too

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
probably heal this site which wasn't too

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.330 
probably heal this site which wasn't too
far<00:04:56.690> off<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:57.080> be<00:04:57.170> honest<00:04:57.470> but<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.950> encounter

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
far off to be honest but the encounter

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.770 
far off to be honest but the encounter
itself<00:04:58.640> and<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:58.940> think<00:04:59.180> most<00:04:59.419> people<00:04:59.750> would

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
minutes I mean with the only reason

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.290 
minutes I mean with the only reason
we're<00:05:15.950> here<00:05:16.070> is<00:05:16.130> because<00:05:16.250> we<00:05:16.669> stood<00:05:16.850> AFK

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
we're here is because we stood AFK

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.430 
we're here is because we stood AFK

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
which he never decided to do but we

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.970 
which he never decided to do but we
imagine<00:05:21.200> this<00:05:21.320> is<00:05:21.440> probably<00:05:21.620> going<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:21.860> be<00:05:21.950> the

imagine this is probably going to be the

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.370 
imagine this is probably going to be the

have great gear so and he is a very very
early<00:05:30.650> boss<00:05:30.890> so<00:05:31.250> it's<00:05:32.090> easing<00:05:32.870> people<00:05:33.229> into

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
early boss so it's easing people into

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.380 
early boss so it's easing people into
the<00:05:33.620> instance<00:05:33.979> I<00:05:34.160> suppose<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:34.760> he<00:05:34.940> didn't<00:05:35.210> a

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
the instance I suppose but he didn't a

the instance I suppose but he didn't a
little<00:05:35.930> lackluster<00:05:36.140> there's<00:05:36.650> not<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:36.950> lot<00:05:37.190> to

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
little lackluster there's not a lot to

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.159 
little lackluster there's not a lot to
him<00:05:37.550> not<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.030> best<00:05:38.150> boss<00:05:38.419> we've<00:05:38.600> seen<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:38.960> far

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
him not the best boss we've seen so far

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.900 
him not the best boss we've seen so far
but<00:05:39.350> I<00:05:39.410> Donna<00:05:39.860> talking<00:05:40.130> completely<00:05:40.490> only

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
but I Donna talking completely only

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.190 
but I Donna talking completely only
because<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.360> enraged<00:05:41.630> mechanic<00:05:42.020> I

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
because of that enraged mechanic I

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.540 
because of that enraged mechanic I
suppose<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.740> could<00:05:42.830> look<00:05:42.979> at<00:05:43.100> this<00:05:43.160> boss<00:05:43.340> and

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
suppose you could look at this boss and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.460 
suppose you could look at this boss and
compared<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:44.030> maybe<00:05:44.180> all<00:05:44.450> traxion<00:05:44.930> an<00:05:45.169> elver

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470

compared to maybe all traxion an elver
encounter<00:05:45.860> that<00:05:45.950> doesn't<00:05:46.370> have<00:05:46.550> a<00:05:46.820> lot<00:05:47.240> of

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
encounter that doesn't have a lot of

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.969 
encounter that doesn't have a lot of
mechanics<00:05:47.810> but<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.260> emerge<00:05:48.500> timer<00:05:48.770> in<00:05:48.919> the

mechanics but the emerge timer in the

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.280 
mechanics but the emerge timer in the
first<00:05:49.160> few<00:05:49.340> weeks<00:05:49.550> is<00:05:49.760> very<00:05:50.060> very<00:05:50.330> close<00:05:50.660> but

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
first few weeks is very very close but

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.450 
first few weeks is very very close but
apart<00:05:51.530> from<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.680> I'm<00:05:51.919> pretty<00:05:52.160> sure<00:05:52.310> this

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
apart from that I'm pretty sure this

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.190 
apart from that I'm pretty sure this
play<00:05:52.640> is<00:05:52.790> going<00:05:52.910> to<00:05:52.970> be<00:05:53.030> great<00:05:53.240> for<00:05:53.510> range<00:05:53.990> of

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
play is going to be great for range of

play is going to be great for range of
melody<00:05:54.500> PS<00:05:54.740> that<00:05:54.950> really<00:05:55.160> want<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.400> show<00:05:55.550> how

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
melody PS that really want to show how

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.460 
melody PS that really want to show how
much<00:05:55.910> dps<00:05:56.240> they<00:05:56.450> have<00:05:56.570> because<00:05:56.840> there's<00:05:57.229> very

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
much dps they have because there's very

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.110 
much dps they have because there's very
few<00:05:57.560> mechanics<00:05:58.220> in<00:05:58.370> play<00:05:58.669> that<00:05:58.880> are<00:05:58.940> going<00:05:59.030> to

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
few mechanics in play that are going to

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.430 
few mechanics in play that are going to
produce<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.600> amount<00:05:59.690> of<00:05:59.870> damage<00:06:00.169> you<00:06:00.200> have<00:06:00.350> to

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
produce the amount of damage you have to

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.530 
produce the amount of damage you have to
do<00:06:00.590> because<00:06:00.800> you<00:06:01.070> don't<00:06:01.250> have<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.550> move<00:06:01.760> that

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
do because you don't have to move that

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.150 
do because you don't have to move that
much<00:06:02.840> at<00:06:03.110> all<00:06:03.290> really<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:03.860> mean<00:06:04.070> the<00:06:04.130> only

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
much at all really I mean the only

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.469 
much at all really I mean the only
people<00:06:04.580> who<00:06:04.669> really<00:06:04.850> need<00:06:05.030> to<00:06:05.150> move<00:06:05.270> other

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
people who really need to move other

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:06.969 
people who really need to move other
people<00:06:05.720> who<00:06:05.810> go<00:06:05.960> into<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:06.260> cleave<00:06:06.470> and<00:06:06.740> then

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
people who go into the cleave and then

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.140 
people who go into the cleave and then
of<00:06:07.070> course<00:06:07.250> when<00:06:07.370> it<00:06:07.490> goes<00:06:07.580> into<00:06:07.760> the<00:06:07.880> bounding

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
of course when it goes into the bounding

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.760 
of course when it goes into the bounding
cleave<00:06:08.360> phase<00:06:08.570> once<00:06:08.780> he<00:06:08.870> reaches<00:06:09.169> 100<00:06:09.470> energy

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
cleave phase once he reaches 100 energy

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.350 
cleave phase once he reaches 100 energy
I<00:06:09.890> suppose<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.310> range<00:06:10.520> after<00:06:10.880> stack<00:06:11.090> which

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
I suppose the range after stack which

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.510 
I suppose the range after stack which
would<00:06:11.540> be<00:06:11.720> a<00:06:11.900> very<00:06:12.080> short<00:06:12.440> downtime<00:06:12.919> of<00:06:13.100> DPS

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
would be a very short downtime of DPS

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.820 
would be a very short downtime of DPS
but<00:06:13.820> generally<00:06:14.360> he<00:06:14.720> is<00:06:14.840> a<00:06:14.870> target<00:06:15.320> on<00:06:15.410> me<00:06:15.560> but

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
but generally he is a target on me but

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.080 
but generally he is a target on me but
