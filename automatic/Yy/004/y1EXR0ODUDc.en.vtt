00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.270 
sound integrated and so for the power
connectors<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.570> an<00:00:39.570> 8<00:00:39.899> pin<00:00:40.260> or<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> 4<00:00:41.010> pin

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
connectors you have an 8 pin or a 4 pin

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.610 
connectors you have an 8 pin or a 4 pin
there<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.600> plug<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.230> I've

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there which you can plug in because I've

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.319 
there which you can plug in because I've
only<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:45.559> 1/4<00:00:46.559> phone<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:48.030> find

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
only got a 1/4 phone if I can just find

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.130 
only got a 1/4 phone if I can just find
it<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.980> you're<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.760> doing

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
it but if you're going to be doing

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
it but if you're going to be doing
overclocking<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.770> would<00:00:56.190> advise<00:00:56.550> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
overclocking with it I would advise you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.220 
overclocking with it I would advise you
get<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> proper<00:00:57.570> power<00:00:57.750> supply<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.890> has

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
get like a proper power supply that has

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.179 
get like a proper power supply that has
8<00:01:01.230> pin<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.039> gonna<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.579> overclocking<00:01:04.189> 24th

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
8 pin it's gonna be do overclocking 24th

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.600 
8 pin it's gonna be do overclocking 24th
in<00:01:05.489> power<00:01:06.000> connector<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.340> sort<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
in power connector so that one sort of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.130 
in power connector so that one sort of
CPU<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> motherboard

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
CPU that was just for the motherboard

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.310 
CPU that was just for the motherboard
and<00:01:11.780> that's<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> power<00:01:14.420> but<00:01:15.420> let's<00:01:16.170> do

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and that's all the power but let's do

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.340 
and that's all the power but let's do
dram<00:01:16.590> now<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.159> dual<00:01:17.400> channel<00:01:18.350> supports

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
dram now so it's dual channel supports

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.399 
dram now so it's dual channel supports
up<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.299> 32<00:01:21.299> gigabytes<00:01:22.729> ddr3<00:01:25.790> 1800s<00:01:27.080> but<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> can

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
up to 32 gigabytes ddr3 1800s but it can

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.149 
up to 32 gigabytes ddr3 1800s but it can
be<00:01:28.530> overclocked<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.479> 2200<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.920> pretty

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
be overclocked to 2200 so that's pretty

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.100 
be overclocked to 2200 so that's pretty
cool<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.329> 1155<00:01:36.329> socket

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
cool and then you have the 1155 socket

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
cool and then you have the 1155 socket
which<00:01:37.320> has<00:01:37.560> backplate<00:01:38.070> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.430> pretty<00:01:38.700> cool

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
which has backplate which is pretty cool

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.170 
which has backplate which is pretty cool
compared<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> Dex<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.159> my<00:01:41.159> last<00:01:41.340> build<00:01:41.670> had<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
compared to Dex like my last build had a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.980 
compared to Dex like my last build had a
LGA<00:01:43.110> 775<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.670> shouldn't<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.090> any<00:01:45.299> back<00:01:45.450> plate

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
LGA 775 we shouldn't have any back plate

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.800 
LGA 775 we shouldn't have any back plate
on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> back<00:01:46.530> plate<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.430> idea<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.570> my

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on the back plate in my idea in like my

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.730 
on the back plate in my idea in like my
eyes<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> good<00:01:50.549> idea<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.240> reduce<00:01:51.750> heat<00:01:52.259> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
eyes is a good idea to reduce heat so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.719 
eyes is a good idea to reduce heat so
that<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.340> go

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that we go

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.330 
that we go
you<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:55.430> CPU<00:01:56.430> fun<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.030> sassy<00:01:57.299> fun<00:01:57.920> there

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you got your CPU fun and sassy fun there

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880 
you got your CPU fun and sassy fun there
they<00:01:59.850> got<00:02:00.119> power<00:02:00.600> fan<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.290> another<00:02:01.560> shot<00:02:01.829> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
they got power fan and another shot I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.119 
they got power fan and another shot I
found<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.549> you've<00:02:03.420> got<00:02:03.689> 4<00:02:04.159> PCIe<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.570> 1<00:02:06.960> X<00:02:07.129> 16

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
found there you've got 4 PCIe so 1 X 16

that<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.700> about<00:03:22.470> rounds<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.650> up<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.280> be

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
that just about rounds it up to be

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.730 
that just about rounds it up to be
honest<00:03:24.640> there's<00:03:24.880> no<00:03:25.120> arm<00:03:25.440> like<00:03:26.440> down<00:03:26.710> here

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
honest there's no arm like down here
