00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.790
 Today I want to show you on a simple 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 master class how to design when 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.840
 enamel gel paints 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.270
 combination with foil 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.600
 if you're interested stay with me 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.510
 so go i modeled she is ready 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.360
 sawed it polished and prepared for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.300
 I will work on drawing design 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.640
 gel paints and now black 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 gel paint draw a small 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.520
 fine brush drawing draw line 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520
 smiles 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:44.020
 it is not necessary to introduce any thin 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.020
 draw lines as you can draw 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.430
 but 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.730
 send to the lamp two minutes after 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.780
 the black gel has dried out 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.780
 translating ear to lion 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.650
 fix the foil in the lamp for 20 seconds 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:36.860
 now thin brush and enamel gel 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.860
 paint fill all available places 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.000
 mom 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.080
 what it means and my gel ink 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.480
 This means that there is no gel ink 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.290
 no nacre and absolutely 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.460
 absolutely 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.460
 and graves 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.990
 It was 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:19.240
 wipe the brush in a dry cloth and 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.260
 apply another color 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.960
 so as not to wipe the brush each time 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.440
 perform this conveyor drawing 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.440
 lying 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.870
 it is possible to apply both bright colors and 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.190
 bed not 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.190
 also at your discretion 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.669
 at 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.669
 but 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:51.370
 send to the lamp for two minutes 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.099
 overlapping work finish or you can 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.189
 cover with a thin layer of modeling 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:00.669
 clear gel do not forget that casting 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:03.759
 this is a prominent design element therefore 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:09.870
 may rub better 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:13.419
 either overlap with two layers of finish or 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.419
 modeling transparent gel and problems 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:19.150
 You are such a simple design and you can 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.719
 perform with enamel gel 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.520
 paint combined with casting 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:26.349
 it can be performed as on all foot 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.690
 points and two 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:32.020
