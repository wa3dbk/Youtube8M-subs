00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
here and then if there is a probe like

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
here and then if there is a probe like
at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.549> minute<00:01:29.670> 40<00:01:30.060> seconds<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.630> your

then he will make damn sure that you can
run<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.530> other<00:01:34.680> simulator<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> then

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
run to the other simulator and then

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
run to the other simulator and then
you're<00:01:36.030> still<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:40.250> one<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.460> he

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
you're still okay see one the way he

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.440 
you're still okay see one the way he
wants<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
wants to take this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.030 
wants to take this

so probes such a thief he's already
stole<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.490> gas<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.350> ten<00:01:46.350> minerals<00:01:47.600> use<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> with

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
stole a gas and ten minerals use it with

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
stole a gas and ten minerals use it with
Brody<00:01:49.110> hammer<00:01:49.229> timing<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.369> hilarious

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
little bit of the mining time of these

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.370 
little bit of the mining time of these
pros<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.829> well<00:01:58.860> oh<00:01:59.219> that's<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.180> oh<00:02:00.210> no<00:02:00.380> he's

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
bit that's on that 15 minerals that he's

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.229 
bit that's on that 15 minerals that he's
investing<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.459> above<00:02:27.670> all<00:02:27.849> that's<00:02:28.060> one

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
investing and above all that's one

problem<00:02:28.510> mining<00:02:28.989> in<00:02:29.079> a<00:02:29.140> very<00:02:29.319> early<00:02:29.470> stage<00:02:29.709> in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
problem mining in a very early stage in

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.610 
problem mining in a very early stage in
the<00:02:29.950> game<00:02:30.099> so<00:02:30.970> where<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.900> he<00:02:32.049> gonna<00:02:32.200> take<00:02:32.439> this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
the game so where is he gonna take this

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.949 
the game so where is he gonna take this
often<00:02:32.920> maybe<00:02:33.909> they<00:02:34.120> follow<00:02:34.329> this<00:02:34.480> up<00:02:34.599> but<00:02:34.720> like

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
often maybe they follow this up but like

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.050 
often maybe they follow this up but like
it's<00:02:35.109> super<00:02:35.349> crazy<00:02:35.590> quick<00:02:35.950> Oracle<00:02:36.370> sage<00:02:36.849> this

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
it's super crazy quick Oracle sage this

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.490 
it's super crazy quick Oracle sage this
is<00:02:37.180> gonna<00:02:37.299> be<00:02:37.480> like<00:02:37.629> your<00:02:37.810> brother<00:02:37.930> I'm<00:02:38.319> just

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
is gonna be like your brother I'm just

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.080 
is gonna be like your brother I'm just
gonna<00:02:38.620> expand<00:02:39.040> from<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.400> immediately<00:02:39.819> since

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
gonna expand from this immediately since

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.879 
gonna expand from this immediately since
I'm<00:02:40.209> gonna<00:02:40.359> be<00:02:40.450> able<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.629> mine<00:02:40.780> gas<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.680> I'm

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
I'm gonna be able to mine gas so I'm

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.140 
I'm gonna be able to mine gas so I'm
gonna<00:02:42.099> have<00:02:42.219> a<00:02:42.250> lot<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.489> extra<00:02:42.700> minerals<00:02:43.060> to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
gonna have a lot of extra minerals to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.030 
gonna have a lot of extra minerals to
spare<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.629> now<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.019> think<00:02:44.349> that<00:02:44.470> he<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.650> wants

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
spare and now I think that he just wants

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.319 
spare and now I think that he just wants
to<00:02:45.129> go<00:02:45.220> for<00:02:45.400> some<00:02:45.489> crazy<00:02:45.730> 3<00:02:46.000> gauge<00:02:46.180> way

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
to go for some crazy 3 gauge way

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.720 
to go for some crazy 3 gauge way
aggression<00:02:46.810> may<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.139> only<00:02:47.290> mining<00:02:47.739> with<00:02:48.310> 4

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
aggression may be the only mining with 4

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.789 
aggression may be the only mining with 4
probes<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.329> gas<00:02:49.510> as<00:02:49.689> well<00:02:49.870> because<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.769> think

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
probes and gas as well because I think

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.770 
probes and gas as well because I think
if<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.370> delay<00:02:51.669> gas<00:02:51.879> is<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.239> much<00:02:52.480> then

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
if you delay gas is this much then

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.509 
if you delay gas is this much then
you're<00:02:53.079> probably<00:02:53.260> just<00:02:53.470> gonna<00:02:53.620> try<00:02:53.889> to<00:02:53.950> use

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
you're probably just gonna try to use

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.369 
you're probably just gonna try to use
your<00:02:54.669> much<00:02:55.060> quicker<00:02:55.329> why<00:02:55.540> pick<00:02:55.780> technology<00:02:56.290> in

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
your much quicker why pick technology in

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.740 
your much quicker why pick technology in
your<00:02:56.470> adventure<00:02:56.919> adventure<00:02:57.489> say<00:02:58.480> she's<00:02:58.659> gonna

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
your adventure adventure say she's gonna

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.539 
your adventure adventure say she's gonna
drop<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.049> porch<00:02:59.439> as<00:02:59.650> well<00:02:59.829> but<00:03:00.040> now<00:03:00.159> this<00:03:00.340> game

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
drop a porch as well but now this game

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.509 
drop a porch as well but now this game
has<00:03:00.579> gone<00:03:00.819> crazy

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
has gone crazy

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.979 
has gone crazy
there's<00:03:03.519> only<00:03:03.609> anti-air<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:04.659> think<00:03:04.900> he's

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
there's only anti-air and I think he's

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.509 
there's only anti-air and I think he's
probably<00:03:05.019> worried<00:03:05.530> about<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.950> prospect<00:03:06.129> of

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
probably worried about the prospect of

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.879 
probably worried about the prospect of
Oracle's<00:03:06.879> that<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.120> were<00:03:07.209> talking<00:03:07.510> about<00:03:07.889> so

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
Oracle's that you were talking about so

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.259 
Oracle's that you were talking about so
might<00:03:09.250> feel<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:09.519> he<00:03:09.609> needs<00:03:09.760> some<00:03:09.819> cannons

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
might feel like he needs some cannons

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.270 
might feel like he needs some cannons
yeah<00:03:10.599> he's<00:03:10.989> all<00:03:11.139> kinda<00:03:11.500> gun<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.919> defend<00:03:12.159> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
yeah he's all kinda gun is to defend the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.649 
yeah he's all kinda gun is to defend the
front<00:03:12.549> though<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:12.879> this<00:03:13.030> game<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:13.239> dis<00:03:13.480> con

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
front though now this game is dis con

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.069 
front though now this game is dis con
crazy

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
crazy

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.930

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
proxy as target unit I guess maybe for

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.280 
proxy as target unit I guess maybe for
dry<00:03:26.829> air<00:03:26.859> as<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:28.000> robo<00:03:28.479> he's<00:03:28.629> gonna<00:03:28.750> bust<00:03:29.019> the
