00:00:01.724 --> 00:00:03.101
 Puyol: "You're crack. 

00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:08.526
 After the victory over Zaragoza and the Madrid incident, we will definitely regain the League. " 

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.028
 This one from Twitter is amazing. 

00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:14.422
 I do not understand people whose statements are so inventive. 

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:18.610
 Queca: Oh, yeah, sure. Now everyone agrees. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.731
 Queca! What are you doing? They can see you! 

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.479
 We will certainly do it, we will certainly do it, we will certainly do it. 

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:31.373
 As there were 10 points, they did not say so. 

00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:33.774
 Everyone bore us the end, even místerowi. 

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:35.786
 Míster can also be wrong. 

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:40.046
 Ooooh! Míster is wrong! Guardiola made a mistake! 

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:41.218
 It's deadly! 

00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:43.571
 Go to Roncero, he will like the bank! 

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.327
 Míster may be wrong, but it's still a fucking crack. 

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.116
 Good Carlitos, we know after all. 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.195
 That when you play with the staves, you love to screw your head at height. 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.389
 We score as many goals as maniacs, that there is nothing to play in defense. 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.096
 Guardiola: Dani, I hope you'll be able to play soon. 

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.096
 Watch out, someone is watching! 

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:07.661
 Carles, who did you talk with? 

00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:10.986
 I spoke with myself. 

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:13.726
 We, people from the mountains, are a little bit freaked out. 

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.789
 Pixilated! Pixilated! 

00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:18.427
 Alves: You can not fool me! 

00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:22.106
 He talked with his plush sheep. 

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:23.401
 It's crazy! 

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.446
 It's your tattoos are crazy! 

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:30.511
 It was so cruel! I want to mom! 

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:33.699
 I'm going to Brazil. Mic-mic! 

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:35.846
 Teatrzyna! 

00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:40.570
 Damn it, Carles, you have an ugly voice like me. 

00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:44.760
 By the way, are not you too big to play with such toys? 

00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:46.780
 Maybe you should throw it away? 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.770
 What else? 

00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:53.580
 No, míster, I have her from a small age. 

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:55.220
 It helps me fall asleep. 

00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:59.990
 And as soon as I lay down, I will get up very early. 

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:02.170
 It's the only one I have. 

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:06.880
 Ah, ok, if so ... All right, hold on. 

00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:14.050
 I get up early, get up early. 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.500
 Damn sheep! They almost had us! 

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:17.280
 Ball! 

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.890
 Either you will be good or I will transform you into grilled lamb. 

00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:21.410
 After all, I'm a plush madman! 

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:24.820
 Do not close me! 

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:30.610
 Owcorato! Owcorato! 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.080
 Rexach: Look, Johan, do you think this Queca is real? 

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:43.890
 Cruyff: Charlio, the fact that at your age you do not distinguish a man from a plushie, it is disturbing. 

00:02:46.463 --> 00:02:47.390
 What do you say, Mindundio? 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.440
 Have you seen the tape with the next sketch? 

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:52.620
 No! 

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:54.320
 I can not find her. 

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:57.390
 It's behind you! 

00:02:58.307 --> 00:02:58.940
 Where? 

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.850
 On the other hand! 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.890
 No, the other!
