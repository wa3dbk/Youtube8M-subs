00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:29.819
 with this we are with new lanes 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.979
 new circuits new emotions for 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.690
 the channel we are mainly going to 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:35.340
 leave three races to be 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 have fun with them since they are very 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.170
 parents and is that in playstation3 we 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.210
 they discriminate too much those of 10 by 60 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.649
 so why did I say why do not we go to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.710
 make a video where we have 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.809
 races of the 60 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.359
 are three races one of a loop and very 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.199
 good another that is this and also the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.280
 Last, they are tall but great 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.289
 I mainly wanted to mention that 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.999
 how am I forever alone here with nothing 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.800
 more than doing so I wanted to invite you to 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.719
 subscribe to the channel as much as 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.309
 the crew that I'm going to let you release 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.860
 then with the video so that also 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.290
 let's have a good time spending it in those 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 it is not for others behind is not a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.280
 seen in these races because the truth 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.870
 is that many precision races three 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
 yes they are very good but we also have 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.160
 something in him is the 360 here I do not know who 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.240
 people sing also subscribe 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.530
 to the channel so they are also 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 pending of the videos that we are going to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.830
 go up because we're also going to go up are and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.740
 moment and what better to do it with 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 enough subscribers then 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.500
 mainly since they join the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 crew and also if they subscribe to the channel 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 I would appreciate it too much you know 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 that sharing the video is not 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.710
 IYC and support them discuss what 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.119
 it's too good so let 's go 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.850
 with the races good the first 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.060
 career that he had put is already half 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.740
 made, it would just be missing a few jumps 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.780
 more than I do not know what I have that is the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.180
 acrobat that I pass them and I'm going to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.270
 ceilings today are brothers and I know that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.729
 I have this also that has some 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.460
 high rare media that I skip it 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.930
 if it was the word like that but 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.140
 is that the tall ones are very good 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.500
 this jump that is looping a loop 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.690
 we could call 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.480
 so looking loop and luminous but that 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.520
 it was more or less good and then I already 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.370
 that the race is what follows 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.960
 of it is simply to make the circuit 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.820
 from point to point is a very 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.100
 normal that has some very good jumps 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.260
 and that I recommend them too 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.910
 that we're going to go through a war let's go 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.520
 with the second race at one race 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.530
 is a law in what has been called looking 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.120
 death or lupine impossible as you 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.570
 want to call because the truth is that 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.000
 I do not know if I'm a rookie or if I'm just 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.850
 playing here I do not know group ping is 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.510
 too extravagant to do it 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.160
 in the short term you get for 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.870
 do it then we race 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.730
 simply crosses to make several 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.430
 Laps in the looping give a few laps 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.020
 throughout the circuit and it's all from the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.580
 bet because the truth is too much 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.470
 complicated to me it made me very 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.380
 complicated to perform the looping and 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.050
 dead and death death if I decide and it 's what 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.459
 only one that happens but is very good for 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.470
 that we're going the third race the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.310
 super giant jumps because the truth 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.230
 is that it's very good if I took it 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.430
 I have skipped some parts 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.569
 I knew I had to jump but still 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.940
 decide the race that is very good 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.409
 this jump is more complicated than everything already 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.099
 I was there for half an hour 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:30.760
 trying to pass and pass and after weight 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.590
 after stumbling and how it looked like there 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.959
 I was going to enter and point 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.239
 I said well let's think about it we're not going 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.489
 to make the return because I seriously had 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.760
 about ten minutes without passing the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.190
 heading east and then the saint is coming 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.530
 super giant on the bridge in which what 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.360
 we have to go through there for one of the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.269
 spaces in the openings that we have 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.609
 than having it and it would be almost 100% done 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.680
 the whole good game - simply 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.900
 remind them to join the cross if he has 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.359
 liked the video give them like share 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.120
 the video this and give it in favorites 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.920
 also subscribe to the channel as usual 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.890
 I've been mentioning that has been 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.990
 a little bit my part 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.090
 the neutral because I change it because the 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.610
 really deserves to change it since it is 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.290
 different than what we are 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.880
 referring to online and that's good 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.420
 been everything for today we hope that has 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.019
 liked and until here the video has 2 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.019
 118 out
