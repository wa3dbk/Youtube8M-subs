00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 at the base is not going to put on the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.430
 goal boxes 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.130
 and he says that the players do not know 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.120
 that tomorrow they will know right now the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.480
 doubt is iker or adam 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.680
 in goal neither they know that we go 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.080
 to play 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.330
 The only thing I can say is that what 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.010
 play tomorrow do not play wednesday 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.740
 I want to play tomorrow help 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.180
 governments 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.740
 I wanted to know if I had to recover the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.680
 trust in me that all the posts 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.830
 they are positions of confidence is some 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.880
 of a comfort zone or permanent no 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.190
 it seems to me that it is best for 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.000
 for any player that confidence is 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.540
 important but 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.960
 competitiveness also I trained a 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.320
 small 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.739
 the little one would say and the people in portugal 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.269
 still when I said that my goalie was 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.040
 the best in the world who can be 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.070
 the best in the world has always been 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.210
 well it's not now that I go and go to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.059
 change 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.650
 and it's goalkeepers are the best I imagine 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.020
 that yesterday was a happy day in that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.210
 wardrobe because the real Madrid for 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.890
 fifth consecutive year has the best 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 The world's goalkeeper says so 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.100
 coaches say the players what 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.659
 says the press says the federation of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.780
 football statistics I would like 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.800
 ask him if it's not an excessive luxury 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.760
 dispense with the best logical goalkeeper 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.460
 your classmates is already a question 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.550
 quite similar to yours answering 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 before the entity 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.940
 I can play the league and it 's exactly 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.310
 as if he were 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.340
 in first as if it were a few 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.100
 first classified points I will not 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.870
 think about other competitions I'm going to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.210
 think match by match because it goes more 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.860
 important is to love and my feeling is 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 that my team wants 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.220
 it's great news for us we've 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.980
 been two months in the same is important 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.440
 for competitiveness between the two 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.080
 important because higuain means 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.570
 goals and a team that is building 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.300
 a lot and he's not scoring so many goals 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.990
 there are many people who have written about 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.990
 those in 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.710
 without knowing anything and therefore not me 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.990
 fancy 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.950
 once it is done say the process that we 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.140
 has led to 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.680
 to this decision because we are left with 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.080
 the two smart ones who have written that they have 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.630
 commented on Monday this trip to 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.290
 zurich for the golden ball 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.330
 I do not go I have to work I have 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.920
 I have a party on Wednesday 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.280
 important match for me I 'm going to 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 do
