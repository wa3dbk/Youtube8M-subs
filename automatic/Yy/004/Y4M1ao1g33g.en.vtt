00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.429
 if you play the multiplayer of Crysis 2 you should always play 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.300
 the reviews 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.439
 he knows and likes 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.390
 and collect extras 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.529
 Here is a brief overview how the whole thing works 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.690
 the skills ratings are different 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.720
 in the course of the game 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 that ranges from very simple 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.550
 up to very difficult conditions in many areas very well 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 is suboptimal 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.980
 because a great way around could 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.330
 In addition, this could make their rating 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
 Inability ranges 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.790
 and you can turn your lean off from the individual offers 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.470
 shape 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.500
 depending on how and when he plays the game he keeps the message 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.800
 The judges want agent status from Olper Marketplace 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.240
 Make right side 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.130
 who collects enough of it 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.740
 the last bet that broadcast is richer 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 to 13 degrees 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 Motorcycles, for example, what they always say 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 rek 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.050
 in the whole country 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.230
 will be soon
