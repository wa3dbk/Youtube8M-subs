something that would be easy to drive

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.790 
something that would be easy to drive
that<00:00:21.330> would<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.600> updated<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> new

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.269 
that would be updated with all the new
new<00:00:23.640> technology<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.160> we

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
new technology right and so but we

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.800 
new technology right and so but we
changed<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.820> lot<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.060> things<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:27.689> we

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
changed a lot of things on it but we

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.050 
changed a lot of things on it but we
wanted<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> keep<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.410> still<00:00:28.650> simple<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
wanted to keep it still simple that it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
wanted to keep it still simple that it
would<00:00:30.179> look<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> original<00:00:31.050> car<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
would look like the original car so it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.500 
would look like the original car so it
looks<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.820> should<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.030> sitting<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.450> a
