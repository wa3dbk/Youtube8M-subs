00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.840
 hi everyone how are you today 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:05.740
 I hope you are super super 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.019
 all right 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.580
 helping a little bit hoarse since the day of 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.559
 I'm here today because you can see that I'm going to 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.750
 do my played because I'm going to do 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.610
 exercise in a little while so here 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.470
 you can see and start having the 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.350
 ingredients I'm going to start from 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.199
 I have my super knife I have here 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.449
 a lot of vegetables and we are going to occupy my 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.699
 extractor that is already taught them 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.430
 before is this man is an extractor 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.140
 chewable and the difference is that this one 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.230
 what he's going to do is that I'm going to start 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.820
 push to work let's say all the fruit and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.620
 the vegetable will start to come out here 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.390
 I'm going to teach you a little bit more 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.820
 in this respect because remember that it is very 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.469
 important that they take something before leaving 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.930
 exercising is nothing else to grab 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.079
 to follow the ideal is that so 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.050
 less consume something that gives us energy and 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.539
 the green juice or the non-wheat is the best 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.730
 option you will be able to occupy all 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.110
 these those vitamins and minerals are going to 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.270
 enter directly into our torrent 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.980
 blood will be absorbed and go to 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.400
 reach our cells and we're going to 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.010
 feed completely 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.110
 natural truths let's give that boost 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.940
 we need to exercise and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.100
 Well what better option then do not go 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.590
 Well, here I am starting what 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.710
 is my fruit and with this extract and I already 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.150
 I had commented before they have input 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.300
 much smaller because probably 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.070
 you can not receive too much fruit and 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.680
 very large vegetable because it could not 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.650
 do your function to decorate note then 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.120
 I'm going to start putting the pieces 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.460
 here 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.050
 if they set the size and we're going to start 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.050
 to put the stick 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.780
 tapachula doing well 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.000
 the fiber 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.540
 I had two downtown 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.740
 and they were very good indeed, that's how 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:08.540
 the one that today is taking doing together 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.540
 since July 2013 and I've been two years 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.780
 and the piece 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.780
 to eat 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.959
 they do not know how it's going 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.930
 because here I have everything what my 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.570
 split fruit and vegetables if you take a 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.220
 little bit more of time but it's worth the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.220
 tempered now what difference 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.480
 we entered the super good input 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.330
 this extractor what is going to do is that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.950
 when using to be slow they need is 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.440
 much slower than us extra 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.110
 commercial does not make as much noise is going to 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.670
 produce much less amount of heat and 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.590
 to produce less heat because 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.580
 obviously the speed is slower 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.580
 they also call him 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.610
 they will lose less amount of vitamins 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.510
 forgiveness for the beetle is always a 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.940
 little bit more noise like the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.930
 carrot because obviously it costs a 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.480
 little bit the crush what inside brings 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.430
 a roller reach them here first but 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.650
 he did not say no that he escapes everything 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.910
 what is the fruit and the vegetable let's say that 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.910
 the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.079
 in this way they begin to separate the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.079
 cube of the board 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.440
 I'm about to finish I remember them 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.470
 which it is what I wore this the last by 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.770
 if they want to do it, it was half 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.940
 beet had a whole lemon carries 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.160
 now three chard leaves a chayote 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:59.590
 I was carrying a pumpkin an apple one 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.600
 pear and a cucumber this juice is for 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.090
 four people and more or less is a 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.400
 cup what I'm going to give each to each 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.920
 person so you can see what 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.410
 ideal is that they always have a maximum 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 fruit per person in this case will not be 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.160
 only two if it is for four people 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.900
 we do not need more because the beetle 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.790
 by itself is also a little bit good is 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.980
 pretty sweet because with this is 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.560
 enough and I'll finish already what 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.390
 more and sorry for so much noise but good 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.690
 here it is now then right now no longer 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.889
 I'm going to put in the glasses and ready 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.199
 to drink 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.689
 Well, here we already have our 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.080
 only we have to put their juices 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.470
 straw 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.090
 These stainless steel posts are 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.699
 revisable and they buy us 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.440
 on a page on facebook but it's already 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.660
 long this page and habitat not 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.190
 is selling us but it's something that 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.290
 you are investigated there are many many 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.020
 pages on facebook that sell these 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.000
 glasses even the ones themselves good 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.680
 I hope you liked this 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.139
 it's just an introduction to how 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.360
 I do, I was nourished, played before I went to 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.729
 to exercise now I'm going right now I'm going 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.130
 to dance I'm not going to do zumba and like 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.440
 I remember never leave without breakfast 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.990
 must take something for me the option 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.330
 ideal is the nu wheat this I feel with 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.510
 a lot of energy I feel very well and I can 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.900
 Well, do everything I have to do 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.400
 about exercise and others is taking me 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.870
