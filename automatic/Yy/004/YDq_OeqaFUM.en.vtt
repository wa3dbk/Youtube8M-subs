moving on to what particular lenses you
should<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.320> using<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.800> let's<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
should be using so let's do it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.900 
should be using so let's do it
what<00:00:21.300> lenses<00:00:21.840> should<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.650> using<00:00:23.010> well<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
what lenses should I be using well the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.429 
what lenses should I be using well the
first<00:00:24.119> thing<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.390> should<00:00:24.570> know<00:00:24.660> about<00:00:24.810> lenses

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
first thing you should know about lenses

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.859 
first thing you should know about lenses
is<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.890> lenses<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.910> always<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> great

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
is that lenses are always a great

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.540 
is that lenses are always a great
investment<00:00:28.439> unlike<00:00:28.830> your<00:00:28.949> camera<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.429> I

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
investment unlike your camera which I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.980 
investment unlike your camera which I
talked<00:00:29.730> about<00:00:29.820> last<00:00:30.119> lesson<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:30.960> will

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
talked about last lesson which will

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
talked about last lesson which will
probably<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.920> style<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.520> very

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
probably go out of style very very

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.540 
probably go out of style very very
shortly<00:00:33.260> lenses<00:00:34.260> don't<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
shortly lenses don't really do that and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
shortly lenses don't really do that and
so<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> very<00:00:36.540> good<00:00:36.780> piece<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so if you have a very good piece of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.740 
so if you have a very good piece of
glass<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:38.010> last<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.640> years

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
glass that can last you for years

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
glass that can last you for years
decades<00:00:39.750> even<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.219> good<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
decades even so it's really good to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.040 
decades even so it's really good to
invest<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.030> good<00:00:42.180> lenses<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
invest in good lenses if you have the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
invest in good lenses if you have the
money<00:00:43.200> put<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.950> rather<00:00:44.550> than<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
money put it there rather than in the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
money put it there rather than in the
camera<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:46.050> you're<00:00:46.170> anything<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.590> me

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
camera but if you're anything like me

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.560 
camera but if you're anything like me
you<00:00:47.160> probably<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.670> hundreds<00:00:48.450> upon

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you probably don't have hundreds upon

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.330 
you probably don't have hundreds upon
thousands<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.260> dollars<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> throw<00:00:49.829> around<00:00:49.920> on

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
thousands of dollars to throw around on

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.639 
thousands of dollars to throw around on
camera<00:00:50.969> gear<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.780> need<00:00:51.989> lens<00:00:52.289> choices

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
camera gear and so we need lens choices

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
camera gear and so we need lens choices
that<00:00:52.980> offer<00:00:53.160> us<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.670> flexibility<00:00:54.420> while

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that offer us the flexibility while

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
that offer us the flexibility while
still<00:00:55.140> giving<00:00:55.289> us<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> highest<00:00:56.070> quality<00:00:56.430> we

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
still giving us the highest quality we

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
still giving us the highest quality we
can<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.300> let's<00:00:57.480> look<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.170> particular

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
can so let's look into the particular

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.400 
can so let's look into the particular
different<00:00:59.219> lenses<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.079> into

complexed<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> zoom<00:01:46.860> lens<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.700> prime

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
complexed as a zoom lens because prime

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.910 
complexed as a zoom lens because prime
lens<00:01:48.240> means<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.990> they're<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> fixed<00:01:49.619> length

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
lens means that they're a fixed length

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.740 
lens means that they're a fixed length
which<00:01:50.460> means<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.820> can't<00:01:51.030> zoom<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.509> or<00:01:51.600> in

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
which means you can't zoom them in or in

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
how sad not really but that's the one

how sad not really but that's the one
thing<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.560> should<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> prime<00:01:59.100> lens<00:01:59.250> is

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
thing you should know the prime lens is

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.399 
thing you should know the prime lens is
they<00:01:59.490> don't<00:01:59.610> zoom<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.479> here's<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
they don't zoom in or out here's a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.920

couple things that you should know about
prime<00:02:03.930> lenses<00:02:04.320> number<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.759> should

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
prime lenses number one you should

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.370 
prime lenses number one you should
always<00:02:06.060> buy<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.420> used<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.079> did<00:02:07.229> with

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
always buy them used like I did with

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.669 
always buy them used like I did with
this<00:02:07.500> guy<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.680> ebay<00:02:08.160> forty<00:02:08.670> five<00:02:08.819> dollars

this guy on ebay forty five dollars

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.990 
this guy on ebay forty five dollars
they're<00:02:10.679> incredibly<00:02:11.129> inexpensive<00:02:11.400> because

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
they're incredibly inexpensive because

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
they're incredibly inexpensive because
they're<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.450> great<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:12.690> fatah

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
they're not so great for fatah

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.200 
they're not so great for fatah
rafi<00:02:13.740> if<00:02:13.890> you're<00:02:14.040> familiar<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.550> photography

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
rafi if you're familiar with photography

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.700 
rafi if you're familiar with photography
one<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> key<00:02:15.960> things<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.560> usually

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
one of the key things that you usually

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.700 
one of the key things that you usually
need<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> ability<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.360> zoom<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.350> out

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
need is the ability to zoom in and out

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.350 
need is the ability to zoom in and out
and<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.220> prime<00:02:20.490> lenses<00:02:20.790> don't<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.150> that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
and because prime lenses don't have that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.260 
and because prime lenses don't have that
ability<00:02:21.570> they're<00:02:22.260> not<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.920> popular

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
ability they're not really that popular

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.460 
ability they're not really that popular
so<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.510> few<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> us<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.900> are<00:02:25.110> using<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
so for the few of us that are using the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.800 
so for the few of us that are using the
video<00:02:25.680> function<00:02:25.890> within<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.910> DSLR<00:02:27.390> cameras

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
video function within the DSLR cameras

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.540 
video function within the DSLR cameras
this<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.230> big<00:02:28.500> way<00:02:28.710> for<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.490> to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
this is a big way for you and I to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.820 
this is a big way for you and I to
capitalize<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.210> this<00:02:30.540> because<00:02:30.990> because<00:02:31.710> of

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
capitalize on this because because of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.430 
capitalize on this because because of
their<00:02:32.040> lack<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.970> demand<00:02:33.270> they're<00:02:33.960> incredibly

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
their lack of demand they're incredibly

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.730 
their lack of demand they're incredibly
inexpensive<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.610> what's<00:02:36.480> up<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:36.720> eBay<00:02:37.140> that's

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
inexpensive so what's up on eBay that's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.390 
inexpensive so what's up on eBay that's
the<00:02:37.830> place<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.010> go

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the place to go

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.420 
the place to go
secondly<00:02:39.270> because<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> mentioned<00:02:40.500> prime

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
secondly because as I mentioned prime

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.730 
secondly because as I mentioned prime
lenses<00:02:41.790> can't<00:02:42.090> zoom<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.230> manually

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
lenses can't zoom you have to manually

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.850 
lenses can't zoom you have to manually
adjust<00:02:44.180> your<00:02:45.180> body<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.720> position<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.650> get<00:02:46.800> the

adjust your body and position to get the

adjust your body and position to get the
right<00:02:47.190> framing<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.480> want<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> zoom

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
right framing that you want with a zoom

right framing that you want with a zoom

in<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.300> zoom<00:02:51.360> out<00:02:51.660> but<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.500> doesn't<00:02:52.680> really

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
in and zoom out but that doesn't really

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.200 
in and zoom out but that doesn't really
teach<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.340> things<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.730> need<00:02:53.970> about

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
teach you the things that you need about

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.690 
teach you the things that you need about
framing<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.110> positioning<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.460> rely

framing and positioning and you can rely

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.400

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
skills prime lenses force you to develop

your own skills and thirdly prime lenses

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.590 
your own skills and thirdly prime lenses
are<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> lot<00:03:04.710> faster<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:06.210> basically<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
are a lot faster that's basically a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.910 
are a lot faster that's basically a
camera<00:03:06.840> term<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.290> means<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.680> they<00:03:07.770> can

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
camera term that means that they can

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.890 
camera term that means that they can
open<00:03:08.280> up<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.580> lot<00:03:08.880> wider<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.480> let<00:03:09.660> more<00:03:09.870> light

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
open up a lot wider and let more light

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900 
open up a lot wider and let more light
in<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.520> wider<00:03:11.700> they

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
in and because of that the wider they

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.360 
in and because of that the wider they
open<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.630> more<00:03:12.810> beautiful<00:03:13.380> bokeh<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
shallow depth of field you can get if

you can't open the lens wide enough it
won't<00:03:18.959> get<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.350> nice<00:03:19.590> super<00:03:20.489> super<00:03:21.030> super

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
won't get the nice super super super

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.150 
won't get the nice super super super
shallow<00:03:21.720> depth<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.110> field<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.860> might<00:03:23.040> be

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
shallow depth of field you might be

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.680 
shallow depth of field you might be
aiming<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.030> other<00:03:24.180> nice<00:03:24.420> thing

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
aiming for and the other nice thing

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.870 
aiming for and the other nice thing
about<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:25.680> lens<00:03:26.040> being<00:03:26.250> able<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.520> open<00:03:26.670> up

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
about a lens being able to open up

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.430 
about a lens being able to open up
really<00:03:27.030> wide<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.840> allow<00:03:27.930> more

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
really wide is that it can allow more

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.440 
really wide is that it can allow more
light<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.040> when<00:03:29.459> you're<00:03:29.580> shooting<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:30.060> places

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
light and when you're shooting in places

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.570 
light and when you're shooting in places
that<00:03:30.480> aren't<00:03:30.690> properly<00:03:31.020> lit<00:03:31.320> shooting<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.160> a

that aren't properly lit shooting in a
dark<00:03:33.300> area<00:03:33.600> or<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:34.110> night<00:03:34.380> having<00:03:35.130> that

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
dark area or at night having that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.640 
dark area or at night having that
flexibility<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.390> get<00:03:36.900> as<00:03:37.050> much<00:03:37.320> light<00:03:37.620> as

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
flexibility to get as much light as

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.860 
flexibility to get as much light as
possible<00:03:38.400> into<00:03:38.550> your<00:03:38.700> lens<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.150> great<00:03:39.570> thing

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
possible into your lens is a great thing

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.100 
possible into your lens is a great thing
and<00:03:40.220> number<00:03:41.220> three<00:03:41.520> zoom<00:03:42.150> lenses<00:03:42.630> now<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.989> I

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
and number three zoom lenses now like I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.630 
and number three zoom lenses now like I
said<00:03:43.170> zoom<00:03:43.800> lenses<00:03:44.160> are<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> lot<00:03:44.459> more

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
said zoom lenses are a lot more

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.550 
said zoom lenses are a lot more
expensive<00:03:45.120> than<00:03:45.540> primes<00:03:45.810> because<00:03:46.440> they're

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
expensive than primes because they're

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.170 
expensive than primes because they're
mechanically<00:03:47.040> complex<00:03:47.190> because<00:03:47.850> they<00:03:48.000> can

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
mechanically complex because they can

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.210 
mechanically complex because they can
shoot<00:03:48.450> at<00:03:48.630> different<00:03:49.170> focal<00:03:49.530> lengths<00:03:49.769> this

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
shoot at different focal lengths this

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.360 
shoot at different focal lengths this
one<00:03:50.430> right<00:03:50.580> here<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> Tokina<00:03:51.750> 11<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> 16<00:03:52.620> 2.8

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
one right here is a Tokina 11 to 16 2.8

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.840 
one right here is a Tokina 11 to 16 2.8
cost<00:03:53.940> me<00:03:54.090> about<00:03:54.180> $700<00:03:55.170> compared<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.190> my<00:03:56.340> Nikon

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
cost me about $700 compared to my Nikon

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.960 
cost me about $700 compared to my Nikon
Nikkor<00:03:57.180> 50<00:03:57.959> mil<00:03:58.220> 1.4<00:03:59.220> which<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.580> just<00:03:59.790> showed

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
Nikkor 50 mil 1.4 which I just showed

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.620 
Nikkor 50 mil 1.4 which I just showed
you<00:04:00.150> which<00:04:00.510> cost<00:04:00.780> about<00:04:00.959> 45<00:04:01.709> on<00:04:02.130> line<00:04:02.940> used<00:04:03.330> on

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
you which cost about 45 on line used on

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.550 
you which cost about 45 on line used on
ebay<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:05.120> they're<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> lot<00:04:06.450> more<00:04:06.480> expensive<00:04:06.989> but

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
ebay so they're a lot more expensive but

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.350 
ebay so they're a lot more expensive but
they<00:04:07.890> offer<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.310> flexibility<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.209> nice

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
they offer the flexibility so it's nice

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.270 
they offer the flexibility so it's nice
to<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.930> said<00:04:10.110> I<00:04:10.140> do<00:04:10.260> have<00:04:10.410> one<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.190> if

different<00:04:18.239> types<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.600> lenses<00:04:18.750> begs<00:04:19.260> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
different types of lenses begs the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.279 
different types of lenses begs the
question<00:04:19.830> which<00:04:20.040> lens<00:04:20.489> should<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.359> buy<00:04:21.570> well

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
you need to know the crop factor of your

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.090 
you need to know the crop factor of your
particular<00:04:28.690> camera<00:04:29.050> if<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:29.800> don't<00:04:29.920> know<00:04:29.980> what

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
a crop factor is go ahead and watch the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.140 
a crop factor is go ahead and watch the
next<00:04:31.960> lesson<00:04:32.080> first<00:04:33.070> which<00:04:33.400> we'll<00:04:33.580> talk<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.880> lot

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
next lesson first which we'll talk a lot

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.820 
next lesson first which we'll talk a lot
about<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.720> help<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:34.960> understand<00:04:35.380> what

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
about that to help you understand what

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.710 
about that to help you understand what
it<00:04:35.950> is<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.760> now<00:04:36.850> once<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.210> know<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.450> crop

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
it is so now once you know the crop

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.480 
it is so now once you know the crop
factor<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.410> your<00:04:38.560> particular<00:04:39.010> camera<00:04:39.220> these

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
factor of your particular camera these

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.460 
factor of your particular camera these
are<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.910> two<00:04:40.060> lenses<00:04:40.420> I<00:04:40.480> suggest<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.200> getting

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
are the two lenses I suggest you getting

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.860 
are the two lenses I suggest you getting
I<00:04:41.590> suggest<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.250> portrait<00:04:42.760> lens<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.330> a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
I suggest a portrait lens and a

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.800 
I suggest a portrait lens and a
wide-angle<00:04:44.350> lens<00:04:44.920> for<00:04:45.700> video<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.120> good<00:04:46.330> lens<00:04:46.540> is

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
wide-angle lens for video a good lens is

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.690 
wide-angle lens for video a good lens is
a<00:04:46.840> 50<00:04:47.290> millimeter<00:04:47.710> lens<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.250> reason<00:04:48.550> for

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
a 50 millimeter lens and the reason for

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.930 
a 50 millimeter lens and the reason for
that<00:04:48.820> is<00:04:49.030> because<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.630> 50<00:04:50.020> millimeter<00:04:50.230> lens

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
that is because a 50 millimeter lens

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.000 
that is because a 50 millimeter lens
frames<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.570> shot<00:04:52.840> in<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.230> very<00:04:53.260> similar<00:04:53.710> way<00:04:53.980> to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
frames the shot in a very similar way to

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.100 
frames the shot in a very similar way to
the<00:04:54.160> way<00:04:54.250> humans<00:04:54.820> see<00:04:55.000> things<00:04:55.330> but<00:04:55.960> remember

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
the way humans see things but remember

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.530 
the way humans see things but remember
just<00:04:56.620> because<00:04:56.920> it's<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.430> film<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.850> 50<00:04:58.180> millimeter

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
just because it's a film a 50 millimeter

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.960 
just because it's a film a 50 millimeter
lens<00:04:58.600> doesn't<00:04:59.470> mean<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.800> will<00:04:59.890> act<00:05:00.130> like<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.610> 50

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
lens doesn't mean it will act like a 50

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.820 
lens doesn't mean it will act like a 50
millimeter<00:05:01.150> lens<00:05:01.630> on<00:05:01.840> your<00:05:01.900> particular

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
millimeter lens on your particular

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.910 
millimeter lens on your particular
camera<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.560> camera<00:05:05.800> I'm<00:05:05.860> using

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
camera so the the the camera I'm using

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.740 
camera so the the the camera I'm using
right<00:05:06.280> now<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.430> shoot<00:05:06.790> this<00:05:06.970> little<00:05:07.150> video<00:05:07.510> is

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
right now to shoot this little video is

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.860 
right now to shoot this little video is
the<00:05:08.470> gh<00:05:08.740> 2<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.280> gh<00:05:09.520> 2<00:05:09.790> has<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.150> crop<00:05:10.600> factor

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
the gh 2 and the gh 2 has a crop factor

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.670 
the gh 2 and the gh 2 has a crop factor
of<00:05:11.230> 1.8<00:05:12.220> so<00:05:12.760> if<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.150> put<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.360> 50<00:05:13.570> millimeter<00:05:13.870> lands

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
of 1.8 so if I put a 50 millimeter lands

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.740 
of 1.8 so if I put a 50 millimeter lands
on<00:05:14.920> the<00:05:15.040> gh<00:05:15.280> 2<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:16.030> would<00:05:16.180> become<00:05:16.480> something

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
on the gh 2 it would become something

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.740 
on the gh 2 it would become something
like<00:05:17.110> an<00:05:17.350> 85<00:05:18.000> millimeter<00:05:19.000> lens<00:05:19.240> or<00:05:19.420> something

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
like an 85 millimeter lens or something

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.960 
like an 85 millimeter lens or something
close<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:20.350> so<00:05:20.860> if<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.340> want<00:05:21.580> something<00:05:21.790> to

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
close to that so if I want something to

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.240 
close to that so if I want something to
look<00:05:22.150> like<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.330> 50<00:05:22.720> ohm<00:05:22.810> IgH<00:05:23.170> -<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:23.650> have<00:05:24.070> to

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
look like a 50 ohm IgH - I have to

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.430 
look like a 50 ohm IgH - I have to
consider<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.700> crop<00:05:25.090> factor<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:26.050> do<00:05:26.260> for

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
consider the crop factor and you do for

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.570 
consider the crop factor and you do for
your<00:05:26.560> camera<00:05:26.860> as<00:05:26.950> well<00:05:27.100> unless<00:05:27.400> you're

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
your camera as well unless you're

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.760 
your camera as well unless you're
shooting<00:05:27.850> on<00:05:27.910> a<00:05:27.970> full<00:05:28.180> frame<00:05:28.360> camera<00:05:28.450> like<00:05:29.320> the

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
shooting on a full frame camera like the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.330 
shooting on a full frame camera like the
5d<00:05:30.010> mark<00:05:30.400> ii<00:05:30.430> so<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:32.050> camera<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.980> lens<00:05:33.100> that<00:05:33.280> I

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
5d mark ii so the camera the lens that I

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.060 
5d mark ii so the camera the lens that I
got<00:05:33.550> for<00:05:33.730> my<00:05:33.790> gh2<00:05:34.120> for<00:05:34.570> a<00:05:34.600> 50<00:05:34.930> mil<00:05:35.110> was<00:05:35.500> actually

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
got for my gh2 for a 50 mil was actually

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.760 
got for my gh2 for a 50 mil was actually
a<00:05:36.100> Nikon<00:05:36.730> Nick<00:05:36.970> or<00:05:37.150> twenty<00:05:37.660> eight<00:05:37.900> two<00:05:38.560> point

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
a Nikon Nick or twenty eight two point

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.170 
a Nikon Nick or twenty eight two point
eight<00:05:38.980> very<00:05:39.400> good<00:05:39.490> very<00:05:39.790> sharp<00:05:40.120> very

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
eight very good very sharp very

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.570 
eight very good very sharp very
inexpensive<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:41.169> so<00:05:41.560> when<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.740> put<00:05:41.980> that<00:05:42.220> on

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
inexpensive and so when I put that on

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.630 
inexpensive and so when I put that on
the<00:05:42.970> gh2<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.660> comes<00:05:43.870> very<00:05:43.990> close<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:45.040> 50<00:05:45.430> mil

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
the gh2 it comes very close to a 50 mil

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.790 
the gh2 it comes very close to a 50 mil
so<00:05:45.910> always<00:05:46.150> remember<00:05:46.450> consider<00:05:47.260> your<00:05:47.530> crop

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
so always remember consider your crop

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.400 
so always remember consider your crop
factor<00:05:48.040> so<00:05:48.910> now<00:05:49.150> once<00:05:49.360> you<00:05:49.510> have<00:05:49.690> your<00:05:49.990> fifty

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
factor so now once you have your fifty

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.290 
factor so now once you have your fifty

people where you have a profile on them

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.080 
people where you have a profile on them
like<00:05:56.140> this<00:05:56.290> right<00:05:56.530> now<00:05:56.560> so<00:05:56.850> baptism<00:05:57.850> video

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
like this right now so baptism video

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.050 
like this right now so baptism video
interview<00:05:59.070> testimony<00:06:00.070> video<00:06:00.550> announcements

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
interview testimony video announcements

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.490 
interview testimony video announcements
anything<00:06:01.390> like<00:06:01.540> that<00:06:01.570> that<00:06:01.870> has<00:06:01.990> a<00:06:02.020> profile

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
anything like that that has a profile

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.680 
anything like that that has a profile
and<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.680> person<00:06:03.010> use<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.640> 50mm<00:06:04.120> because<00:06:04.390> like<00:06:04.570> I

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
and a person use the 50mm because like I

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.990 
and a person use the 50mm because like I
said<00:06:04.750> it's<00:06:05.260> very<00:06:05.380> similar<00:06:05.860> to<00:06:06.280> how<00:06:06.400> we<00:06:06.460> see<00:06:06.880> the

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
said it's very similar to how we see the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.820 
said it's very similar to how we see the
world<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:07.360> so<00:06:07.480> it's<00:06:07.630> very<00:06:07.780> familiar<00:06:08.350> when

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
world and so it's very familiar when

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.710 
world and so it's very familiar when
it's<00:06:08.980> on<00:06:09.100> the<00:06:09.160> screen<00:06:09.370> the<00:06:10.090> second<00:06:10.450> lens<00:06:10.600> I

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
it's on the screen the second lens I

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.230 
it's on the screen the second lens I
suggest<00:06:11.169> is<00:06:11.350> a<00:06:11.680> good<00:06:11.919> wide-angle<00:06:12.730> lens<00:06:12.910> and

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
suggest is a good wide-angle lens and

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.810 
suggest is a good wide-angle lens and
like<00:06:13.720> I<00:06:13.840> said<00:06:13.900> my<00:06:14.200> crop<00:06:14.470> factor<00:06:14.650> on<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.100> gh2<00:06:15.370> is

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
like I said my crop factor on the gh2 is

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.090 
like I said my crop factor on the gh2 is
very<00:06:16.540> very<00:06:16.810> big<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.200> I<00:06:17.230> had<00:06:17.440> to<00:06:17.560> get<00:06:17.710> as<00:06:17.830> why<00:06:18.040> the

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
very very big so I had to get as why the

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.430 
very very big so I had to get as why the
lens<00:06:18.460> I<00:06:18.610> could<00:06:18.880> or<00:06:19.120> it<00:06:19.900> wouldn't<00:06:20.169> have<00:06:20.290> turned

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
lens I could or it wouldn't have turned

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.590 
lens I could or it wouldn't have turned
out<00:06:20.620> wide<00:06:20.830> at<00:06:20.980> all<00:06:21.100> so<00:06:21.370> like<00:06:21.790> I<00:06:21.910> said<00:06:21.970> -<00:06:22.330> Keena

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
out wide at all so like I said - Keena

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.650 
out wide at all so like I said - Keena
11<00:06:23.050> is<00:06:23.169> 16<00:06:23.560> 2.8<00:06:24.130> that<00:06:24.610> turns<00:06:24.880> out<00:06:25.120> with<00:06:25.480> the

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
11 is 16 2.8 that turns out with the

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.900 
11 is 16 2.8 that turns out with the
crop<00:06:25.840> factor<00:06:26.020> on<00:06:26.290> the<00:06:26.380> gh2<00:06:26.650> -<00:06:27.040> about<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.490> twenty

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
crop factor on the gh2 - about a twenty

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.940 
crop factor on the gh2 - about a twenty
to<00:06:28.030> thirty<00:06:28.330> millimeter<00:06:28.810> lens<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.410> this<00:06:29.800> is

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
to thirty millimeter lens and this is

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.020 
to thirty millimeter lens and this is
what<00:06:30.070> you're<00:06:30.190> going<00:06:30.280> to<00:06:30.340> use<00:06:30.400> the<00:06:30.820> wide-angle

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
what you're going to use the wide-angle

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.390 
what you're going to use the wide-angle
lens<00:06:31.570> for<00:06:31.900> landscape<00:06:32.560> shots<00:06:32.800> anything

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
lens for landscape shots anything

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.270 
lens for landscape shots anything
without<00:06:34.090> people<00:06:34.860> wide-angle<00:06:35.860> lenses<00:06:36.130> are

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
without people wide-angle lenses are

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.060
