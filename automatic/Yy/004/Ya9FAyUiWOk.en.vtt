00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.199 
look at the trunk space chunky is pretty
heavy<00:03:23.190> because<00:03:23.489> we<00:03:23.700> have<00:03:23.790> actually<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> wheel

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
heavy because we have actually a wheel

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.170 
heavy because we have actually a wheel
on<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> got<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.050> give<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.350> some<00:03:25.440> effort

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
on it so you got to give it some effort

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.449 
on it so you got to give it some effort
here's<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.300> chunk<00:03:27.650> literally<00:03:28.650> no<00:03:28.890> space<00:03:29.220> back

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459

here
this<00:03:30.570> car<00:03:30.750> would<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:30.989> horrible<00:03:31.290> if<00:03:31.380> your

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
this car would be horrible if your

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
chocolate girl she's in it especially if

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.160 
chocolate girl she's in it especially if
you<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.330> people<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.810> because<00:03:34.050> it

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
you have more people in it because it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.140 
you have more people in it because it
not<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.380> able<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.560> fit<00:03:34.709> anything<00:03:35.090> like<00:03:36.090> I
