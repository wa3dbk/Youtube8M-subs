00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820 
seem to do pretty well here and i'm
using<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.719> FAL<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.320> fails<00:00:10.500> back

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
using the the FAL that fails back

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.900 
using the the FAL that fails back
although<00:00:11.190> now<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.429> supposed<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
although now it's supposed to be the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.810 
although now it's supposed to be the
sm58<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.960> modern<00:00:13.799> version<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.549> fail

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820

sm58 the modern version of that fail
which<00:00:15.059> honestly<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.480> think<00:00:15.599> looks<00:00:15.990> terrible<00:00:16.800> in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
which honestly I think looks terrible in

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
long-range assault rifle yeah i think it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
long-range assault rifle yeah i think it
was<00:00:37.800> basically<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.219> only<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:39.000> else<00:00:39.149> was

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
was basically the only what else was

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.799 
was basically the only what else was
there<00:00:39.300> there<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> g11<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.680> FAL<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.399> the

there there was the g11 the FAL and the
alright<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> m16<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.890> there's<00:00:44.879> another<00:00:45.030> long

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270

rich guy on the m14 and FAL is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
rich guy on the m14 and FAL is
definitely<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> most<00:00:48.270> useful<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> those

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
definitely the most useful out of those

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.040 
definitely the most useful out of those
and<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.620> easiest<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> use<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.579> yeah<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you can actually use it pretty well up

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510 
you can actually use it pretty well up
close<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.960> black<00:00:55.230> ops<00:00:55.379> 2<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.129> equip

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
in that scene Vidya that was the only

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.440 
in that scene Vidya that was the only
thing<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.070> actually<00:01:59.219> used<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> cz-75<00:02:00.299> with

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
thing I actually used the cz-75 with

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.230 
thing I actually used the cz-75 with
extended<00:02:00.840> mags<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> don't<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
extended mags and the I don't get the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.670 
extended mags and the I don't get the
full<00:02:03.390> auto<00:02:03.600> attachment<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.320> gun<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.619> was

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
full auto attachment for that gun it was

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.170 
full auto attachment for that gun it was
so<00:02:04.829> useless<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.250> could<00:02:05.369> fire<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.579> faster<00:02:06.060> on

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
so useless you could fire it faster on

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
so useless you could fire it faster on
Serato<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> could<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> full

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
Serato and then you could have a full

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.480 
Serato and then you could have a full
auto

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
auto

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.670 
auto
alright<00:02:09.270> that's<00:02:09.720> kind<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> pointless<00:02:10.350> because

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
alright that's kind of pointless because

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.500 
alright that's kind of pointless because
some<00:02:10.980> people<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.730> trophy<00:02:11.910> trigger

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
some people have that trophy trigger

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.710 
some people have that trophy trigger
finger<00:02:12.840> okay<00:02:13.410> but<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.880> uh<00:02:14.910> there<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
finger okay but there is uh there is a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.210 
finger okay but there is uh there is a
full<00:02:15.900> auto<00:02:16.050> pistol<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.620> game<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.190> is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
full auto pistol in this game and it is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.800 
full auto pistol in this game and it is
definitely<00:02:17.640> more<00:02:18.000> useful<00:02:18.390> than<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.630> full

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
definitely more useful than the full

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.280 
definitely more useful than the full
auto<00:02:18.990> cz-75<00:02:19.770> was<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.480> not<00:02:21.480> sure<00:02:21.750> how<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.960> feel

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
auto cz-75 was and not sure how I feel

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.020 
auto cz-75 was and not sure how I feel
about<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.770> it's<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:23.250> like<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.610> good<00:02:23.850> as<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
about that it's not like as good as a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.610 
about that it's not like as good as a
main<00:02:24.300> gun<00:02:24.570> but<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.110> definitely<00:02:25.290> use<00:02:25.500> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
main gun but you can definitely use it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.210 
main gun but you can definitely use it
better<00:02:26.340> than<00:02:26.520> what<00:02:26.670> i'm<00:02:26.760> using<00:02:26.940> now<00:02:28.070> it's<00:02:29.070> just

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
better than what i'm using now it's just

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.340 
better than what i'm using now it's just
really<00:02:29.700> easy<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.060> use<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.840> reason<00:02:31.080> not<00:02:31.290> a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
really easy to use and the reason not a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.200 
really easy to use and the reason not a
big<00:02:31.800> fan<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.490> because<00:02:32.610> i<00:02:32.850> prefer<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
big fan of that is because i prefer to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.610 
big fan of that is because i prefer to
be<00:02:33.360> able<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.600> use<00:02:33.750> pretty<00:02:33.960> much<00:02:34.020> all<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.410> guns

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
be able to use pretty much all the guns

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620 
be able to use pretty much all the guns
and<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.250> gives<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.580> no<00:02:36.120> reason<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.540> use

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
and then that gives you no reason to use

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.730 
and then that gives you no reason to use
anything<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.530> pistol<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.620> get<00:02:40.620> all

much<00:03:46.050> i<00:03:46.230> am<00:03:46.350> pretty<00:03:46.560> sure<00:03:46.650> they<00:03:47.280> got<00:03:47.400> rid<00:03:47.490> of

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
much i am pretty sure they got rid of

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.920 
much i am pretty sure they got rid of
claymores<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.180> they<00:03:48.240> added<00:03:48.510> bouncing

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
claymores and they added bouncing

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.590 
claymores and they added bouncing
Betties<00:03:49.170> now<00:03:49.290> which<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.460> basically<00:03:51.330> i'm

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
Betties now which is basically i'm

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.060 
Betties now which is basically i'm
pretty<00:03:51.960> sure<00:03:52.110> their<00:03:52.290> reasoning<00:03:52.860> for<00:03:53.010> doing

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
pretty sure their reasoning for doing

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.650 
pretty sure their reasoning for doing
that<00:03:53.430> was<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.640> get<00:03:53.850> people<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.120> try<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.390> stop

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
that was to get people to try to stop

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.500 
that was to get people to try to stop
you<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.260> using<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:55.920> camp<00:03:56.580> basically<00:03:57.240> put

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
you know using it to camp basically put

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.030 
you know using it to camp basically put
it<00:03:57.600> behind<00:03:57.720> them<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.350> bouncing<00:03:58.650> buddies<00:03:58.890> have

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
it behind them but bouncing buddies have

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.410 
it behind them but bouncing buddies have
an<00:03:59.160> area<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.490> effect<00:03:59.610> no<00:03:59.910> matter<00:04:00.060> where<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.390> go

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
an area of effect no matter where you go

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.910 
an area of effect no matter where you go
you're<00:04:00.690> gonna<00:04:00.750> set<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.140> off<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.530> doesn't

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
you're gonna set it off so it doesn't

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.410 
you're gonna set it off so it doesn't
matter<00:04:01.980> anyway<00:04:02.130> people<00:04:02.820> still<00:04:02.970> use<00:04:03.150> those<00:04:03.270> to

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
matter anyway people still use those to

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.710 
matter anyway people still use those to
camp<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:04.730> thought<00:04:05.730> was<00:04:05.910> better<00:04:06.120> than<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.540> clan

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
camp I thought was better than the clan

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.420 
camp I thought was better than the clan
war<00:04:06.930> because<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.260> hits<00:04:07.410> all<00:04:07.500> around<00:04:07.890> yeah<00:04:08.250> that

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
war because it hits all around yeah that

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.830 
war because it hits all around yeah that
was<00:04:08.520> that's<00:04:08.610> what<00:04:08.760> i<00:04:08.820> was<00:04:08.880> saying<00:04:09.120> i<00:04:09.300> know<00:04:09.420> but

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
was that's what i was saying i know but

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.160 
was that's what i was saying i know but
i<00:04:09.900> mean<00:04:10.580> people's<00:04:11.580> logic<00:04:11.730> i<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.540> heard<00:04:12.930> someone

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
i mean people's logic i I heard someone

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.480 
i mean people's logic i I heard someone
try<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.410> explain<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:13.890> me<00:04:13.980> earlier<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.430> I

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
try to explain that to me earlier and I

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.719 
try to explain that to me earlier and I
basically<00:04:15.030> said<00:04:15.450> what<00:04:15.660> you<00:04:15.690> said<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:16.170> I

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
basically said what you said but I

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.010 
basically said what you said but I
understood<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.910> reasoning<00:04:18.299> though<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.780> is

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
understood the reasoning though it is

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.339 
understood the reasoning though it is
flawed

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
flawed

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.830 
flawed

this<00:04:24.050> thing<00:04:25.810> this<00:04:26.810> thing<00:04:26.870> is<00:04:27.199> really<00:04:27.349> fun<00:04:27.620> to

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
this thing this thing is really fun to

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.680 
this thing this thing is really fun to
use<00:04:27.949> because<00:04:28.130> people<00:04:28.580> panic<00:04:29.000> when<00:04:29.330> they<00:04:29.479> walk

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
use because people panic when they walk

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.879 
use because people panic when they walk
into<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.930> room<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.410> there's<00:04:30.590> something<00:04:30.770> just

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
hovering there if they normally just do

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.420 
hovering there if they normally just do
a<00:04:34.880> 180<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.360> try<00:04:35.569> to<00:04:35.630> run<00:04:35.810> away<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:37.160> smart

a 180 and try to run away the smart
thing<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.729> do<00:04:37.880> would<00:04:38.120> be<00:04:38.180> cheated<00:04:38.810> cuz<00:04:38.930> it

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
thing to do would be cheated cuz it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.330 
thing to do would be cheated cuz it
doesn't<00:04:39.259> take<00:04:39.349> much<00:04:39.590> but<00:04:40.190> yeah<00:04:42.069> but<00:04:43.069> it's<00:04:43.190> fun

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
doesn't take much but yeah but it's fun

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.430 
doesn't take much but yeah but it's fun

to use she has a nice attachment to that

to use she has a nice attachment to that
so<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.710> can<00:04:45.860> just<00:04:45.889> copy<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.490> people<00:04:46.990> OOP<00:04:47.990> them

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
so you can just copy the people OOP them

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.710 
so you can just copy the people OOP them
move<00:04:49.400> them<00:04:49.580> at<00:04:49.729> all<00:04:49.910> I<00:04:49.940> almost<00:04:50.270> got<00:04:50.419> that<00:04:50.599> guy

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
it it automatically runs out that's the
