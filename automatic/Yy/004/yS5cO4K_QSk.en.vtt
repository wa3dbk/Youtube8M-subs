it's a unique experience in this day and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.830 
it's a unique experience in this day and
age<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.420> takes<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:09.409> certain<00:01:09.890> amount<00:01:10.040> of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
age it takes a certain amount of

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.810 
age it takes a certain amount of
serendipity<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.869> for<00:01:12.860> all<00:01:13.100> things<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.640> come

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
serendipity to for all things to come

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.639 
serendipity to for all things to come
together<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.390> find<00:01:14.659> a<00:01:14.810> line<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.200> hasn't<00:01:15.500> been

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
together to find a line that hasn't been

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.160 
together to find a line that hasn't been
climbed<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.220> seems<00:01:16.850> worth<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.810> effort<00:01:18.140> to

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
climbed it seems worth the effort to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.900 
climbed it seems worth the effort to
climb<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:18.979> found<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:19.280> corner<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.820> know

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
climb and we found this corner you know

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.570 
climb and we found this corner you know
it's<00:01:20.090> not<00:01:20.270> like<00:01:20.539> a<00:01:20.720> Astro<00:01:21.590> man<00:01:21.770> or<00:01:22.160> anything

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
it's not like a Astro man or anything

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.660 
it's not like a Astro man or anything
mega<00:01:23.229> classic<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.649> think<00:01:24.890> for<00:01:25.130> us<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.520> was

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
mega classic but I think for us it was

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.870 
mega classic but I think for us it was
is<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.090> pretty<00:01:27.160> satisfying<00:01:28.160> and<00:01:28.580> an

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
is a pretty satisfying and an

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.660 
is a pretty satisfying and an
adventurous<00:01:29.420> experience<00:01:29.660> I<00:01:30.340> think<00:01:31.340> it's<00:01:31.550> just

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
adventurous experience I think it's just

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.469 
adventurous experience I think it's just
where<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.800> locals<00:01:33.970> have<00:01:34.970> their<00:01:35.149> target

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
where the locals have their target

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.830 
where the locals have their target
practice<00:01:35.929> up<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.130> wall

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
practice up on the wall

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.980 
practice up on the wall
hopefully<00:01:38.840> not<00:01:38.990> while<00:01:39.200> we're<00:01:39.350> climbing

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
hopefully not while we're climbing

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
hopefully not while we're climbing
they're<00:01:41.990> pretty<00:01:42.229> big<00:01:42.500> bullets

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.760 

when<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.570> decided<00:01:52.930> we<00:01:53.140> were<00:01:53.230> going<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.410> try<00:01:53.710> to

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
when we decided we were going to try to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.950 
when we decided we were going to try to
climb<00:01:54.520> this<00:01:54.760> corner<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.180> had<00:01:55.300> moon<00:01:55.450> climb<00:01:55.690> do

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
climb this corner that had moon climb do

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.180 
climb this corner that had moon climb do
you<00:01:56.050> know<00:01:56.140> we<00:01:56.350> there's<00:01:56.590> only<00:01:56.680> so<00:01:56.860> much<00:01:56.980> you<00:01:57.040> can
