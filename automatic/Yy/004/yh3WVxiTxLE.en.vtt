00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.410
 that as every day I eat is a little 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.610
 my diet is once inside the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.180

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.430
 do not let me leave the wave does not run 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.990
 we will take a salad 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.670
 these 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.460
 is what I eat many times with 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.710

 with this always always the first dish 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.740
 that I eat is a salad is good 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.270
 for the body because it hydrates a lot and 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.040
 they have enough minerals now we are going to 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.100
 sleep second plate some breasts 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.460
 how good are they pretty good 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.979
 for athletes they do not have much 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 fat so my trainer leaves me 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.280
 eat those that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.530
 what you want to stop putting an end to the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.330
 chicken breasts we will take a little 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.190
 of cheese we are going to look for a cheese that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.350
 that is a little bit good that does not have 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.600
 a lot of fat I always put him 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.120
 that only chicken breasts because 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.620
 If I do not become a town that comes out 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.770
 well let's go for dessert I usually eat 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.580
 quite pretty yogurt because apart from 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.890
 what I like has enough calcium 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.909
 we catch we take natural 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.729

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.190

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.960

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 and I was going I was going to take a little bit of 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.600
 this but 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.020
 I think I'm going to leave it when 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.560
 we are going to the cash to pay this is my 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.800
 food from 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.530
 almost every day there are some times that 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.560
 several and if I go a lot to train 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.900
 well instead of eating breast salad 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.760
 of chicken as more then macaroni something 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.890
 of red meat or pasta has 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.810
 enough enough carbohydrates and meat 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.130
 red has got a lot of protein when 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.069
 something I'm not very tired and such 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.500
 Well, as this looks, I take advantage of 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.520
 also as a little forgiveness some 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.220
 oranges 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.010
