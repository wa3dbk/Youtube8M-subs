00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.650
New system improves in-town
satnav accuracy by 90%

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.740
What is the purpose of this research?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.470
The aim of
this project

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.240
is to develop a
positioning system

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.040
for complex urban environments.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.340
This is an example of
a complex urban environment,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.540
where vehicle positioning
is hindered by several

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.870
walls that prevent the
GPS signals from properly

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.720
reaching the receiver in the car.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.540
We therefore need to develop
a system that enables

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.630
reliably positioning
vehicles in an urban environment

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.210
by using sensor fusion.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.280
How does sensor fusion work?

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.040
We have developed a
sensor fusion system

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.910
that integrates the information
supplied by a GPS receiver

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.840
with an accelerometer
and a gyroscope unit.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.490
The aim is to improve
the estimation of position

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.450
and other parameters,
such as travel speed,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.270
not only when the
GPS signal is impaired,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.750
 but also when the GPS signal
is lost altogether.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.030
What are the system's potential applications?

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.600
The current status of the project
is a prototype we have developed

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.550
for urban positioning,
which resolves the issues

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.600
affecting commercial
satnav systems

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.370
currently available on the market.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.380
Our prototype can be
installed on any vehicle

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.930
and its main applications are,
for example,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.510
autonomous vehicle navigation,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.080
where a vehicle can navigate
in a fully autonomous manner

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.450
in an urban environment.
Additionally,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.290
it enables other applications,
such as totally reliable

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.510
vehicle tracking
in urban environments.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.550
To what extent does it improve satnav accuracy?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.310
The data fusion
system implemented

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.810
can correct the
individual errors

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.710
of each of the sensors
involved in the process.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.200
The system's ability to
adapt automatically

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.360
has allowed us to improve
vehicle positioning accuracy 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.490
by up to 90%.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.020
We have also succeeded
in overcoming the urban

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.950
positioning issues of
current satnav systems.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.490
Will you continue
to pursue this line of research?

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.260
We have recently started work
on a new line of research,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.530
which involves incorporating this
data fusion system into a mobile phone

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.480
that can integrate the measurements
provided by the different sensors

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.740
(GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope)
that are built into the mobile phone.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.910
This way we hope to obtain
the same results

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.730
at a much lower cost,
using a device that anyone

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.450
can carry in their pocket.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:03:03.740
