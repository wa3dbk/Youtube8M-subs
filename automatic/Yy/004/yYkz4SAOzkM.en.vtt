00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
 hello friends today I come to talk about my city 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.959
 The truth is that the province of Huelva is simply beautiful 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.599
 We have excellent beaches such as punta umbría el portil islantilla or 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.799
 cristina island 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.590
 we also have the place of all the earth that most resembles Mars 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.650
 Rio Tinto 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.699
 a national park that envies us all of Spain as it is Dona Ana and many 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.189
 towns with an extensive culture like moguer 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.220
 cradle of juan ramón jiménez or fog 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.720
 we were the cradle of america 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.840
 then remember that colon left the port of sticks 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.880
 but the truth is that all this I do not care about a fucking shit 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.710
 Well, capital is a disgusting city according to several investigations 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.780
 what 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.670
 to be sure 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 they were not made in our college shit huelva is the city of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.780
 Spain where we have more risk of suffering from certain types of cancers and is 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.200
 what 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.140
 I remember that my parents told me that a few decades ago they bathed in 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.770
 the river 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.650
 Now if you get into it, you risk leaving with one more eye or one leg 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.190
 less 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.670
 since the water is more contaminated than gurpegui's blood 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.290
 It's all the fault of the whores factories 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.400
 I shit on all your dead 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.440
 If you see the city of Huelva in this photo of Google Earth 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.340
 we see on the right of the city two large spots almost as big as the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.180
 city ​​and they look like lakes 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.310
 well, that shit is a raft of phosphogypses 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.380
 some chemical waste that our little friends of fertiberia have thrown 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.220
 of whore 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.740
 to the south of the city we see all the fucking chemical pole of huelva 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.540
 I wish some earthquake or something would come and take them to hell 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.870
 all as the foam rubber would say 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.710
 and above 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.760
 the fucking companies do not support the city in anything 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.420
 the historical basketball team does not beat 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.940
 the city of huelva has disappeared for not having economic supports the kid 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.140
 from baio and the sons of bitches from cajaol who do not pollute but touch the cock 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.549
 same 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.410
 have been the ones who have achieved this 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.350
 cepsa has stopped supporting the recreational I shit on all his dead 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.490
 to all this the city council that we have is a vice right now governs a 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.890
 sir who is a photographer and is in the pp 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.930
 but it turns out that the psoe's aunt is even more corrupt where are we going to 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.659
 arrive 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:09.629
 but yes 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.829
 huelva is the city of the world with more sources per square meter every 50 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.239
 meters you have a source 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.319
 what they should do is fix the streets a bit, which is a pity 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.440
 day they came to visit me some friends from outside and they said to me that it is incredible the 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.560
 amount of gaps that have the sidewalks of Huelva walk in this city 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.889
 it's like playing super mario bros 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.840
 and finally the best communications routes 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.840
 the train station is sadder than our airport 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.179
 oo that we do not have 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.049
 forgive me 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.959
 is that I just smoke a joint that has given me a colleague and late Christmas 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.639
 as I said the only thing that renfe station has is an aunt edge that 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.859
 sells you tickets for 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.119
 Attention 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.849
 to Sevilla 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.639
 madrid and stop counting 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.260
 they also have a cafeteria that is more expensive than Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.450
 I recommend you to 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.900
 if you are going to take the train 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.020
 and you want to buy something, do it in the store in front of the station, if not 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.679
 you want to spend your college savings 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.769
 as for the bus station here it is known as 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.439
 to that I say everything 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.709
 we also have nine great urban bus lines 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.079
 I miss the bus is worse than losing a child as you try to catch the 6 a 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.889
 Saturday you can take more than an hour waiting 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.999
 I have taken the theoretical based on studying waiting for the bus 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.500
 here finished my story about my city 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.020
 the only objective of this video is to raise awareness of those outside our 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.610
 situation and make it clear that I am very proud to be onubense the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.909
 recreativist 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.959
 greetings to all and to all give cadiz
