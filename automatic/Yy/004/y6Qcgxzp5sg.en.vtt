00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:06.729
 for science the subject the video is 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.010
 convert a power supply from 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.300
 lab things like that 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.309
 good our lab speakers 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.890
 will also have a regulator 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.200
 voltage and it's not going to do a few exits and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.450
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.990
 two LEDs after power 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.090
 resistors of 220 as 6 barnes one of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.850
 black colors the other colors one button 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.610
 switch and a voltage regulator we made 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.379
 nerve past the link so that they go what 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.030
 see and progress the days after 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.309
 you land and the tools that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.470
 let's use your a soldering iron is late 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.980
 it is not ordered by a clamp a 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.200
 judas voltmeter the first step we are going to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.350
 remove all the screws that have the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350
 power 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.739
 and let's go 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.370
 to remove this quotient 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.190
 to remove all the cables 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.900
 we are also going to cut is to lose all 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.870
 the cables here 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.880
 in the front of our fountain 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.140
 we will place all the goals 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.760
 in this way we are going to mark the points 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.690
 to proceed to open a hole or 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.160
 entries may the holes so that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.160
 can enter this 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.620
 black 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.800
 and they are not montijo 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.800
 These same 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:54.210
 now this contact is very important and 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.210
 that the fat 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.850
 in this way and we will place in another 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.530
 button in this hole that where they go 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.480
 all volcanoes if you get a button 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.440
 round like this one is better because it fits 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.440
 to the profession here 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.220
 it's perfectly if we're going to open it 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.410
 two more holes around here to place the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.910
 leds once the holes are open 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.210
 is going to stay this way where will it go 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.910
 the LEDs here we take you to weld in your 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.740
 father activates the resistances of 220 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.690
 now let's put some cables that 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.350
 speak for our button will go 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.030
 the green wire and a black wire a wire 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.770
 green and the black wire that we're going to 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.720
 drop here to control the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.220
 on and now pay to the green that 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.500
 we have up here we are going to let go 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 with a black wire and a red wire for 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.580
 tell us that the source is 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.710
 working and alex ross we have it here 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.140
 down we are going to solder them with the cable 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.690
 purple that is here and a black wire 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.550
 This will indicate when the accounts 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.620
 demo green currents that back and this 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.690
 switch in this good past are already 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.820
 all the cables connected to the green led 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.040
 is connected to a red wire that carries 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.230
 5 volts with its cable resistance 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.390
 black when you are red is connected 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.980
 purple cable with its black cable and its 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.230
 resistance and the sedicide is 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.750
 connected 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.640
 with board to access it 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 for now let's proceed to test the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.909
 power source for laboratory when 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.519
 the other the switch the back of 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.230
 turn on the red LED which means that already 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.450
 there is current when we read the suiche 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.709
 The green LED on the front 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.600
 will tell us that everything is working 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.720
 all right 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.110
 now let's put our regulator 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.110
 to place it we will have here 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.709
 to be able to control the protection 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.790
 our regulator back that we 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.620
 we did in the last video and then you 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.819
 we are going to place the cable we have played 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.860
 those who have allowed the cards 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.750
 yellow and they carry 12 volts and power 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.950
 manipulate those 12 volts and have ones 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.200
 different you have different amount 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.000
 of voltage we are going to add two cables 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.330
 to our voltage regulator one that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.340
 goes land that comes from the leg 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.290
 acceptable and another that comes from the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.150
 output can be seen in past video 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.860
 good as he explained once he placed 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.240
 our potentiometer will be left 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.209
 this way 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.030
 and here is the voltage regulator what 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.610
 mold up the elbows now that is 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.740
 the power source places you area of 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.480
 the capacitors a bit of taipei for 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.160
 that does not directly count one of 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.470
 the things that should be careful is 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.570
 that nothing to make contact with the source 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.460
 internally under any circumstances 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.260
 nothing to make good contact now let's go 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.060
 to grab all the wires and we're going to 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.680
 make for arch by colors as well as 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.990
 are here we give you to proceed to weld 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.730
 in each work bar already connected 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.710
 all the cables here can see how 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.570
 all cables are connected 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.910
 equally all the blacks here are 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.740
 connected to the voltage operator here 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.050
 they are connected with the yellows here 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.300
 there is the blue the red and the oranges 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.700
 we're going to have some exits from a 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.610
 variable the yellow ones have 12 volts 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.950
 blue has minus 12 reds has 5 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.980
 and the orange also in 3.3 volts and 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.810
 finally we have to connect one of 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.810
 the orange wires with the brown wire 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:18.289
 when everything has to be placed for 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.989
 that nothing makes contact because if something already 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.509
 is the contact is elevated to be damaged and 

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:26.630
 fast and we're going to eliminate this gray case 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.940
 since we are going to use only sliced 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.430
 now we have another laboratory source 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.760
 list let's try the german 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.190
 running September the electro too 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.810
 It indicates that already has current 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.000
 they light walber from the fountain starts to 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.390
 work and let's try each one of 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.630
 the cables 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.330
 and you have 3.3 that are connected 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.730
 orange wires 5 that are 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.680
 connected with reds minus 10 of 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.230
 business that will be connected the 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.900
 Blue wire should have minus 12 but 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.210
 12 that all the 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.400
 yellow wires and now let's try 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.290
 ours would be variable and we see that a 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.290
 as we raise the protection but 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.270
 of wills v from 2 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.750
 up to 9 volts 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.750
 9 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.880
 exactly 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.270
 if we can regulate our voltage from 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.370
 9 up to 2 tickets 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.790
 but we have another court source 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.860
 realistic but the astrocytes looks something 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.990
 so in the next video we're going to 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.730
 add a few accessories from 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.650
 hospital and we go with him then the 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.660
 let's put it fine so do not have 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.190
 is to miss the next video in the 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.020
 today I hope you liked it 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.000
 that you have learned from him can 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.130
 subscribe to the channel comment any 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.640
 question announce and well we do not see the 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.640
 next video 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:07.080
 but no 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.150
 in terms of sex 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.420
 again 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.750
 Y
