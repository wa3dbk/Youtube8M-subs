 barrier-free DE we are in austria 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.280
 at the integra 2014 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.830
 we have had one last year 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.620
 reported by Peter Aigner 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.030
 He has a great rehatechnik house 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.900
 First of all, Hello Peter 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.230
 hello so must also say what are so 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.449
 guest at the peter am stand it is the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.310
 the second day is over hell 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.650
 we have finally time 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 have or have been for a while now 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.450
 few minutes to talk 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 this crazy what's going on here what you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.480
 for vehicle conversion of hate various 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.940
 wheelchairs in the sanitation think what 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.469
 so unparalleled is looking for it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.649
 I want to know what you have 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.840
 mainly your tools became like that 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.210
 ready for the people 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.090
 Of course we sit up a lot 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.039
 mobility that people actually mobile 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.230
 can stay mobile 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.879
 actually have in one direction 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.180
 Of course car conversion is one 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.890
 essential part for us then we have 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.020
 mobility had to be part of the car 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.979
 Wheelchairs in the direction of course 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.610
 even then how was there sitting on 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.229
 See that hurt you there too, of course 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 Bit of a fun device or or too 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.790
 a receiving device has, so to speak 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.110
 amazon.de zesel is working on the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.409
 location informed 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.000
 We like that very much new 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.220
 innovations above all so the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.170
 Technology and everything goes on and on 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.869
 Do you always do anything but complain? 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.549
 but there are many tools cool 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.650
 where you where arbeitskreis not from the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.290
 fund pays but where are in demand 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.439
 Of course we are also looking for new ones 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.259
 show also that to show 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.090
 It's not just standard things 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.580
 but to go hammer into terrain 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.490
 where one can ever 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.920
 not where else, after all, anyway 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.060
 comes from mainz terrain can drive 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.010
 also in the snow in things what my 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.460
 otherwise until now maybe only if 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.010
 Wheelchair users can not do it 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.110
 Rebuilding a car now has a lot to offer 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.420
 offer very quickly their swivel 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.790
 almost all publishers help 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 There is somehow specialized on 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.710
 certain types of cars or did everything there 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.260
 or what are you doing there basically 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.760
 we actually built that up for 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.290
 the disabled or or concerned 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.250
 actually offer everything what technical 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.640
 meaningful is what is also feasible 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.930
 of course financially possible 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.640
 we do not really look into it 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.680
 direction that you say I want that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.870
 only sell this product but 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.870
 rather what the affected one gets what 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.950
 he needs or or likes or likes 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.650
 would like to have 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.750
 We have the people as you can 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.550
 come to you who has no dix 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.459
 rumgesprochen that you really here 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.739
 also great advisor and it will be great 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.140
 I like working so many are coming 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.610
 really with zero idea of â€‹â€‹the matter 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.410
 ran and let a variety of picture yes 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.750
 diversity so peter that was really 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.120
 gigantic how many vehicles do you have 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.450
 so in your stock already built 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.160
 you ever count total belief 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.170
 because now she can always do it 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.440
 is sure so in the year are so between 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.709
 80 and 100 vehicles what you what 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.410
 hardly any attention was paid to the conversions 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.510
 actually not exactly defined 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.380
 Of course it's from the self-driver to 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.230
 Passive drivers simply visit this 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.870
 get in easier or just go 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.180
 tool what you can 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.700
 we actually offer everything with everything 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.219
 Anja so really great here 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.500
 Peter first thanks also from here 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.230
 Eon of more for the introduction that one 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.810
 that's exactly where this location is 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.239
 what we need great people open 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.040
 People get more of the great advice than 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.540
 we really have fun makes me stay 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.939
 Of course, a while ago 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.620
 in the morning still there or is it 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.760
 you'll be hamburg again 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.230
 we have been really happy now 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.430
 that you spend a second here 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.199
 could grab and yes will everything 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.150
 say we are not only on the 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.699
 you are the whole year for the people 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.750
 there simply that statement where are you 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.630
 exactly at home 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.240
 it is so we are actually central in 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.460
 Austria in Salzburg we drive 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.220
 Of course, for the customers all over Austria 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.550
 we service before the customer place the 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.500
 simply because first of all I am told too 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.620
 not always mobile until it is perhaps 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.419
 also have done the remodeling and that 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.660
 second of course, the customer also before 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.639
 Place service has that easy but we 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.889
 are there all over austria and 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.139
 For us, the customer is actually king 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.210
 that's the most important 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.520
 So there you stay where it is 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.470
 actually the integra every year or 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.440
 every two years also for our people 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.960
 home the every day with us every two years 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.240
 I believe that is also ideal 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.510
 Of course we always try that 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.599
 to introduce innovations 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.099
 It's the first time this spring 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.870
 again so good time and I think so 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.370
 that's what people are talking about 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.240
 because formerly simply the time one is 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.220
 you want to be mobile as a wave then you can 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.560
 here only always say in two years 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.510
 hopefully on the integra again 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.669
 hopefully with the on the stand again with 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.130
 Peter because it was really fun 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.889
 Thank you very much Peter first, see you soon 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.889
 all and will and and peter
