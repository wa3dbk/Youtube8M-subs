00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
to do is you'll have to take back off

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.700 
to do is you'll have to take back off
the<00:04:33.340> side<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.610> u-joint<00:04:35.710> previously

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
the side of the u-joint previously

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.650 
the side of the u-joint previously
installed<00:04:37.070> take<00:04:37.730> it<00:04:37.910> back<00:04:38.090> off<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.540> then

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
installed take it back off and then

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.410 
installed take it back off and then
there's<00:04:38.840> there's<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.430> place<00:04:40.430> for<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.790> bolt<00:04:41.270> to

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
there's there's a place for a bolt to

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.270 
there's there's a place for a bolt to
spread<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.960> pulley<00:04:42.170> apart<00:04:42.530> we'll<00:04:43.100> show<00:04:43.250> you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
spread the pulley apart we'll show you

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.500 
spread the pulley apart we'll show you
that<00:04:43.520> here<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.820> second

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.120 

spread<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.200> pull-a-part<00:04:49.380> you'll<00:04:49.890> need<00:04:50.070> to

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
spread the pull-a-part you'll need to

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.620 
spread the pull-a-part you'll need to
put<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> metric<00:04:50.880> bolt<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.940> hole<00:04:54.120> provided

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
put a metric bolt in the hole provided

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.900 
put a metric bolt in the hole provided
in<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.840> pulley<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.440> spread<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.310> apart<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:56.880> that

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
in the pulley to spread it apart so that

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.710 
in the pulley to spread it apart so that
the<00:04:57.500> you'll<00:04:58.500> be<00:04:58.680> able<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.190> install<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.880> driven

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
the you'll be able to install the driven

00:05:00.720 --> 00:06:11.830 
the you'll be able to install the driven
on<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.830> stub<00:05:02.010> shaft

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.370 

now<00:06:12.410> we'll<00:06:12.650> be<00:06:12.800> able<00:06:12.919> to<00:06:13.070> take<00:06:13.280> the<00:06:14.380> metric

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
now we'll be able to take the metric

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.960 
now we'll be able to take the metric
bolt<00:06:15.560> out<00:06:15.740> of<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.889> pulley

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:27.480 

after<00:06:19.720> you've<00:06:19.840> tightened<00:06:20.200> the<00:06:20.940> clutch<00:06:21.940> bolt

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490
