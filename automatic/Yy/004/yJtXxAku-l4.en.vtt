the<00:05:19.180> card<00:05:19.510> is<00:05:19.900> just<00:05:20.039> under<00:05:21.039> 11<00:05:21.070> inches<00:05:21.880> long<00:05:22.180> so

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
the card is just under 11 inches long so

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.950 
the card is just under 11 inches long so
about<00:05:23.440> one<00:05:23.650> inch<00:05:23.860> smaller<00:05:24.220> than<00:05:24.430> me<00:05:24.669> yeah<00:05:25.570> but

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
about one inch smaller than me yeah but

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.990 
about one inch smaller than me yeah but
um<00:05:26.200> yeah<00:05:26.890> just<00:05:26.919> make<00:05:27.310> sure<00:05:27.430> your<00:05:27.580> measurements

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
um yeah just make sure your measurements

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.230 
um yeah just make sure your measurements
are<00:05:28.090> on<00:05:28.180> point<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.780> make<00:05:29.229> sure<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:29.440> have<00:05:29.770> a
