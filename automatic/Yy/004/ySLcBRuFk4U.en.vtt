the other day well this this year again
this<00:00:34.370> is<00:00:34.489> my<00:00:34.670> my<00:00:35.180> Thailand<00:00:35.570> giant<00:00:35.989> colocasia

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
this is my my Thailand giant colocasia

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.770 
this is my my Thailand giant colocasia
we<00:00:38.989> had<00:00:39.199> a<00:00:39.230> raccoon<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.159> the<00:00:40.220> backyard<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:40.850> in

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
we had a raccoon in the backyard and in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.209 
we had a raccoon in the backyard and in
trying<00:00:42.079> to<00:00:42.199> get<00:00:42.289> the<00:00:42.440> raccoon<00:00:42.770> out<00:00:42.980> of<00:00:43.160> the

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
trying to get the raccoon out of the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.369 
trying to get the raccoon out of the
backyard<00:00:43.870> he<00:00:44.870> thought<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:45.260> this<00:00:45.410> was<00:00:45.649> a

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
backyard he thought that this was a

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.200 
backyard he thought that this was a
Ledge<00:00:48.379> I<00:00:48.710> guess<00:00:49.010> something<00:00:49.579> he<00:00:49.730> could<00:00:49.850> jump<00:00:50.059> on

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
Ledge I guess something he could jump on

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.650 
Ledge I guess something he could jump on
so<00:00:50.539> we<00:00:51.230> tore<00:00:51.559> this<00:00:51.680> leaf<00:00:51.920> all<00:00:52.129> up<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:52.660> we've

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
so we tore this leaf all up and we've

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.470 
so we tore this leaf all up and we've
just<00:00:53.690> had<00:00:53.989> a<00:00:54.140> storm<00:00:55.039> recently<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:55.969> it

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
just had a storm recently and and it

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.209 
just had a storm recently and and it
tore<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.899> leaf<00:00:57.050> even<00:00:57.350> more<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:57.800> think<00:00:58.070> that

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
tore the leaf even more so I think that

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.490 
tore the leaf even more so I think that
it's<00:00:58.340> about<00:00:58.430> time<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.789> this<00:00:59.090> leaf<00:00:59.300> is<00:00:59.660> to<00:01:00.350> get

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
it's about time that this leaf is to get

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.189 
it's about time that this leaf is to get
cut<00:01:00.710> off<00:01:01.000> if<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:02.210> if<00:01:02.449> you've<00:01:02.600> ever<00:01:02.719> grown<00:01:02.870> any

it's<00:02:16.040> gonna<00:02:16.160> grow<00:02:16.370> but<00:02:17.300> if<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it's gonna grow but if you have the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.530 
it's gonna grow but if you have the
opportunity<00:02:19.070> not<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.610> obstructed<00:02:20.390> by

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
opportunity not to have it obstructed by

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.300 
opportunity not to have it obstructed by
anything<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:21.530> gonna<00:02:21.650> grow<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> lot<00:02:22.100> nicer

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
anything it's gonna grow a lot nicer

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.760 
anything it's gonna grow a lot nicer
this<00:02:23.150> leaf<00:02:23.420> has<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:23.870> really<00:02:24.260> hit<00:02:24.530> anything

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
this leaf has not really hit anything

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.070 
this leaf has not really hit anything
yet<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.520> doesn't<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:25.940> tears<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:26.959> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
yet so it doesn't have you tears but the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.500 
yet so it doesn't have you tears but the
second<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.440> starts<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:28.060> slap<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.240> against

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
second it starts to slap up against

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.150 
second it starts to slap up against
something<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.020> wind<00:02:30.200> that's<00:02:30.860> when<00:02:31.070> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
something in the wind that's when the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.940 
something in the wind that's when the
tearing<00:02:31.489> starts<00:02:31.790> happening<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:33.769> I'm<00:02:33.830> gonna

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
tearing starts happening so I'm gonna

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.290 
tearing starts happening so I'm gonna
chop<00:02:34.250> this<00:02:34.459> off<00:02:36.370> maybe<00:02:37.370> my<00:02:37.550> clematis<00:02:38.030> will<00:02:38.180> get

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
chop this off maybe my clematis will get

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.970 
chop this off maybe my clematis will get
some<00:02:38.450> light<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.930> maybe<00:02:39.080> survive<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.800> is

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
some light and maybe survive this is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
some light and maybe survive this is
what<00:02:43.130> makes<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.430> fun<00:02:44.050> it's<00:02:45.050> fun<00:02:45.230> just<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:46.000> rip

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
what makes it fun it's fun just to rip

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.890 
what makes it fun it's fun just to rip
and<00:02:47.180> tear<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.250> good<00:02:49.370> time<00:02:49.610> with<00:02:49.760> them

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
and tear and have a good time with them

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.080 
and tear and have a good time with them
so<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.080> leaf<00:02:51.320> here<00:02:51.560> will<00:02:51.860> grow<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.640> I'll

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
so this leaf here will grow and I'll

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.610 
so this leaf here will grow and I'll
probably<00:02:53.300> get<00:02:53.480> another<00:02:53.720> two<00:02:54.019> or<00:02:54.050> three<00:02:54.200> leaves

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
probably get another two or three leaves

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.410 
probably get another two or three leaves
before<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.130> end<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.400> season<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.090> will

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
before the end of the season so it will

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.750 
before the end of the season so it will
come<00:02:56.660> back<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.709> when<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:57.920> go<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.160> take<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.550> in

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
come back but when I go to take this in

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.199 
come back but when I go to take this in
for<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.120> winter<00:02:59.420> that'll<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.350> my<00:03:00.470> next<00:03:00.500> video

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
for the winter that'll be my next video

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.729 
for the winter that'll be my next video
I'm<00:03:02.209> just<00:03:02.269> gonna<00:03:02.480> chop<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.900> whole<00:03:03.050> thing<00:03:03.230> off

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
I'm just gonna chop the whole thing off

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.680 
I'm just gonna chop the whole thing off
it's<00:03:04.130> I'm<00:03:04.370> just<00:03:04.400> gonna<00:03:04.670> chop<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.360> right<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.600> the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
it's I'm just gonna chop it right to the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.229 
it's I'm just gonna chop it right to the
ground<00:03:05.900> pretty<00:03:06.080> well<00:03:06.820> I'm<00:03:07.820> gonna<00:03:08.000> bring<00:03:08.120> you

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
ground pretty well I'm gonna bring you

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.550 
ground pretty well I'm gonna bring you
guys<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.600> for<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.780> little<00:03:08.870> close-up<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.410> these

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
guys in for a little close-up on these

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.680 
guys in for a little close-up on these
flowers<00:03:09.799> as<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.880> plant<00:03:11.150> has<00:03:11.299> been<00:03:11.330> growing

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
flowers as this plant has been growing

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.470 
flowers as this plant has been growing
the<00:03:12.200> flowers<00:03:12.590> have<00:03:12.739> also<00:03:12.890> been<00:03:13.160> growing<00:03:13.480> at

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
the flowers have also been growing at

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.930 
the flowers have also been growing at
first<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.989> flowers<00:03:15.350> were<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.860> don't<00:03:16.130> know<00:03:16.310> to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
first the flowers were I don't know to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.960 
first the flowers were I don't know to
three<00:03:17.269> inches<00:03:17.420> twelve<00:03:17.750> another<00:03:18.549> five<00:03:19.549> six

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
three inches twelve another five six

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.360 
three inches twelve another five six
eight<00:03:20.690> inches<00:03:20.930> tall<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:21.620> I'll<00:03:22.130> bring<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
eight inches tall so I'll bring the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.330 
eight inches tall so I'll bring the
camera<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.600> we'll<00:03:23.720> look<00:03:23.750> at<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.340> baby

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
camera in and we'll look at the baby

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.400 
camera in and we'll look at the baby
growth<00:03:25.640> down<00:03:25.910> here

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
growth down here

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.979 
growth down here
we'll<00:03:28.410> just<00:03:28.560> see<00:03:28.680> how<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.830> plants<00:03:29.190> doing<00:03:29.989> okay

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
we'll just see how the plants doing okay

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.320 
we'll just see how the plants doing okay
so<00:03:31.020> here<00:03:31.380> we<00:03:31.500> are<00:03:31.640> as<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.880> can<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
so here we are as you can see the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.930 
so here we are as you can see the
flowers<00:03:33.750> are<00:03:33.930> here<00:03:34.200> they<00:03:35.099> really<00:03:35.459> resemble<00:03:35.880> a

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
flowers are here they really resemble a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.640 
flowers are here they really resemble a
piece<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.300> leaf

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
piece of leaf

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.040 
piece of leaf
they're<00:03:37.650> quite<00:03:37.890> they're<00:03:38.130> quite<00:03:38.340> large

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
they're quite they're quite large

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.490 
they're quite they're quite large
there's<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.489> other<00:03:41.489> part<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:42.000> there

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
there's the other part in there

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.190 
there's the other part in there
these<00:03:43.500> are<00:03:43.680> spent<00:03:44.220> flowers<00:03:44.870> somebody<00:03:45.870> told<00:03:46.110> me

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
these are spent flowers somebody told me

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.100 
these are spent flowers somebody told me
that<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.220> species<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.030> plant<00:03:48.270> all<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
that with this species of plant all the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.680 
that with this species of plant all the
allocations<00:03:49.709> in<00:03:49.830> collocations<00:03:50.520> are<00:03:51.060> roads<00:03:51.450> in

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
allocations in collocations are roads in

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.830 
allocations in collocations are roads in
general<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:53.819> cut<00:03:53.970> off<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.180> flowers<00:03:54.600> because

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
general to cut off the flowers because

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.220 
general to cut off the flowers because
you'll<00:03:54.959> get<00:03:55.080> larger<00:03:55.530> leaf<00:03:55.739> production<00:03:57.230> which

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
you'll get larger leaf production which

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.140 
you'll get larger leaf production which
is<00:03:58.410> it's<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.769> good<00:03:58.920> good<00:03:59.310> suggestion<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.940> don't

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
is it's a good good suggestion I don't

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.059 
is it's a good good suggestion I don't
really<00:04:00.300> need<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.660> flowers<00:04:01.050> at<00:04:01.620> some<00:04:01.830> point

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
really need these flowers at some point

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.070 
really need these flowers at some point
I'd<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.489> see<00:04:02.640> if<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.600> some<00:04:03.720> viable

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
I'd like to see if I can get some viable

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.820 
I'd like to see if I can get some viable
seeds<00:04:04.319> just<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.400> just<00:04:05.970> for<00:04:06.060> giggles<00:04:06.299> but<00:04:07.019> all

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
seeds just for just for giggles but all

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.289 
seeds just for just for giggles but all
in<00:04:08.040> all<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.190> don't<00:04:08.459> really<00:04:08.610> need<00:04:08.790> them<00:04:08.970> they're

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
in all I don't really need them they're

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.650 
in all I don't really need them they're
usually<00:04:09.420> hidden<00:04:09.870> by<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.410> leaves<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.660> not

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
usually hidden by the leaves so not
