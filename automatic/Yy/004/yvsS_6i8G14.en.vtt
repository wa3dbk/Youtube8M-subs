00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello and welcome to the center 7 eur 99 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.839
 the question of the moment what methods 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.780
 recruiting choose for a cdi in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.900
 2010 hello to all hello Madam pee 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello m juniors according to you what 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 are the different methods for 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.279
 recruit in cdi 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
 first of all we have to distinguish the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.480
 direct recruitment of recruitment 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 indirect, that is, recruitment 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.320
 direct is to recruit a candidate 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.920
 without prior stages like the internship 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.179
 the cdd or the interim besides the fear 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.189
 companies and the lack of 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.750
 confidence in the future will bring the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.969
 companies to focus on recruitment 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.550
 Acting in 2010 in the sectors 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.530
 highly specialized what is a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 aberration because the legislation their 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.899
 allows lower cost alternative solutions 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.270
 agree for direct recruitment into 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.890
 function of the complexity of the profile the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.030
 companies decide to recruit by 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.559
 itself or to sub-treat this 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.629
 recruitment 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.520
 is there a better solution not 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.870
 depending on the case and I repeat from 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 the complexity of the profile 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.430
 the use of a hunting cabinet by 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 example can be faster and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.570
 more relevant however it will be more 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.700
 expensive 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.860
 simply with the development of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.510
 social networks look for a profile in 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.280
 position is within the reach of all 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.020
 recruiters whether internal or external 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.060
 to the company what methodology 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.870
 advise you whatever the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.910
 retained technique 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.460
 the methodology always respects the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.650
 100th stage the development of the profile of 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.290
 post at the creation of the media of 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.420
 selection associate the formalization of 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.300
 evaluation grids implementation 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.800
 selection and integration of 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.400
 candidate and in terms of 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 techniques 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.330
 what do you recommend on the one hand it takes 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.090
 consider the budget and the time allotted 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.740
 recruitment then different 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.300
 studies have been published on reliability 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.220
 different techniques 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 the best of them is putting 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.630
 in situation what the employment center appoints 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.820
 the empowerment method 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.100
 in second position we have the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 reference check and then come the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.720
 these seeds center the maintenance the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.829
 personality or projective tests and 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.750
 for those who like techniques 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.079
 obscure we find the graphology 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.549
 numerology and junior astrology 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.019
 do not tell me that companies to the still 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.510
 recruit with graphology 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.640
 I knew expert interim companies 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.690
 in executive delegation recruiting 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.430
 with graphology 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.650
 we may repeat tirelessly 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.260
 that knowledge seriously harms 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.970
 beliefs but hey I invite them to read 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.670
 the ticket we wrote on 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.440
 the history of graphology 2665 to our 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.130
 days what do you think of the series a 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.900
 range 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.900
 its solutions are used in the states 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.410
 united as a screening tool in 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.450
 la France 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.310
 different companies have integrated it into 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.930
 dallas support decision like 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.430
 orange or l'orÃ©al who uses it to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.190
 recruit in number of trainees 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.670
