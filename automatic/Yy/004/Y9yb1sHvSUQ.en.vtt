00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 a tutorial then started immediately 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.759
 extending a thing of white enamel 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.529
 covering this you see is mine 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.170
 second pass then if retained 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:25.480
 if necessary, let it dry again 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.279
 fine and white enamel and started 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.400
 with a very thin brush and it 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.590
 red nail polish to make a transverse line 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.329
 I do it quite often is 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.860
 approximately 2 mm 23 mm also depends 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.570
 from the length of your nails 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.520
 if you have very short and do 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.370
 simply a line with the brush that 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.120
 remain very very very thin always 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.550
 well my line is complete also from 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.530
 sides I recommend very well I do 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.719
 two indeed in art wants 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.120
 take a little inspiration from the candies and 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.300
 stags when to take these 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.730
 vile smi very red and with enamel 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.970
 red still wet then just 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.439
 finished making the lines I go lean 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.729
 my finger inside my glitter 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.430
 precisely for this reason or in a while 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.020
 will go to remove the excess and the enamel 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 white must be super dry because 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.900
 if the glitter were still wet 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.490
 they would also simplify him and not go 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.040
 well we want them only and only 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.970
 on the red enamel 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.100
 when then with the small brush a 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.720
 brush everything by dropping i 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.119
 glitter that is attached 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.640
 on the dry asphalt then on the part 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.460
 white and we don't want them there then 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.439
 spend it I spend a joint and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.630
 surely some gods will remain attached 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.030
 glitter inevitable then me with 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.920
 trattoria underwire trying not to 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.759
 ruin the white enamel under but so much 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.310
 dry so it should not bind with 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.740
 I notice a lot of attention at work 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.909
 completed 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.790
 of course they spread my base 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.680
 transparent which is really necessary 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.479
 because on the books of the ancients they go away not 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 there is hope 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.219
 and this is the same final used on all 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.019
 ten fingers a little while ago at work 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.260
 made and on longer nails and it was 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.110
 exactly what i hope you like e 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.360
