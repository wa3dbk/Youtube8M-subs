00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.520
 very good people all good to you 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.620
 riffs art here I bring you a new 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.059
 fifa 14 video ultimate link and I'm going 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.129
 to teach and I'll give you a little advice 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.980
 I'm going to teach how to get contracts to 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.470
 250 coins and especially what days to 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.660
 then you are going to see what I 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.970
 I want you to get them to take the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.900
 contracts to 250 currencies because if for 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.050
 example you buy 100 or it would cost 25 thousand 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.689
 coins 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.720
 no longer 30,000 that would cost you if the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.399
 purchases of 300 are 5000 and I advise you 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.340
 when you buy contracts you buy 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.750
 a good string of contracts with 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.820
 many contracts 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.489
 and here you see the demo I want 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.290
 that you take it to 250 coins since everything 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.330
 the total is what counts because they are 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.550
 5,000 and 10,000 other player 5000 of 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.480
 others and in the end you get up to 50,000 more 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.590
 just for not taking advantage of these tips 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.559
 well let's see players have not been 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.989
 wrong consumables quality gold type 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.140
 of consumables contracts and maximum price 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.850
 important to 250 coins not in purchase anymore 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.400
 since if we put the purchase and we 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.540
 we would go to the 59 minute method that 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 right now we are not interested 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.230
 Here I recommend that you go to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.430
 from one minute 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.290
 you go from one minute we go to it 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.330
 Once here what we have to do is 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.610
 go turning pages from minute 1 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.620
 minute and a half two minutes and go by 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.250
 pages until you find the contracts 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.320
 bright all those at a price 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.870
 initial 200 coins what we have to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.550
 to do is to judge 250 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.400
 and we'll go looking for had the 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.470
 pages we are in advanced pages 86 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.990
 86 88 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.390
 this from the pce becomes much more 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.780
 fast because it happens that for you what 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.610
 I had to do in the console 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.100
 but it's three times as fast because 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.430
 the pages are much faster 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.430
 and there are usually no errors 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.130
 well here from here this as 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.600
 You see 250 that is already wet that I have 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.850
 jumped here you have another 250 and from 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.890
 from here all you see begin to 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.170
 bid does not mind not to back out 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.730
 and try to spend everything 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.330
 can you or all the contracts first and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.460
 to buy 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.400
 from now on without stopping because to 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.140
 from here it's like you go 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.660
 ahead of those who are bidding on 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.660
 previous minutes the second 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.520
 here as you see many fall but yes 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.520
 that you have enough 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.579
 and good and now let's see the result 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.579
 is this after about 10 minutes 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.030
 concretely they are 16 what I 'm taking 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.269
 about 10 minutes but if you spend 20 minutes 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.319
 or half an hour the result would be this 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.319
 would be 43 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.129
 of 43 well it is already 20 minutes 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.790
 - besides you are going to check it 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.020
 here you have the proof and all to 250 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.670
 coins 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.620
 and nothing more kids that has been all 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.570
 remember on Wednesdays after 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.910
 team of weeks and Thursdays by 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.940
 the mornings remember to put maximum price 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.430
 250 coins and a minute or two in 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.680
 ahead there you can find them and that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.870
