00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
let's get to talking about the gear

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.330 
let's get to talking about the gear
we'll<00:01:01.469> start<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> forward<00:01:01.980> weapons

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
we'll start with the forward weapons

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.539 
we'll start with the forward weapons
array<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.750> have<00:01:03.750> tool<00:01:04.379> advanced<00:01:04.890> fleet<00:01:05.159> face<00:01:05.369> or

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
array I have tool advanced fleet face or

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.480

dual<00:01:05.700> heavy<00:01:05.970> cannons<00:01:06.840> mark<00:01:07.260> 12<00:01:07.680> damage<00:01:08.130> times

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
dual heavy cannons mark 12 damage times

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
dual heavy cannons mark 12 damage times
to<00:01:08.670> accuracy<00:01:09.060> times<00:01:09.360> 2<00:01:09.570> because<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.140> really

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to accuracy times 2 because I really

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.230 
to accuracy times 2 because I really
like<00:01:10.979> accuracy<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.850> damage<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
like accuracy if I really like damage I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
like accuracy if I really like damage I
split<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.750> half<00:01:14.869> which<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
split it in half which this one is the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
split it in half which this one is the
same<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.009> over<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.759> now

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
same as one over here just as well now

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.030 
same as one over here just as well now
the<00:01:18.570> torpedoes<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.259> can't<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.619> accuracy

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the torpedoes you can't get accuracy

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
the torpedoes you can't get accuracy
times<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> had<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.299> settle<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.780> damage

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
times two so I had to settle for damage

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.859 
times two so I had to settle for damage
times<00:01:22.320> three<00:01:22.500> accuracy<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.570> mean<00:01:24.720> that's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
times three accuracy and I mean that's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
times three accuracy and I mean that's
good<00:01:25.020> enough<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.500> much<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> get

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
good enough for how much you get

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
good enough for how much you get
I<00:01:26.369> prefer<00:01:27.030> kinetics<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:27.630> photons<00:01:28.110> because

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
I prefer kinetics over photons because

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.899 
I prefer kinetics over photons because
they<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.040> damage<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.460> need<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
they do the damage you need to in the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.100 
they do the damage you need to in the
middle<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> an<00:01:30.210> alpha-strike<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:30.990> don't

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
middle of an alpha-strike and they don't

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
middle of an alpha-strike and they don't
have<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> abysmal<00:01:31.740> e<00:01:31.979> long<00:01:32.189> reload<00:01:32.579> time<00:01:32.820> of

torpedoes in the game but they only deal
about<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.280> eighty<00:01:44.790> percent<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.420> an

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
about I think it's eighty percent of an

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.679 
about I think it's eighty percent of an
equivalent<00:01:45.750> photon<00:01:46.290> torpedoes<00:01:46.740> DPS<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.689> most

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
equivalent photon torpedoes DPS but most

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420 
equivalent photon torpedoes DPS but most
people<00:01:48.899> wait<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> fire<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> torpedoes<00:01:50.250> until

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
people wait to fire the torpedoes until

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340 
people wait to fire the torpedoes until
the<00:01:50.520> enemy<00:01:50.850> shields<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.180> down<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.020> still

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the enemy shields are down so it still

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
the enemy shields are down so it still
works<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.829> good<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.759> phaser<00:01:54.090> quad

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
works out to be good the phaser quad

works out to be good the phaser quad

in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> game<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.850> terms<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.119> DPS<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.619> get

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
in the game in terms of DPS and you get

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.560 
in the game in terms of DPS and you get
them<00:01:58.890> off<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> reef<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.969> they<00:02:00.119> level<00:02:00.450> with

them off the reef it and they level with

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.120 
them off the reef it and they level with
you<00:02:00.719> which<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.020> nice<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> plan<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.829> always

my deflector array is the assimilated
deflector<00:02:07.619> array<00:02:07.650> mark<00:02:08.250> 11<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.789> got<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.119> way

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
deflector array mark 11 I got this way

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.490

back when you actually had to do the old
STF<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.130> get<00:02:11.280> them<00:02:11.400> they're<00:02:12.270> different<00:02:12.510> now

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
STF to get them they're different now

nice<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.350> get<00:03:25.530> um<00:03:25.709> more<00:03:26.670> turn<00:03:26.880> rate<00:03:27.060> while<00:03:27.239> in

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
nice I get um more turn rate while in

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.740 
nice I get um more turn rate while in
slipstream<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.250> all<00:03:29.250> damage<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.120> get<00:03:30.269> 3.5

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
slipstream and all damage and I get 3.5

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.990 
slipstream and all damage and I get 3.5
all<00:03:31.079> damage<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:31.769> each<00:03:31.799> sub<00:03:32.100> system<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.549> 75

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
all damage for each sub system with 75

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.430 
all damage for each sub system with 75
or<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.269> power<00:03:33.450> which<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.989> nice<00:03:34.230> thing<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
or more power which is a nice thing to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.319 
or more power which is a nice thing to
have<00:03:34.530> as<00:03:34.709> well<00:03:34.859> next<00:03:35.820> we<00:03:35.880> move<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
have as well next we move on to the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.449 
have as well next we move on to the
regenerative<00:03:36.690> shields<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:38.310> is

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
regenerative shields now this is

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.650 
regenerative shields now this is
something<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.760> lot<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:38.940> people<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.299> like<00:03:39.450> is

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
something a lot of people don't like is

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.740 
something a lot of people don't like is
using<00:03:39.930> regenerative<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.459> because<00:03:41.850> it

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
using regenerative I like it because it

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.210 
using regenerative I like it because it
has<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.079> if<00:03:43.320> my<00:03:43.410> bridge<00:03:43.590> officer<00:03:43.920> abilities

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
has to if my bridge officer abilities

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.710 
has to if my bridge officer abilities
which<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.400> will<00:03:44.549> do<00:03:44.640> in<00:03:44.670> another<00:03:44.940> video<00:03:45.209> but

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
which I will do in another video but

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.050 
which I will do in another video but
basically<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.260> am<00:03:46.500> able<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> have<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.670> regen

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
basically I am able to have it regen

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.759 
basically I am able to have it regen
enough<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.600> where<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.750> negate<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.350> majority<00:03:49.739> of

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
enough to where I negate the majority of

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.710 
enough to where I negate the majority of
incoming<00:03:50.160> damage<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.790> then<00:03:51.150> my<00:03:51.239> hull<00:03:51.420> can<00:03:51.570> mop

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
incoming damage and then my hull can mop

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.380 
incoming damage and then my hull can mop
up<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.019> rest<00:03:52.489> now<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:53.549> move<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.239> rear

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
up the rest now we move on to the rear

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.080 
up the rest now we move on to the rear
weapons<00:03:54.750> array<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.340> where<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.760> lot<00:03:57.060> of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
weapons array and this is where a lot of

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.400 
weapons array and this is where a lot of
the<00:03:57.209> controversy<00:03:57.480> starts<00:03:57.989> because<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.260> use

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
the controversy starts because I use

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
the controversy starts because I use
phaser<00:03:58.709> beam<00:03:58.950> arrays<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.489> lot<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.180> people<00:04:00.359> like

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
phaser beam arrays a lot of people like

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.670 
phaser beam arrays a lot of people like
to<00:04:00.600> do<00:04:00.690> turrets<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.260> way<00:04:01.350> they<00:04:01.470> have<00:04:01.500> all

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
to do turrets that way they have all

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.900 
to do turrets that way they have all
their<00:04:01.829> damage<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.370> they<00:04:02.489> can<00:04:02.640> hit<00:04:02.760> going

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
their damage that they can hit going

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.849 
their damage that they can hit going
forward<00:04:03.329> but<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.780> don't<00:04:04.470> like<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.769> when

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
forward but I don't like it when

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:05.930 
forward but I don't like it when
somebody<00:04:05.010> gets<00:04:05.250> behind<00:04:05.340> me<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:05.700> all<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.820> have

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
somebody gets behind me and all I have

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.340 
somebody gets behind me and all I have
is<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.090> torpedo<00:04:06.359> launcher<00:04:06.750> into<00:04:06.959> turrets<00:04:07.260> to

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
is a torpedo launcher into turrets to

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.640 
is a torpedo launcher into turrets to
kill<00:04:07.880> it's<00:04:08.880> personal<00:04:09.239> thing<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.049> choose<00:04:10.560> to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
kill it's personal thing so I choose to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.020 
kill it's personal thing so I choose to
have<00:04:10.829> more<00:04:10.980> firepower<00:04:11.220> than<00:04:11.489> with<00:04:11.700> science

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
have more firepower than with science

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.490 
have more firepower than with science
ships<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.420> rear<00:04:12.569> that<00:04:13.080> way<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.290> can

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
ships on the rear that way I can

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.050 
ships on the rear that way I can
actually<00:04:13.650> defend<00:04:13.980> myself<00:04:14.190> if<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.940> have<00:04:15.030> to

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
actually defend myself if I have to

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.190 
actually defend myself if I have to
fight<00:04:15.269> from<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.510> rear<00:04:15.659> which<00:04:15.840> actually

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
fight from the rear which actually

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.920 
fight from the rear which actually
happens<00:04:16.739> when

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
happens when

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.490 
happens when
attracted<00:04:17.350> me<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> lot<00:04:19.019> now<00:04:20.019> we<00:04:20.079> move<00:04:20.229> on<00:04:20.380> the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
attracted me a lot now we move on the

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.620 
attracted me a lot now we move on the
engineering<00:04:20.799> consoles<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.850> is<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> universal

I<00:04:25.990> cannot<00:04:26.710> remember<00:04:26.860> exactly<00:04:27.039> what<00:04:27.639> I<00:04:27.940> think

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
I cannot remember exactly what I think

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.510 
I cannot remember exactly what I think
it<00:04:28.300> was<00:04:28.330> out<00:04:28.479> of<00:04:28.509> a<00:04:28.630> lockbox<00:04:29.020> at<00:04:29.169> one<00:04:29.289> point<00:04:29.520> I

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it was out of a lockbox at one point I

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.920 
it was out of a lockbox at one point I
think<00:04:31.060> there<00:04:31.180> still<00:04:31.330> some<00:04:31.509> around<00:04:31.690> floating

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
think there still some around floating

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.240 
think there still some around floating
around<00:04:32.139> on<00:04:32.380> exchange<00:04:32.680> probably<00:04:32.979> pick<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.160> up

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
around on exchange probably pick it up

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.340 
around on exchange probably pick it up
like<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.400> mill<00:04:33.639> and<00:04:34.630> energy<00:04:34.960> credits<00:04:35.259> so

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
like a mill and energy credits so

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.230 
like a mill and energy credits so
basically<00:04:35.620> if<00:04:35.889> I<00:04:36.250> get<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.490> within<00:04:36.639> 10k<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.030> can

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
basically if I get to within 10k I can

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.640 
basically if I get to within 10k I can
jump<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.600> 3k<00:04:37.930> behind<00:04:38.259> somebody<00:04:38.500> which<00:04:38.620> is

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
jump to 3k behind somebody which is

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.029 
jump to 3k behind somebody which is

kinetic<00:04:56.259> it's<00:04:56.830> not<00:04:56.949> as<00:04:57.070> much<00:04:57.340> as<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.669> specific

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150

ones<00:04:58.360> but<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:58.870> still<00:04:59.080> get<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.229> lot<00:04:59.470> this<00:05:00.280> one

immediately<00:06:06.330> next<00:06:07.330> we<00:06:07.419> have<00:06:07.570> zero<00:06:07.990> point

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199

immediately next we have zero point
quantum<00:06:08.590> chambers<00:06:08.949> which<00:06:09.130> basically

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
quantum chambers which basically

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.670 
quantum chambers which basically
increase<00:06:09.820> my<00:06:10.000> quantum<00:06:10.360> torpedo<00:06:10.720> damage<00:06:11.050> which

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
increase my quantum torpedo damage which

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.490 
increase my quantum torpedo damage which
is<00:06:11.889> incredibly<00:06:12.520> important<00:06:13.229> then<00:06:14.229> I<00:06:14.259> have

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
is incredibly important then I have

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.010 
is incredibly important then I have
phaser<00:06:14.830> relays<00:06:15.310> which<00:06:15.580> up<00:06:15.849> my<00:06:16.330> phaser<00:06:16.570> damage

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
phaser relays which up my phaser damage

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.420 
phaser relays which up my phaser damage
because<00:06:17.229> all<00:06:17.289> my<00:06:17.409> weapons<00:06:17.530> a<00:06:17.770> phaser<00:06:17.979> so<00:06:18.220> I<00:06:18.280> get

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
because all my weapons a phaser so I get

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.830 
because all my weapons a phaser so I get
twenty<00:06:18.669> six<00:06:18.849> point<00:06:19.030> two<00:06:19.210> phaser<00:06:19.449> damage

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
twenty six point two phaser damage

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.379 
twenty six point two phaser damage
increases<00:06:20.320> I<00:06:20.380> have<00:06:20.470> two<00:06:20.560> of<00:06:20.680> those<00:06:21.270> two<00:06:22.270> of

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
increases I have two of those two of

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.790 
increases I have two of those two of
those<00:06:22.479> so<00:06:22.690> it's<00:06:22.990> twenty<00:06:23.229> six<00:06:23.380> point<00:06:23.560> two<00:06:23.650> times

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
those so it's twenty six point two times

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.800 
those so it's twenty six point two times
two

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
two

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.990 
two
yeah<00:06:26.530> it's<00:06:27.100> a<00:06:27.250> fleet<00:06:27.490> version<00:06:27.850> of<00:06:27.910> the

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
yeah it's a fleet version of the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.460 
yeah it's a fleet version of the
tactical<00:06:28.270> escort<00:06:28.570> retrofit<00:06:28.990> I<00:06:29.110> had<00:06:29.230> pretty

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
tactical escort retrofit I had pretty

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.560 
tactical escort retrofit I had pretty

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
much the same fit on the old version

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.650 
much the same fit on the old version
except<00:06:32.560> for<00:06:32.770> I<00:06:32.800> lost<00:06:33.400> out<00:06:33.820> on<00:06:33.850> one<00:06:34.270> of<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:34.450> zero

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
except for I lost out on one of the zero

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.250 
except for I lost out on one of the zero
point<00:06:34.840> quantum<00:06:35.260> chambers<00:06:37.080> because<00:06:38.080> there's

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260
