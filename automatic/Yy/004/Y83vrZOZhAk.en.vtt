00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
somehow found across some when I was

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.250 
somehow found across some when I was
like<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.370> for<00:03:14.640> long<00:03:14.790> shots<00:03:14.820> or<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.540> noticed

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
like going for long shots or I noticed

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.930 
like going for long shots or I noticed
them<00:03:16.410> as<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.310> shooting<00:03:17.610> people

and I knew I was going to get those long

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.069 
and I knew I was going to get those long
shot<00:03:20.430> challenges<00:03:20.910> soon<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> paid<00:03:22.049> attention

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
shot challenges soon so I paid attention

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.069 
shot challenges soon so I paid attention
to<00:03:22.470> where<00:03:22.739> where<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> spots<00:03:23.400> were<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.209> need

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
to where where the spots were and I need

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.720 
to where where the spots were and I need
a<00:03:25.110> note<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.620> where<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:26.070> were<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.489> they

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
a note of where they were and they

say maybe the blood thursdays but the
long<00:03:40.049> shots<00:03:40.380> are<00:03:40.620> tricky<00:03:41.400> i<00:03:41.519> can<00:03:41.760> tell<00:03:41.940> you

that youre that you need to know about
it<00:03:53.880> all<00:03:54.060> right<00:03:54.360> then<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.810> let's<00:03:55.019> look<00:03:55.170> at<00:03:55.320> this

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
it all right then so let's look at this

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.720 
it all right then so let's look at this
let's<00:03:55.650> get<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.920> little<00:03:56.160> clip<00:03:56.340> which<00:03:56.579> is<00:03:56.700> a

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
let's get this little clip which is a

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.220 
let's get this little clip which is a
little<00:03:56.880> do<00:03:57.209> little<00:03:57.450> test<00:03:57.660> right<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:57.900> and

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
little do little test right here and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.460 
little do little test right here and
let's<00:03:58.769> see<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.820> we're<00:04:00.150> using<00:04:00.299> m27<00:04:00.840> sammy's

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
let's see this we're using m27 sammy's

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.820 
let's see this we're using m27 sammy's
shots<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.860> takes<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.310> kill<00:04:03.410> 12

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.580 

three<00:04:08.460> as<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:09.060> takes<00:04:09.480> three<00:04:09.720> shots<00:04:09.990> to<00:04:10.140> kill<00:04:10.320> up

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
three as it takes three shots to kill up

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.550 
three as it takes three shots to kill up
close<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:11.390> let's<00:04:12.390> let's<00:04:13.110> go<00:04:13.170> back<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> little

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
close and let's let's go back a little

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.960 
close and let's let's go back a little
bit<00:04:13.710> further<00:04:13.860> we'll<00:04:14.190> see<00:04:14.310> what<00:04:14.520> happens<00:04:14.610> now

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
bit further we'll see what happens now

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.600 
bit further we'll see what happens now
one<00:04:15.480> two<00:04:16.350> three<00:04:17.480> four<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:19.130> look<00:04:20.130> we<00:04:20.549> still

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
one two three four and look we still

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.000 
one two three four and look we still
have<00:04:20.820> not<00:04:20.940> gotten<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.239> long<00:04:21.450> shot<00:04:21.690> metal<00:04:22.140> so

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
have not gotten a long shot metal so

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.940 
have not gotten a long shot metal so
then<00:04:23.160> let's<00:04:23.340> go<00:04:23.490> back<00:04:23.700> even<00:04:23.910> further<00:04:24.060> one<00:04:24.950> two

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
then let's go back even further one two

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.370 
then let's go back even further one two
three<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:28.670> four<00:04:29.670> five<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:30.120> now<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.020> can<00:04:31.200> see

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
three and four five and now you can see

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.660 
three and four five and now you can see
the<00:04:31.500> fit<00:04:31.680> bullet<00:04:31.950> but<00:04:32.100> there<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.400> fifth

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
the fit bullet but there is a fifth

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.550 
the fit bullet but there is a fifth
bullet<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.330> see<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.720> we<00:04:33.870> got<00:04:34.080> our<00:04:34.110> long

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
bullet and you see that we got our long

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.620 
bullet and you see that we got our long
shot<00:04:34.590> metal<00:04:35.370> so<00:04:36.000> then<00:04:36.180> what<00:04:36.390> can<00:04:36.540> we<00:04:36.600> conclude

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
shot metal so then what can we conclude

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.840 
shot metal so then what can we conclude
from<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.380> data<00:04:37.620> our<00:04:37.980> little<00:04:38.190> experiment<00:04:38.550> that

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
from the data our little experiment that

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.730 
from the data our little experiment that
we<00:04:38.910> did<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.270> was<00:04:39.660> all<00:04:39.780> in<00:04:39.870> slow<00:04:40.050> motion<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:40.620> we

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
we did that was all in slow motion so we

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.920 
we did that was all in slow motion so we
figured<00:04:41.100> out<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.220> for<00:04:41.610> three<00:04:42.300> bullets<00:04:42.630> kills

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
figured out that for three bullets kills

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.530 
figured out that for three bullets kills
a<00:04:43.110> person<00:04:43.140> up<00:04:43.650> close<00:04:44.070> four<00:04:44.910> bullets<00:04:45.270> kills<00:04:45.450> a

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
a person up close four bullets kills a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.360 
a person up close four bullets kills a
person<00:04:45.570> for<00:04:46.050> medium<00:04:46.320> range<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.830> five<00:04:47.040> bullets

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
person for medium range and five bullets

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.770 
person for medium range and five bullets
kills<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.640> person<00:04:47.670> from<00:04:48.090> long<00:04:48.300> range<00:04:48.330> and

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
kills a person from long range and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.500 
kills a person from long range and
that's<00:04:48.900> considered<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.680> be<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:50.070> long<00:04:51.030> shot<00:04:51.060> as

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
that's considered to be a long shot as

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.540 
that's considered to be a long shot as
in<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:53.070> varies<00:04:53.790> on<00:04:53.970> two<00:04:54.330> different<00:04:54.570> little

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
in it varies on two different little

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.480 
in it varies on two different little
little<00:04:56.930> variables<00:04:57.930> we<00:04:58.080> can<00:04:58.200> say<00:04:58.350> as<00:04:58.500> in<00:04:59.190> we

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
little variables we can say as in we

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.850 
little variables we can say as in we
first<00:04:59.790> figure<00:05:00.270> out<00:05:00.420> that<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.930> depends<00:05:01.650> on<00:05:01.800> the

first figure out that it depends on the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.710 
first figure out that it depends on the
distance<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.610> course<00:05:03.180> is<00:05:03.300> always<00:05:03.510> going<00:05:03.630> to

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
distance of course is always going to

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.570 
distance of course is always going to
pin<00:05:03.870> on<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:03.990> distance<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.530> long<00:05:04.800> shot<00:05:05.040> distance

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
pin on a distance a long shot distance

pin on a distance a long shot distance
of<00:05:06.030> course<00:05:06.330> as<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:07.320> second<00:05:07.680> thing<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:07.860> you

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
of course as the second thing that you

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.100 
of course as the second thing that you
don't<00:05:08.340> think<00:05:08.520> about<00:05:08.730> is<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.450> bullet<00:05:09.780> damage

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
don't think about is the bullet damage

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.800 
don't think about is the bullet damage
as<00:05:10.560> I've<00:05:11.340> always<00:05:11.610> thought<00:05:11.850> about<00:05:11.910> this<00:05:12.240> until

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
as I've always thought about this until

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.690 
as I've always thought about this until
I<00:05:13.080> finally<00:05:13.680> did<00:05:13.860> this<00:05:13.980> experiment<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.580> I

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
I finally did this experiment and I

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.120 
I finally did this experiment and I
finally<00:05:14.970> thought<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.330> was<00:05:15.780> right<00:05:16.080> as<00:05:16.320> i<00:05:16.890> did

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
finally thought it was right as i did

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.430 
finally thought it was right as i did
think<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.760> was<00:05:18.090> how<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:18.990> get<00:05:19.230> long

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
think that this was how you get long

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.140 
think that this was how you get long
shot<00:05:19.680> metals<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.100> depends<00:05:20.460> on<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.640> bullet

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
shot metals it depends on the bullet

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.300 
shot metals it depends on the bullet
damage<00:05:21.390> as<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.710> farther<00:05:22.980> away<00:05:23.070> from

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
damage as in the farther away from

damage as in the farther away from
someone<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.480> means<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.930> less<00:05:25.200> damage

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
someone that means the less damage

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.230 
someone that means the less damage
you're<00:05:26.130> going<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.370> have<00:05:26.550> with<00:05:26.790> your<00:05:26.880> bullets

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
you're going to have with your bullets

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.090 
you're going to have with your bullets
as<00:05:27.390> in<00:05:27.870> we're<00:05:28.080> going<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.230> use<00:05:28.410> an<00:05:28.590> example<00:05:28.830> like

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
as in we're going to use an example like

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.730 
as in we're going to use an example like
a<00:05:29.160> gun<00:05:29.400> with<00:05:29.550> has<00:05:29.700> 45<00:05:30.240> bullet<00:05:30.450> damage<00:05:30.720> up<00:05:31.440> close

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
a gun with has 45 bullet damage up close

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.040 
a gun with has 45 bullet damage up close
you<00:05:32.040> can<00:05:32.370> have<00:05:32.580> about<00:05:32.700> thirty<00:05:33.180> six<00:05:33.630> damage

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
you can have about thirty six damage

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.620 
you can have about thirty six damage
from<00:05:34.710> far<00:05:35.010> away<00:05:35.040> from<00:05:35.520> its<00:05:35.669> maximum<00:05:36.090> range<00:05:36.360> and

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
from far away from its maximum range and

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.810 
from far away from its maximum range and
once<00:05:37.169> it<00:05:37.290> gets<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.500> its<00:05:37.530> maximum<00:05:37.950> range<00:05:38.310> error

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
once it gets to its maximum range error

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.360 
once it gets to its maximum range error
at<00:05:39.720> any<00:05:39.990> certain<00:05:40.230> range<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.890> bullet<00:05:41.250> damage

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
at any certain range the bullet damage

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.940 
at any certain range the bullet damage
was<00:05:41.669> slowly<00:05:41.970> drop<00:05:42.510> until<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.440> hits<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
was slowly drop until it hits to the

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.550 
was slowly drop until it hits to the
point<00:05:44.190> where<00:05:44.780> you'll<00:05:45.780> have<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.110> least<00:05:46.410> amount

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
point where you'll have the least amount

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.980 
point where you'll have the least amount
of<00:05:46.980> bullet<00:05:47.340> damage<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:47.970> then<00:05:48.419> once<00:05:48.750> you<00:05:48.840> get

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
of bullet damage and then once you get

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.140 
of bullet damage and then once you get
to<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.140> point<00:05:49.440> that<00:05:50.040> once<00:05:50.850> you<00:05:50.910> get<00:05:51.030> to<00:05:51.060> that

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
to that point that once you get to that

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.080 
to that point that once you get to that
point<00:05:51.390> or<00:05:51.600> even<00:05:51.900> more<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.560> as<00:05:52.800> is<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.640> stay<00:05:53.940> at<00:05:54.060> a

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
point or even more it as is a stay at a

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.820 
point or even more it as is a stay at a
certain<00:05:54.360> damage<00:05:54.750> point<00:05:55.050> and<00:05:55.229> no<00:05:55.500> matter<00:05:55.680> how

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
certain damage point and no matter how

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.710 
certain damage point and no matter how
far<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.100> are<00:05:56.220> so<00:05:56.669> i<00:05:56.729> stay<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:56.940> certain<00:05:57.270> damage

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
far you are so i stay a certain damage

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.230 
far you are so i stay a certain damage
point<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.110> i<00:05:58.140> can<00:05:58.350> keep<00:05:58.560> on<00:05:58.740> going<00:05:58.950> lower<00:05:59.240> just

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
point so i can keep on going lower just

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.610 
point so i can keep on going lower just
or<00:06:00.360> keep<00:06:00.510> that<00:06:00.660> in<00:06:00.750> mind<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.110> once<00:06:01.350> you<00:06:01.440> get<00:06:01.590> to

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
or keep that in mind and once you get to

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.570 
or keep that in mind and once you get to
that<00:06:01.710> point<00:06:01.830> is<00:06:02.370> considered<00:06:03.060> a<00:06:03.180> long<00:06:03.570> shot<00:06:04.580> now

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
that point is considered a long shot now

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.000 
that point is considered a long shot now
most<00:06:06.390> people<00:06:06.479> would<00:06:06.810> not<00:06:06.960> think<00:06:07.200> about<00:06:07.290> it<00:06:07.530> as

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
most people would not think about it as

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.159 
most people would not think about it as
I<00:06:08.490> I<00:06:08.550> thought<00:06:09.210> about<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.540> I<00:06:09.720> thought<00:06:09.930> about

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
I I thought about that I thought about

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.860 
I I thought about that I thought about
the<00:06:10.830> damage<00:06:11.310> and<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.580> bullets<00:06:12.270> as<00:06:12.390> in<00:06:12.720> it

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
the damage and the bullets as in it

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.740 
the damage and the bullets as in it
takes<00:06:13.110> a<00:06:13.229> lot<00:06:13.560> longer<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.310> kill<00:06:14.520> so<00:06:14.669> my<00:06:14.820> from

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
takes a lot longer the kill so my from

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.219 
takes a lot longer the kill so my from
far<00:06:16.020> away<00:06:16.280> far<00:06:17.280> away<00:06:17.340> and<00:06:17.910> then<00:06:18.479> does<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.810> kill

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
far away far away and then does the kill

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.080 
far away far away and then does the kill
someone<00:06:19.530> up<00:06:19.650> close<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.340> this<00:06:21.210> is<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.390> very

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
someone up close and this is a very

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.680 
someone up close and this is a very
reliable<00:06:23.020> tip<00:06:23.260> is<00:06:23.470> very<00:06:23.980> some<00:06:24.220> good<00:06:24.460> it<00:06:24.760> it's

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
reliable tip is very some good it it's

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.840 
reliable tip is very some good it it's
is<00:06:25.990> very<00:06:26.320> important<00:06:26.830> but<00:06:27.070> most<00:06:27.400> people<00:06:27.669> not

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
is very important but most people not

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.200 
is very important but most people not
think<00:06:28.120> about<00:06:28.240> this<00:06:28.449> at<00:06:28.960> all<00:06:29.110> and<00:06:29.910> that<00:06:30.910> this<00:06:31.150> is

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
think about this at all and that this is

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.930 
think about this at all and that this is
a<00:06:31.479> very<00:06:31.900> easy<00:06:32.290> way<00:06:32.440> if<00:06:32.860> you<00:06:33.340> try<00:06:33.550> to<00:06:33.610> figure<00:06:33.820> out

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
a very easy way if you try to figure out

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.180 
a very easy way if you try to figure out
what<00:06:34.570> type<00:06:34.780> of<00:06:34.810> damage<00:06:35.470> and<00:06:35.650> what<00:06:35.979> type<00:06:36.160> of

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
what type of damage and what type of

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.700 
what type of damage and what type of
range<00:06:36.610> of<00:06:37.000> your<00:06:37.419> weapon<00:06:37.690> that<00:06:38.350> you're<00:06:38.500> using

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
range of your weapon that you're using

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.400 
range of your weapon that you're using
can<00:06:39.070> also<00:06:39.250> depend<00:06:39.669> on<00:06:39.970> how<00:06:40.810> far<00:06:40.870> you<00:06:41.229> need<00:06:41.350> a

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
can also depend on how far you need a

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.750 
can also depend on how far you need a
beat<00:06:42.000> so<00:06:43.000> basically<00:06:43.690> just<00:06:44.080> debunked<00:06:44.470> how<00:06:45.310> the
