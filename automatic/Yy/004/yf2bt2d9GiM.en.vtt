00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
did it and I thought the audition went

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.120 
did it and I thought the audition went
really<00:00:51.220> badly<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.960> I<00:00:52.990> was<00:00:53.560> really<00:00:53.920> bummed

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
in retrospect now I understand it's a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.000 
in retrospect now I understand it's a

little bit more of the job I took on but

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.449 
little bit more of the job I took on but
I'm<00:02:23.579> hoping<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.120> people<00:02:24.750> will<00:02:25.230> enjoy<00:02:25.650> what<00:02:26.400> I

I'm hoping that people will enjoy what I

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.819 
I'm hoping that people will enjoy what I
did<00:02:26.700> while<00:02:27.180> still<00:02:27.540> loving<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:27.989> Sally<00:02:28.319> did<00:02:28.440> as

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
giving away any spoilers I I think the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.280 
giving away any spoilers I I think the
games<00:02:55.440> are<00:02:58.250> very<00:02:59.250> intriguing<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:01.080> know<00:03:01.140> I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
games are very intriguing and you know I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.410 
games are very intriguing and you know I
like<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.830> fact<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.430> shifts<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.300> little

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
like the fact that it shifts a little

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.340 
like the fact that it shifts a little
bit<00:03:03.570> from<00:03:04.080> game<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.710> game<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:06.020> think<00:03:07.020> it's<00:03:07.200> a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
bit from game to game and I think it's a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.680 
bit from game to game and I think it's a
great<00:03:08.040> franchise<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.850> I'm<00:03:08.970> excited<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.480> see

ages<00:03:36.870> voice<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.440> definitely<00:03:38.600> did<00:03:39.600> more<00:03:39.900> vocal

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
ages voice I definitely did more vocal

warm-ups<00:03:40.920> on<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:41.640> way<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.450> Moreno<00:03:42.600> Rae<00:03:43.670> then

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
warm-ups on the way to Moreno Rae then

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.300 
warm-ups on the way to Moreno Rae then
well<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.660> always<00:03:45.960> do<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> vocal<00:03:46.560> warm-ups<00:03:47.010> but

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
well I always do a vocal warm-ups but

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.090 
well I always do a vocal warm-ups but
because<00:03:47.610> her<00:03:48.390> voice<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.930> much<00:03:49.200> smoother<00:03:49.770> than

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
because her voice is much smoother than

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.330 
because her voice is much smoother than
mine<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.360> more<00:03:51.780> sophisticated<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:52.710> had<00:03:53.220> to

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
mine and more sophisticated I had to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.460 
mine and more sophisticated I had to
kind<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:53.670> try<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.150> make<00:03:54.720> sure<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.380> know

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
kind of try and make sure that you know

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.330 
kind of try and make sure that you know
it<00:03:55.560> didn't<00:03:55.770> sound<00:03:55.830> like<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.040> was<00:03:56.070> hitting

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
it didn't sound like I was hitting

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.450 
it didn't sound like I was hitting
puberty<00:03:56.520> every<00:03:57.060> fourth<00:03:57.540> line<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:59.280> know

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
puberty every fourth line so you know

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.010 
puberty every fourth line so you know
some<00:03:59.670> cracking<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.270> stuff<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.540> she<00:04:00.870> doesn't

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
some cracking and stuff that she doesn't

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.950 
some cracking and stuff that she doesn't
have<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.730> for<00:04:02.730> me<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.120> was<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.240> matter<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.600> trying

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
have so for me it was a matter of trying

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.320 
have so for me it was a matter of trying
to<00:04:04.200> keep<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.590> very<00:04:05.810> smooth<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.050> easy<00:04:08.300> which<00:04:09.300> is

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
to keep it very smooth and easy which is

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.540 
to keep it very smooth and easy which is
not<00:04:09.600> necessarily<00:04:10.230> something<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:10.980> play<00:04:11.220> all<00:04:11.460> the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
not necessarily something I play all the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.520 
not necessarily something I play all the
time<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.870> was<00:04:12.960> definitely<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.350> different

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
time so it was definitely a different

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.030 
time so it was definitely a different
headspace<00:04:13.830> from<00:04:15.770> some<00:04:16.770> of<00:04:16.860> the<00:04:16.950> other

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
headspace from some of the other

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.539 
headspace from some of the other
characters<00:04:17.489> I've<00:04:17.640> played<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.630> think<00:04:19.020> that

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
characters I've played and I think that

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.440 
characters I've played and I think that
Capcom<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:22.130> don't<00:04:23.130> think<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:23.850> they<00:04:24.000> wanted

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
Capcom I don't think that they wanted

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.270 
Capcom I don't think that they wanted
someone<00:04:25.020> who<00:04:25.290> was<00:04:25.980> just<00:04:26.010> like<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:28.070> exact<00:04:29.070> voice

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
someone who was just like a exact voice

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.880 
someone who was just like a exact voice
match<00:04:29.640> for<00:04:29.670> Sally<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.450> felt<00:04:30.840> like<00:04:31.020> they<00:04:31.530> wanted

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
match for Sally I felt like they wanted

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.370 
match for Sally I felt like they wanted
her<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.190> be<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:33.300> know<00:04:33.420> four<00:04:33.630> ADA's<00:04:33.900> voice<00:04:34.110> to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
her to be you know four ADA's voice to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.220 
her to be you know four ADA's voice to
remain<00:04:34.680> cool<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:35.640> sophisticated<00:04:36.090> but<00:04:36.900> they

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
remain cool and sophisticated but they

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.580 
remain cool and sophisticated but they
weren't<00:04:37.470> trying<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.370> make<00:04:38.790> me<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.420> know

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
weren't trying to make me you know

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.620 
weren't trying to make me you know
obviously<00:04:40.590> they<00:04:40.830> would<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:41.700> used<00:04:42.090> Sally

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
obviously they would have used Sally

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.550 
obviously they would have used Sally
um<00:04:43.040> suppo<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:44.940> Capcom<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:46.260> wanted

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
um suppo I think that Capcom just wanted

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.990 
um suppo I think that Capcom just wanted
to<00:04:46.680> keep<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:47.010> spirit<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.730> Ada<00:04:49.100> alive<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.880> know

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
to keep the spirit of Ada alive you know

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.350 
to keep the spirit of Ada alive you know
in<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.390> original<00:04:51.870> voice<00:04:52.080> alive<00:04:53.150> but<00:04:54.150> there

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
in the original voice alive but there

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.420 
in the original voice alive but there
was<00:04:54.480> room<00:04:54.690> for<00:04:54.720> some<00:04:55.500> differences<00:04:55.920> -<00:04:56.130> which<00:04:56.310> I

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
was room for some differences - which I

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.800 
was room for some differences - which I
