00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
is great mainly because enchanted

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.580 
is great mainly because enchanted
weapons<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> lot<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.200> benefits

and<00:02:04.710> perks<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.240> more<00:02:06.240> often<00:02:06.450> than<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.719> we

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and perks but more often than not we

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.719 
and perks but more often than not we
don't<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.590> them<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> use<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.190> our

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
don't really put them to use because our

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.510 
don't really put them to use because our
characters<00:02:09.470> they<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:11.009> use<00:02:11.190> her<00:02:11.340> skills

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
characters they really use her skills

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.600 
characters they really use her skills
and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.040 
and
really<00:02:12.910> benefit<00:02:13.270> from<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.600> enchanted

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
really benefit from the enchanted

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.440 
really benefit from the enchanted
ability<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.470> weapons<00:02:14.830> however<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.910> followers

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
ability of weapons however the followers

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.870 
ability of weapons however the followers
use<00:02:17.200> them<00:02:17.350> all<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.470> time<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.100> they<00:02:18.700> can

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
use them all the time and they can

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.930 
use them all the time and they can
benefit<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:20.110> rather<00:02:20.650> than<00:02:20.800> having<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:21.430> lot<00:02:21.820> of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
benefit so rather than having a lot of

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.510 
benefit so rather than having a lot of
gear<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.510> getting<00:02:22.900> close<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.380> no<00:02:23.890> damage<00:02:24.310> out
