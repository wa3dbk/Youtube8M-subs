00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.899
 128 riders from 23 different countries 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.160
 be disguised by the mayor of 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.200
 well shot 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.200
 for this 18th edition of the zlm tour 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.119
 a bit of chaos at the start eagerly 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.119
 riders at the departure as you see 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.900
 and after the official go-ahead 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.850
 given how eager it is 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.610
 then southwest wind force 4 tot 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.620
 5 and wind blows favorably in the initial phase 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.540
 that for the Dutch reason for it 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.390
 speed up at the start 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.610
 already in the first kilometers of the in 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.200
 a total of 177 breaks into the pack 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.820
 different pieces 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.660
 the first group is in the direction of the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.510
 zealand bridge 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.970
 17 riders big but the differences 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.820
 are still small the leaders ride the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.110
 after 10 km from the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.239
 leadership among others everything is the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.950
 Dutch with the only sale here 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.370
 brian van goethem from sluice kill with 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.810
 number 3 but also one in his wheel 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.699
 the big favorites for this competition 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.110
 the german rick zabel 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.670
 who entered the opening game last week 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.580
 the nations cup the flanders round 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.470
 managed to win but let's take a moment 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.880
 listen some goethem home rider 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.340
 just before the start of the competition 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.190
 well thought i just think hard and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.630
 the rates and yes my role in the room 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.340
 and especially since I left here again 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.720
 incredibly good and I like the other one 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.360
 send boys to colder 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.709
 Captain and if there is any 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.259
 situation so I can also my own 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.000
 chance go and yes we just have to be best 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.890
 and we have to look at how the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.470
 the course of the course make the legs be and then 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.580
 you can really roll a few and the go 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.110
 to describe 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.160
 hbe of tying today i have 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.289
 a free role 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.670
 well i just have a free role and me 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.470
 think everyone just a free one 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.789
 role has had to look at how 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.289
 the competition goes in which 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.580
 situation 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.890
 of course we also have a few quick ones 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.660
 man to attract but with this wind 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.130
 will not actually wash on the 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.569
 mass sprint from weird 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.420
 so the plans of the dutch are 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.179
 clearly make the game hard there 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.950
 behind it are mainly the Belgians who 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.840
 to hunt 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.190
 call conductive nations cup they have 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.170
 nobody and want this crooked 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.970
 thus correct the situation 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.930
 the difference is less than half a 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.910
 minute 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.190
 the is driven very fast 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.510
 differences remain playable as the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.660
 riders have schouw-pigeon land 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.459
 reached behind the 17 leaders of one 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.000
 organized hunting actually not really 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.310
 there 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.410
 it makes the difference 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.850
 runs to about half a minute 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.490
 in the front it is still the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.800
 orange shirts that set the pace 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.230
 in addition to the 6 Dutch, duos from 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.460
 france germany australia and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.750
 Switzerland for 40 km we have 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.190
 driven as the riders towards the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.450
 philipsdam driving 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.970
 the difference between the first group and 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.870
 pursuers has become smaller again 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.140
 and there seems to be a regrouping ahead 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.390
 this is a beautiful image on the philipsdam 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.880
 in the front car erik zabel the 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.200
 former German top rider he won under 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.270
 more five times the green jersey in the tour 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.370
 de france and he is now in the competition 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.810
 to the operations of his son Rick 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.950
 to follow 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.950
 we see it here with number 45 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.650
 that the heart goes shows it 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.270
 average is 52 and a half kilometers 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.640
 traveled in the first match hour 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.860
 and the regrouping Dhira seemed to come 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.300
 never came 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.790
 that is striking because the difference was 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.820
 at Bruinisse after 35 kilometers 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.300
 mama 100 meters with more than 100 km too 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.640
 to drive 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.130
 after a little brabant we are finished 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.570
 way to tholen and bryan reimbursed him 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.730
 is thirsty 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.560
 he asks for a water bottle at the neutral 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 material low 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.650
 for good and already booked 3 victories this 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.270
 season 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.550
 next week he will be 22 and he will 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.640
 like to own a fourth victory today 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.030
 add province 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.629
 115 is the maximum difference 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.340
 but then the pace behind it goes up 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.579
 Kazakhstan in particular takes the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.170
 chase in hands in a second 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.170
 group with about 30 riders 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.620
 the front then passes the neutral 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.079
 material wagon means the gap quickly 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.099
 becomes smaller and therefore it becomes smaller 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.970
 restless in the first group 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.190
 different riders think it is 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.130
 not going fast enough and in particular 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.690
 brian van goethem is active, we are then 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.729
 on the way to the cobblestone lane at the 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.320
 higher where polder on the border between 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.419
 Zeeland and Brabant and we see that below 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.440
 direct the greenhouse bags and first 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:37.240
 group joins the 17 in front 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.169
 now a total of thirty people and they 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.169
 dark over the cobbles 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.250
 away for one of the australians and we 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.020
 See that from the background even more 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.820
 riders try the crossing forward 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.680
 to make another short trip 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.620
 brabant 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.360
 we also see more groups looking at that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.580
 drive forwards back in zealand then with 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.580
 just under 70 km to drive 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.680
 we have a large group in charge 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.210
 but the pace is not too fast anymore 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.210
 light after that faster start 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.880
 There are different attacks 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.880
 but they are actually all from 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.099
 Short term, the first serious attack 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.310
 from the brit john it caught a double 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.509
 both surfaces bridge quickly for half a minute 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.520
 the 19 year old this is me 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.360
 first-year pledge is also very active on the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.830
 job 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.620
 last year when he was still a junior 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.560
 he gained Paris cream and let it 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:42.340
 fifth at the World Cup in Valkenburg he picks up 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.990
 35 seconds at the first of 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.880
 a total of three passages on the cat one 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.770
 German dyke with just under 40 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.400
 two men to go to this and miles 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.770
 driven to it 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.870
 the Japanese Kinoshita in the 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.930
 New Zealander McCormick have the gap 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.520
 poem and we get 3 leaders 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.680
 behind that gas is also given and 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.440
 we see brian van goethem tempo again 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.840
 and therefore the large group breaks 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.340
 in several pieces 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.909
 not much later the three will be 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.340
 arrested a lot of turmoil in the first 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.710
 local laps around are good at 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.020
 25 km to drive 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.460
 miscellaneous run-out attempts but none of them 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.409
 the riders really know how to get away 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.630
 This is the second passage on the cat one 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.340
 German empire and again van soot him with 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.759
 are Dutch colleagues who are trying 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.370
 to hit a hole that runs from goethem 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.849
 a strong match itself and again 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:36.250
 much fragmentation behind it 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.930
 then we enter the final lap of 17km 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.400
 and it is all goethem 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.800
 but trying to separate 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.270
 he seems to get some room with the 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.740
 fingers passage but doesn't really get away 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.120
 tons stands by the executioner's work 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.490
 zeeuws-vlaming this group in the 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.159
 14-man final round and the winner will be there 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.810
 this 18th round zlm sitting 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.030
 the Dutch are like all day long 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.069
 already well represented for to the 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.900
 Belgians have three riders ahead 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:07.930
 netherlands we are yoeri hawk 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.759
 brian van goethem and degree of train van 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.460
 trijp seems to have a lot to do with it 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:16.210
 but it remains restless in the group 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.430
 no time to catch your breath 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.020
 the last time she can do that 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.610
 with a few miles to go and 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.590
 but again a pace acceleration of 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.229
 reimbursed him he seems to be one of the 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.940
 strongest in course but the other likes 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.039
 that also a bit to see and be gone 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.690
 to wheel 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:33.580
 shortly thereafter another Dutchman 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.680
 in the absolute final phase 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.229
 yoeri hawk from assendelft together with the 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.289
 sloven market schrama star beach 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.940
 and this seems to be the decision of the Netherlands 

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:44.650
 all day, the initiative but 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.729
 is there also an orange rider it 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.740
 finish up 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:49.870
 yeah that's gonna be bluey hawk 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.270
 the successor of the Fransman Maxim Daniel 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.740
 as the winner of the zlm tour 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.539
 in the last kilometer he leaves the
