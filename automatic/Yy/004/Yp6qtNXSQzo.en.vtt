00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
bit skinny okay see if we just go all

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.179 
bit skinny okay see if we just go all
the<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.869> over<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the way over like that you see how that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.800 
the way over like that you see how that
changing<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.000> looks<00:02:06.180> strange

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
changing to looks strange

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
changing to looks strange
okay<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.950> we're<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.310> somewhere<00:02:08.700> in

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
okay so we're going to go somewhere in

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.270 
okay so we're going to go somewhere in
this<00:02:08.970> area<00:02:09.270> okay<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.259> we're<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.160> hit

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
this area okay and we're going to hit

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.869 
this area okay and we're going to hit
Enter

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
Enter

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.900 
Enter
we're<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.870> two<00:02:13.080> paths

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
we're going to do this in two paths

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.960 
we're going to do this in two paths
okay<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.480> let<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.870> transform<00:02:16.550> pause<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.730> video

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
okay so let it transform pause the video

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.480 
okay so let it transform pause the video
for<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.390> second<00:02:18.720> okay<00:02:19.130> there<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.250> have<00:02:20.400> it

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
for just a second okay there we have it

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.770 
for just a second okay there we have it
and<00:02:20.610> we're<00:02:20.820> going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:20.970> run<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.540> command

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and we're going to run this command

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.980 
and we're going to run this command
again<00:02:22.320> we're<00:02:22.530> going<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.710> go<00:02:22.920> edit<00:02:23.990> content

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990

see I'm starting to push her body in too
much<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:44.130> we<00:02:44.250> go<00:02:44.280> we're<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.960> maybe

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
much so there we go we're going to maybe

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.640 
much so there we go we're going to maybe
try<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.740> like<00:02:47.010> that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
try it like that

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.560 
try it like that
somewhere<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:50.240> okay<00:02:51.240> we're<00:02:51.420> going<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
somewhere like that okay we're going to

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.140 
somewhere like that okay we're going to
hit<00:02:51.690> enter<00:02:51.960> there<00:02:52.320> let<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.190> think<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.000> going

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
hit enter there let it think it's going

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.470 
hit enter there let it think it's going
to<00:02:54.180> transform<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.910> then<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.150> next<00:02:57.420> thing

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
to transform and then the next thing

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.760 
to transform and then the next thing
we're<00:02:57.630> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.960> is<00:02:58.410> we're<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.710> to
