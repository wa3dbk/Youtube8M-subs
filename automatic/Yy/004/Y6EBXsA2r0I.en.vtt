16-valve dual overhead cam 2.0 it's a

good<00:01:38.420> solid<00:01:38.870> engine<00:01:40.810> it's<00:01:41.810> been<00:01:41.930> sitting<00:01:42.260> for

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
good solid engine it's been sitting for

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.610 
good solid engine it's been sitting for
about<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.620> year<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.310> half<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:44.470> cranked<00:01:45.470> it

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
about a year and a half I cranked it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.740 
about a year and a half I cranked it
maybe<00:01:46.100> twice<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.030> month

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.900 

running<00:01:50.750> up<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.140> down<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.380> driveway<00:01:51.910> about

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
running up and down the driveway about

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.060 
running up and down the driveway about
twice<00:01:53.150> a<00:01:53.180> month

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
twice a month

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.320 
twice a month
the<00:01:55.070> only<00:01:55.220> thing<00:01:55.400> reason<00:01:55.640> why<00:01:55.760> it's<00:01:56.240> been

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
the only thing reason why it's been

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.480 
the only thing reason why it's been
parked<00:01:56.930> is<00:01:57.110> because<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.830> transmission<00:01:58.400> is

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
parked is because the transmission is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.270 
parked is because the transmission is
slipping<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:00.740> gonna<00:02:00.860> need<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.130> new

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
slipping so it's gonna need a new

00:02:01.280 --> 00:03:37.430 
slipping so it's gonna need a new
transmission<00:02:01.460> or<00:02:02.060> rebuilt<00:02:02.480> one

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.300 

fans<00:03:37.980> overlap

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
fans overlap

00:03:39.310 --> 00:04:09.589 
fans overlap
like<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.700> said<00:03:39.760> there's<00:03:40.120> two<00:03:40.300> things

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.790 

it's<00:04:09.930> got<00:04:10.170> to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
it's got to

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.830 
it's got to
gl<00:04:13.170> subwoofers<00:04:14.170> in<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.770> bandpass<00:04:15.010> block<00:04:15.720> with<00:04:16.720> a

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
gl subwoofers in a bandpass block with a

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.300 
gl subwoofers in a bandpass block with a
father<00:04:17.080> and<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.380> watch<00:04:17.590> Jensen<00:04:18.450> amplifiers<00:04:20.310> and

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
father and a watch Jensen amplifiers and

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.800 
father and a watch Jensen amplifiers and
like<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:21.730> said<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> reason<00:04:22.180> why<00:04:22.390> I<00:04:22.420> don't<00:04:22.630> drive

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
like I said the reason why I don't drive

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.180 
like I said the reason why I don't drive
it<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.110> because<00:04:23.440> it's<00:04:23.980> transmission<00:04:24.790> slipping

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
it is because it's transmission slipping

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.560 
it is because it's transmission slipping
and<00:04:27.190> that's<00:04:27.640> it<00:04:27.850> 92<00:04:28.420> Mitsubishi<00:04:29.140> Eclipse<00:04:29.350> ES

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
and that's it 92 Mitsubishi Eclipse ES

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.300 
and that's it 92 Mitsubishi Eclipse ES
