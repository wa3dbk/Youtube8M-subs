I believe you know at the time we had a
pretty<00:00:20.460> good<00:00:20.640> chance<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.119> other<00:00:21.420> than<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
pretty good chance but other than that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.370 
pretty good chance but other than that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
your greatest love you certainly the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.840 
your greatest love you certainly the
first<00:00:32.940> love<00:00:33.270> rallying<00:00:33.809> yeah<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.010> Jamie's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
first love rallying yeah well Jamie's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090 
first love rallying yeah well Jamie's
built<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.149> terrific<00:00:36.540> car<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
built a terrific car for that and I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700 
built a terrific car for that and I
believe<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> best<00:00:39.420> car<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
believe it's the best car here in the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
believe it's the best car here in the
field<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:42.329> might<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> good<00:00:42.809> vice<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
field and this might be a good vice of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.479 
field and this might be a good vice of
course<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.829> believe<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.250> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
course but I believe it is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
course but I believe it is
Jamie<00:00:45.090> Drummond<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:46.020> makes<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.469> want<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
Jamie Drummond what makes you want to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.380 
Jamie Drummond what makes you want to
build<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.160> car<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.670> then<00:00:47.820> give<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> somebody

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
build a car and then give it to somebody

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.080 
build a car and then give it to somebody
else<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.719> wear<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> can't<00:00:50.700> drive<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
else to wear up that I can't drive the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.369 
else to wear up that I can't drive the
car<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.870> making<00:00:52.110> capability<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:54.379> an

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
car so it's making capability and an

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
car so it's making capability and an
excellent<00:00:55.739> driver<00:00:56.030> deserves<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.180> break
