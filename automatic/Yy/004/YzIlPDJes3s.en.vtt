00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.920 
then you sort of roll it like some
school<00:03:21.659> yeah<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.419> so<00:03:24.419> that's<00:03:24.599> that's<00:03:24.780> about

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
school yeah and so that's that's about

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
school yeah and so that's that's about
it<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:26.189> it's<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.939> keeper<00:03:27.329> I'm

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
it so I think that it's a keeper I'm

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.809 
it so I think that it's a keeper I'm
going<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:27.750> keep<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:29.370> design<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
going to keep it and then design the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.619 
going to keep it and then design the
other<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.389> that<00:03:30.629> is<00:03:31.319> one<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.970> another<00:03:33.209> part

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
other one that is one and another part

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.960 
other one that is one and another part
is<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.949> I<00:03:35.010> think<00:03:35.159> it's<00:03:35.519> supposed<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.879> be

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
is that I think it's supposed to be

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.729 
is that I think it's supposed to be
better<00:03:36.209> than<00:03:36.359> what<00:03:36.629> this<00:03:36.840> one<00:03:37.079> is<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:37.439> this<00:03:37.590> is

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
better than what this one is so this is

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.449
