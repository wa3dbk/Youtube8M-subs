billets<00:00:50.790> we<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.269> over<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.660> course<00:00:51.839> of<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
billets we do them over the course of a

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.259 
billets we do them over the course of a
year<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> probably<00:00:53.190> takes<00:00:53.339> about<00:00:53.640> three<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
year so it probably takes about three to

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.719 
year so it probably takes about three to
four<00:00:54.479> maybe<00:00:54.780> five<00:00:55.290> years<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.979> do<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.280> entire

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
four maybe five years to do this entire

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.780 
four maybe five years to do this entire
attack<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:58.019> then<00:00:58.379> led<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> decision

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
attack which then led to the decision

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.630 
attack which then led to the decision
and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> challenge<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:01.949> possibly<00:01:02.399> do

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
and the challenge can you possibly do

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.249 
and the challenge can you possibly do
the<00:01:02.790> rest<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.659> very<00:01:03.870> abbreviated

the rest and in a very abbreviated
amount<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> time<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.690> be<00:01:06.780> an

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
amount of time this would be an

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.740 
amount of time this would be an
