why<00:01:54.820> he<00:01:55.000> didn't<00:01:55.270> use<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.660> or<00:01:56.650> because<00:01:57.430> we<00:01:57.520> got

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
why he didn't use it or because we got

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.030 
why he didn't use it or because we got
DRS<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:58.540> he<00:01:58.810> must<00:01:58.990> have<00:01:59.140> not<00:01:59.350> been<00:01:59.500> using<00:01:59.710> curse

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
DRS so he must have not been using curse

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.920 
DRS so he must have not been using curse
because<00:02:00.910> I've<00:02:01.090> had<00:02:01.210> him<00:02:01.300> on<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.510> straight<00:02:01.720> so

keep<00:02:11.830> cutting<00:02:12.190> corners<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.700> don't<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:13.629> this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
keep cutting corners I don't like this

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.360 
keep cutting corners I don't like this
track<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.050> can't<00:02:14.319> seem<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.530> nail<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:15.040> because<00:02:15.069> on

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
track I can't seem to nail it because on

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.530 
track I can't seem to nail it because on
this<00:02:15.550> game<00:02:15.760> rather<00:02:16.030> than<00:02:16.180> f1<00:02:16.629> 2010<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
this game rather than f1 2010 the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.560 
this game rather than f1 2010 the
turning<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.320> more<00:02:20.620> sensitive<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.340> find<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.540> I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
turning is more sensitive I find so I

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.059 
turning is more sensitive I find so I
centre<00:02:23.290> cut<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.680> corners

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
centre cut the corners

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.619

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.280 
and go off magnificently
so<00:03:30.699> we<00:03:30.849> can<00:03:31.030> cruise<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.449> victory<00:03:31.479> if<00:03:32.139> you've

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
so we can cruise to victory if you've

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.439 
so we can cruise to victory if you've
noticed<00:03:32.470> I've<00:03:32.829> taken<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.280> corner<00:03:33.729> that<00:03:33.909> way

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
noticed I've taken that corner that way

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:35.939 
noticed I've taken that corner that way
every<00:03:34.959> single<00:03:35.229> lap<00:03:35.379> and<00:03:35.500> hasn't<00:03:35.650> give<00:03:35.829> me<00:03:35.919> a

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
every single lap and hasn't give me a

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.830 
every single lap and hasn't give me a
call<00:03:36.189> it's<00:03:36.549> fantastic<00:03:37.180> way<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.359> doing<00:03:37.629> it<00:03:37.750> you

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
call it's fantastic way of doing it you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.159 
call it's fantastic way of doing it you
should<00:03:37.870> try<00:03:38.199> it<00:03:38.349> and<00:03:38.769> there<00:03:39.459> was<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> Lotus<00:03:40.629> spun

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
should try it and there was a Lotus spun

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.879 
should try it and there was a Lotus spun
out<00:03:41.379> so<00:03:41.829> he's<00:03:42.430> up<00:03:42.609> into<00:03:42.849> p2<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:44.199> Lotus<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
out so he's up into p2 the Lotus the

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.979 
out so he's up into p2 the Lotus the
brawl<00:03:45.220> between<00:03:45.489> p1<00:03:45.909> and<00:03:46.120> p2<00:03:46.359> ended<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
brawl between p1 and p2 ended in a

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.689 
brawl between p1 and p2 ended in a
spinning<00:03:47.319> Lotus<00:03:47.859> but<00:03:50.009> it<00:03:51.009> was<00:03:51.250> looking<00:03:51.639> like

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
spinning Lotus but it was looking like

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:55.080 
spinning Lotus but it was looking like
p2<00:03:52.509> but<00:03:52.989> he's<00:03:53.709> got<00:03:53.919> himself<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.459> penalty<00:03:54.909> that's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
p2 but he's got himself a penalty that's

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.949 
p2 but he's got himself a penalty that's
disappointing<00:03:55.540> 10<00:03:55.989> seconds<00:03:56.530> he's<00:03:56.650> got<00:03:56.859> it<00:03:57.959> so

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
disappointing 10 seconds he's got it so

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.449 
disappointing 10 seconds he's got it so
that<00:03:59.079> isn't<00:03:59.259> good<00:03:59.560> news<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.099> here<00:04:00.310> we<00:04:00.430> are

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
that isn't good news so here we are

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.920 
that isn't good news so here we are
ratios<00:04:00.819> review<00:04:01.449> I'm<00:04:01.509> gonna<00:04:01.659> have<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.840> be

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
ratios review I'm gonna have to be

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.030 
ratios review I'm gonna have to be
careful<00:04:02.290> through<00:04:02.379> these<00:04:02.650> last<00:04:02.829> few<00:04:03.009> corners

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
careful through these last few corners

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.759 
careful through these last few corners
so<00:04:06.040> it's<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.759> a<00:04:06.849> p2<00:04:07.269> probably<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.290> could<00:04:08.530> say

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
so it's it's a p2 probably I could say

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.129 
so it's it's a p2 probably I could say
you<00:04:09.549> know<00:04:09.699> I<00:04:09.729> should<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.239> p2<00:04:10.419> but<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.840> shouldn't

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
you know I should be p2 but I shouldn't

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.929 
you know I should be p2 but I shouldn't
do<00:04:11.469> you<00:04:11.530> know<00:04:11.650> frankly<00:04:12.310> I've<00:04:12.430> been<00:04:12.579> punished

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
do you know frankly I've been punished

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.339 
do you know frankly I've been punished
for<00:04:13.060> cutting<00:04:13.359> too<00:04:13.479> many<00:04:13.659> corners<00:04:13.870> it's<00:04:14.169> been<00:04:14.319> a

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
for cutting too many corners it's been a

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.800 
for cutting too many corners it's been a
poor<00:04:14.620> driving<00:04:15.129> I've<00:04:15.849> been<00:04:16.030> too<00:04:16.209> keen<00:04:16.479> on<00:04:16.509> the

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
poor driving I've been too keen on the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.990 
poor driving I've been too keen on the
throttle<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.829> I've<00:04:17.979> cost<00:04:18.219> myself<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.849> was<00:04:18.969> a

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
throttle and I've cost myself that was a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.300 
throttle and I've cost myself that was a
back<00:04:19.329> marker<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.709> yeah<00:04:20.949> I'm<00:04:21.009> gonna<00:04:21.130> get

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
back marker and yeah I'm gonna get

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.399 
back marker and yeah I'm gonna get
shunted<00:04:21.609> down<00:04:21.969> I<00:04:22.000> was<00:04:22.240> probably<00:04:22.419> deserve<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.169> a

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
shunted down I was probably deserve it a

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.310 
shunted down I was probably deserve it a
