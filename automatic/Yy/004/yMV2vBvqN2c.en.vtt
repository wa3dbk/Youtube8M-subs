wave I think this one comes with the
optimist<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.800> one<00:02:23.980> comes<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.250> skywarp

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
optimist and this one comes with skywarp

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.370 
optimist and this one comes with skywarp
it's<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.000> little<00:02:25.210> spider<00:02:25.510> bot<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.260> is

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
it's a little spider bot and this is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.720 
it's a little spider bot and this is
like<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> gorilla<00:02:26.860> kind<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.280> thing<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.460> came

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
like a gorilla kind of thing that came

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.480 
like a gorilla kind of thing that came
with<00:02:27.970> Megatron<00:02:28.810> but<00:02:29.620> let's<00:02:30.010> take<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.220> look<00:02:30.430> at

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
with Megatron but let's take a look at

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.490 
with Megatron but let's take a look at
the<00:02:30.670> actual<00:02:32.520> boxes<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.820> these<00:02:34.030> guys<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:35.140> here's

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the actual boxes of these guys so here's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.870 
the actual boxes of these guys so here's
the<00:02:35.620> crazy<00:02:35.800> part<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:37.770> don't<00:02:38.770> really<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.760> not

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the crazy part we don't really it's not

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.250 
the crazy part we don't really it's not
window<00:02:40.120> box<00:02:40.300> packaging<00:02:40.750> that's<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.050> first

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
window box packaging that's the first

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.380 
window box packaging that's the first
thing<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.470> notice<00:02:41.800> it's<00:02:42.460> not<00:02:42.520> window<00:02:42.880> box<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
thing you notice it's not window box and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.660 
thing you notice it's not window box and
it<00:02:44.080> makes<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.410> feel<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.160> model<00:02:45.490> kit

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
it makes it feel like it's a model kit

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.280 
it makes it feel like it's a model kit
and<00:02:45.880> which<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.690> actually<00:02:46.900> kind<00:02:47.230> of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
and which is actually kind of

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.560 
and which is actually kind of
appropriate<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.330> apparently<00:02:49.330> the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
appropriate because apparently the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.230 
appropriate because apparently the
micron<00:02:50.050> arms<00:02:50.440> figures<00:02:50.830> are<00:02:51.070> built<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:51.790> model

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
micron arms figures are built like model

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.510 
micron arms figures are built like model
kits<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.170> build<00:02:53.709> them<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.370> have<00:02:54.459> to

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
kits like you build them you have to

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.390 
kits like you build them you have to
assemble<00:02:54.880> them<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.860> let's<00:02:56.860> take<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.070> look<00:02:57.310> at

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
assemble them and let's take a look at

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.280 
assemble them and let's take a look at
the<00:02:57.520> box<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:58.060> oh<00:02:58.420> yeah<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.140> see<00:02:59.260> right

there you see that um the sprues I'll
right<00:03:02.110> behind<00:03:02.350> optimus<00:03:02.910> while<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.060> is

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
right behind optimus while this is

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.479 
right behind optimus while this is
actually<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> good<00:03:04.780> looking<00:03:05.430> good<00:03:06.430> looking

like this up box art at the back of the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.229 
like this up box art at the back of the
box<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.070> gives<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.489> an<00:03:36.580> example<00:03:36.970> of

all the guns together because all the
Micra<00:03:42.160> NARMS<00:03:42.400> can<00:03:42.580> actually<00:03:42.850> combine<00:03:43.680> yeah<00:03:44.680> so

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
Micra NARMS can actually combine yeah so

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.560 
Micra NARMS can actually combine yeah so
look<00:03:46.150> at<00:03:46.300> that<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.660> looks<00:03:46.720> pretty<00:03:47.050> badass

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
we'll see what I look at Cliffjumper

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.140 
we'll see what I look at Cliffjumper
cliff<00:03:55.560> jumpers<00:03:55.890> got<00:03:56.070> all<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.490> weapons<00:03:56.880> all
