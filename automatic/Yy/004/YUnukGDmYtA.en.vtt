00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.650
 good you are the ones who spend 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.630
 too much in the purchase of food 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.880
 both in the supermarket and in the 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.800
 restaurants because today they are organized 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.590
 fan releases comes to offer 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.929
 strategies to save on food 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.810
 how are you welcome tell us very well 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.670
 thank goodness there are people who think 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.859
 that food should not skimp 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.500
 however we have seen a trend 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.269
 increasingly high that prisoners 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.090
 keep going up and the union comes 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.740
 we were in the called fillings of 30 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.359
 dollars with market you go for 60 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.879
 exactly that is how it seems very 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.440
 important to use the planning 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.299
 and within the planning do the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.339
 comparison of the shopper is to use 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.809
 the discount coupons and obviously 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.059
 always look for is the best offer 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.129
 but without leaving behind that the quality in 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.659
 normal food the most primordial thing to 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.940
 Sometimes this looks like a little 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.199
 threatened when we do not have time and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.359
 now that we go here we are going to start 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.010
 the classes so dad and mom sometimes 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.350
 they do not have time to get home 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.760
 prepare food for the kids like that 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.219
 that this strategy that I bring to you today 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.980
 it's just for all those people 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.710
 that they need to economize but 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.690
 they do not have time for example for example 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 the first thing is to take a day and prepare 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.830
 then the meals that are going to be 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.770
 all week and prepare them that day 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.750
 this we are going to then plan with 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.220
 how cool it is with the other parent or the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.720
 another relative what are we going to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.340
 eat this week and there we can go 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.290
 controlling also in a matter of 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.380
 nutrition that is what most us and we 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.240
 reveals does not suit us let's go to 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.460
 then take those foods after 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.619
 prepare it, we are going to pack it, we are going to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.869
 use either ciper bags that 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.390
 everyone knows them or the containers 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.920
 plastics according to your taste and your space 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.200
 because that is something that is a matter of 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.030
 taste and also source space because if 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.619
 you have a small freezer 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.600
 you know that then the bags are more 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.710
 flexible to then accommodate with 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.410
 embroider the best 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.700
 exactly then it 's going to freeze and 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.450
 it warms them up at the moment of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.300
 consume them 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.070
 I personally said good that I 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.440
 I can do it because I do not have time to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.450
 be cooking every day and sometimes 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.149
 I have to go to the street to buy food 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.090
 that obviously does not offer us the same 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.369
 nutrition 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.440
 upside down festival in most of the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.780
 cases and then I remember that when I 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.540
 he works in a restaurant that was what 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.780
 they did they had a really big freezer 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.060
 where the food was 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.040
 stored including lots to wash and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.220
 one thinks they are the same day creator 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.200
 of the home and it is not like that and if it is so 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.060
 see in the secrets look those were 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.980
 packaging and the food prepared and the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.830
 prepared food and you are 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.900
 planned and I found it internet 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.819
 again in this search investigate 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.980
 what was he doing and when I saw him 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.720
 I said I'm great but because it was 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.329
 then to investigate in this then 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.400
 investigate well and I found it's animals 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.220
 that we shared there and I put it in 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.530
 practice and look not only I'm 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.810
 saving money on food but 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.599
 that I am eating better and in addition to 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.069
 That came came home and finished 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.379
 work because we have the same case 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.459
 He came to work and it's a matter 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.170
 to heat the food and I do not have to 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.540
 be worrying about the pont is 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.670
 cooked is art I take advantage of this time and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.640
 IM going to do exercise 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.190
 on the cutting edge in planning planning and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.200
 it's a strategy that not everyone 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.060
 we know but sometimes one says well 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.410
 I cook for today for tomorrow because I know 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.180
 he knows what he can do is for a 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.349
 week several normal days because 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.349
 I cook one day a week 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.050
 It is important to emphasize that not all 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.730
 arguments can be frozen but I 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.400
 I will be publishing in lazio finish 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.069
 is dotcom on a link from the fd to 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.530
 where it tells you how to store the 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.910
 food in the freezers which 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.260
 can not which ones are the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.269
 temperatures that we should consider 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.580
 for most cases of rice the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.069
 pasta that are prepared in large 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.290
 quantities and saving what we can go to 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.910
 see well if sometimes one says ice like 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.709
 reheated because you know that the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.959
 restaurants many times you are 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.120
 possibly organized eating and you 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.430
 It's getting expensive and obviously not 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.920
 is being as nutritious as they should be 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.689
 so it's important you know when you 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.189
 go to the supermarkets take your 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.140
 Story coupons can print 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.540
 free on the dotcom badge for 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.940
 food for any kind of evening 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.009
 food and obviously then always 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.930
 have a little bit of care not to leave 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.669
 without planning , if they do not always do 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.350
 the little things so then finally 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.630
 he figured very well there is a trend 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.210
 well marked makes fan and in the latter 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.130
 days to buy with coupons every time 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.050
 I find more people looking for coupons 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.729
 to redeem them to be able to have even 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.710
 warehouses in your house are a trend 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.410
 that comes also us and we see it in 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.210
 many programs but more people what 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.280
 are doing in puerto rico - looking 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.599
 save little ones 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.310
 so we could be talking about that 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.990
 maybe in a next intervention but 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.419
 the garage uses the get in the former 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.949
 minister with two p dot com and you're 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.419
 on facebook and there is of course because 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.620
 provided they are available to 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.449
 mind and pending 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.729
 we already have the application of the suck and 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.470
 sta that is in the android market for 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.270
 that they are downloading and there too 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.190
 they will be updating themselves 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.780
 when they go shopping, it takes a 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.790
 photo and publish it within the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.050
 application very well so it's going 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.050
 growing the business
