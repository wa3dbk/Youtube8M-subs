00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.250
 bye Bye 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.640
 no 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.410
 after 20 c 27 years of work I am 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 found in front of a car 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.580
 extraordinary organizational beyond 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.230
 construction skills beyond 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.140
 techniques and their skills this 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.850
 20-day capacity to organize 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 all phases of a complex job 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.720
 why this complex job for him 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.150
 embossed for the finishes that I wanted 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.190
 like a real finished home not with a 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.940
 set up was really a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.820
 teaching and I must say that I will steal 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.470
 this experience to wolf haus or 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 the tree over time with and I hope to 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.720
 accompany me for some time in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.010
 this in this year in this 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.750
 parallelism we say between design 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.750
 constructive capacity 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.790
 that effort was precisely that of 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.660
 wanting to show want to show how the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.720
 wood allows capacity allows 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.630
 even extreme expressive possibilities 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.750
 the large cantilever the inclined the not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.150
 orthogonality light without pillars la 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.330
 cleaning the lines and that is building 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.490
 wood is for architects is a little 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.970
 as a child I play is a freedom 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.950
 extreme creative that the construction 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.470
 traditional does not give you oct imposes 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:17.940
 much more limiting constraints is much more 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:22.080
 more narrower and wood I use it as 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.230
 structural element for some time and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.100
 I must say that it offers remarkable advantages 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.820
 both for installation speed and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.880
 for performance in terms of yield 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.980
 temporal viral wood in wood a 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.320
 material that we often use in 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.570
 our projects and we always try to 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.290
 join the companies with the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.970
 processing are ahead in respect 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.190
 both of the material and of the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.580
 maintain the naturalness of the material 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.280
 same we say that inspiration also 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.740
 friends of the wolf haus have 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.290
 definitely stimulated ideas 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.010
 projects that are really a lot 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.230
 wide and without limits 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:22.910
 ready made the great a is now a 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:25.459
 matera yesterday's stand of the gods 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.490
 materials that over time do not 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.110
 get worse but improve the huge 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.690
 mutation of the taste that is 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.290
 characterizing the early 21st century and 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.660
 to sell frank leveraged silver a 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.650
 Ecological cost but also be nice 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.459
 in touching in bing inside of such 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.130
 often am arlberg network facebook of 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.160
 crisis today in recent decades there is 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.050
 was an evolution on the subject 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.489
 extraordinary because so much since 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.170
 wood production system e 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.140
 there is a controlled difference 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.200
 extraordinary supply chain that passes by 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.080
 plant the wood before the final product 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:11.390
 of all the fragrance and scent of wood 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.720
 beautiful when riva bought le 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.459
 briccole di venice has cut them will be 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.239
 inside the wood that was in the water from 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.720
 50 years there is still perfume is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.880
 surprising how a dead thing can 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.710
 survive so long and 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.450
 I gave you an emotional after so many 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.450
 years that is a telescope for 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.590
 look on the face that deserves I must 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.260
 to say that the mixture then of experiences 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.490
 among those who build who designs here has 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.490
 given to the excellent result 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.390
 we are very well known on the subject 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.020
 energy saving on the speed of 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.450
 anti-seismic construction instead in 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.460
 this context we wanted to show that 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.340
 however beyond this we are also capable 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.920
 makes cutting-edge buildings 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.500
 with a very particular design as then 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.510
 let's see with six-seven ledges 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.510
 meters and with a very nice design
