00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.410
 let's do from the ceapat a 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.820
 adaptation that will turn out to be very 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.520
 simple for all types 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.520
 of dolls to be pressed 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.490
 in some kind of hands or feet 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.419
 let's see the material that we are going to 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.990
 use for all kinds of these 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.390
 adaptations as we have said 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 of toys that you have to push with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.590
 fingers on any hand or on the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 foot the truth that this is going to be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.220
 the low cost because it is very simple 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 a one 3.5 aerial male monkey plug 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.840
 a piece of two-wire cable that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.590
 you can can be from any one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.900
 tin a soldering iron and a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.200
 little bit of electrical tape 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.420
 the first step for adaptation 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.420
 always as we will see about where we are going to 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.140
 press in this case on the epp and on the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.960
 hand what we're going to do is that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.680
 with a scissors or with a cutter we are going to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.050
 always break the seam we're going to 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.450
 let be the seam to locate 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.030
 whenever two cables are going to go once 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.700
 that we have made a cut always cited in 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.650
 all kinds of this this kind of doll 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.100
 that we press on a hand a foot 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.690
 let's locate in all kinds will 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.440
 always two little cables 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.410
 once we have always located the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.080
 two wires coming from the pushbutton let's go 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.450
 we are going to peel so we can splice 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.270
 our female diary where we will connect 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.810
 the pulsador although it is not very orthodox 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.990
 a way to strip the wire without cutting it 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.910
 is with giving it heat with the same 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.910
 welder that we have already plugged 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.690
 we have peeled you see a little the cable 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.569
 that comes from the button and with another 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.060
 piece of two-wire cable that in 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.630
 this case we use hose that can be 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.630
 ask for a phone call 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.080
 to peel too 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.060
 these these cables and this we do with 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.950
 the tip of the scissors 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.730
 once as you see we have peeled 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.720
 also the cable that we are going to connect 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.990
 the button what we are going to do is that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.250
 or else he gives us a spin on the 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:52.040
 cable that comes from the doll's we give it 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.230
 turns on the other cable let's say that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.480
 this is a splice in us for 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.330
 greater security what we are going to do 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.840
 It is also that we are going to weld it 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.840
 bit 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.300
 sold the other cable and now for a 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.670
 little bit more security with a bit 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.670
 of insulating tape we're going 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.520
 to entangle so that you can not have 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.770
 a short circuit we have faced the 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.130
 another cable and now what we're going to do 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.490
 is that we're going to put it back inside 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.150
 the doll cables although it will come out 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.030
 the back the cable that we're going to 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.150
 connect our pushbutton this or else what 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.010
 We cook with a little bit of glue what 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.730
 we can paste 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.819
 well let's go almost with the last step 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.939
 of the adaptation the female aerial jazz what 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.849
 unscrew we have of the sleeve we will pass 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:59.560
 the cover so that later it can be returned to 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:04.560
 roll up the cable let's peel the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 cable for the last step drop it 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.270
 You see, they always come out 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.150
 the two threads 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.090
 we believe that we have soldier 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.250
 we will fight here very very little so that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.609
 can not do us a short in the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.609
 plug 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.900
 well we see the female that we have the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.670
 part the part let's say where we're going to 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.220
 drop one of the wires that in the part 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.560
 is large and then the other cable in 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.800
 either of the two legs 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.890
 we can solder is indifferent we go to 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.710
 make the solder we solder one of the 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.000
 cables 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.430
 here in this part and the other one we are going to 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.340
 drop here on either of the two 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.630
 sideburns I have picked this one 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:01.990
 the cable squeezing so that we do not get 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.990
 move before any pull tighten the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.870
 pins with the cable and we are going to screw 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.480
 and we have finished the adaptation 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.400
 and we have already finished the adaptation as 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.590
 you see we have connected one of our 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.110
 push buttons and we will approve the adaptation 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.320
 what we are going to replace then is the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.450
 movement of the hand push button to 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.750
 through and the button works 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.750
 correctly
