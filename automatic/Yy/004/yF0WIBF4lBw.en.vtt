I promised my mother I would help him get
through it all.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.900
So I caught up with him this one night and
I was already half a dozen drinks behind.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.950
So we had a few more.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.960
And after a while he tells me he wants to
drive me back to the apartment.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.280
I said no thanks.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.019
We were all still living there then.

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:42.019
I just stood there and watched him drive off.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.280
Makes it through the whole goddamn war and
I let him drive.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.469
Later that night, Ines was typing whatever
it is they type on, and you know what she

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.180
tells me?

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.430
She tells me how much my book meant to her.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.430
My brother's getting cold in the next room
and all she can talk about is a book.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.520
Well, everything changed from then on.

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.699
Within five months, I buried him, my ma, my
father, all of them here in the Bronx.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.420
We spent our summers here and if we were lucky,
the fall.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.460
A lot of falls with those teams.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.800
Not enough.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:05.100
The 
rest of those who have gone before us cannot
steady the unrest of those to follow.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.280
You wrote that in your book.
