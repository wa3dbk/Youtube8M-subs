as<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.870> knitter<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.140> inevitable<00:00:04.950> that

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
as a knitter is inevitable that

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.430 
as a knitter is inevitable that
eventually<00:00:05.730> you're<00:00:06.420> going<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.990> have<00:00:07.230> to

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
eventually you're going to have to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.830 
eventually you're going to have to
figure<00:00:07.770> out<00:00:07.980> how<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> join<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.059> yarn<00:00:09.599> that

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
figure out how to join the yarn that

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.459 
figure out how to join the yarn that
just<00:00:10.110> ran<00:00:10.320> out<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> new<00:00:11.849> ball<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> yarn<00:00:12.469> there

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
just ran out to a new ball of yarn there

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.499 
just ran out to a new ball of yarn there
are<00:00:13.620> several<00:00:13.830> ways<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.340> doing<00:00:14.490> them<00:00:14.849> I'm<00:00:15.150> going

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
are several ways of doing them I'm going

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.480 
are several ways of doing them I'm going
to<00:00:15.630> show<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.379> technique<00:00:16.710> called<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to show you one technique called a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.150 
to show you one technique called a
Russian<00:00:17.910> joint<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:19.109> order<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> Russian

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
Russian joint in order to do a Russian

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.950 
Russian joint in order to do a Russian
join<00:00:20.369> you're<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.210> need<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.630> yarn<00:00:21.869> needle

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
join you're going to need a yarn needle

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.929 
join you're going to need a yarn needle
now<00:00:22.590> there's<00:00:22.800> several<00:00:22.980> different<00:00:23.160> kinds

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
now there's several different kinds

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
now there's several different kinds
these<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.779> probably<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> ones<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.740> see

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
these are probably the ones you see

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
these are probably the ones you see
traditionally<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> plastic<00:00:27.330> one<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
traditionally the plastic one and the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
traditionally the plastic one and the
metal<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.619> sometimes<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.429> sometimes<00:00:29.970> not

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
metal one sometimes then sometimes not

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.600 
metal one sometimes then sometimes not
and<00:00:30.510> then<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> slightly<00:00:31.890> smaller<00:00:32.279> one

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and then this is a slightly smaller one

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.600 
and then this is a slightly smaller one
often<00:00:32.910> called<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.390> tapestry<00:00:33.780> needle<00:00:34.250> now<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
often called a tapestry needle now I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.790 
often called a tapestry needle now I
prefer<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> smaller<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.110> especially

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
prefer to use the smaller one especially

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.459 
prefer to use the smaller one especially
with<00:00:38.309> using<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.000> yarn<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
with using this yarn as you can see the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.950 
with using this yarn as you can see the
yarn<00:00:40.710> isn't<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.879> thick<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:44.960> I've

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
yarn isn't really all that thick so I've

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920 
yarn isn't really all that thick so I've
done<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.680> sample<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> I've<00:00:48.390> done

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
done this sample here and I've done

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.439 
done this sample here and I've done
several<00:00:49.289> Russian<00:00:50.070> joins<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> already

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
several Russian joins in it already

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
several Russian joins in it already
to<00:00:51.690> show<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> finished<00:00:52.949> product

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to show you what the finished product

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
to show you what the finished product
will<00:00:53.489> look<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> them<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> raid<00:00:55.350> down

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
will look like one of them is raid down

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
will look like one of them is raid down
here<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.699> there's<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.390> where<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here then there's the one where the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
here then there's the one where the
color<00:00:58.050> changes<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> there's<00:00:59.730> another

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
color changes are and there's another

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
color changes are and there's another
one<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.260> can't<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
one up here you can't see them from the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.759 
one up here you can't see them from the
front<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.239> there<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> evidence<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.229> joins<00:01:04.500> in

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
front but there is evidence of joins in

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.350 
front but there is evidence of joins in
the<00:01:04.860> back<00:01:05.010> where<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:06.000> frayed

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the back where you see the little frayed

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.440 
the back where you see the little frayed
and<00:01:06.630> some<00:01:06.960> yarn<00:01:07.229> sticking<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:08.090> like<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.210> said

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and some yarn sticking up like I said

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.230 
and some yarn sticking up like I said
really<00:01:10.229> can't<00:01:10.439> tell<00:01:10.650> from<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> front<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.880> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
really can't tell from the front so in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.810 
really can't tell from the front so in
order<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> Russian<00:01:13.229> drop<00:01:13.470> join<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.700> will

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
order to do a Russian drop join you will

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.539 
order to do a Russian drop join you will
take<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.380> end<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.710> your<00:01:16.890> old<00:01:17.100> yarn

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
take at your the end of your old yarn

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.550 
take at your the end of your old yarn
and<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> want<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.360> least<00:01:18.420> four<00:01:18.930> inches<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and you want at least four inches to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960 
and you want at least four inches to
work<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.950> anything<00:01:20.280> less<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.790> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
work with anything less than that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
work with anything less than that
becomes<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> little<00:01:21.689> cumbersome<00:01:22.409> you're<00:01:23.310> going

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
becomes a little cumbersome you're going

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
becomes a little cumbersome you're going
to<00:01:23.549> thread<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> yarn<00:01:24.330> onto<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.170> needle<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to thread the yarn onto your needle and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.030 
to thread the yarn onto your needle and
the<00:01:26.009> easy<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.840> fold<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the easy way to do that is to fold the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.350 
the easy way to do that is to fold the
yarn<00:01:29.070> over<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.780> needle<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.530> pinch<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.360> remove

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
yarn over the needle and pinch it remove

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.539 
yarn over the needle and pinch it remove
the<00:01:33.390> needle<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> numbaz<00:01:35.220> left

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the needle and then with the numbaz left

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789 
the needle and then with the numbaz left
there<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.479> wiggle<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> eye<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> needle

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
there just wiggle the eye of the needle

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.810 
there just wiggle the eye of the needle
onto<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.960> pull<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:39.990> through

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
onto it and pull it through

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.550 
onto it and pull it through
then<00:01:41.820> you're<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.299> turn<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.899> needle<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
then you're going to turn the needle and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.639 
then you're going to turn the needle and
you're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> run<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:47.250> center<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
you're going to run it up the center of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.550 
you're going to run it up the center of
your<00:01:49.649> yarn<00:01:50.450> right<00:01:51.450> through<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.229> twist

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
your yarn right through the twist

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.100 
your yarn right through the twist
sometimes<00:01:55.400> you'll<00:01:55.640> have<00:01:55.790> more<00:01:56.060> than<00:01:56.240> one<00:01:56.510> pile

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
sometimes you'll have more than one pile

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.130 
sometimes you'll have more than one pile
you<00:02:00.110> just<00:02:00.200> want<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.590> get<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.840> yarn

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
you just want to get it so that the yarn

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.930 
you just want to get it so that the yarn
needle<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:04.840> directly<00:02:05.840> into<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.890> center<00:02:07.250> and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
needle is directly into the center and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.059 
needle is directly into the center and
you'll<00:02:08.090> run<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:08.899> for<00:02:09.140> about<00:02:09.259> two

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
you'll run that in there for about two

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.140 
you'll run that in there for about two
inches<00:02:10.959> okay<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.290> as<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:12.770> see<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.970> needle

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
inches okay so as you can see the needle

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.090 
inches okay so as you can see the needle
is<00:02:14.360> completely<00:02:14.870> covered<00:02:15.200> by<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.860> yarn

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
is completely covered by the yarn

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.610 
is completely covered by the yarn
there's<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.940> loop<00:02:17.209> at<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.420> end<00:02:17.540> here<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.410> want

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
there's a loop at the end here we want

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.309 
there's a loop at the end here we want
to<00:02:18.709> keep<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.069> loop<00:02:19.450> while<00:02:20.450> pulling<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.080> yarn

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
to keep that loop while pulling the yarn

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.590 
to keep that loop while pulling the yarn
off<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.130> needle<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.910> I'm<00:02:22.970> going<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.180> pull<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
off the needle so I'm going to pull the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.510 
off the needle so I'm going to pull the
yarn<00:02:23.630> which<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.380> going<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> drag<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.190> end

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
yarn which is going to drag this end

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.770 
yarn which is going to drag this end
down<00:02:25.850> into<00:02:26.480> itself<00:02:27.850> while<00:02:28.850> keeping<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.570> loop

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
down into itself while keeping the loop

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.400 
down into itself while keeping the loop
at<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.110> end<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:32.060> zero<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> network<00:02:32.660> okay

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
at the end to zero the network okay

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.500 
at the end to zero the network okay
that's<00:02:34.310> good<00:02:34.550> we<00:02:34.730> still<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.090> loop<00:02:35.269> there

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
that's good we still have a loop there

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.100 
that's good we still have a loop there
all<00:02:35.900> right<00:02:36.519> then<00:02:37.519> take<00:02:37.790> your<00:02:38.239> new<00:02:38.450> yarn<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
all right then take your new yarn and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.610 
all right then take your new yarn and
again<00:02:39.920> thread<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.390> needle<00:02:44.620> then

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
again thread it on to the needle then

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.390 
again thread it on to the needle then
thread<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.489> new<00:02:47.269> yarn<00:02:47.680> through<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.709> loop<00:02:49.069> of

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
thread the new yarn through the loop of

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.370 
thread the new yarn through the loop of
the<00:02:49.569> old<00:02:50.569> yarn<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.519> again<00:02:56.350> turn<00:02:57.350> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the old yarn like so again turn the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.810 
the old yarn like so again turn the
needle<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.040> thread<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.120> down<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.870> center<00:03:00.230> of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
needle and thread it down the center of

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.479 
needle and thread it down the center of
the<00:03:01.820> new<00:03:01.940> yarn

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.670 

sometimes<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.420> will<00:03:08.540> get<00:03:08.750> off<00:03:09.019> a<00:03:09.049> little<00:03:09.439> bit

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
sometimes it will get off a little bit

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.580 
sometimes it will get off a little bit
and<00:03:10.299> don't<00:03:11.299> quite<00:03:11.659> get<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.989> through<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.290> exact

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
and don't quite get it through the exact

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.020 
and don't quite get it through the exact
center<00:03:12.980> you'll<00:03:13.250> be<00:03:13.370> able<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.609> tell<00:03:13.790> when<00:03:13.939> you

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
center you'll be able to tell when you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.440 
center you'll be able to tell when you
pull<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.390> through<00:03:14.599> when<00:03:15.469> it<00:03:15.560> doesn't<00:03:16.450> that

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
pull it through when it doesn't that

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.819 
pull it through when it doesn't that
looks<00:03:17.659> too<00:03:17.840> long<00:03:20.079> it's<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.200> better<00:03:21.409> looking

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
looks too long it's a better looking

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.380 
looks too long it's a better looking
joint<00:03:22.099> if<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.459> get<00:03:22.609> it<00:03:22.700> right<00:03:22.819> square<00:03:23.150> through

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
joint if you get it right square through

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.020 
joint if you get it right square through
the<00:03:23.450> middle<00:03:23.739> okay<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:24.799> run<00:03:25.159> it<00:03:25.340> stand<00:03:25.819> that

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
the middle okay so run it stand that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.879 
the middle okay so run it stand that
through<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.359> center<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:26.870> again<00:03:27.739> you're

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
through the center and again you're

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.349 
through the center and again you're
going<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.069> pull<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> needle<00:03:28.549> off<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.090> time<00:03:29.329> I

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
going to pull the needle off this time I

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.970 
going to pull the needle off this time I
don't<00:03:29.510> have<00:03:29.689> to<00:03:29.900> be<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:30.200> careful<00:03:30.590> with<00:03:30.769> this

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
don't have to be so careful with this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.009 
don't have to be so careful with this
loop<00:03:31.250> here<00:03:31.519> in<00:03:31.730> fact<00:03:32.299> I'm<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:32.659> going<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.810> let

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
loop here in fact I'm just going to let

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.199 
loop here in fact I'm just going to let
it<00:03:33.049> drag<00:03:33.379> all<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:34.040> way<00:03:34.329> up<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:37.549> end<00:03:37.760> where

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
it drag all the way up to the end where

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.849 
it drag all the way up to the end where
the<00:03:38.510> other<00:03:38.659> loop<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.260> from<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.859> old<00:03:40.010> yarn<00:03:40.340> and

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
the other loop is from the old yarn and

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.490 
the other loop is from the old yarn and
then<00:03:42.859> pull<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.220> neat<00:03:43.340> loss<00:03:44.139> then<00:03:45.139> grab<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
then pull the neat loss then grab the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.599 
then pull the neat loss then grab the
yarn<00:03:45.829> both<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.700> old<00:03:46.939> and<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.329> new<00:03:47.599> and<00:03:48.609> pull

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
yarn both the old and the new and pull

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.440 
yarn both the old and the new and pull
them<00:03:49.790> tight<00:03:51.129> as<00:03:52.129> you<00:03:52.430> can<00:03:52.489> see<00:03:52.790> I'm<00:03:53.060> putting<00:03:53.389> a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
them tight as you can see I'm putting a

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.839 
them tight as you can see I'm putting a
lot<00:03:53.659> of<00:03:53.719> pressure<00:03:54.469> on<00:03:54.919> that<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.430> I'm<00:03:55.609> pulling

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
lot of pressure on that and I'm pulling

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.610 
lot of pressure on that and I'm pulling
and<00:03:56.060> pulling<00:03:56.269> and<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:56.900> not<00:03:57.200> going<00:03:57.439> to<00:03:57.500> come

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
and pulling and it is not going to come

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.670 
and pulling and it is not going to come
apart<00:03:58.150> then<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.359> just<00:03:59.569> knit<00:03:59.810> as<00:04:00.049> normal<00:04:00.469> now

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
apart then you just knit as normal now

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.190 
apart then you just knit as normal now
sometimes<00:04:01.129> there's<00:04:01.400> bigger<00:04:01.730> little<00:04:02.659> ends<00:04:03.079> of

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
sometimes there's bigger little ends of

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.500 
sometimes there's bigger little ends of
yarn<00:04:03.469> sticking<00:04:03.950> up<00:04:04.099> here<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.579> I<00:04:05.090> say<00:04:05.329> just

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
yarn sticking up here and I say just

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.149 
yarn sticking up here and I say just
leave<00:04:05.840> those<00:04:06.139> because<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.650> actually<00:04:06.980> gives

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
leave those because it actually gives

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.429 
leave those because it actually gives
you<00:04:07.250> something<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.700> work<00:04:08.060> with<00:04:08.090> if<00:04:08.569> when

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
you something to work with if when

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.289 
you something to work with if when
you're<00:04:09.530> knitting<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:10.519> happens<00:04:10.969> to<00:04:11.090> fall

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
you're knitting that happens to fall

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.759 
you're knitting that happens to fall
into<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.750> front<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.049> your<00:04:12.169> work<00:04:12.379> you<00:04:12.590> can<00:04:12.739> just

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
into the front of your work you can just

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.219 
into the front of your work you can just
poke<00:04:13.129> it<00:04:13.159> through<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.609> back<00:04:13.819> so<00:04:14.720> I'll<00:04:15.079> go

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
poke it through to the back so I'll go

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.199 
poke it through to the back so I'll go
ahead<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.590> knit<00:04:15.739> that<00:04:15.889> up<00:04:16.130> now<00:04:16.760> first<00:04:17.060> one

back area there so you kind of pull on

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.529 
back area there so you kind of pull on
it<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.710> little<00:04:27.830> bit<00:04:28.039> usually<00:04:28.389> I'll<00:04:29.389> pull<00:04:29.659> it<00:04:29.690> out

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:41.549

so<00:04:42.129> when<00:04:42.279> you<00:04:42.369> knit<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.759> join<00:04:43.089> you<00:04:43.419> want<00:04:43.599> to

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
so when you knit that join you want to

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.429 
so when you knit that join you want to
knit<00:04:43.839> it<00:04:43.959> a<00:04:44.050> little<00:04:44.439> bit<00:04:44.739> closer<00:04:45.779> than<00:04:46.779> you

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
knit it a little bit closer than you

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.100 
knit it a little bit closer than you
might<00:04:47.469> normally<00:04:47.739> knit<00:04:48.669> so<00:04:49.539> that<00:04:49.869> you're

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
might normally knit so that you're

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.209 
might normally knit so that you're
reducing<00:04:50.319> as<00:04:50.919> much<00:04:51.159> of<00:04:51.369> that<00:04:51.489> bulk<00:04:51.819> as<00:04:52.059> you<00:04:52.330> can

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219
