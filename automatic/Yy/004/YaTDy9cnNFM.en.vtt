guess a number between one and five
hundred<00:02:04.790> this<00:02:05.790> must<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.479> done<00:02:06.690> for<00:02:06.930> each<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
hundred this must be done for each of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050 
hundred this must be done for each of
the<00:02:07.440> weapons<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> wish<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> participate<00:02:08.550> with

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the weapons you wish to participate with

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.140 
the weapons you wish to participate with
and<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.050> done<00:02:10.229> twice<00:02:10.619> per<00:02:11.130> weapon<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.940> get

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and can be done twice per weapon you get

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.410 
and can be done twice per weapon you get
two<00:02:12.360> attempts<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.380> if<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:14.160> fails<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.180> might

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
two attempts so if one fails you might

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.660 
two attempts so if one fails you might
have<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.630> second<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> chance<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.950> actually<00:02:17.160> get

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
have a second a chance to actually get

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.580 
have a second a chance to actually get
the<00:02:18.510> code<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.900> yourself<00:02:20.569> then<00:02:21.569> on<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> day<00:02:22.560> of

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the code for yourself then on the day of

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.280 
the code for yourself then on the day of
the<00:02:22.770> drawing<00:02:23.190> I'll<00:02:23.400> draw<00:02:23.720> two<00:02:24.720> codes<00:02:25.530> two

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
the drawing I'll draw two codes two

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.979 
the drawing I'll draw two codes two
numbers<00:02:28.290> between<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.310> five<00:02:29.519> hundred<00:02:29.989> for

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
numbers between one and five hundred for

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.430 
numbers between one and five hundred for
each<00:02:31.170> weapon<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.700> person<00:02:33.300> who<00:02:33.330> gets<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
each weapon and the person who gets the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.860 
each weapon and the person who gets the
closest<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.430> number<00:02:35.790> will<00:02:36.239> receive<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
closest to that number will receive the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.220 
closest to that number will receive the
code<00:02:37.790> now<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.030> hope<00:02:39.239> that's<00:02:39.450> clear<00:02:39.720> enough<00:02:39.780> if

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
code now I hope that's clear enough if

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.830 
code now I hope that's clear enough if
you<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.530> any<00:02:40.830> questions<00:02:41.370> whatsoever<00:02:41.850> then

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
you have any questions whatsoever then

you have any questions whatsoever then
