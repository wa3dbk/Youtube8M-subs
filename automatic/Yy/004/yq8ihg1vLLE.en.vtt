00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you had ten years ago I know it's much

you had ten years ago I know it's much
faster<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.980> anything<00:00:56.610> different<00:00:56.940> with

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
faster but anything different with

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.380 
faster but anything different with
driving<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:57.960> why<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.559> works<00:00:59.390> it's

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
driving it or the way why it works it's

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.240 
driving it or the way why it works it's
so<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.660> faster<00:01:00.809> car<00:01:01.260> though<00:01:01.440> you'll<00:01:02.100> feel

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so much faster car though you'll feel

the difference
and<00:01:04.650> here's<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> car<00:01:05.940> run<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> run

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that's was the fast I think five three

that's was the fast I think five three
eight<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.640> fastest<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> car<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
eight was the fastest the car in and you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.100 
eight was the fastest the car in and you
took<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> nearly<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> tenth<00:01:26.160> quicker<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> are

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
took it nearly a tenth quicker so are

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.410 
took it nearly a tenth quicker so are

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
we're English were quite used to doing

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.980 
we're English were quite used to doing
this<00:02:24.690> hanging<00:02:25.020> around<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.410> wet<00:02:26.990> fantastic

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
this hanging around in the wet fantastic

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.050 
this hanging around in the wet fantastic
run<00:02:28.110> yesterday<00:02:28.319> where<00:02:28.890> did<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.069> come<00:02:29.250> from

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
run yesterday where did that come from

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.890 
run yesterday where did that come from
well<00:02:32.640> now<00:02:33.640> unfortunately<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.510> wasn't<00:02:34.660> there

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
well now unfortunately it wasn't there

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900 
well now unfortunately it wasn't there
from<00:02:35.050> before<00:02:35.230> we<00:02:35.590> had<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.830> work<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> since

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
from before we had to work on it since

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.840 
from before we had to work on it since
the<00:02:37.030> last<00:02:37.060> meeting<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:39.069> two<00:02:39.250> runs<00:02:39.490> we<00:02:39.700> did

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
the last meeting the two runs we did

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.400 
the last meeting the two runs we did
that<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.209> main<00:02:41.200> event<00:02:43.230> damaged<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.319> engine

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
that the main event damaged the engine

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.410 
that the main event damaged the engine
both<00:02:44.770> times<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.580> we<00:02:45.670> had<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.940> work<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.240> power

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
both times so we had to work the power

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.020 
both times so we had to work the power
from<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.720> different<00:02:47.050> angle<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.670> try<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.880> work

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
from a different angle and try and work

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.760 
from a different angle and try and work
it<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.480> obviously<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.020> not<00:02:50.080> fly<00:02:50.380> enough<00:02:50.620> at

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
it so obviously it's not fly enough at

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.430 
it so obviously it's not fly enough at
the<00:02:50.830> top<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:52.360> seemed<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:52.780> working<00:02:53.020> pretty

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
the top it seemed to be working pretty

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.580 
the top it seemed to be working pretty
good<00:02:54.180> without<00:02:55.180> without<00:02:55.630> telling<00:02:55.959> me<00:02:56.050> too<00:02:56.260> much

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
good without without telling me too much

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.640 
good without without telling me too much
how<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.610> does<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.090> actually<00:02:58.360> happen<00:02:58.660> the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
how is does that actually happen the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.130 
how is does that actually happen the
what<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.610> goes<00:03:00.819> wrong<00:03:01.239> in<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.780> engine

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
what is it that goes wrong in the engine

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.280 
what is it that goes wrong in the engine
to<00:03:02.319> make<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.680> go<00:03:03.010> bang<00:03:04.080> basically<00:03:05.080> we<00:03:05.200> were

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
to make it go bang basically we were

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.960 
to make it go bang basically we were
pushing<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.739> hard<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.250> we<00:03:06.459> pushed<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.790> too

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
pushing it hard and we pushed it too

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.710 
pushing it hard and we pushed it too
hard<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:08.530> became<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.370> quickest<00:03:10.239> car<00:03:10.480> in

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
hard and we became the quickest car in

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.580 
hard and we became the quickest car in
Europe<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.890> cost<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.420> burned<00:03:13.630> up<00:03:13.810> our<00:03:14.019> spare

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
Europe a cost and it burned up our spare

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.090 
Europe a cost and it burned up our spare
cylinder<00:03:15.040> heads<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.880> block<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.830> when<00:03:17.980> we

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
cylinder heads and a block so when we

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.920 
cylinder heads and a block so when we
started<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.519> event<00:03:18.880> obviously<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:19.780> still

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
started this event obviously we still

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.809 
started this event obviously we still
wanted<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.350> run<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.920> numbers<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:21.580> we<00:03:21.700> just

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
wanted to run the numbers but we just

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.110 
wanted to run the numbers but we just
had<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.060> work<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.510> power<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.810> different<00:03:23.170> way

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
had to work the power a different way

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.360 
had to work the power a different way
unfortunately<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.600> worked<00:03:25.840> really<00:03:25.989> good

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
unfortunately it's worked really good

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.920 
unfortunately it's worked really good
when<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.489> 5:29<00:03:28.150> came<00:03:28.390> up<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.720> board

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
when that 5:29 came up on the board

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.150 
when that 5:29 came up on the board
again<00:03:29.140> yesterday<00:03:29.319> were<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.800> is<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.010> what

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
again yesterday were you is that what

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.479 
again yesterday were you is that what
you're<00:03:30.310> expecting<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:31.060> course<00:03:32.069> yeah<00:03:33.069> stupid

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
you're expecting of course yeah stupid

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.390 
you're expecting of course yeah stupid
question<00:03:33.940> yeah<00:03:34.090> no<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.840> thought<00:03:35.470> maybe<00:03:35.530> first

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
question yeah no I thought maybe first

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.789 
question yeah no I thought maybe first
run<00:03:36.670> with<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.390> know<00:03:37.540> since<00:03:37.989> since<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.680> had

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
run with you know since since you had

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.050 
run with you know since since you had
the<00:03:38.920> problem<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.400> might<00:03:39.519> take<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.940> little

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
the problem you might take it a little

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.770 
the problem you might take it a little
bit<00:03:40.299> easier<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:43.049> worked<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:45.239> safer<00:03:46.239> in<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.510> area

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
bit easier I worked it safer in the area

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.530 
bit easier I worked it safer in the area
where<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.049> blew<00:03:47.200> up<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:48.430> obviously<00:03:49.269> had<00:03:49.510> my

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
where it blew up and obviously had my

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.750 
where it blew up and obviously had my
fingers<00:03:49.989> crossed<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.350> certain<00:03:50.650> extent<00:03:50.980> and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
fingers crossed to a certain extent and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.069 
fingers crossed to a certain extent and
where<00:03:52.030> we<00:03:52.180> managed<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.480> make<00:03:52.750> up<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.049> extra

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
where we managed to make up the extra

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.170 
where we managed to make up the extra
power<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.130> seems<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.610> work<00:03:54.640> really<00:03:54.760> good

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
power it just seems to work really good

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.479 
power it just seems to work really good
with<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.480> track<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.079> I<00:03:56.440> mean<00:03:57.010> that's<00:03:57.340> also

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
with this track so I mean that's also
