don't want them to run through it run in

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.899 
don't want them to run through it run in
the<00:02:12.390> house<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.950> been<00:02:14.129> melting<00:02:14.579> across

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
the house so as it's been melting across

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.399 
the house so as it's been melting across
the<00:02:15.120> yard<00:02:15.360> I've<00:02:15.720> been<00:02:15.840> coming<00:02:16.079> out<00:02:16.170> every<00:02:16.379> day

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
the yard I've been coming out every day

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.649

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
and picking it up it also makes it a lot

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.449 
and picking it up it also makes it a lot
easier<00:02:18.720> than<00:02:19.379> having<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.739> pick<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.099> all<00:02:20.310> at

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
easier than having to pick it up all at

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.620 
easier than having to pick it up all at
one<00:02:20.610> time
