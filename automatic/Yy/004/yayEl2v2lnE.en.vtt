here's a comparison shot of how much

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.110 
here's a comparison shot of how much
difference<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.799> slim<00:02:23.070> tower<00:02:23.280> makes<00:02:23.640> compared

to the old dimension e510 from oh I

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.300 
to the old dimension e510 from oh I
believe<00:02:28.650> 2005<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:29.880> one<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:31.320> as<00:02:32.010> far<00:02:32.190> as

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
believe 2005 that one is and as far as

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.520 
believe 2005 that one is and as far as
performance<00:02:32.489> goes<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.630> pretty<00:02:33.989> damn<00:02:34.230> good

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
performance goes it's pretty damn good

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.539 
performance goes it's pretty damn good
honestly<00:02:35.810> I've<00:02:36.810> heard<00:02:37.079> that<00:02:37.260> these<00:02:37.500> 2nd<00:02:38.310> gen

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
honestly I've heard that these 2nd gen

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.569 
honestly I've heard that these 2nd gen
i5<00:02:38.959> processors<00:02:39.959> which<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.950> faster

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
i5 processors which this is is faster

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.410 
i5 processors which this is is faster
than<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.030> original<00:02:42.989> i7s<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.400> here<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.269> can

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
than the original i7s and here you can

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.190 
than the original i7s and here you can
see<00:02:46.010> there's<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.070> thing<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.430> Windows<00:02:47.880> 7<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.660> mean

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
see there's a thing on Windows 7 I mean

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.930 
see there's a thing on Windows 7 I mean
I<00:02:49.230> don't<00:02:49.320> know<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.829> it's<00:02:49.950> new<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.220> Windows<00:02:50.549> 7

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
I don't know that it's new to Windows 7

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.380 
I don't know that it's new to Windows 7
i've<00:02:51.060> only<00:02:51.269> ever<00:02:51.390> had<00:02:51.930> XP<00:02:52.650> prior<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.390> but

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
i've only ever had XP prior to this but

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.590 
i've only ever had XP prior to this but
it's<00:02:54.680> cheese<00:02:55.680> alee<00:02:56.040> named<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.790> windows

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.130 
that is the things that matter more to
me<00:03:37.799> are<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> processor<00:03:39.120> speed<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
me are the processor speed and the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.860 
me are the processor speed and the
memory<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.890> they<00:03:41.760> both<00:03:41.879> scored<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.420> seven

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
memory and they both scored a seven

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.050 
memory and they both scored a seven
point<00:03:43.170> four<00:03:43.620> out<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.010> seven<00:03:44.700> point<00:03:44.970> nine

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
point four out of seven point nine

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.289 
point four out of seven point nine
that's<00:03:46.049> pretty<00:03:46.260> damn<00:03:46.530> good<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:47.790> being<00:03:48.030> said

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
remember what the power supply unit

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.740 
remember what the power supply unit
wattage<00:04:01.859> is<00:04:02.040> but<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.459> know<00:04:02.609> it's<00:04:03.030> not<00:04:03.389> all<00:04:03.629> that

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
get yourself a big beefy card you might

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.129 
get yourself a big beefy card you might
also<00:04:08.250> want<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.609> be<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.299> know<00:04:09.389> upgrading<00:04:10.109> your

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
ram slots in this current setup it came

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.879 
ram slots in this current setup it came
with<00:05:05.039> six<00:05:05.400> gigs<00:05:05.699> ram<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.050> got<00:05:07.199> a<00:05:07.229> four<00:05:07.500> gig<00:05:07.710> at

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
with six gigs ram so I got a four gig at

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.029
