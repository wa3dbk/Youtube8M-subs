00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
running out of space this computer we

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.759 
running out of space this computer we
built<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.870> last<00:00:07.080> year<00:00:08.059> we<00:00:09.059> put<00:00:09.300> on<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.769> solid

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
built it last year we put on a solid

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.950 
built it last year we put on a solid
state<00:00:10.950> hard<00:00:10.980> drive<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.940> 120<00:00:12.509> gigabytes

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
state hard drive with 120 gigabytes

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.419 
state hard drive with 120 gigabytes
that's<00:00:13.290> pretty<00:00:13.679> much<00:00:13.860> full

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
that's pretty much full

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.700 
that's pretty much full
that's<00:00:15.360> what<00:00:15.540> used<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> run<00:00:16.049> everything<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
that's what used to run everything and

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.640 
that's what used to run everything and
he<00:00:17.520> has<00:00:17.609> another<00:00:17.880> internal<00:00:18.480> hard<00:00:18.660> drive<00:00:18.930> which

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
he has another internal hard drive which

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.570 
he has another internal hard drive which
is<00:00:19.680> also<00:00:20.010> 120<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.590> that's<00:00:22.590> almost<00:00:23.130> full<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
is also 120 and that's almost full and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.060 
is also 120 and that's almost full and
then<00:00:23.880> he<00:00:23.970> has<00:00:24.119> internal<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.869> external<00:00:25.070> Maxtor

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
then he has internal and external Maxtor

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.779 
then he has internal and external Maxtor
with<00:00:26.340> 500<00:00:26.970> that's<00:00:27.779> also<00:00:28.199> full<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> he's

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
with 500 that's also full so he's

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.659 
with 500 that's also full so he's
calling<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.289> space

slipping<00:01:48.800> but<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.380> work<00:01:52.680> yourself<00:01:52.890> around<00:01:53.550> it

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.310 

is<00:01:58.650> there<00:01:58.980> you<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.220> click<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.320> very

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is there you like click as it's very

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.960 
is there you like click as it's very
thin<00:02:01.590> plastic<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.990> there<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.470> go

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
thin plastic and like that there you go

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.850 
thin plastic and like that there you go
I<00:02:14.480> think<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.660> opens<00:02:16.290> up<00:02:17.570> like<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> car<00:02:18.990> hood<00:02:19.680> or

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
I think this opens up like a car hood or

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.200 
I think this opens up like a car hood or
trunk<00:02:21.320> there<00:02:22.320> we<00:02:22.470> go<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.090> what

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
trunk there we go and then this is what

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.090 
trunk there we go and then this is what
you<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.480> your<00:02:24.870> hard<00:02:25.050> drives<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.590> since<00:02:25.860> I'd

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you have your hard drives and since I'd

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.150 
you have your hard drives and since I'd
this<00:02:26.370> casing<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:28.410> should<00:02:28.650> come<00:02:28.770> out<00:02:28.920> easily

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
this casing this should come out easily

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.350 
this casing this should come out easily
there<00:02:29.790> should<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.060> no<00:02:30.210> screws<00:02:30.510> holding<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:35.360> you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
there should be no screws holding it you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540 
there should be no screws holding it you
turn<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.780> way<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.170> guys<00:02:37.320> can<00:02:37.530> see<00:02:37.710> try<00:02:38.490> to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
turn this way so you guys can see try to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.720 
turn this way so you guys can see try to
