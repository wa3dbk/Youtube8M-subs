00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.649
 today we will decorate a hat 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.649
 double crochet 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.950
 for example, we connect such horizontal 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 strips of cones 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.949
 here we have such a hat here already 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.199
 knit 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.050
 one horizontal strip of cones 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.130
 Now I will show how to knit the same but 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.800
 another place 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 make the initial loop so convenient 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.410
 will attach the thread 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.989
 grab and and drag and 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.510
 knit 1 air loop then 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.550
 remove the diaper thread 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.829
 for the first cone one air 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.280
 the rise is enough to dial 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.729
 and knitting under this double crochet 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.430
 which we fastened 5 and finished 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.940
 double crochet 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.380
 the second column we will make a cape 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.560
 grab the thread tying two loops 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.020
 on hook 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:10.000
 apple 4 unfinished double crochet 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.000
 and 5 unfinished double crochet 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 then we knit all the strings on the hook 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.560
 from us the basis for the first bump 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.409
 fastened through 1 column 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.170
 from the place of the previous fastening cones 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.780
 here is the first column we are under the second column 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.020
 grab the thread and drag it all 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.869
 attached for the second bump for 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 each subsequent recruit 2 air 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.040
 lifting and knitting 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.689
 under the bar that we have the flu 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:52.640
 5 unfinished double crochets 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.640
 the second column knit not finished 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 3 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.280
 we cap a thread 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.369
 only two loops on the hook 4 and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.369
 and you 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.190
 here is the basis for the second bump 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.739
 we knit all the loops on the hook 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.200
 strengthen again through 1 column from the place 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.050
 previous thread attachment 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.830
 such cones can be decorated for example 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.420
 hat for boy 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.050
 when we knit a simple hat for 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.090
 girls we knit the base and decorate 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.640
 flowers or bows 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.770
 and for a boy 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.230
 you can for example such a horizontal 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.240
 a pinch of cones say no 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 necessarily even such a contrasting thread 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.770
 women's hat 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.360
 can 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.380
 one can steal such stripes 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.010
 You can make a bump 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.010
 less often 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.100
 learning to knit such bumps you then 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.220
 you can turn on your imagination 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.810
 and come up with how you decorate a simple 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.440
 knitted hat 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.660
 here is glue there 2 to 3 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.680
 Bump for the next I type 2 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.640
 air lift and so on for example 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.690
 we can get from a simple hat 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.319
 stocking 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.140
 such a hat 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.150
 how to knit the base for such a hat i 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.560
