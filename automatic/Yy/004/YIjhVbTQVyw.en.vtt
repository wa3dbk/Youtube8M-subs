 all tablet product series 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.980
 focused on android we expected 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.920
 something windows actually nothing is 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.289
 arrived but we have four major 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.029
 always produce that tablet segment 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.349
 android memo pad 10 full hd and hd sorry 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 is one of the innovations presented here is done 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.090
 we have already seen in the blog 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 we see a series of videos now in 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.559
 hand for the first time officially a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.039
 tablet that offers a 10.1 display 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.680
 inch hd 1280 x 800 pixels ips 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.760
 possibility of having a c more then 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 quad core to continue processor is a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
 gigabytes of ram memory inside the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.550
 device we find the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.250
 car customization if slightly 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.119
 magazine compared to previous models 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.500
 so even more software a few 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.640
 extra option regarding 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.280
 some lancer organization 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.190
 option to go and hide a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.800
 series of icons and then the programs e 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.210
 slightly modified and renewed icons 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.479
 as for the applications 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.200
 owners of asus a product that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.000
 offers good display visibility 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.460
 especially also the viewing angle 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.640
 at a product of the same category 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.890
 average and good in both inscape and import 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.350
 reit obviously we can rose and between 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.450
 interface without any problem is not 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.369
 very reactive as we have seen 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.890
 we are talking about products anyway 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.100
 considered not completely definitive 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.649
 it's a device 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.979
 obviously with the possibility of having both 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.770
 wifi that 3g connectivity inside 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.009
 of the lower bar we also find the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.679
 floating applications then those that 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.800
 you can go to position 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.470
 inside the interface above the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.600
 other apps we see how many programs 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.410
 this year we have arrived at three 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.950
 with the April spot for example 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.560
 other applications 4 so a good one 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.890
 app quantity management 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 present 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.319
 within this mode with the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.970
 possibility then to select others 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.580
 widget inside the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.940
 of this option of this interface 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.290
 of inserting floating widgets as 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.540
 see here for example we put in 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.740
 calendar that perfectly 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.050
 previously it wasn't there and now 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.930
 we have included virtually all 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.030
 widgets that are present inside 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.240
 of the interface or better the greater 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.690
 part can then also be inserted 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.760
 within this interface 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.130
 floating screen test 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.950
 obviously they can then be added 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.150
 also classic mode of talent 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.750
 asus we have ten comes to market 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.110
 with this shocking pink coloring 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.150
 so a very bright pink cases 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.730
 stereo backs that stand out here 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.220
 very good but obviously nicer 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.630
 dark version for a male audience 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.970
 with rear camera and we find 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:37.310
 all the features or android 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.739
 4.2 jelly beans the lara but as mentioned a 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.190
 gigabytes we have storage in version 8 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.670
 16 gigabytes plus expandable memory 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.430
 obviously the weight is 522 g 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.970
 front camera is a mega pixel and 2 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.950
 while the back one is 2 megapixels 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.260
 with 720p video situations then 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.060
 nothing exaggerated but inside the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.180
 system options we can go to 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.880
 see how asus has customized the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.030
 notification bar that does not allow 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.150
 a double function with two fingers or a 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.100
 face or swipe from one side to the other but 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.950
 we have a single interface that can then 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.940
 be modified with the various togos for the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.860
 fast management of settings e 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.810
 the various options for entering the various 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.760
 of the various quick access functions a 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.920
 pau tablet with 2.2 kernel 3.0 point 36 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.860
 a quick overview we will return to 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.750
 this obviously in the coming days a 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.910
 only voter of hdblog from 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.910
