size<00:00:17.279> tank<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.730> good<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> shrimp<00:00:18.420> tank<00:00:18.600> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
size tank is good for a shrimp tank and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.130 
size tank is good for a shrimp tank and
so<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.949> first<00:00:20.880> off<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> start<00:00:21.990> by

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
gallon and most people gonna say you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
gallon and most people gonna say you
know<00:00:42.930> what's<00:00:43.140> wrong<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> six<00:00:43.739> counting

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
know what's wrong with the six counting

what's<00:00:44.219> wrong<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> 10<00:00:44.820> gallon<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:46.379> know

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
what's wrong with the 10 gallon you know

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.250 
what's wrong with the 10 gallon you know
those<00:00:46.680> things<00:00:46.920> work<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.360> again<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
those things work but then again if you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
those things work but then again if you
know<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> made<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.010> mistake<00:00:50.160> it's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
going to be detrimental and so if you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260 
going to be detrimental and so if you
have<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> 20<00:00:53.250> gallon<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.670> gives<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
keeping and so on so I have two 20

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
keeping and so on so I have two 20
gallons<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.070> carbon<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.000> tank<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
gallons and this carbon really tank that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.820 
gallons and this carbon really tank that
you're<00:01:06.450> looking<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:06.990> 20<00:01:07.500> gallon

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you're looking at is actually 20 gallon

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.469 
you're looking at is actually 20 gallon
this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.390> smallest<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.200> would<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
this is the very smallest I would go and

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
this is the very smallest I would go and
you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.380> safe<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.340> about

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you know it's just a very safe way about

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
you know it's just a very safe way about
going<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.659> got<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> 40<00:01:16.439> gallon

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
going and I actually got to 40 gallon

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
going and I actually got to 40 gallon
breeders<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> I'm<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.850> using<00:01:18.119> for

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
breeders that I'm going to be using for

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.330 
breeders that I'm going to be using for
shrimp<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.659> that's<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.960> very<00:01:19.470> good<00:01:19.710> size<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
shrimp and that's a very good size and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.510 
shrimp and that's a very good size and
so<00:01:20.970> again<00:01:21.630> 20<00:01:22.259> gallons<00:01:22.740> definitely<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so again 20 gallons definitely the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.920 
so again 20 gallons definitely the
smallest<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.970> would<00:01:24.119> ever<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.689> shrimp

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
smallest I would ever go with shrimp

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
smallest I would ever go with shrimp
keeping<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> next<00:01:26.729> thing<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.330> kind<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
keeping so the next thing what kind of

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.100 
keeping so the next thing what kind of
filtration<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.619> good<00:01:29.720> one<00:01:30.720> thing<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
filtration is good one thing that I

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.890 
filtration is good one thing that I
always<00:01:31.290> recommend<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.600> two

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
always recommend is that you need two

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.620 
always recommend is that you need two
types<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> filtration<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:35.820> very

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
types of filtration it's it's very very

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.800 
types of filtration it's it's very very
smart<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.710> always<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> backup<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.659> so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
smart to always have a backup and so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
smart to always have a backup and so
what<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.439> use<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> sponge<00:01:41.100> filter<00:01:41.280> just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
what I do is I use a sponge filter just

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.830 
what I do is I use a sponge filter just
simply<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> most<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:44.610> know

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
simply because it's the most you know

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.010 
simply because it's the most you know
cost-effective<00:01:46.460> beneficial<00:01:47.460> thing<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.020> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
cost-effective beneficial thing and you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.149 
cost-effective beneficial thing and you
know<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.200> actually<00:01:49.320> gives<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> shrimp

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
know it actually gives the shrimp

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.649 
know it actually gives the shrimp
something<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> little

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
something that you know the little

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.300 
something that you know the little
shrimp<00:01:51.840> let's<00:01:52.140> when<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.439> come<00:01:52.619> out<00:01:52.649> they

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
shrimp let's when they come out they

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.620 
shrimp let's when they come out they
have<00:01:53.430> somewhere<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> feed<00:01:54.479> on

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
have somewhere you know to feed on

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.850 
have somewhere you know to feed on
because<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> lot<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
because it's going to have a lot of the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.539 
because it's going to have a lot of the
microorganisms<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.869> eat<00:01:58.079> so

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
microorganisms that they they eat so

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.730 
microorganisms that they they eat so
definitely<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> sponge<00:01:59.850> filter<00:02:00.149> number<00:02:00.329> one

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
definitely a sponge filter number one

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
definitely a sponge filter number one
under<00:02:01.740> gravel<00:02:02.070> filters<00:02:02.460> they're<00:02:03.420> definitely

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
under gravel filters they're definitely

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.010 
under gravel filters they're definitely
very<00:02:04.219> very<00:02:05.219> very<00:02:05.820> good<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.479> shrimp<00:02:06.689> keeping

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
very very very good for shrimp keeping

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
very very very good for shrimp keeping
and<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.950> you're<00:02:08.129> able<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.550> give<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and so if you're able to give you the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.029 
and so if you're able to give you the
right<00:02:09.179> rock<00:02:09.450> size<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.470> substrate

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
right rock size the right substrate

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.840 
right rock size the right substrate
under<00:02:11.970> gravel<00:02:12.300> filter

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
under gravel filter

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.970 
under gravel filter
sponge<00:02:13.090> filter<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.660> by<00:02:13.840> far<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> very<00:02:14.620> effective

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
sponge filter is by far a very effective

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.120 
sponge filter is by far a very effective
way<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.490> um<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.930> know<00:02:17.020> what<00:02:17.140> my<00:02:17.380> personal

with<00:02:22.540> filtration<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.130> I'm<00:02:24.400> something

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
with filtration and so I'm something

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.180 
with filtration and so I'm something
that's<00:02:25.000> worked<00:02:25.240> for<00:02:25.330> me<00:02:25.570> very<00:02:25.840> well<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.980> do<00:02:27.040> a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
that's worked for me very well is I do a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.790 
that's worked for me very well is I do a
sponge<00:02:27.550> filter<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.120> then<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:29.260> canister

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
sponge filter and then I do a canister

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.980 
sponge filter and then I do a canister
filter<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.280> most<00:02:30.430> people<00:02:30.730> say<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:30.970> know<00:02:31.180> well

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
filter and most people say you know well

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.780 
filter and most people say you know well
the<00:02:32.560> shrimp<00:02:32.800> get<00:02:32.950> sucked<00:02:33.190> up<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.550> canister

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the shrimp get sucked up in the canister

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.180 
the shrimp get sucked up in the canister
filter<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:35.080> true<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.710> know<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.890> will

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
filter and that's true you know you will

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.950 
filter and that's true you know you will
have<00:02:36.370> some<00:02:36.610> get<00:02:36.760> sucked<00:02:37.000> up<00:02:37.180> into<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.840> you

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
have some get sucked up into it and you

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.560 
have some get sucked up into it and you
can<00:02:37.990> buy<00:02:38.290> screens<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:39.010> protect<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.670> but<00:02:40.390> I'm

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
can buy screens that protect it but I'm

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.380 
can buy screens that protect it but I'm
something<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.110> found<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> very<00:02:42.670> effective<00:02:43.000> is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
um I actually buy bulk sponge and then I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.840 
um I actually buy bulk sponge and then I
put<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.380> over<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.220> tank<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.730> I'll

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.980 
here I actually have um you know just a
regular<00:02:59.470> sponge<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:00.610> cut<00:03:00.820> up<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.570> got

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
regular sponge that I cut up and I got

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.440 
regular sponge that I cut up and I got
it<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.230> perfect<00:03:02.620> width<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.270> know<00:03:04.390> you

it the perfect width and I you know you
can<00:03:04.690> see<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.930> shrimp<00:03:05.050> are<00:03:05.290> actually<00:03:05.560> feed<00:03:05.740> on

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
can see the shrimp are actually feed on

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.390 
can see the shrimp are actually feed on
it<00:03:06.040> right<00:03:06.190> now

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400

and so on so this is probably my

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.580 
and so on so this is probably my
favorite<00:03:09.700> way<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.330> go<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.750> then<00:03:11.350> definitely

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
favorite way to go and then definitely

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.100 
favorite way to go and then definitely
the<00:03:11.890> sponge<00:03:12.130> filter<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.660> buy<00:03:13.810> bulk

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
the sponge filter and so I just buy bulk

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.200 
the sponge filter and so I just buy bulk
sponge<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.860> guys<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.520> online<00:03:15.730> I

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
sponge you guys can get this online I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.010 
sponge you guys can get this online I
think<00:03:17.080> it's<00:03:17.200> two<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.770> a<00:03:17.920> half<00:03:18.100> inches<00:03:18.520> thick

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
think it's two and a half inches thick

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.230 
think it's two and a half inches thick
so<00:03:20.020> it's<00:03:20.140> pretty<00:03:20.350> thick<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.820> comes<00:03:22.060> in<00:03:22.180> a

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
so it's pretty thick and it comes in a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.000 
so it's pretty thick and it comes in a
huge<00:03:22.270> piece<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.500> don't<00:03:23.620> even<00:03:23.800> know

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
huge piece this is I don't even know

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.440 
huge piece this is I don't even know
this<00:03:24.130> probably<00:03:24.490> 20<00:03:24.730> bucks<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.210> kind<00:03:25.360> of

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
this probably 20 bucks so it's kind of

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.270 
this probably 20 bucks so it's kind of
expensive<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.110> then<00:03:26.710> again<00:03:26.800> it's<00:03:27.070> really

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
expensive but then again it's really

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.910 
expensive but then again it's really
worth<00:03:27.490> it<00:03:27.790> um<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.330> take<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.750> out<00:03:28.840> clean<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.230> once

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
worth it um I take it out clean it once

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.670 
worth it um I take it out clean it once
a<00:03:30.100> month<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.660> then<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.260> kind<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.500> adds

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
a month and and then it kind of adds

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.290 
a month and and then it kind of adds
another<00:03:32.920> sponge<00:03:33.280> filter<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.820> your<00:03:33.940> tank<00:03:34.120> and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
another sponge filter to your tank and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.180 
another sponge filter to your tank and
then<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.380> can<00:03:35.500> see<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.650> do<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.950> sponge

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
then as you can see I do the sponge

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.590 
then as you can see I do the sponge
filter<00:03:36.520> as<00:03:36.610> well<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.060> actually<00:03:37.210> have<00:03:37.480> the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
filter as well so I actually have the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.370 
filter as well so I actually have the
Marineland<00:03:38.730> for<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.850> forty<00:03:40.240> ounce<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.810> then

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
Marineland for the forty ounce and then

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.920 
Marineland for the forty ounce and then
I<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> sponge<00:03:41.920> filter<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:43.720> just

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
I have a sponge filter so that just

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.750 
I have a sponge filter so that just
gives<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.200> guys<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.350> real<00:03:44.590> good<00:03:44.800> idea<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.430> I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
gives you guys a real good idea and I

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.730 
gives you guys a real good idea and I
would<00:03:45.940> always<00:03:46.120> again<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.870> would<00:03:47.140> always<00:03:47.290> do<00:03:47.530> two

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
would always again I would always do two

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.260 
would always again I would always do two
types<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.160> filtration<00:03:48.460> with<00:03:48.820> shrimp<00:03:49.090> it's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
types of filtration with shrimp it's

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.970 
types of filtration with shrimp it's
just<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.630> smart<00:03:49.990> way<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.200> go<00:03:50.380> about<00:03:50.590> it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
just a smart way to go about it

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.220 
just a smart way to go about it
and<00:03:51.160> um<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:52.120> know<00:03:52.210> it's<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.360> very<00:03:52.570> safe<00:03:52.960> way<00:03:53.200> to

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
and um you know it's a very safe way to

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.990 
and um you know it's a very safe way to
do<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.740> so<00:03:53.920> in<00:03:54.280> my<00:03:54.430> next<00:03:54.460> video<00:03:54.910> I'm

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
do it and so in my next video I'm

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.920 
do it and so in my next video I'm
actually<00:03:55.120> going<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.390> talk<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.780> guys<00:03:55.870> a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
actually going to talk to you guys a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.080 
actually going to talk to you guys a
little<00:03:56.170> bit<00:03:56.290> more<00:03:56.410> about<00:03:57.190> them<00:03:57.520> what<00:03:57.850> kind<00:03:58.030> of

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
little bit more about them what kind of

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.420 
little bit more about them what kind of
substrate<00:03:58.420> should<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.780> get<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.170> then<00:03:59.890> we'll

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
substrate should you get and then we'll

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.190 
substrate should you get and then we'll
dive<00:04:00.610> back<00:04:00.910> more<00:04:01.180> into<00:04:01.360> water<00:04:01.570> chemistry<00:04:01.960> and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
dive back more into water chemistry and

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.280 
dive back more into water chemistry and
understanding<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.220> know<00:04:03.310> TDS<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.180> uh<00:04:04.290> you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
understanding you know TDS and uh you

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.630 
understanding you know TDS and uh you
know<00:04:05.380> how<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.560> do<00:04:05.740> water<00:04:05.950> change<00:04:06.250> things<00:04:06.460> like

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
know how to do water change things like

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.580
