00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 category in which we think he was 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.590

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.420

 recognitions from the first year of 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 if we had delivered it last year 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.570
 I would have taken him also you've already 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.620

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.750

 they have been there for a long time 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.620
 what would be the next step to give 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.620
 law of tombs for 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.100
 you were talking about going to Mexico these last 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.770
 two years you stayed as a finalist of 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.240
 who looks for the crown that 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.530
 good interest for different 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.960
 circumstances you have not been able to attend 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.000
 the final in Monterrey the people that you 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.400
 we know how to fight if we consider that 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.180
 going all the final they have many 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.180
 chances of winning 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.780
 if it exists within your plans by 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.819
 example in the nationalization of goya in 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.350
 monterrey you may have achieved everything 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.700
 what can be achieved, I say, I'll stay for 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.800
 there pending for the situation of the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.600
 pearl injury maybe a mask that 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.069
 it was the rivalry that you had but 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.450
 the monterrey already achieved the championships 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.770
 that could be saved from the company 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.020
 regiomontana wrestling that is 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.760
 let's say exposes a bit for what was the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.530
 champion but everything else already 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.690
 did you do the next step will be the 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.000
 nationalization can be said is 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.560
 among other upcoming plans 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.489
 you see it in the long term you see it in short 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.590
 term 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.530
 is where I want to say if you are looking for 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.819
