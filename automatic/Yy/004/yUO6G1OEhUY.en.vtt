so right now I'm working on placing all
the<00:00:14.250> electrical<00:00:14.820> components

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.710 

and<00:00:17.970> trying<00:00:18.970> to<00:00:19.090> keep<00:00:19.180> things<00:00:19.710> organized<00:00:20.710> by

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and trying to keep things organized by

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380 
and trying to keep things organized by
supper<00:00:22.720> so<00:00:23.620> communication<00:00:24.310> things<00:00:24.910> are<00:00:25.270> in

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
supper so communication things are in

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.440 
supper so communication things are in
one<00:00:25.570> spot<00:00:26.010> power<00:00:27.010> stuff<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.670> in<00:00:27.820> another<00:00:28.090> spot

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
one spot power stuff is in another spot

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.580 
one spot power stuff is in another spot
heavy<00:00:29.369> things<00:00:30.369> are<00:00:30.640> in<00:00:30.730> another<00:00:30.940> statement

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
heavy things are in another statement

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.470 
heavy things are in another statement
and<00:00:32.590> I'm<00:00:32.770> trying<00:00:33.040> to<00:00:33.070> keep<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.370> center<00:00:33.670> opened

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
and I'm trying to keep the center opened

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.870 
and I'm trying to keep the center opened
up<00:00:34.600> because<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.950> main<00:00:36.100> mechanism<00:00:36.670> we're

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
up because the main mechanism we're

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.850 
up because the main mechanism we're
going<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.059> use<00:00:37.270> needs<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.140> lot<00:00:38.290> of<00:00:38.320> space<00:00:38.500> in<00:00:38.800> the

drilled<00:00:53.350> into<00:00:53.530> already<00:00:54.040> for<00:00:54.280> us<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:54.670> when<00:00:54.820> we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
drilled into already for us so when we

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.270 
drilled into already for us so when we
go<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.120> put<00:00:55.360> our<00:00:55.510> electronic<00:00:56.079> devices<00:00:56.170> on<00:00:56.710> we

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
go to put our electronic devices on we

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.670 
go to put our electronic devices on we
can<00:00:57.430> just<00:00:57.610> as<00:00:57.700> uptime<00:00:58.060> down<00:00:58.390> after<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.320> finding

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
can just as uptime down after a finding

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.030 
can just as uptime down after a finding
a<00:00:59.770> place<00:00:59.980> for<00:01:00.220> it<00:01:01.000> also<00:01:01.090> helps<00:01:01.600> with<00:01:02.040> water

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
a place for it also helps with water

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.790 
a place for it also helps with water
management<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:04.180> laying<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.290> cables<00:01:05.649> out

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
management so laying the cables out

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.980 
management so laying the cables out
nicely<00:01:06.420> making<00:01:07.420> sure<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:07.720> have<00:01:07.840> good

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
nicely making sure you have good

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
nicely making sure you have good
90-degree<00:01:08.649> angles<00:01:09.250> where<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.610> show<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.880> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
90-degree angles where you show that and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.150 
90-degree angles where you show that and
helps<00:01:12.580> with<00:01:12.790> keeping<00:01:13.180> things<00:01:13.540> secure<00:01:14.160> another

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
helps with keeping things secure another

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.010 
helps with keeping things secure another
thing<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.850> we're<00:01:16.060> using<00:01:16.410> all<00:01:17.410> FRC<00:01:18.160> legal

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
thing is that we're using all FRC legal

is in our robot is legal to use on your
guts<00:01:27.159> it's<00:01:27.340> real<00:01:27.870> one<00:01:28.870> thing<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.200> wanted<00:01:29.710> to

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
guts it's real one thing I wanted to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.580 
guts it's real one thing I wanted to
point<00:01:29.890> out<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:32.110> laid<00:01:32.320> our

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
point out is that we laid our

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.109 
point out is that we laid our
electronics<00:01:33.490> out<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:35.970> cooperation<00:01:36.970> with

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
electronics out with cooperation with

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.570 
electronics out with cooperation with
our<00:01:37.150> mechanical<00:01:37.750> team<00:01:37.869> they<00:01:38.350> had<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> general

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
our mechanical team they had a general

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.289 
our mechanical team they had a general
idea<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:40.110> mechanism<00:01:41.110> they<00:01:41.260> wanted<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.770> use<00:01:41.950> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
idea of mechanism they wanted to use a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.870 
idea of mechanism they wanted to use a
little<00:01:43.299> catapult<00:01:43.810> thing<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.710> they<00:01:44.830> said<00:01:45.100> make

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
little catapult thing and they said make

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.609 
little catapult thing and they said make
sure<00:01:45.909> that<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.420> center<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.750> clear<00:01:47.020> try<00:01:47.560> to

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
sure that the center is clear try to

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.640 
sure that the center is clear try to
keep<00:01:47.799> it<00:01:47.950> as<00:01:48.040> clear<00:01:48.369> as<00:01:48.520> possible<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.650> that's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
keep it as clear as possible so that's

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.670 
keep it as clear as possible so that's
what<00:01:51.010> I<00:01:51.040> tried<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.490> do<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:51.970> then<00:01:52.330> after<00:01:52.630> we<00:01:53.470> I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
what I tried to do and then after we I

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.660 
what I tried to do and then after we I
almost<00:01:53.979> got<00:01:54.220> this<00:01:55.049> pretty<00:01:56.049> much<00:01:56.290> running

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
almost got this pretty much running

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.120 
almost got this pretty much running
Danny<00:01:57.670> came<00:01:58.000> out<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.770> mentioned<00:01:59.770> Haiti<00:02:00.009> I

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
Danny came out and mentioned Haiti I

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.730 
Danny came out and mentioned Haiti I
just<00:02:00.460> looked<00:02:00.700> at<00:02:00.850> our<00:02:00.970> CAD<00:02:01.210> file<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.840> serios

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
just looked at our CAD file and serios

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.520 
just looked at our CAD file and serios
gonna<00:02:03.100> be<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.250> point<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:04.689> started<00:02:05.409> looking

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
gonna be a point so we started looking

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.910 
gonna be a point so we started looking
at<00:02:05.830> okay<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:07.299> we<00:02:07.420> have<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.659> move<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.019> Serio<00:02:08.440> or

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
at okay do we have to move the Serio or

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.910 
at okay do we have to move the Serio or
is<00:02:09.040> there<00:02:09.220> another<00:02:09.459> way<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:09.700> can<00:02:10.239> reach

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
is there another way we can reach

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.140 
is there another way we can reach
figure<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:12.620> catapult<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.069> we<00:02:14.760> don't<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
figure the catapult so we don't have to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.820 
figure the catapult so we don't have to
do<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.660> looks<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.170> we're<00:02:16.440> gonna<00:02:16.590> move

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
do that it looks like we're gonna move

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.850 
do that it looks like we're gonna move
mark<00:02:17.160> bad<00:02:17.900> because<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.020> got<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.319> nice<00:02:19.530> big

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
mark bad because we got this nice big

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.309 
mark bad because we got this nice big
open<00:02:20.220> area<00:02:20.550> over<00:02:20.790> here<00:02:21.180> we're<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
open area over here we're just going to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.710 
open area over here we're just going to
probably<00:02:22.800> move<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.430> battery<00:02:23.730> over<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.450> or

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
probably move the battery over here or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.559 
probably move the battery over here or
turn<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.560> clear<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:26.610> some<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:27.090> little<00:02:27.360> bit<00:02:27.480> more

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
turn it clear up some a little bit more

here in this place like like sailors on

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.180 
here in this place like like sailors on
the<00:02:38.250> ship<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.110> don't<00:02:40.110> want<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> get<00:02:40.380> scurvy<00:02:40.739> so

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the ship you don't want to get scurvy so

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.190 
the ship you don't want to get scurvy so
we're<00:02:41.489> gonna<00:02:41.580> eat<00:02:41.790> your<00:02:42.000> voice<00:02:43.400> thank<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.760> Oh

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
we're gonna eat your voice thank you Oh

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.759 
we're gonna eat your voice thank you Oh
care<00:02:46.200> man<00:02:46.410> needs<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.830> now<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.910> he<00:02:48.209> gets<00:02:48.390> here

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
care man needs one now if he gets here

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.830 
care man needs one now if he gets here
picking<00:02:49.769> tips<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:54.090> there's<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.390> couple<00:02:54.569> of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
picking tips so there's a couple of

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.500 
picking tips so there's a couple of
parts<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.530> proper<00:02:56.459> water<00:02:56.670> management<00:02:57.150> at

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
parts to proper water management at

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.809 
parts to proper water management at
least<00:02:57.690> what<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.170> feel<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.220> proper<00:02:59.640> water

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
least what I feel is proper water

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.539 
least what I feel is proper water
management<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.630> first<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.519> should

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
management the first one is it should

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.699 
management the first one is it should
visibly<00:03:03.330> look<00:03:04.640> good<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.299> weights<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.380> make<00:03:07.560> it

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
visibly look good so weights to make it

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.150 
visibly look good so weights to make it
look<00:03:07.890> nice<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:09.330> bundle<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.230> wires<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:11.100> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
look nice is to bundle the wires of the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.640 
look nice is to bundle the wires of the
same<00:03:12.590> purpose<00:03:13.590> together<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.650> PWM

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
same purpose together so I have PWM

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.699 
same purpose together so I have PWM
warriors<00:03:17.100> all<00:03:18.060> together<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.959> those<00:03:19.470> are

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
warriors all together and those are

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.280 
warriors all together and those are
bundled<00:03:20.130> separate<00:03:20.609> from<00:03:20.910> my<00:03:21.090> power<00:03:21.299> lines<00:03:21.810> so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
bundled separate from my power lines so

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.420 
bundled separate from my power lines so
when<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.560> look<00:03:22.769> at<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.070> robot<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.329> see

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
when you look at the robot you can see

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.660 
when you look at the robot you can see
certain<00:03:26.430> paths<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.440> they're<00:03:28.440> all<00:03:28.670> segregated

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
certain paths and they're all segregated

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.590 
certain paths and they're all segregated
by<00:03:29.850> their<00:03:30.329> use<00:03:31.640> another<00:03:32.640> good<00:03:32.820> thing<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.150> do<00:03:33.299> is

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
by their use another good thing to do is

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.870 
by their use another good thing to do is
to<00:03:33.930> color<00:03:34.500> code<00:03:35.359> your<00:03:36.359> wires<00:03:37.109> based<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.890> sub

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
to color code your wires based on sub

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.470 
to color code your wires based on sub
assembly<00:03:39.329> or<00:03:39.660> mechanism<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:41.100> have<00:03:41.480> like

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
assembly or mechanism so we have like

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.830 
assembly or mechanism so we have like
for<00:03:42.870> example<00:03:42.959> here<00:03:43.500> we<00:03:43.650> have<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.859> motor<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:45.390> I

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
for example here we have a motor and I

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.330 
for example here we have a motor and I
have<00:03:45.989> green<00:03:46.260> tape<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.739> motor<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.070> green

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
have green tape on the motor a green

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.880 
have green tape on the motor a green
tape<00:03:47.579> where<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.880> goes<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.269> gear<00:03:48.480> box<00:03:48.890> green

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
tape where it goes in the gear box green

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.590 
tape where it goes in the gear box green
on<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.100> speed<00:03:50.370> controller<00:03:50.880> during<00:03:51.299> on<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
on the speed controller during on the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.820 
on the speed controller during on the
PWM<00:03:52.230> green<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.310> power<00:03:53.489> distribution<00:03:53.760> hand

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
PWM green on the power distribution hand

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.620 
PWM green on the power distribution hand
on<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.490> Digital<00:03:55.820> side<00:03:55.850> card<00:03:56.270> where<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.510> goes

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
on the Digital side card where it goes

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.610 
on the Digital side card where it goes
so<00:03:57.140> if<00:03:57.830> for<00:03:58.250> some<00:03:58.310> reason<00:03:59.080> so<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.260> takes<00:04:00.410> this

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
so if for some reason so it takes this

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.650 
so if for some reason so it takes this
motor<00:04:00.890> outputs<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.460> new<00:04:01.580> motor<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.270> know

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
motor outputs a new motor and you know

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.760 
motor outputs a new motor and you know
oh<00:04:02.990> it<00:04:03.650> goes<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.460> green<00:04:05.320> speed<00:04:06.320> controller

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
oh it goes to the green speed controller

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.920 
oh it goes to the green speed controller
because<00:04:07.100> it's<00:04:07.280> plugged<00:04:07.670> into<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.210> green<00:04:08.510> spot

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
because it's plugged into the green spot

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.770 
because it's plugged into the green spot
on<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.200> gearbox<00:04:09.410> or<00:04:09.890> if<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.520> PWM<00:04:11.210> gets<00:04:11.480> cut<00:04:11.750> and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
on the gearbox or if a PWM gets cut and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.580 
on the gearbox or if a PWM gets cut and
you<00:04:12.050> need<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.290> rewire<00:04:12.650> that's<00:04:13.520> easy<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:14.060> do

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
you need to rewire that's easy to do

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.199 
you need to rewire that's easy to do
another<00:04:15.590> thing<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.970> keep<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.299> mind<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:19.030> try<00:04:20.030> not

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
another thing to keep in mind is try not

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.580 
another thing to keep in mind is try not
to<00:04:20.390> crisscross<00:04:20.840> your<00:04:20.959> wires

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
to crisscross your wires

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.840 
to crisscross your wires
try<00:04:21.830> to<00:04:21.890> try<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.340> bundle<00:04:23.330> them<00:04:23.540> all<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.580> what<00:04:25.580> if

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
try to try to bundle them all so what if

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.950 
try to try to bundle them all so what if
you<00:04:26.000> have<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.360> conjoined

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
you have the conjoined

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.810 
you have the conjoined
outer<00:04:27.200> lines<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.800> have<00:04:27.830> all<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.250> black<00:04:28.490> on

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
outer lines you have all the black on

nicely<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.850> also<00:04:34.970> want<00:04:35.420> to<00:04:35.570> try<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.290> avoid

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
nicely you also want to try to avoid

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.850 
nicely you also want to try to avoid

another feature that I'd like to point
out<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:46.700> where<00:04:47.120> we're<00:04:47.300> thinking<00:04:48.050> about

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
out is where we're thinking about
