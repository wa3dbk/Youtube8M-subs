00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
you don't need batteries which is pretty
kick<00:01:27.900> ass<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
kick ass and you know you have you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.660 
kick ass and you know you have you
charge<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.299> via<00:01:30.450> through<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.159> USB<00:01:32.159> cord<00:01:32.460> or

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
charge it via through your USB cord or

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.539 
charge it via through your USB cord or
whatever<00:01:33.860> also<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:36.380> $35<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.369> pro

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
whatever also it is like $35 so the pro

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
whatever also it is like $35 so the pro
controller<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.720> around<00:01:39.810> fifty<00:01:40.229> dollars

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
controller is right around fifty dollars

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.870 
controller is right around fifty dollars
so<00:01:40.680> you're<00:01:40.920> looking<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> fifteen<00:01:41.850> dollar

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so you're looking at a fifteen dollar

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.569 
so you're looking at a fifteen dollar
difference<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> also<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> guys

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
difference there and also as you guys

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.090 
difference there and also as you guys
can<00:01:44.820> watch<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.899> videos<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.290> pencil<00:01:46.560> days<00:01:46.740> i've

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
can watch my videos for pencil days i've

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
can watch my videos for pencil days i've
been<00:01:47.250> using<00:01:47.430> xbox<00:01:47.939> 360<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.869> take<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
been using xbox 360 and if you take a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.719 
been using xbox 360 and if you take a
look<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.439> there's<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.520> similarities

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
look there there's some similarities

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.719 
look there there's some similarities
there<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.220> analog

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
there and what that is is the analog

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.969 
there and what that is is the analog
sticks<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> analog<00:01:55.619> sticks<00:01:55.860> are

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
sticks as you see the analog sticks are

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.499 
sticks as you see the analog sticks are
located<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> same<00:01:56.759> position<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
located in the same position now on the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.420 
located in the same position now on the
pro<00:01:57.689> controller<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.530> analog<00:01:58.890> sticks<00:01:59.250> are

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
pro controller the analog sticks are

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.190 
pro controller the analog sticks are
located<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> top<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
located at the top you get one here and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
located at the top you get one here and
you<00:02:01.439> got<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.920> right<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.610> where<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> Y

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you got one right there where the Y

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.719 
you got one right there where the Y
button<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.770> not<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> big<00:02:05.009> fan<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
button is not a big fan of it not that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.039 
button is not a big fan of it not that
it<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:05.850> bothers<00:02:06.299> me<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.960> feel

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it really bothers me but I just feel

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
like the pro I mean the xbox controller

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.229 
like the pro I mean the xbox controller
the<00:02:10.619> ergonomics<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.459> man<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.879> perfect

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239

really<00:02:13.430> really<00:02:13.700> well<00:02:13.880> designed<00:02:14.060> controller

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
really really well designed controller

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.750 
really really well designed controller
some<00:02:15.500> people<00:02:15.740> play<00:02:15.890> complaining<00:02:16.550> about<00:02:16.610> the

some people play complaining about the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.130 
some people play complaining about the
size<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.240> but<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.450> really<00:02:17.600> matter<00:02:17.840> if<00:02:18.020> you
