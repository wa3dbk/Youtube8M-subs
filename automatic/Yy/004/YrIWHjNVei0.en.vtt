00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.889 
morning but yeah bottomless will hit
double<00:00:41.730> saber<00:00:41.910> source<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.450> that'll<00:00:42.809> be

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
double saber source and that'll be

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
double saber source and that'll be
unfortunate<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.530> six<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> player<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.850> if

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
unfortunate for a six and player but if

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.810 
unfortunate for a six and player but if
he<00:00:45.270> did<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.050> Lance<00:00:46.370> could<00:00:47.370> still<00:00:47.610> attack

still Cheyenne right here but popping

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.649 
still Cheyenne right here but popping
this<00:01:22.820> definitely<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> better<00:01:24.420> play

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this definitely it was the better play

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.170 
this definitely it was the better play
first<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.560> gently<00:01:26.400> drop<00:01:26.670> into<00:01:26.909> another

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
first because I gently drop into another

first because I gently drop into another
6m<00:01:27.570> United<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.590> could<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.700> my<00:01:29.820> guess

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
6m United you could do that but my guess

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
6m United you could do that but my guess
is<00:01:30.060> he's<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.720> Cheyenne<00:01:31.530> um<00:01:32.689> which<00:01:33.689> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
is he's gonna make Cheyenne um which is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
is he's gonna make Cheyenne um which is
a<00:01:33.930> pretty<00:01:34.290> good<00:01:34.590> card<00:01:34.890> against<00:01:35.310> dynaroo<00:01:35.729> bad

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
a pretty good card against dynaroo bad

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
a pretty good card against dynaroo bad
said<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> Dinah<00:01:37.229> rabbit<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.829> know

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
said because I Dinah rabbit you know

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
said because I Dinah rabbit you know
they<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.549> relatively<00:01:38.939> weak<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.540> far<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.259> their

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
they are relatively weak as far as their

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
they are relatively weak as far as their
attack<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.009> mean<00:01:41.159> they<00:01:41.310> can't<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.670> over<00:01:41.850> shiiin

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
attack I mean they can't get over shiiin

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.050 
attack I mean they can't get over shiiin
shiiin<00:01:42.329> communicate<00:01:43.290> Lance<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.860> be

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
shiiin communicate Lance it can be

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.490 
shiiin communicate Lance it can be
so<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.549> feel<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.700> our<00:01:47.850> 600<00:01:48.270> player

just because he went first he

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
just because he went first he

we're against like it's like six

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.319 
we're against like it's like six
samurais<00:01:56.009> versus<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.520> rabbits<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
samurais versus like rabbits you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.910 
samurais versus like rabbits you
definitely<00:01:57.869> need<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.289> set<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.470> against<00:01:58.829> him

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
definitely need to set up against him

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.649 
definitely need to set up against him
first<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.430> whoever<00:01:59.700> gets<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.970> first<00:02:00.329> set<00:02:00.539> up

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
first and whoever gets the first set up

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.810 
first and whoever gets the first set up
definitely<00:02:00.930> has<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.170> advantage<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.070> think<00:02:02.520> our

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
definitely has the advantage I think our

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
definitely has the advantage I think our

same<00:02:49.320> source<00:02:49.590> though<00:02:49.859> but<00:02:50.549> perhaps<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.030> just

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
same source though but perhaps you just

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150 
same source though but perhaps you just
attacking<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.720> same<00:02:51.900> perhaps<00:02:52.380> for<00:02:52.709> miracle

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
attacking the same perhaps for miracle

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.099 
attacking the same perhaps for miracle
fusion<00:02:53.340> which<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.150> an<00:02:54.359> interesting<00:02:54.660> attack

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
fusion which is an interesting attack

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.920 
fusion which is an interesting attack
and<00:02:55.850> we'll<00:02:56.850> get<00:02:56.940> compulsive<00:02:57.510> i<00:02:57.600> think<00:02:57.810> that's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
and we'll get compulsive i think that's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
and we'll get compulsive i think that's

activate miracle fusion which could be
an<00:03:02.700> option<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.269> that'd<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.049> really<00:03:04.319> cool

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
an option and that'd be a really cool

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.330 
this deck and I want to you know maybe
place<00:03:36.420> s<00:03:36.630> later<00:03:36.900> on<00:03:37.079> although<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> dislike

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
place s later on although I dislike

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.559 
place s later on although I dislike
playing<00:03:38.639> Rapids<00:03:38.970> because<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.269> kind<00:03:39.359> of<00:03:39.450> like

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
playing Rapids because it's kind of like

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.660 
playing Rapids because it's kind of like
a<00:03:39.630> really<00:03:40.170> predictable<00:03:40.650> deck<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.430> playing

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
a really predictable deck but playing

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.819 
a really predictable deck but playing
the<00:03:41.790> Sparkman<00:03:42.209> definitely<00:03:42.810> gives<00:03:43.139> me<00:03:43.290> some

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
the Sparkman definitely gives me some

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.629 
the Sparkman definitely gives me some
interest<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:45.889> unfortunately<00:03:46.889> i'm<00:03:47.579> not

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
interest in it unfortunately i'm not

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.520 
interest in it unfortunately i'm not
sure<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.060> there's<00:03:48.480> any<00:03:48.750> other<00:03:48.780> girls<00:03:49.410> are

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
sure if there's any other girls are

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.050 
sure if there's any other girls are
enrolled<00:03:49.769> or<00:03:50.010> stronger<00:03:50.489> than<00:03:50.579> Sparkman

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
enrolled or stronger than Sparkman

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.759 
enrolled or stronger than Sparkman
although<00:03:51.660> i<00:03:51.840> would<00:03:52.170> be<00:03:52.290> safe<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.500> say<00:03:52.739> that

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
although i would be safe to say that

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.050 
although i would be safe to say that
probably<00:03:53.129> Sparkman<00:03:53.939> is<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.720> strongest<00:03:55.470> one

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
probably Sparkman is the strongest one

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.170 
probably Sparkman is the strongest one
but<00:03:56.900> let's<00:03:57.080> see<00:03:57.200> if<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.440> player<00:03:57.650> in<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.180> blue

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
but let's see if a player in the blue

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.390 
but let's see if a player in the blue
happened<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.660> have<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.140> lance<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.920> used<00:04:01.280> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
happened to have that lance and used it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.160 
happened to have that lance and used it
to<00:04:01.430> save<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.730> saber<00:04:02.060> source<00:04:02.390> I'm<00:04:02.720> sorry

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
to save a saber source I'm sorry

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.809 
to save a saber source I'm sorry
compostables<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.130> attack<00:04:04.880> into<00:04:05.330> that<00:04:05.569> um

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
compostables and attack into that um

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.630 
compostables and attack into that um
that<00:04:07.819> kagemusha<00:04:09.069> he<00:04:10.069> might<00:04:10.280> have<00:04:10.400> actually

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
that kagemusha he might have actually

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.610 
that kagemusha he might have actually
secured<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.390> vonage<00:04:11.810> there<00:04:12.050> because<00:04:12.440> our

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
secured and vonage there because our

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.559 
secured and vonage there because our
player<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:13.130> couldn't<00:04:13.640> have<00:04:13.760> made<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:13.970> she<00:04:14.450> n

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
player I couldn't have made that she n

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.090 
player I couldn't have made that she n
and<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:15.200> back<00:04:15.440> row<00:04:15.620> could<00:04:15.800> have<00:04:15.890> actually

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
and this back row could have actually

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.430 
and this back row could have actually
helped<00:04:16.609> protect<00:04:16.820> him<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.900> know<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.290> is

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
helped protect him so you know it is

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.740 
helped protect him so you know it is
kind<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.680> difficult<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:19.100> judge<00:04:19.370> sometimes<00:04:20.120> but

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
kind of difficult to judge sometimes but

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.570 
kind of difficult to judge sometimes but
against<00:04:21.260> exam<00:04:21.530> ER<00:04:21.560> eyes<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.919> really<00:04:22.370> need<00:04:22.550> to

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
against exam ER eyes you really need to

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.760 
against exam ER eyes you really need to
be<00:04:23.210> able<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.540> establish<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.200> field<00:04:24.380> control

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
be able to establish that field control

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.100 
be able to establish that field control
but<00:04:25.700> yeah<00:04:25.820> definitely<00:04:26.060> interesting<00:04:26.690> tech<00:04:26.930> I

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
but yeah definitely interesting tech I

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.140 
but yeah definitely interesting tech I
didn't<00:04:27.350> expect<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:27.650> see<00:04:27.710> spark<00:04:28.130> man<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.520> you

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
didn't expect to see spark man and you

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.909 
didn't expect to see spark man and you
know<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.270> mean<00:04:29.450> you'll<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.260> e<00:04:30.290> heroes<00:04:30.710> and

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
know I mean you'll have to e heroes and

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.590 
know I mean you'll have to e heroes and
if<00:04:31.010> you<00:04:31.130> activate<00:04:31.430> miracle<00:04:31.639> fusion<00:04:31.790> you'll

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
if you activate miracle fusion you'll

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.840 
if you activate miracle fusion you'll
get<00:04:32.750> an<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.990> hero<00:04:33.229> which<00:04:33.440> will<00:04:33.590> be<00:04:33.790> most<00:04:34.790> likely
