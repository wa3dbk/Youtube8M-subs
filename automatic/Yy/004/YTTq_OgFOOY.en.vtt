00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
with the talent but very experienced I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.190 
with the talent but very experienced I
think<00:02:45.100> that's<00:02:45.310> why<00:02:45.550> rhinos<00:02:46.060> there<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.600> don't

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
think that's why rhinos there I don't

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.010 
think that's why rhinos there I don't
really<00:02:47.590> know<00:02:48.100> what's<00:02:48.430> going<00:02:48.520> on<00:02:48.850> exactly<00:02:49.030> but

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
really know what's going on exactly but

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.470 
really know what's going on exactly but
that<00:02:50.200> would<00:02:50.380> be<00:02:50.410> my<00:02:50.770> guess<00:02:50.800> as<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.730> why<00:02:51.940> rhino

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
that would be my guess as to why rhino

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.560 
that would be my guess as to why rhino
is<00:02:52.840> back<00:02:53.170> why<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> WV<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.880> why<00:02:55.330> he's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
is back why is in the WV and why he's

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.560 
is back why is in the WV and why he's
working<00:02:56.020> in<00:02:56.140> xt<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:58.240> what<00:02:58.420> most

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
working in xt I think that's what most

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.030 
working in xt I think that's what most
people<00:02:58.900> believe<00:02:58.990> by<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.320> way<00:02:59.440> Bret<00:03:00.010> the
