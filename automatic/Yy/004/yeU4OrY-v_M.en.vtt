light XL 50 I've been thinking about

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.510 
light XL 50 I've been thinking about
buying<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> Maglite<00:00:15.750> LEDs<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.740> this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
buying one of the Maglite LEDs in this

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.269 
buying one of the Maglite LEDs in this
very<00:00:17.850> basic<00:00:18.180> standard<00:00:18.810> version<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.220> came

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
very basic standard version but I came

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040 
very basic standard version but I came
across<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:21.090> light<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.630> some<00:00:21.779> reason

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
across this light and for some reason

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.870 
across this light and for some reason
I've<00:00:22.140> never<00:00:22.289> seen<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.580> gonna<00:00:23.730> tell

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
little flashlight now I've already had

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.029 
little flashlight now I've already had
this<00:00:27.720> out<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> package<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.650> put<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.920> in

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.560 
can do it on the three strobe talked
about<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.290> versatile<00:02:01.890> light<00:02:02.360> now<00:02:03.360> let's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
about a very versatile light now let's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
about a very versatile light now let's
first<00:02:03.810> we'll<00:02:04.049> look<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.259> single<00:02:04.649> click

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
first we'll look at the single click

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.930 
first we'll look at the single click
large<00:02:05.880> field<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:07.140> runs<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:08.160> light<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
large field this runs this light the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.839 
large field this runs this light the
beam<00:02:09.149> distance<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.720> 145<00:02:10.530> meters<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
beam distance is 145 meters it's a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.670 
beam distance is 145 meters it's a
hundred<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.390> four

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
hundred and four

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.819 
hundred and four
lumens<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:15.269> will<00:02:15.569> run<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.260> mode<00:02:16.560> for

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
lumens and it will run in this mode for

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.449 
lumens and it will run in this mode for
eight<00:02:17.069> hours<00:02:17.099> in<00:02:17.489> 45<00:02:18.299> minutes<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:19.219> lot<00:02:20.219> better

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
eight hours in 45 minutes a lot better

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.119 
eight hours in 45 minutes a lot better
than<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.670> lithium<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.769> do<00:02:22.890> two

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
than the lithium and then we can do two

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.809 
than the lithium and then we can do two
quick<00:02:23.370> clicks<00:02:24.200> that's<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.439> low<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.579> will

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
quick clicks that's the low that will

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.349 
quick clicks that's the low that will
run<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.359> 36<00:02:28.290> hours<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.159> really<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.209> most

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
run for 36 hours and really for most

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.699 
run for 36 hours and really for most
cases<00:02:30.659> this<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.489> very<00:02:32.540> adequate<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:34.469> on<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
cases this is very adequate just on the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.729 
cases this is very adequate just on the
low<00:02:34.859> setting<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.349> then<00:02:37.349> we'll<00:02:37.469> look<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
low setting and then we'll look at the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.390 
low setting and then we'll look at the
strobe

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
strobe

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.839 
strobe
that's<00:02:38.609> three<00:02:38.969> clicks<00:02:42.439> for<00:02:43.439> emergency<00:02:44.069> or<00:02:44.400> two

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
that's three clicks for emergency or two

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.470 
that's three clicks for emergency or two
signal<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.409> neat<00:02:46.799> feature<00:02:47.239> also<00:02:48.239> there's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
signal just a neat feature also there's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.629 
signal just a neat feature also there's
an<00:02:48.629> adjustment<00:02:49.079> at<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.439> end<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:50.099> will<00:02:50.250> brow

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
an adjustment at the end that will brow

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.949 
an adjustment at the end that will brow
broaden<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.329> beam<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:53.780> can't<00:02:54.780> really

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
broaden the beam and you can't really

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.330 
broaden the beam and you can't really
tell<00:02:55.200> from<00:02:55.230> here<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:55.859> I<00:02:55.919> just<00:02:55.950> wanted<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
tell from here but I just wanted to

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.099 
tell from here but I just wanted to
feature<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.030> as<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.329> see<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.599> pinpoint

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
feature it as you can see it's pinpoint

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.420 
feature it as you can see it's pinpoint
and<00:02:58.349> then<00:02:58.439> it<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.739> opens<00:02:59.069> up<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
and then it just opens up to do a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.089 
and then it just opens up to do a
broader<00:02:59.730> beam<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.840> see<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.319> push<00:03:01.829> button

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
broader beam you see the push button

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.349 
broader beam you see the push button
I've<00:03:02.189> had<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.489> for<00:03:02.669> a<00:03:02.730> couple<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:03.030> days<00:03:03.150> I've

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
I've had this for a couple of days I've

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.240 
I've had this for a couple of days I've
been<00:03:03.480> using<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.049> carrying<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.530> my<00:03:04.680> pocket<00:03:05.099> it's

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
been using it carrying it my pocket it's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.599 
been using it carrying it my pocket it's

of the best things that I like about it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.550 
of the best things that I like about it
is<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.079> it's<00:03:19.379> made<00:03:19.680> here<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.729> US<00:03:21.060> a
