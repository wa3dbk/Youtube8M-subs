thing<00:01:12.619> you<00:01:12.770> need<00:01:12.979> is<00:01:13.130> paper<00:01:13.670> each<00:01:14.509> Quiller<00:01:15.020> has

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
thing you need is paper each Quiller has

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.620 
thing you need is paper each Quiller has
their<00:01:15.619> own<00:01:15.649> idea<00:01:16.310> about<00:01:16.610> what<00:01:17.000> type<00:01:17.240> of<00:01:17.450> paper

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
their own idea about what type of paper

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.230 
their own idea about what type of paper
is<00:01:17.899> better<00:01:18.110> for<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.649> quilling<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.459> I<00:01:19.970> think

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
is better for the quilling and I think

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.120 
is better for the quilling and I think
there<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.479> no<00:01:20.750> best<00:01:20.990> paper<00:01:21.259> for<00:01:21.649> quilling<00:01:21.979> in

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
there is no best paper for quilling in

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.529 
there is no best paper for quilling in
general<00:01:22.580> because<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.000> depends<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
general because it depends of the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.300 
general because it depends of the
person's<00:01:24.020> preference<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.740> papers<00:01:25.099> available

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.300 
disadvantages and advantages and one is
that<00:01:50.599> it<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:50.929> usually<00:01:51.440> more<00:01:51.619> expensive<00:01:52.160> than

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
that it is usually more expensive than

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.460 
that it is usually more expensive than
if<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.640> buy<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.119> cut<00:01:53.360> your<00:01:53.569> own<00:01:53.599> paper<00:01:54.080> and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
if you buy and cut your own paper and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.620 
if you buy and cut your own paper and
the<00:01:54.860> second<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.429> that<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.789> is<00:01:55.910> very<00:01:56.119> thin<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the second is that it is very thin and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.839 
the second is that it is very thin and
in<00:01:56.720> my<00:01:56.810> opinion<00:01:56.959> does<00:01:57.470> not<00:01:57.500> look<00:01:57.920> as<00:01:58.220> nice<00:01:58.489> and

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
in my opinion does not look as nice and

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.990 
in my opinion does not look as nice and
the<00:01:58.970> thicker<00:01:59.270> paper<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.590> third<00:02:01.000> disadvantage

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
the thicker paper the third disadvantage

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.150 
the thicker paper the third disadvantage
is<00:02:02.179> that<00:02:02.209> it<00:02:02.569> limits<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.259> in<00:02:03.410> terms<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.860> color

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
is that it limits you in terms of color

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.580 
is that it limits you in terms of color
for<00:02:04.910> example<00:02:05.360> I<00:02:05.479> want<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.750> use<00:02:05.840> different

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
for example I want to use different

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.499 
for example I want to use different
shades<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.069> a<00:02:07.160> color<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.910> may<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.209> more

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
shades of a color it may be more

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.600 
shades of a color it may be more
difficult<00:02:08.569> because<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.649> cooling<00:02:09.920> paper<00:02:10.160> is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
difficult because the cooling paper is

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.760 
difficult because the cooling paper is
not<00:02:10.819> as<00:02:11.090> popular<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.840> does<00:02:12.230> not<00:02:12.440> come<00:02:12.620> in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
not as popular and does not come in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.220 
not as popular and does not come in
hundreds<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.250> color<00:02:13.910> Suzy<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.570> cut<00:02:14.750> out<00:02:15.050> paper

hundreds of color Suzy and cut out paper

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.090 
hundreds of color Suzy and cut out paper
comes

comes

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.890

the<00:02:16.160> lessees<00:02:16.460> advantage<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.210> that<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:17.630> cut

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
the lessees advantage is that it's cut

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.870 
the lessees advantage is that it's cut
size<00:02:18.200> limits<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.800> if<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.160> want<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.490> use<00:02:19.670> the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
order to cut the paper you have also

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.110 
order to cut the paper you have also
different<00:03:15.410> possibilities<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.370> first<00:03:16.610> one<00:03:16.910> is

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
different possibilities the first one is

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.180 
different possibilities the first one is
to<00:03:17.270> mark<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.630> paper<00:03:17.810> with<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.200> pencil<00:03:18.530> using<00:03:19.040> a

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
to mark the paper with a pencil using a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.640 
to mark the paper with a pencil using a
ruler<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.730> cut<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.180> with<00:03:20.210> a<00:03:20.360> cutter<00:03:20.720> this

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
ruler and cut it with a cutter this

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.710 
ruler and cut it with a cutter this
advantage<00:03:22.160> with<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.520> is<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.210> takes<00:03:23.450> a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
advantage with this is that it takes a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.540 
advantage with this is that it takes a
long<00:03:23.900> time<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.560> only<00:03:24.740> for<00:03:25.010> example<00:03:25.430> eight

long time it only for example eight
minutes<00:03:25.940> measure<00:03:26.210> and<00:03:26.420> cut<00:03:26.570> thirty<00:03:26.900> strips<00:03:27.350> of

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
minutes measure and cut thirty strips of

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.710 
minutes measure and cut thirty strips of
paper<00:03:27.770> also<00:03:28.670> if<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.910> choose<00:03:28.970> this<00:03:29.240> method<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
cutting pad as I did for this one

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.479 
cutting pad as I did for this one
the<00:03:55.690> fourth<00:03:55.989> possibility<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.099> use<00:03:57.430> a

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
the fourth possibility is to use a

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.119 
the fourth possibility is to use a
manual<00:03:57.879> paper<00:03:58.209> shredder<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.260> advantage<00:03:59.830> is

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
manual paper shredder the advantage is

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.559 
manual paper shredder the advantage is
that<00:04:00.159> you<00:04:00.340> can<00:04:00.640> cut<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.819> whole<00:04:01.120> sheet<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.390> paper

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
that you can cut a whole sheet of paper

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.800 
that you can cut a whole sheet of paper
at<00:04:01.870> one<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:03.400> only<00:04:03.610> took<00:04:03.819> me<00:04:04.030> 12<00:04:04.269> seconds<00:04:04.750> to

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
at one and it only took me 12 seconds to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.780 
at one and it only took me 12 seconds to
cut<00:04:05.080> 30<00:04:05.349> strips<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.950> paper<00:04:06.099> with<00:04:06.370> my<00:04:06.489> shredder

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
cut 30 strips of paper with my shredder

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.610 
cut 30 strips of paper with my shredder
and<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.540> cause<00:04:07.780> mine<00:04:07.989> is<00:04:08.019> small<00:04:08.440> what

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
and this is the cause mine is small what

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.080 
and this is the cause mine is small what

60 strips of paper in less than 15
seconds<00:04:12.879> a<00:04:13.349> disadvantage<00:04:14.349> with<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.829> is<00:04:15.040> that

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
seconds a disadvantage with it is that

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
paper cut manually with a cutter you can

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.029 
paper cut manually with a cutter you can
see<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.520> difference<00:05:03.880> between<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.450> two<00:05:05.039> for

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
filling I bought a button that will

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.469 
filling I bought a button that will
speak<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:47.979> would<00:05:48.190> not<00:05:48.340> write<00:05:48.639> transplant<00:05:49.240> I

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
speak and would not write transplant I

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.020 
speak and would not write transplant I
did<00:05:49.690> not<00:05:49.870> like<00:05:50.080> it<00:05:50.110> at<00:05:50.349> all<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:50.889> I<00:05:51.220> decided<00:05:51.880> to

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
did not like it at all and I decided to

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.210 
did not like it at all and I decided to
try<00:05:52.389> transparent<00:05:53.080> glue<00:05:53.260> that<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.710> really<00:05:54.010> liked

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
try transparent glue that I really liked

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.250 
try transparent glue that I really liked
because<00:05:54.729> it<00:05:54.880> will<00:05:55.000> dry<00:05:55.180> faster<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.840> of<00:05:55.960> course

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
because it will dry faster and of course

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.980 
because it will dry faster and of course
transplant<00:05:57.030> there<00:05:58.030> is<00:05:58.150> no<00:05:58.300> best<00:05:58.539> friend<00:05:58.660> of

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
transplant there is no best friend of

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.719 
transplant there is no best friend of

different countries I

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.509 
different countries I
always<00:06:03.369> found<00:06:03.699> the<00:06:03.879> good<00:06:04.089> one<00:06:04.239> to<00:06:04.389> use<00:06:04.419> a

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:05.519 
always found the good one to use a

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:08.009 
always found the good one to use a
disadvantage<00:06:06.519> with<00:06:06.819> the<00:06:07.089> transplant<00:06:07.509> clue<00:06:07.869> is

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:08.019 
disadvantage with the transplant clue is

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:09.959 
disadvantage with the transplant clue is
that<00:06:08.050> is<00:06:08.379> thicker<00:06:08.860> than<00:06:09.069> the<00:06:09.309> white<00:06:09.489> one<00:06:09.729> and

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
that is thicker than the white one and

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.119 
that is thicker than the white one and
is<00:06:10.059> not<00:06:10.269> good<00:06:10.599> to<00:06:10.809> use<00:06:10.989> for<00:06:11.019> certain<00:06:11.439> job<00:06:11.860> site

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
is not good to use for certain job site

for<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.519> drawing<00:06:12.849> type<00:06:13.139> let's<00:06:14.139> write<00:06:14.409> several

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:14.709 
for the drawing type let's write several

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:17.639 
for the drawing type let's write several
types<00:06:15.189> of<00:06:15.369> them<00:06:15.699> and<00:06:15.999> the<00:06:16.869> glue<00:06:17.080> would<00:06:17.229> give<00:06:17.559> a

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:17.649 
types of them and the glue would give a

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.709 
types of them and the glue would give a
transplant<00:06:18.309> what<00:06:18.550> shiny<00:06:18.819> Martin<00:06:19.269> my<00:06:19.360> drawing

transplant what shiny Martin my drawing
which<00:06:19.899> I<00:06:20.019> did<00:06:20.169> not<00:06:20.379> like<00:06:20.619> that's<00:06:21.519> why<00:06:21.789> I

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.029 
which I did not like that's why I

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.149 
which I did not like that's why I
decided<00:06:22.509> to<00:06:22.959> try<00:06:23.199> again<00:06:23.259> the<00:06:23.559> typical<00:06:23.739> white

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
decided to try again the typical white

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:25.829 
decided to try again the typical white
glue<00:06:24.429> the<00:06:24.699> thinner<00:06:24.939> one<00:06:25.269> that<00:06:25.569> white

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
glue the thinner one that white

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.929 
glue the thinner one that white
transparent<00:06:26.139> of<00:06:26.589> course<00:06:26.860> and<00:06:27.339> I<00:06:27.550> was<00:06:27.699> really

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
transparent of course and I was really

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.659 
transparent of course and I was really
pleased<00:06:28.209> of<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:28.479> results<00:06:29.249> another<00:06:30.249> advantage

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
pleased of the results another advantage

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.089 
pleased of the results another advantage
of<00:06:30.969> this<00:06:31.149> one<00:06:31.449> is<00:06:31.659> that<00:06:32.110> you<00:06:32.169> can<00:06:32.439> also<00:06:32.649> use<00:06:32.949> it

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
of this one is that you can also use it

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.799 
of this one is that you can also use it
as<00:06:33.219> a<00:06:33.279> sealant<00:06:33.759> for<00:06:33.849> your<00:06:34.119> jewelry<00:06:34.569> or<00:06:34.779> other
