00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.170 

do<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.230> type<00:03:01.620> since<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.850> big<00:03:03.150> one

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180

you<00:03:04.079> need<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.500> big<00:03:04.799> hole<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:08.840> hold<00:03:09.840> it

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
you need like a big hole so we hold it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.449 
you need like a big hole so we hold it
in<00:03:10.760> then<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.209> one<00:03:12.570> just<00:03:13.230> keep<00:03:13.799> this<00:03:14.400> one

in then for this one just keep this one

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.699 
in then for this one just keep this one
so<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.450> don't<00:03:15.600> have<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.930> poke<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.260> big<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
through we'll just plug that one in and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.150 
through we'll just plug that one in and
get<00:03:19.079> this<00:03:19.350> part<00:03:19.940> put<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.060> through<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.360> big<00:03:21.600> one

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
get this part put it through the big one

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.210 
get this part put it through the big one
and<00:03:23.160> take<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.790> see<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.720> have<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.140> here<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.680> plug

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and take it see I have it here and plug
