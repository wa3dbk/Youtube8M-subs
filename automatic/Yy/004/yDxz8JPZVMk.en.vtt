and then on the other side you have your
numbers<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.760> not<00:00:26.880> entirely<00:00:27.090> sure<00:00:27.269> what

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
numbers I'm not entirely sure what

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.839 
numbers I'm not entirely sure what
that's<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.900> might<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> model<00:00:28.470> number

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849

Brunswick<00:00:32.130> logo<00:00:32.719> now<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
Brunswick logo now as you can see like I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860 
Brunswick logo now as you can see like I
said<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> t-zone<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.480> reason<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
said this is t-zone and the reason I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380 
said this is t-zone and the reason I
believe<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.070> crosshair<00:00:38.489> if

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
believe that they have this crosshair if

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.880 
believe that they have this crosshair if
you<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.690> across<00:00:39.930> areas<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.500> half<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you want across areas this is half of it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.190 
you want across areas this is half of it
it's<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:41.969> down<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> scope<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
it's what you look down a scope for on a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.430 
it's what you look down a scope for on a
gun<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.890> aim<00:00:44.480> I'm<00:00:45.480> guessing<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.930> has<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.289> do

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
gun to aim I'm guessing this has to do

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.700 
gun to aim I'm guessing this has to do
with<00:00:47.239> straightness<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.539> something<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
with straightness or something like that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
with straightness or something like that
I<00:00:49.890> guess<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> means<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.000> gonna<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I guess it means that you're gonna I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
I guess it means that you're gonna I
don't<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.980> entirely<00:00:53.250> sure<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.520> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
don't know not entirely sure what that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.389 
don't know not entirely sure what that
was<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.940> anyway<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.870> t-zone<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> brand

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
was for anyway but t-zone is the brand

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.110 
was for anyway but t-zone is the brand
of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> ball

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
of the ball

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.209 
of the ball

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.100 
ball the brand of it is Brunswick now
the<00:01:01.980> reason<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.309> chose<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.940> color<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.449> because

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the reason I chose this color is because

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170

just use the tips so when I throw I can
throw<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.979> spin<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.340> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
throw like that and have spin on it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.590 
throw like that and have spin on it
going<00:01:53.579> down<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> lane<00:01:54.979> I'm<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.130> righty<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.759> can

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
going down the lane I'm a righty so can

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480 
going down the lane I'm a righty so can
either<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.350> it'll<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
either do it for right it'll go right to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179 
either do it for right it'll go right to
the<00:01:59.549> left<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:01.079> you're<00:02:01.200> vice<00:02:01.350> versa<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.979> goes

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the left or if you're vice versa it goes

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.730 
the left or if you're vice versa it goes
left<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> right<00:02:03.079> it<00:02:04.079> doesn't<00:02:04.380> matter<00:02:04.530> either

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
left to right it doesn't matter either

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490 
left to right it doesn't matter either
way<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.040> works<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> want<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> go<00:02:07.020> see

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
way it works so if you want to go see

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.050 
way it works so if you want to go see

rotating eventually at the end of the
lane<00:03:25.980> or<00:03:26.280> near<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.760> end<00:03:26.880> it'll<00:03:27.209> start<00:03:27.419> going

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
lane or near the end it'll start going

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.599 
lane or near the end it'll start going
forward<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.260> it'll<00:03:28.440> go<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.709> way<00:03:28.889> or<00:03:29.130> however

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
forward or it'll go this way or however

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.839 
forward or it'll go this way or however
your<00:03:29.849> throwing<00:03:30.030> ball<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:31.139> um<00:03:31.609> back<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
your throwing ball so um back to the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.440 
your throwing ball so um back to the
uneven<00:03:33.120> core<00:03:33.480> with<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.470> uneven<00:03:34.650> core<00:03:35.419> you<00:03:36.419> can

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
uneven core with the uneven core you can

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.349 
uneven core with the uneven core you can
basically<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:37.980> made<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.430> hooking<00:03:38.730> this

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
basically this is made for hooking this
