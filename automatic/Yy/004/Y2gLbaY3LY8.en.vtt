00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:05.020
 and this is what you remember from the moment of your return in pole-position 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 I remember that I did a very good first lap 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.210
 already on the second lap you can see a little more the car was very good 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.359
 did not have 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.359
 absolutely no problem 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.919
 copapt 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.550
 in front of each forum the goods to ijuí 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.450
 I figured I said I think it's going to hurt 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.840
 got close 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.210
 very close to the wall will be rodrigo 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.450
 while it came close 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 hereu I got much faster on the second lap 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.950
 had done in the first round 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.950
 the increase of honey 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.360
 where you crossed the line that the team will have the best time at that time 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.250
 what was thought 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.900
 at the worst of them per second sincerely 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.890
 the first thing that crossed my mind 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.310
 the one more car still with the situation 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.050
 it becomes obvious that he is also content to be more eccentric a little more 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.400
 important to talk big 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.580
 in the foreground dependent on all this 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.300
 we give it all away 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 The most important to me 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.010
 logical creamer 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.180
 It's important to be in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.670
 The race in my head is a thousand times more important is to try to hit the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.890
 car very well mother and sister 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 criciúma come here long accompanies I never saw you vibrating 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.870
 when you have bruno when 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.610
 I knew that your pole-position and that the people you raised if you 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.410
 out 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.350
 it was an empire outburst its price 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.750
 a little bit outside 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.980
 I particularly in the past two years in my career for men 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.000
 mainly 97 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 As soon as you can 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.630
 first at home 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.280
 it's fantastic then 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.960
 I think we're going the right way. 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.130
 I'm very pleased 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.849
 I had already said it before 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.269
 tomorrow is the moment of increase if it will be today it was warming up a little bit 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.009
 my mother was really have to go headbangs to look forward 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.059
 forget that you have two mirrors in the car 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.839
 do your best
