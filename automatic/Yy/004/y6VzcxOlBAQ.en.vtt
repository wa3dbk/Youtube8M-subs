"Speaker 1: My name is Joe Kliegman and I'm
a post-doc in the Derisi lab at UCSF.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.680
So right now, one of the, the projects that
I'm working on that I'm most excited about

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.609
is an analogy project.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.559
And basically, we're trying to find a genetic
signature for anaphylactic allergy.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.510
You know, some people are allergic to milk,
some people are allergic to pollen, some people

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.739
are allergic to peanuts and the problem is
is nobody understands quite how that works

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.080
and you know they know the molecules in your
body that are responsible for that allergy

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.350
but they don't really know what goes wrong
with those molecules and if we understand

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.659
what goes wrong with those molecules we can
both develop diagnostic tools to diagnose

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.940
and say oh yeah like you have this bad allergy.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.300
And we can also kind of figure out therapies
to cure allergy.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:24.010
So I grew up kind of in a on a subsistence
goat farm and in, in central Washington State.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.820
We didn't have electricity, we didn't have
running water when as a small child.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.261
My dad was, I guess an environmental activist
and he did a lot of work trying to stop a,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.110
a gold mine that was proposed close to where
I grew up.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:47.600
He was, he was ultimately successful in large
part because of scientists who testified in

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.610
court on our behalf.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.990
I don't know, my parents always were, were
always you know encouraged me to be interested

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.970
in the natural world, encouraged me to experiment
with my surroundings, kind of due to i guess

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.840
a unique set of circumstances I ended up in
science and it stuck.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.420
A typical day is I come in and try to, try
to get whatever experiments that I planned

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.080
for that day rolling.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.200
Matt might be, you know, setting up an incubation
kind of taking some patients' samples like

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.450
patient blood and extracting the nucleic acids
out of the patient blood so like I can do

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.560
experiments on them.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.510
An important, an important part of lab I think,
any day of the week, is coming in and talking

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.510
to people.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.510
So what are you doing?

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.890
Speaker 2: This is a collaboration with the
Vale lab.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.349
They have a cool thing.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.670
They're doing RNA pulldowns on proteins.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.280
So I wanna use this technique for vita samples
with her plasmodium stuff.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.050
Speaker 1: Okay is is there something like
is there something on the surface of plasmodium

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.050
that recognizes

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.069
Speaker 2: Well it would be life saving, so

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:14.010
Speaker 1: Because I think research is this,
this cyclical process of doing experiments,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.800
seeing, you know, the results that those experiments
tell you and then kind of talking about the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.340
your results with a lot of people that have
different perspectives and you know I think

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.209
we're really lucky in this lab to have medical
doctors and neurologists, dentists kind of

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.770
like people, people of all different kind
of academic persuasions and training.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.239
They all have like really different things
to say and you know you might not like agree

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.680
with what they say like that or, or they might
kind of in, in the space of five minutes completely

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.770
change your thinking of, like a project.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.710
Speaker 2: No, no, so the RNA is the motif
and the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.710
Speaker 1: The RNA is the the motif

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.540
Speaker 2: And then the proteins bind to it
so what he wants to understand is what are

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.840
all the proteins that are involved in this

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.490
Speaker 1: I think that people tend to kind
of underestimate how much of Science is really

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.340
just talking to people and talking with people
about ideas.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.640
I guess I chose this lab because having, having
like a lively dialogue like a lively back

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.880
and forth like for me is like really important
to kind of stimulate my own thinking.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.610
So I think that's primarily what I was actually
I mean and, and Joe's also, he kind of like

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.889
chose, chosen a field that I was really compelled
by.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.690
You know, infectious disease like effects
millions of people around the world and he

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.490
has like a really clear mission statement
of helping people from I guess like more,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.819
more kind of disadvantaged socio-economic
and a contacts and developing nations so I

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.819
really appreciated that too.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.789
You know, I've done some research that I like
but it mostly like I think I'm like proud

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.979
of the people around me and proud of the people
that I get to work with on a, a daily basis."
