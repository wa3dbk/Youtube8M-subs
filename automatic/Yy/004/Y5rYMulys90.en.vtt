00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
headphone jack so without further ado we

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:49.990 
headphone jack so without further ado we
are<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> unbox<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.870> x5<00:00:37.320> max<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:37.950> now

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.420 

so<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> x5<00:00:51.570> max<00:00:51.960> has<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> 5.5<00:00:52.949> inch<00:00:52.980> Super

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so the x5 max has a 5.5 inch Super

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.520 
so the x5 max has a 5.5 inch Super

I<00:01:32.579> hope<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.479> description<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.439> wrong

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
I hope the description is a bit wrong

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.130 
I hope the description is a bit wrong
because<00:01:34.979> 16<00:01:35.340> gigabytes<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.869> not

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because 16 gigabytes is really not

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.219 
because 16 gigabytes is really not
enough<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> smart<00:01:38.430> phone<00:01:38.610> right<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.869> we

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
enough for a smart phone right now so we

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.960 
enough for a smart phone right now so we
don't<00:01:40.409> further<00:01:40.619> ado<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:40.950> gonna<00:01:41.189> unwrap<00:01:41.820> the

don't further ado I'm gonna unwrap the
plastic<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.479> take<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> phone<00:01:43.020> out<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.290> the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
the thickness of six point seven

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.030 
the thickness of six point seven
millimeters<00:05:40.690> so<00:05:40.900> I'm<00:05:41.440> gonna<00:05:41.560> compare<00:05:41.950> the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
millimeters so I'm gonna compare the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.510 
millimeters so I'm gonna compare the
phone<00:05:42.250> set<00:05:42.550> by<00:05:42.669> site<00:05:42.960> so<00:05:43.960> there<00:05:44.680> we<00:05:44.770> go<00:05:44.830> six

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
phone set by site so there we go six

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.310 
phone set by site so there we go six
point<00:05:45.760> seven<00:05:45.910> millimeters<00:05:46.510> versus<00:05:46.960> five

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
point seven millimeters versus five

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.200 
point seven millimeters versus five
point<00:05:47.590> zero<00:05:47.890> eight<00:05:48.040> millimeters<00:05:48.669> can<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.000> see

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
point zero eight millimeters can you see

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.540 
point zero eight millimeters can you see
the<00:05:49.330> difference<00:05:49.660> already<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.440> in<00:05:51.250> terms<00:05:51.430> of

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
the difference already and in terms of

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.450 
the difference already and in terms of
design<00:05:51.880> they<00:05:52.360> are<00:05:52.540> really<00:05:53.290> really<00:05:53.890> different

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
design they are really really different

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.760
