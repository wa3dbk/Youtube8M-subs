00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.250 

the<00:00:05.120> favorite<00:00:05.480> thing<00:00:05.510> about<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:06.020> airplane

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:06.260 
the favorite thing about this airplane

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.190 
the favorite thing about this airplane
and<00:00:06.740> flying<00:00:07.040> it<00:00:07.250> is<00:00:07.399> the<00:00:08.029> thrust<00:00:08.510> capability

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
and flying it is the thrust capability

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
and flying it is the thrust capability
and<00:00:09.950> also<00:00:10.519> just<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:10.880> basic<00:00:11.780> user<00:00:12.590> interface

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
and also just the basic user interface

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.640 
and also just the basic user interface
within<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:14.150> cockpit<00:00:14.630> this<00:00:15.110> airplane<00:00:15.440> has<00:00:15.560> got

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
within the cockpit this airplane has got

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.140 
within the cockpit this airplane has got
a<00:00:15.680> lot<00:00:15.860> of<00:00:15.890> power<00:00:16.129> in<00:00:16.369> it<00:00:16.460> so<00:00:16.699> when<00:00:16.910> you're<00:00:17.029> up

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
a lot of power in it so when you're up

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.600 
a lot of power in it so when you're up
when<00:00:17.600> you<00:00:17.689> go<00:00:17.750> to<00:00:17.810> take<00:00:18.019> off<00:00:18.460> accelerates<00:00:19.460> very

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
when you go to take off accelerates very

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.940 
when you go to take off accelerates very
rapidly<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:20.330> then<00:00:20.600> up<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.930> airspeed<00:00:21.260> you<00:00:21.830> go

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
rapidly and then up the airspeed you go

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.150 
rapidly and then up the airspeed you go
to<00:00:22.010> afterburner<00:00:22.520> it<00:00:23.510> goes<00:00:23.720> pretty<00:00:23.930> quick<00:00:24.289> with

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
to afterburner it goes pretty quick with

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.270 
to afterburner it goes pretty quick with
automation<00:00:26.030> such<00:00:26.510> as<00:00:26.750> auto<00:00:27.050> throttle<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.890> a

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
automation such as auto throttle and a

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.760 
automation such as auto throttle and a
more<00:00:28.760> robust<00:00:29.240> autopilot<00:00:29.750> than<00:00:30.080> in<00:00:30.289> previous

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
more robust autopilot than in previous

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.639 
more robust autopilot than in previous
airplanes<00:00:31.369> I've<00:00:31.550> had<00:00:31.789> as<00:00:32.119> well<00:00:32.300> as<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.539> mat<00:00:33.500> ik

airplanes I've had as well as a mat ik

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.639 
airplanes I've had as well as a mat ik
trim<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.280> that<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:35.060> f-35<00:00:35.600> has<00:00:35.630> it<00:00:36.230> allows<00:00:36.500> you

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
trim and that the f-35 has it allows you

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.069 
trim and that the f-35 has it allows you
to<00:00:36.739> devote<00:00:37.040> almost<00:00:37.880> all<00:00:38.180> of<00:00:38.210> your<00:00:38.600> mental

capacity<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.040> mission<00:00:40.550> rather<00:00:41.030> than<00:00:41.300> to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
capacity to the mission rather than to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.780 
capacity to the mission rather than to
the<00:00:41.600> flying<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.380> airplane<00:00:42.770> what<00:00:43.670> was

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
the flying of the airplane what was

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.790 
the flying of the airplane what was
striking<00:00:44.059> about<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.630> flights<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.050> me<00:00:45.320> was<00:00:45.680> how

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
striking about the flights to me was how

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.650 
striking about the flights to me was how
comfortable<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.460> was<00:00:46.670> just<00:00:47.059> after<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:47.360> couple<00:00:47.570> of

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
comfortable I was just after a couple of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.240 
comfortable I was just after a couple of
approaches<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.410> would<00:00:48.800> have<00:00:48.890> been<00:00:48.980> comfortable

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
approaches I would have been comfortable

we'll play in high alpha testing on a f4

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.899 
we'll play in high alpha testing on a f4
and<00:01:08.719> we<00:01:09.469> found<00:01:09.740> out<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.159> whenever<00:01:10.430> we<00:01:10.729> put

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
and we found out that whenever we put

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.969 
and we found out that whenever we put
the<00:01:11.030> airplane<00:01:11.180> out<00:01:11.509> of<00:01:11.539> control<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.680> were<00:01:12.799> able

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
the airplane out of control we were able

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.130 
the airplane out of control we were able
to<00:01:13.310> use<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.850> stick<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.390> pedals<00:01:14.810> or<00:01:14.990> the

together<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.630> like<00:01:59.320> how<00:01:59.530> when<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.860> download

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
together I like how when you download

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.499 
together I like how when you download
the<00:02:00.460> PMD<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:00.940> gives<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.240> all<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.479> information

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
the PMD it gives you all the information

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.520 
the PMD it gives you all the information
right<00:02:02.110> off<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.530> write<00:02:02.950> off<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.190> aircraft

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.449 

straight<00:02:08.910> aircraft<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.660> next<00:02:10.899> 50<00:02:11.200> years

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
straight aircraft for the next 50 years

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.980 
straight aircraft for the next 50 years
it's<00:02:12.459> extremely<00:02:12.970> important<00:02:13.330> for<00:02:13.420> us<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:14.740> be

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
it's extremely important for us to be

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.960 
it's extremely important for us to be
operating<00:02:16.990> an<00:02:17.110> aircraft<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.760> fly<00:02:18.760> from

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
operating an aircraft that can fly from

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.059 
operating an aircraft that can fly from
ships<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.840> we're<00:02:20.050> getting<00:02:20.680> as<00:02:20.890> much

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
ships and we're getting as much

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.800 
ships and we're getting as much
experience<00:02:21.400> as<00:02:21.700> possible<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.209> we<00:02:22.300> can<00:02:22.450> move<00:02:22.569> to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
experience as possible so we can move to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.380 
experience as possible so we can move to
Edwards<00:02:23.500> Air<00:02:23.620> Force<00:02:23.650> Base<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.340> carry<00:02:25.209> out<00:02:25.360> our

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.160 

what's<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:29.910> different<00:02:30.060> about<00:02:30.209> f-35<00:02:30.900> from

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
what's really different about f-35 from

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.830 
what's really different about f-35 from
legacy<00:02:31.530> platforms<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.360> number

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
legacy platforms is just the the number

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.690 
legacy platforms is just the the number
of<00:02:33.959> sensors<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.709> available<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
of sensors we have available the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.430 
of sensors we have available the
integration<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.360> those<00:02:36.510> sensors<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.319> then

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
integration of those sensors and then

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.930 
integration of those sensors and then
the<00:02:37.590> display<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.160> information<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
pilot concept of the helmet is

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.090 
pilot concept of the helmet is
essentially<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.100> provide<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:42.510> virtual<00:02:43.470> HUD<00:02:43.830> for

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
essentially to provide a virtual HUD for

essentially to provide a virtual HUD for
the<00:02:44.160> pilot<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.680> through

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the pilot with that we can see through

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.350 
the pilot with that we can see through
the<00:02:47.100> cockpit<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:47.790> means<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.209> we<00:02:48.270> don't

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
the cockpit which means that we don't

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.940 
the cockpit which means that we don't
have<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.720> roll<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.020> airplane<00:02:49.140> inverted<00:02:49.800> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
have to roll the airplane inverted to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
see our target we can actually look

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300 
see our target we can actually look
through<00:02:51.360> at<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.230> aircraft<00:02:52.620> if<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.100> to

what<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.510> f-35<00:03:23.320> has<00:03:23.710> done<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.760> change<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
what the f-35 has done is change the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
pilot specifically it uses flaps to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.370 
pilot specifically it uses flaps to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
change the airplanes position on the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.230 
change the airplanes position on the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
glide slope and what that does is it

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.260 
glide slope and what that does is it
takes<00:03:38.080> practically<00:03:38.830> all<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.280> lag<00:03:39.520> out<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:40.210> a

pilot input for an airplane you had to

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.010 
pilot input for an airplane you had to

all together for you unless you

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.150 
all together for you unless you
basically<00:03:47.110> make<00:03:47.320> quick<00:03:47.500> decisions<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
basically make quick decisions on the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.250 
basically make quick decisions on the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
pilot to make a better more informed

pilot to make a better more informed
tactical<00:03:53.380> decision<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.490> in<00:03:54.790> my<00:03:54.970> opinion<00:03:55.120> is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
tactical decision that in my opinion is

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.300 
tactical decision that in my opinion is
going<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.170> big<00:03:56.320> leap<00:03:56.470> forward<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:57.070> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
going to be the big leap forward in the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.060 
going to be the big leap forward in the
f-35
