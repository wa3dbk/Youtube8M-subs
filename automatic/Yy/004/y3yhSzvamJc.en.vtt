last<00:00:51.149> video<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> jackal<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.129> own

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

or<00:00:53.550> Li<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> difference<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
or Li the difference or what they are I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.279 
or Li the difference or what they are I
just<00:00:55.680> kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> classify<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> dog<00:00:57.289> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
just kind of classify them as a dog and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.700 
just kind of classify them as a dog and
so<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.309> pretty<00:00:59.460> cute<00:01:00.350> personally<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> think

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.649 

it<00:01:04.710> looks<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.070> real<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it looks really real and I think you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.969 
it looks really real and I think you
know<00:01:06.720> mo<00:01:06.900> damn<00:01:07.080> should<00:01:07.320> come<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.770> some

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
know mo damn should come up with some
type<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.369> dog<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.939> mean<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> guess<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
type of a dog I mean I guess there's the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
type of a dog I mean I guess there's the
Fox<00:01:10.500> which<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> dog<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.360> don't

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
Fox which is kind of like a dog I don't

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.880 
Fox which is kind of like a dog I don't
know<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.549> yeah<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.760> it'd<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.090> cool<00:01:15.890> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
know but yeah I think it'd be cool the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
know but yeah I think it'd be cool the
second<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> buffalo<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.080> my

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
second one is a buffalo and this is my

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.130 
second one is a buffalo and this is my
lunchbox<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:20.100> monitor<00:01:21.140> a.k.a<00:01:22.880> galaxy<00:01:23.880> gal<00:01:24.570> gal

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
lunchbox my monitor a.k.a galaxy gal gal

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
lunchbox my monitor a.k.a galaxy gal gal
I'm<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:25.979> even<00:01:26.159> gonna<00:01:26.250> try<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> link<00:01:27.600> will

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
I'm not even gonna try but the link will

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.770 
I'm not even gonna try but the link will
be<00:01:27.810> done<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.009> buffalo<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.479> think

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
be done so it's a buffalo and I think

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.600 
be done so it's a buffalo and I think
the<00:01:34.259> Buffalo<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.130> cool<00:01:35.369> it's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the Buffalo would be really cool it's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.830 
the Buffalo would be really cool it's
kind<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.060> different<00:01:36.210> from<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> other

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
kind of like different from the other

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
kind of like different from the other
animals<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.409> Jamaal<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.970> really

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
animals in Jamaal and if you really

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.840 
animals in Jamaal and if you really
click<00:01:39.329> personally<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:41.640> third

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
click personally I think the third

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
click personally I think the third
animal<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> camel<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.220> these

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
animal is a camel and I think these

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.550 
animal is a camel and I think these
would<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.700> rather<00:01:44.939> interesting<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.439> in

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
would be rather interesting to see in

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469 
would be rather interesting to see in
Jamal<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> hump<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> everything<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
Jamal with the hump and everything and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240 
Jamal with the hump and everything and
how<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> clothes<00:01:49.320> would<00:01:49.530> fit<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> back

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
how the clothes would fit on the back

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.310 
how the clothes would fit on the back
like<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> worn<00:01:51.030> I'd<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.750> weird<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.170> may

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
like a worn I'd be really weird we may

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
like a worn I'd be really weird we may
just<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.710> top<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> hump<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.520> something

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
just be on top of the hump or something

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.780 
just be on top of the hump or something
and<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> weird<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.560> yeah<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.829> think<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and be kind of weird so yeah I think a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.749 
and be kind of weird so yeah I think a
camel<00:01:57.420> would<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.649> cool<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.490> come

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
camel would be really cool if they come

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.830 
camel would be really cool if they come
to<00:02:00.000> Jamal<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:04.200> last<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.579> raccoon<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to Jamal and the last one is a raccoon I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.589 
to Jamal and the last one is a raccoon I
think<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.500> don't<00:02:07.560> even<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:09.060> honest<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
think I don't even know to be honest I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.670 
think I don't even know to be honest I
might<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.170> let<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.679> not

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
might have to let this for not

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.640 
might have to let this for not
but<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:13.510> really<00:02:14.379> cute<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:16.409> don't<00:02:17.409> know

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
but it's really cute and I don't know

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
pretty cute I like the tail and I wonder

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.959 
pretty cute I like the tail and I wonder
whether<00:02:26.739> like<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> raccoon<00:02:27.400> tail<00:02:27.579> would<00:02:27.790> look

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
whether like a raccoon tail would look

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.640 
whether like a raccoon tail would look
like<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.989> would<00:02:29.109> probably<00:02:29.139> look<00:02:29.409> kind

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
like on it it would probably look kind

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.399 
like on it it would probably look kind
of<00:02:29.680> similar<00:02:29.859> but<00:02:30.189> it<00:02:30.280> looked<00:02:30.459> really<00:02:30.519> cool<00:02:30.819> and

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
of similar but it looked really cool and

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.640 
of similar but it looked really cool and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
I think justing this one and making it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.009 
I think justing this one and making it
colorful<00:02:35.950> would<00:02:36.909> be<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> great<00:02:37.329> experience
