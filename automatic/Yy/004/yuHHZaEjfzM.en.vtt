00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 hello my name is cycero your biology teacher is the seven months 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.009
 what more about gene frequency and frequency imaging than populations 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.419
 if by chance 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.709
 striking to be the following problem 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.810
 paul kosgei dominant in this case 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.369
 the frequency of the German is paulo and the protection of zaga we go forces of the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 hamas in gaza because it's a sock two just for you tell me who 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.550
 that the agency sid 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.579
 so let's say that today's frequency does not 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.300
 and served at 8 70% 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.090
 and the frequency was 2 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.950
 is that it served 2 or 20% 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.890
 with these attentive frequencies I can tell which of the two genes is today 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 dominant 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.270
 probably some instant of the light pension I can say that today dominant 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.670
 and German 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.980
 because it gets you to the frequency of 10 80% 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.040
 neglecting the rooster's frequency does not indicate dominance 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.340
 a value can be important if they appear less frequent at the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.260
 population 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.350
 with for example 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.710
 polished gilda typify spaghetti from where no longer on the feet and hands 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 today as the dominant image but despite being a dominant day to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.500
 low frequency of polydactyly is frequency of the ginga 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.600
 polydactyly in populations is very low 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.630
 so it has nothing to do with the fact that you are anointed anointed to appear in a 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.800
 frequency 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.770
 so what is going to decide the German said the allele to 2 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 is today dominant 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420
 we need to look 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.950
 for phenotypic expression two years later 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.780
 depending on the phenotype of the face that is the width of 2, we will tell which of the two 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.600
 two organs is the dominant 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.250
 imagine with me there 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.440
 there is a phenotype determined by the way 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.710
 there is a ferry boat determined by the vendors 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.680
 if by chance the heterosexual 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.400
 I'm going to mark here one of them give blow if it is to bring good I had the occasion 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.180
 determined by the judge to 1 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.719
 then this means that the target is the dominant one 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.990
 in the south it's just holes 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.570
 to present 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.570
 the phenotype 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.899
 therefore it is a consequence of this 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.829
 is that the foot album 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.449
 dominant 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.929
 if by chance 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:25.299
 the floor where all to three games was determined by the judge to 2 desire to 2 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.970
 was the determinant of the final fanatic of the other transdev 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.199
 then to two events 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:35.819
 so watch out you do not confuse frequency with the dominant gem has nothing 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.620
 to see one thing with the other 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.739
 of course you might even be a bit annoying many times during the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.929
 lecture frequently 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.339
 but even this does not necessarily happen 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.029
 next time I have a little more 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:47.609
 We just do little more for the way she
