at the moment it's on an alkaloid base

at the moment it's on an alkaloid base
wash<00:00:07.490> and<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.610> tend<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> 50/50<00:00:10.139> mix<00:00:10.380> you

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
know half the week we'll do the alkaloid

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.289 
know half the week we'll do the alkaloid
the<00:00:14.190> other<00:00:14.340> half<00:00:14.549> will<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> acid

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
the other half will do the acid

days they go in the roof and bogie and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.100 
days they go in the roof and bogie and
the<00:00:48.110> roofs<00:00:48.800> washed<00:00:49.250> with<00:00:50.059> an<00:00:50.180> acid<00:00:50.510> compound

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
the roofs washed with an acid compound

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.200 
the roofs washed with an acid compound
to<00:00:51.350> keep<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.710> shiny<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:55.280> pan<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.670> all<00:00:55.760> down<00:00:55.940> and

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
to keep it shiny we pan it all down and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.479 
to keep it shiny we pan it all down and
we<00:00:56.269> can<00:00:56.390> isolate<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.900> road<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:58.070> then<00:00:58.220> we<00:00:58.309> just

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
we can isolate the road and then we just

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.420 
we can isolate the road and then we just
spray<00:00:58.820> like<00:00:59.089> a<00:00:59.119> gel<00:00:59.449> force<00:00:59.750> on<00:01:00.229> top<00:01:00.470> and<00:01:01.280> then

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
spray like a gel force on top and then

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.100 
spray like a gel force on top and then
rinse<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.820> off<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.030> water<00:01:02.239> basically<00:01:02.629> ounces

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
rinse it off the water basically ounces

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.679 
rinse it off the water basically ounces
activated<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.699> we<00:01:04.760> have<00:01:04.850> full<00:01:05.059> access<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
activated so we have full access to the

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.090 
activated so we have full access to the
roof<00:01:05.869> once<00:01:06.170> they're<00:01:06.320> all<00:01:06.439> powered<00:01:06.799> down

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.740 

you'll<00:01:10.100> see<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.549> shade<00:01:10.760> out<00:01:10.939> well<00:01:11.540> how<00:01:11.689> we

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
beginning we used to have tracking

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
beginning we used to have tracking
problems<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.390> we've<00:01:25.110> spread<00:01:25.320> some<00:01:25.650> cool<00:01:26.070> down

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
problems but we've spread some cool down

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.210 
problems but we've spread some cool down
in<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.970> paste<00:01:27.510> on<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.470> insulators<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.010> now

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
in for paste on the insulators and now

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.930 
in for paste on the insulators and now
we<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.760> don't<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.090> any<00:01:30.180> tracking<00:01:33.500> yeah

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
we go we don't get any tracking yeah

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.180 
we go we don't get any tracking yeah
it's<00:01:35.940> just<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.270> gem<00:01:36.600> heist<00:01:36.930> yeah<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.979> just
