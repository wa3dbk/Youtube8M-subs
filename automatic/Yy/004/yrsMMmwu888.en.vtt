00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.970
 Welcome to Ahmed's Kitchen, and today we make a puff pastry with spinach and soft cheese 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.849
 We need you: 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.730
 200g spinach 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.709
 150g soft cheese 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.709
 Thyme, white pepper, sweet peppers and a little salt, because cheese is already soft 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.360
 It was in the salt position in it 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.750
 Let us start 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.870
 I've already cut thin spinach and washed it 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.870
 We cut the rest there and still 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.230
 Cheese is soft for 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 I make a small hand 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.679
 pepper 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.170
 Thyme 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.530
 sweet spicy 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.270
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.689
 Turns everything upside down 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.689
 A little pure olive oil 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.520
 Then tastes better 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.799
 And a fuss 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.799
 And no 50g cheese with (previously added) 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.020
 sensation 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 We have 150g cheese, spinach and 200g 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.820
 Ok, now that we left a rest for 5 minutes then I kept going 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 I have now rolled pastries which I now participate in 5 parts 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 I cut so far, 1,2,3,4 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.510
 And completely isolated 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.870
 Through the Center 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.870
 Finished, protein now comes on the edge 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.819
 one more time 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.689
 ready 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.299
 Fill it out 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.170
 Centrally 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.780
 the side 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.780
 And 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.510
 Higher 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.760
 Press the sides of it 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.219
 Which we must adhere to 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.849
 The next day 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.620
 I can take already gone 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.620
 Here 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.659
 And click everywhere with a fork on it 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 In the oven at 200 Â° C for 10-15 minutes strictly 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.460
 We get it from the oven, ok 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.430
 If you like you can also make yolk before that, I now have Don 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.789
 made 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.789
 We do it on a plate 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.630
 So you can serve them 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.179
 I wish you good appetite with a puff pastry, so next time, Ahmed, goodbye 

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:10.429
 :)
