hey what's up guys so I'm doing the
paddy<00:00:03.510> elearning<00:00:04.319> right<00:00:04.980> now<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.400> I'm<00:00:05.850> at<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
paddy elearning right now and I'm at the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.360 
paddy elearning right now and I'm at the
dive<00:00:06.660> table<00:00:06.990> section<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.950> dive<00:00:08.130> table

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
dive table section the dive table

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.370 
dive table section the dive table
construction<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.849> pretty<00:00:09.059> good<00:00:09.290> except<00:00:10.290> it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
construction is pretty good except it

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.499 
construction is pretty good except it
could<00:00:10.500> be<00:00:10.559> more<00:00:10.710> intuitive<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.280> think<00:00:11.519> there's

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
could be more intuitive I think there's

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.150 
could be more intuitive I think there's
a<00:00:12.570> great<00:00:12.900> YouTube<00:00:13.290> video<00:00:13.559> that's<00:00:13.769> explaining

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
a great YouTube video that's explaining

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.570 
a great YouTube video that's explaining
that<00:00:14.730> kind<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> walk<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:15.299> wonderful<00:00:15.660> problem

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
that kind of walk for wonderful problem

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.070 
that kind of walk for wonderful problem
except<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> done<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> meter<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
except this is done in a meter so I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.720 
except this is done in a meter so I
thought<00:00:19.260> it'd<00:00:19.350> be<00:00:19.380> nice<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.920> version

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
thought it'd be nice to have a version

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.599 
thought it'd be nice to have a version
and<00:00:20.939> feet<00:00:21.090> as<00:00:21.270> well<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.980> quickly

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and feet as well so really quickly

and feet as well so really quickly
asking<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.180> more<00:00:24.330> question<00:00:24.480> I'll<00:00:24.840> put

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
asking for one more question I'll put

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.679 
asking for one more question I'll put
them<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.250> question<00:00:26.519> down<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:27.029> in

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
them out put the question down into in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.200 
them out put the question down into in
the<00:00:27.869> description<00:00:28.760> but<00:00:29.760> basically<00:00:30.000> the

50 feet right here okay and then you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.119 
50 feet right here okay and then you
want<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> work<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:00.809> way<00:01:00.899> down<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.410> find<00:01:01.620> 23

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
want to work your way down to find 23

want to work your way down to find 23
minutes<00:01:03.199> 23<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> table<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
minutes 23 is not on the table so you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.960 
minutes 23 is not on the table so you
want<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.720> highest<00:01:07.590> number

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
want to go to for the highest number

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.450 
want to go to for the highest number
next<00:01:08.970> highest<00:01:09.150> number<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.200> F

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
next highest number which put you in F

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.890 
next highest number which put you in F
now<00:01:11.460> once<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> work

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
now once you have this you want to work

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.740 
now once you have this you want to work
your<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.200> across<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.710> table<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:15.090> find<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
your way across the table to find the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.350 
your way across the table to find the
service<00:01:16.560> interval<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.060> service

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
service interval that you be on service

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.289 
service interval that you be on service
and<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.830> half<00:01:20.009> okay<00:01:20.570> it's<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.750> here

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
and a half okay it's right here

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.899 
and a half okay it's right here
so<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> once<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.229> find<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so you once you find it you go down the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.690 
so you once you find it you go down the
column<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.650> you'll<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.979> after<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
column and you'll see that after the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
column and you'll see that after the
break<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.290> fall<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.380> pressure<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:32.240> okay<00:01:33.680> now

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
break you fall in pressure be okay now

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.840 
break you fall in pressure be okay now
for<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> second<00:01:35.100> part<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> question<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
for the second part of the question you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.249 
for the second part of the question you
flip<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.689> over<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:38.659> start<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.780> from<00:01:39.930> pressure

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
flip it over you start out from pressure

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.950 
flip it over you start out from pressure
group<00:01:40.470> B<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.860> you'll<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.790> diving<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.299> depth<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
group B and you'll be diving at depth of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.230 
group B and you'll be diving at depth of
35<00:01:43.590> right<00:01:44.329> an<00:01:46.040> intersection<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.460> two

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
35 right an intersection you have two

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.780 
35 right an intersection you have two
numbers<00:01:48.509> 19<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> 186<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.399> number<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
numbers 19 and 186 the number you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.450 
numbers 19 and 186 the number you
concerning<00:01:51.119> right<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.590> it's<00:01:52.590> 19<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.399> is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
concerning right now it's 19 this is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
concerning right now it's 19 this is
that<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.909> portion<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.509> key<00:01:54.960> right

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that this portion is actually key right

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
that this portion is actually key right
here<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:56.130> actually<00:01:56.460> got<00:01:56.549> me<00:01:56.640> tripped<00:01:56.850> up

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
here this actually got me tripped up

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.969 
here this actually got me tripped up
fold<00:01:57.780> quite<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> while<00:01:58.229> until<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.500> figure<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> out

fold quite a while until I figure it out
so<00:01:59.850> what<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.540> remembers

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so what you want to do is like remembers

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.980 
so what you want to do is like remembers
number<00:02:01.259> 19<00:02:01.670> all<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.420> flip<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.869> back

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
number 19 all right now you flip it back

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.249 
number 19 all right now you flip it back
over<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:06.409> let's<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:09.360> second<00:02:09.750> dive<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
over and let's see the second dive you

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.330 
over and let's see the second dive you
be<00:02:10.410> at<00:02:10.649> 35<00:02:11.190> 35<00:02:11.700> feet<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.239> 46<00:02:12.660> minutes

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
be at 35 35 feet for 46 minutes

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.059 
be at 35 35 feet for 46 minutes
now<00:02:13.910> instead<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.690> just<00:02:14.780> looking<00:02:15.080> 46<00:02:15.650> you

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
now instead of just looking 46 you

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.500 
now instead of just looking 46 you
actually<00:02:16.310> want<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.520> add<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.760> previous<00:02:17.270> number

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
actually want to add the previous number

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.380 
actually want to add the previous number
19<00:02:17.930> that's<00:02:18.319> an<00:02:18.410> amount<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:19.000> nitrogen<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.180> got

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
19 that's an amount of nitrogen you got

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.290 
19 that's an amount of nitrogen you got
left<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:20.959> body<00:02:21.080> at<00:02:21.349> 19<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.280> 46<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
left in your body at 19 to the 46 and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.100 
left in your body at 19 to the 46 and
you<00:02:23.480> get<00:02:23.660> 65<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.250> want<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.459> do<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
you get 65 so what you want to do is you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.830 
you get 65 so what you want to do is you
want<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.349> go<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> 35<00:02:27.830> feet<00:02:27.980> right<00:02:28.430> here<00:02:28.840> first

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
want to go to 35 feet right here first

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.759 
want to go to 35 feet right here first
column<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.349> look<00:02:31.160> for<00:02:31.310> 65<00:02:32.380> 65<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.500> now<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
column and look for 65 65 is now in the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.960 
column and look for 65 65 is now in the
table<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.220> pump<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.550> up<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.790> next

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
table so you pump it up to the next

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.030 
table so you pump it up to the next
number<00:02:35.390> next<00:02:36.019> highest<00:02:36.230> group<00:02:36.470> which<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:36.860> group

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
number next highest group which is group

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.559 
number next highest group which is group
air<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.489> that's<00:02:37.970> your<00:02:38.090> answer

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
air and that's your answer

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.559 
air and that's your answer
upon<00:02:39.050> surfacing<00:02:40.030> your<00:02:41.030> pressure<00:02:41.209> group<00:02:41.420> will

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
upon surfacing your pressure group will

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.710 
upon surfacing your pressure group will
actually<00:02:41.780> be<00:02:41.870> M<00:02:42.550> due<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.880> build-up<00:02:44.390> from

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
actually be M due to the build-up from

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.710 
actually be M due to the build-up from
the<00:02:44.810> previous<00:02:45.140> dive<00:02:45.319> as<00:02:45.470> well<00:02:45.650> all<00:02:46.370> right<00:02:46.720> any

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the previous dive as well all right any

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.170 
the previous dive as well all right any
question<00:02:48.049> going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.560> ask<00:02:48.680> I'm<00:02:49.670> super<00:02:49.940> new<00:02:50.030> to
