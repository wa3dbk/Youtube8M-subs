played by Aaron Eckhart which of course

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
played by Aaron Eckhart which of course
differs<00:00:12.389> from<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.719> two-faced<00:00:13.170> which<00:00:13.410> is

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
differs from the two-faced which is

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.779 
differs from the two-faced which is
manufactured<00:00:14.630> as<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.870> see<00:00:16.080> there<00:00:16.289> are

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
manufactured as you can see there are

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.609 
manufactured as you can see there are
notable<00:00:17.789> differences<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:19.050> example<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
notable differences for example the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.950 
notable differences for example the
torso<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:21.109> black<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.380> red<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.189> obviously

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
torso are black and red to obviously

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
torso are black and red to obviously
look<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.010> did<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> film<00:00:26.670> when

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
look just as they did in the film when

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.429 
look just as they did in the film when
he<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.510> burnt<00:00:27.859> also<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> face<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.609> more<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
he was burnt also the face is more of a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.880 
he was burnt also the face is more of a
sort<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.529> an<00:00:31.619> orangey<00:00:32.540> color<00:00:33.590> if<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> look<00:00:34.800> at

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
sort of an orangey color if you look at

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.110 
sort of an orangey color if you look at
the<00:00:34.980> side<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> his<00:00:35.460> head<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> lot<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the side of his head there's a lot of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.090 
the side of his head there's a lot of
detail<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.530> wounds<00:00:37.739> which<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:39.000> course

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
detail on the wounds which of course

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.060 
detail on the wounds which of course
does<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.270> did<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> film<00:00:43.070> but

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
does look just as it did in the film but

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.830 
does look just as it did in the film but
of<00:00:44.160> course<00:00:44.370> no<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:44.610> faces<00:00:44.940> complete<00:00:45.510> without

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
of course no two faces complete without

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
of course no two faces complete without
his<00:00:45.899> revolver<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.239> lucky<00:00:48.239> coin<00:00:48.710> which<00:00:49.710> was

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
his revolver and lucky coin which was

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.540 
his revolver and lucky coin which was
obviously<00:00:49.980> included<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> set<00:00:52.550> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
obviously included in this set the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.510 
obviously included in this set the
hairpiece<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.120> believe<00:00:54.360> comes<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
hairpiece I believe comes from the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.939 
hairpiece I believe comes from the
Gilderoy<00:00:56.520> Lockhart<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.300> Harry<00:00:57.480> Potter

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
Gilderoy Lockhart from Harry Potter

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.160 
Gilderoy Lockhart from Harry Potter
which<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.180> blonde<00:01:00.440> quiff<00:01:01.489> type<00:01:02.489> hair<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
which is a blonde quiff type hair so it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780 
which is a blonde quiff type hair so it
looks<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.799> eerie<00:01:04.979> did<00:01:05.189> when<00:01:05.430> he<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
looks just as eerie did when he was in

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.859 
looks just as eerie did when he was in
the<00:01:05.909> film<00:01:07.430> yeah<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.510> well

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the film yeah I think it's a very well

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
the film yeah I think it's a very well
designed<00:01:10.140> figure<00:01:10.799> obviously<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> bought<00:01:11.880> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
designed figure obviously I bought this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.480 
designed figure obviously I bought this
off<00:01:12.180> eBay<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:13.049> around<00:01:13.290> almost<00:01:14.040> 30<00:01:14.250> pounds

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
off eBay for around almost 30 pounds

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
off eBay for around almost 30 pounds
with<00:01:14.820> postage<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.400> good

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
with postage which is I think a good

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
with postage which is I think a good
price<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.630> mean<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.500> could<00:01:19.710> be

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
price for what it is I mean it could be

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.200 
price for what it is I mean it could be
very<00:01:19.920> expensive<00:01:20.040> buy<00:01:20.520> things<00:01:20.759> quite<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> good

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
very expensive buy things quite a good

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.649 
very expensive buy things quite a good
price<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:23.189> design<00:01:23.790> goes<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.390> way<00:01:24.509> for

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
price the design goes right way for

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.219 
price the design goes right way for
round<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> torso<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.100> leg<00:01:26.689> also<00:01:27.689> all

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
round from the torso to the leg also all

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.060 
round from the torso to the leg also all
on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> longest<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:31.070> which

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
on the longest side as you can see which

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.560 
on the longest side as you can see which
of<00:01:32.100> course<00:01:32.220> now<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> hard<00:01:32.970> thing<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.420> when

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of course now is a hard thing to do when

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.350 
of course now is a hard thing to do when
it<00:01:33.689> comes<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.930> putting<00:01:34.020> decals<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> legs<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
it comes to putting decals on the legs I

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.069 
it comes to putting decals on the legs I
mean<00:01:36.360> obviously<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.619> half<00:01:37.939> of<00:01:38.939> his<00:01:39.000> head<00:01:39.420> or

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
mean obviously the half of his head or

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.889 
mean obviously the half of his head or
half<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.470> his<00:01:40.619> body<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.009> decal<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.689> why

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
half of his body is decal which is why

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.249 
half of his body is decal which is why
you<00:01:43.500> cannot<00:01:43.799> move<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.549> right<00:01:44.939> leg<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:46.110> can

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you cannot move this right leg you can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.920 
you cannot move this right leg you can
only<00:01:46.380> move<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> left<00:01:48.320> not<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> right

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
only move the left not the right

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.440 
only move the left not the right
yeah<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> very<00:01:52.860> well<00:01:53.040> designed

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
yeah I think it's a very well designed

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.469 
yeah I think it's a very well designed
figure<00:01:54.450> especially<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.170> facial<00:01:55.380> features

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
figure especially in the facial features

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.410 
figure especially in the facial features
like<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:58.040> teeth<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
like the teeth and if you can see that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
like the teeth and if you can see that
but<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:02.399> only<00:02:02.520> thing<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.700> would<00:02:02.759> say<00:02:02.850> about

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
but the only thing I would say about

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.679 
but the only thing I would say about
this<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.780> suit<00:02:04.200> isn't<00:02:05.060> as<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
this is the suit isn't as it was in the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.850 
this is the suit isn't as it was in the
film<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.140> looks<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.590> though<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
film it looks as though it's a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.309 
film it looks as though it's a
double-breasted<00:02:08.250> design<00:02:08.940> which<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.080> know<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
double-breasted design which you know is

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.320 
double-breasted design which you know is
still<00:02:11.129> quite<00:02:11.370> good<00:02:11.400> when<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.970> look<00:02:12.120> at<00:02:12.239> the
