00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.890 
right now
okay<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:24.400> now<00:04:24.699> we've<00:04:24.849> entered<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:25.360> in<00:04:25.570> and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
okay so now we've entered this in and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.650 
okay so now we've entered this in and
let's<00:04:26.289> specify<00:04:26.639> how<00:04:27.639> long<00:04:27.699> the<00:04:28.210> duration<00:04:28.300> of

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
let's specify how long the duration of

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.939 
let's specify how long the duration of
each<00:04:28.750> image<00:04:29.020> is<00:04:29.199> before<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.530> switch<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.830> the

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
each image is before I switch to the

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:30.540 
each image is before I switch to the
next<00:04:30.039> one

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
next one

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.810 
next one
in<00:04:30.669> JavaScript<00:04:31.360> it's<00:04:31.599> done<00:04:31.780> by<00:04:31.960> milliseconds

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
in JavaScript it's done by milliseconds

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.730 
in JavaScript it's done by milliseconds
2000<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:33.970> basically<00:04:34.720> two<00:04:34.930> seconds<00:04:35.470> so<00:04:35.590> if<00:04:35.680> you

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
2000 is basically two seconds so if you

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.469 
2000 is basically two seconds so if you
want<00:04:35.889> to<00:04:35.949> change<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.280> 4<00:04:36.490> second<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.120> simply

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
want to change the 4 second to simply

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.890 
want to change the 4 second to simply
under<00:04:37.720> 4,000<00:04:38.349> and<00:04:38.860> now<00:04:39.070> we<00:04:39.130> save<00:04:40.120> this<00:04:40.300> as<00:04:40.570> our

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
under 4,000 and now we save this as our

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.290 
under 4,000 and now we save this as our
index<00:04:41.229> file<00:04:41.440> now<00:04:42.340> we've<00:04:42.520> saved<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:43.000> let's

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
index file now we've saved it let's

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.120 
index file now we've saved it let's
switch<00:04:43.570> back<00:04:43.599> to<00:04:43.840> ensure<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.349> this<00:04:44.650> again<00:04:44.979> is

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
switch back to ensure that this again is

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.469 
switch back to ensure that this again is
the<00:04:45.160> iframe

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.140 

and<00:04:51.629> that's<00:04:52.349> tested<00:04:52.710> would<00:04:53.520> open<00:04:53.759> this<00:04:53.849> up<00:04:53.999> and

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
and that's tested would open this up and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:03.410 
and that's tested would open this up and
crow<00:04:56.479> first<00:04:57.479> you<00:04:57.599> know<00:04:57.749> loading<00:04:58.169> our<00:04:58.919> path

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.300 

just<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.170> see<00:05:04.380> if<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.860> slide<00:05:05.070> she<00:05:05.220> was

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
just to see if this slide she was

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.950 
just to see if this slide she was
working<00:05:05.580> without<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.910> iframe<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:06.840> can

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
working without the iframe and you can

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.240 
working without the iframe and you can
see<00:05:07.140> got<00:05:07.290> it<00:05:07.440> as<00:05:07.560> working<00:05:08.600> we<00:05:09.600> click<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.260> can

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
see got it as working we click it I can

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.420 
see got it as working we click it I can
see<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.850> is<00:05:11.880> opening<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.540> links<00:05:12.810> correct

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430
