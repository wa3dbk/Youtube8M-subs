in terms of propagating it growing it
from<00:00:49.549> seeds<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:50.559> an<00:00:51.559> easy<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.309> good<00:00:52.580> way<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.850> do

from seeds is an easy and good way to do

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.509 
from seeds is an easy and good way to do
it<00:00:53.420> if<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:54.140> take<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:55.299> seed<00:00:56.299> out<00:00:56.570> of<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:57.519> fresh

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
it if you take the seed out of a fresh

it if you take the seed out of a fresh
picked<00:00:59.269> piece<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.110> fruit<00:01:00.519> it<00:01:01.519> will<00:01:02.030> be<00:01:02.150> viable

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
picked piece of fruit it will be viable

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.689 
picked piece of fruit it will be viable
for<00:01:02.690> about<00:01:03.110> two<00:01:03.290> or<00:01:03.320> three<00:01:03.619> days<00:01:03.830> I've<00:01:04.250> read

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
for about two or three days I've read

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.350 
for about two or three days I've read
and<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.409> that<00:01:06.409> proves<00:01:06.619> out<00:01:06.920> in<00:01:07.130> my

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
and that that proves out in my

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.429 
and that that proves out in my
experimentation<00:01:08.360> with<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.659> trying<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:08.960> grow

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
experimentation with it trying to grow

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.530 
experimentation with it trying to grow
and<00:01:09.560> proceed<00:01:09.970> they<00:01:10.970> seem<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.360> sprout<00:01:12.939> with<00:01:13.939> a

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
and proceed they seem to sprout with a

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.969 
and proceed they seem to sprout with a
high<00:01:15.250> high<00:01:16.250> frequency<00:01:17.590> just<00:01:18.590> plant<00:01:18.890> them

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
high high frequency just plant them

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.440 
high high frequency just plant them
about<00:01:19.070> two<00:01:19.340> inches<00:01:19.640> deep<00:01:19.820> in<00:01:20.030> good<00:01:20.210> potting

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
about two inches deep in good potting

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.419 
about two inches deep in good potting
soil<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.200> you'll<00:01:21.590> see<00:01:21.799> a<00:01:21.829> sprout<00:01:22.100> come<00:01:22.310> up

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
soil and you'll see a sprout come up

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.660 
soil and you'll see a sprout come up
within<00:01:22.609> a<00:01:22.759> week<00:01:22.909> or<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.770> then<00:01:24.770> grow<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.579> up

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
within a week or so then grow it up

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.669 
within a week or so then grow it up
until<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:26.179> got<00:01:26.390> woody<00:01:26.689> bark<00:01:27.049> on<00:01:27.289> it<00:01:27.469> that's

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
until it's got woody bark on it that's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.459 
until it's got woody bark on it that's
what<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:27.859> do<00:01:27.979> for<00:01:28.729> about<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> half<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.659> year<00:01:29.899> year

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
what I do for about a half a year year

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.340 
what I do for about a half a year year
and<00:01:31.219> then<00:01:31.490> Transplant<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.210> into<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.140> ground

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
and then Transplant it into the ground

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.429 
and then Transplant it into the ground
keep<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.130> protected<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:35.840> will<00:01:35.960> grow<00:01:36.109> up<00:01:36.289> it

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
keep it protected and it will grow up it

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.130 
keep it protected and it will grow up it
