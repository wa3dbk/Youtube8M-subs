hey<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.760> bone<00:00:03.000> grew<00:00:03.210> from<00:00:03.510> polycount

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hey this is bone grew from polycount

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.360 
hey this is bone grew from polycount
and<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.950> wanted<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.250> do<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> quick<00:00:05.609> tutorial<00:00:07.370> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
and I wanted to do a quick tutorial to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.500 
and I wanted to do a quick tutorial to
share<00:00:08.550> something<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.970> learned<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.450> my

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
share something that I learned on my

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.829 
share something that I learned on my
last<00:00:09.840> project<00:00:11.450> here<00:00:13.190> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.089> thing<00:00:15.480> it

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
last project here this is the thing it

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.599 
last project here this is the thing it
wasn't<00:00:16.379> done<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> movie<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.190> done<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
wasn't done for the movie was done for a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.720 
wasn't done for the movie was done for a
game<00:00:17.910> tie-in<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> had<00:00:20.039> access<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
game tie-in but I had access to the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.620 
game tie-in but I had access to the
reference<00:00:21.150> material<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.170> movie<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.630> so

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
reference material for the movie and so

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.290 
reference material for the movie and so
there<00:00:25.140> was<00:00:25.230> some<00:00:25.760> some<00:00:26.760> things<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.029> learned

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
there was some some things I learned

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.779 
there was some some things I learned
when<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.750> trying<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> find<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
when I was trying to find a way to

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.290 
when I was trying to find a way to
create<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> shapes<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.390> needed<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:32.149> you<00:00:33.149> can

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
create the shapes I needed to you can

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.340 
create the shapes I needed to you can
notice<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.840> these<00:00:34.260> little<00:00:35.780> design<00:00:36.780> elements

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
notice all these little design elements

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.310 
notice all these little design elements
almost<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:39.260> tendons<00:00:40.260> or<00:00:40.820> like<00:00:41.899> some<00:00:42.899> areas<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
almost or tendons or like some areas it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.040 
almost or tendons or like some areas it
looked<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.829> stretched<00:00:44.629> skin<00:00:45.629> are

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
looked kind of like stretched skin are

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.970 
looked kind of like stretched skin are
just<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:47.450> really<00:00:48.950> gnarly<00:00:50.870> interwoven

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
just really really gnarly interwoven

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.479 
just really really gnarly interwoven
line<00:00:52.980> pattern<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.870> way<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> found<00:00:58.260> out<00:00:58.489> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
line pattern and the way I found out to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
line pattern and the way I found out to
do<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> way<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> came<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
do it or just the way I came up with to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.920 
do it or just the way I came up with to
do<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> planar<00:01:02.820> line<00:01:03.149> tool<00:01:03.449> so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
do it is with the planar line tool so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.859 
do it is with the planar line tool so
I'm<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.619> show<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> guys<00:01:05.010> how<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> can

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
I'm going to show you guys how you can

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.490 
I'm going to show you guys how you can
use<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.070 

so<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.730> biggest<00:01:12.970> thing<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.900> don't

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
so the biggest thing is that you don't

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.580 
so the biggest thing is that you don't
want<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.720> don't<00:01:16.780> want<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.050> do<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:17.290> at<00:01:17.560> a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
want to you don't want to do this at a

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.850 
want to you don't want to do this at a
low<00:01:17.950> subdivision<00:01:18.880> level<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.560> want<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.770> make

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
low subdivision level you want to make

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.860 
low subdivision level you want to make
sure<00:01:21.010> you're<00:01:21.340> at<00:01:21.520> your<00:01:21.670> detailing<00:01:22.060> phase<00:01:22.360> and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
sure you're at your detailing phase and

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.600 
sure you're at your detailing phase and
you're<00:01:23.140> at<00:01:23.320> basically<00:01:24.070> max<00:01:24.400> poly<00:01:24.910> count<00:01:26.610> wow

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
you're at basically max poly count wow

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.490 
you're at basically max poly count wow
we<00:01:28.090> really<00:01:28.360> aren't<00:01:28.510> max<00:01:28.720> or<00:01:28.930> month<00:01:29.110> we<00:01:29.230> go<00:01:29.320> down

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
we really aren't max or month we go down

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.960 
we really aren't max or month we go down
one<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.790> let's<00:01:34.690> say<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.670> going<00:01:36.940> to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
one so let's say I'm just going to

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:48.170 
one so let's say I'm just going to
really<00:01:37.660> quickly<00:01:37.990> sketch<00:01:38.500> in<00:01:38.710> some<00:01:38.920> forms

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.390 

some<00:01:48.750> big<00:01:48.960> gashes<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.770> you've<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:50.100> maybe

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
some big gashes and you've got maybe

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.330 
some big gashes and you've got maybe
this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.680> muscles<00:01:54.500> or<00:01:56.030> anything<00:01:57.030> really

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
this is like muscles or anything really

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.540 
this is like muscles or anything really
and<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.930> want<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:02.070> want<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
and you want to you want to kind of

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.280 
and you want to you want to kind of
create<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.750> lines<00:02:04.670> going<00:02:05.670> through<00:02:05.820> here

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
create little lines going through here

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
create little lines going through here
and<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.369> were<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.820> with<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.240> a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and if you were to do that with just a

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.380 
and if you were to do that with just a
normal<00:02:10.020> standard<00:02:10.350> brush<00:02:12.500> no<00:02:17.120> not<00:02:18.120> gonna<00:02:18.270> work

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
normal standard brush no not gonna work

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.730 
normal standard brush no not gonna work
because<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.350> North<00:02:19.560> normals<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.430> too

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
because it's the North normals are too

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.780 
because it's the North normals are too
that<00:02:22.740> are<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:22.950> too<00:02:23.130> packed<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.670> there<00:02:25.790> so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that are just too packed in there so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.010 
that are just too packed in there so
what<00:02:27.380> do<00:02:28.380> go<00:02:28.860> down<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:30.360> your<00:02:30.510> plane<00:02:30.810> our

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
what do go down here to your plane our

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.480 
what do go down here to your plane our
line<00:02:31.290> brush<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:33.420> guy<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.350> either

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
line brush and this guy you can either

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.430 
line brush and this guy you can either
go<00:02:38.490> with<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.670> default<00:02:39.120> alpha<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:40.820> use<00:02:42.260> use<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
go with the default alpha or use use the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.230 
go with the default alpha or use use the
alpha<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.920> has<00:02:44.070> more<00:02:44.340> than<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:45.740> sort<00:02:46.740> of

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
alpha that has more than one sort of

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.120 
alpha that has more than one sort of
island<00:02:51.170> yeah<00:02:52.170> there's<00:02:52.440> there's<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.980> first

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
island yeah there's there's the first

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.570 
island yeah there's there's the first
thing<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.430> talk<00:02:53.580> about<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.590> need<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.890> use<00:02:56.250> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
thing to talk about so you need to use a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.050 
thing to talk about so you need to use a
big<00:02:57.480> draw<00:02:57.720> size<00:02:58.670> bigger<00:02:59.670> than<00:02:59.760> you're<00:03:00.000> gonna

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
big draw size bigger than you're gonna

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.790 
big draw size bigger than you're gonna
think<00:03:00.330> because<00:03:01.970> it's<00:03:02.970> going<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.180> be<00:03:03.800> affected

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
think because it's going to be affected

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.020 
think because it's going to be affected
by<00:03:04.830> your<00:03:04.950> drop<00:03:05.250> size<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:05.970> to

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
by your drop size it's not going to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.910 
by your drop size it's not going to
affect<00:03:06.390> anything<00:03:06.720> down<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.530> little<00:03:07.650> hole

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
affect anything down in that little hole

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.540 
affect anything down in that little hole
if<00:03:08.220> your<00:03:08.340> draw<00:03:08.520> size<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.970> too<00:03:09.090> small

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.940 

so<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.660> gets<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.260> have<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.470> use<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.710> big

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
so if it gets if you have to use a big

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.910 
so if it gets if you have to use a big
draw<00:03:17.100> size<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.610> wanna<00:03:17.730> have<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.910> small

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
draw size but you wanna have a small

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.280 
draw size but you wanna have a small
line<00:03:19.920> then<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.880> use<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> small<00:03:21.300> alpha<00:03:21.510> pretty

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
line then just use a small alpha pretty

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.320 
line then just use a small alpha pretty
simple<00:03:22.560> all<00:03:22.680> right<00:03:23.450> yeah<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:26.090> move<00:03:27.090> your

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
simple all right yeah you just move your

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.050 
simple all right yeah you just move your
line<00:03:27.870> over<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.920> other<00:03:29.010> side<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.550> the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
line over to the other side of the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.680 
line over to the other side of the
crease<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.020> then<00:03:31.980> fold<00:03:32.880> out<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.510> go<00:03:34.350> back

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
crease and then fold out and go back

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.400 
crease and then fold out and go back
okay<00:03:38.390> so<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:41.430> can<00:03:41.610> do<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.960> your<00:03:43.140> heart's

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
okay so you can do that to your heart's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.250 
okay so you can do that to your heart's
content<00:03:43.710> and<00:03:44.420> it's<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.450> pretty<00:03:45.630> easy<00:03:45.930> way<00:03:46.200> to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
content and it's a pretty easy way to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.830 
content and it's a pretty easy way to
just<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> good-looking<00:03:47.610> kind<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:51.630> can

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
just get a good-looking kind of it can

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.390 
just get a good-looking kind of it can
you<00:03:52.020> can<00:03:52.080> either<00:03:52.350> look<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:52.620> stretched<00:03:53.040> skin

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
you can either look like stretched skin

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.290 
you can either look like stretched skin
or<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:53.940> case<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.330> looks<00:03:54.420> more<00:03:54.660> like

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
or in this case it looks more like

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.500 
or in this case it looks more like
knitted<00:03:57.300> bone<00:03:57.650> tell<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.830> same<00:03:59.360> but<00:04:00.360> it's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
knitted bone tell the same but it's

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.330 
knitted bone tell the same but it's
definitely<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.990> more<00:04:01.350> abstract<00:04:01.500> kind<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.160> shape

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
definitely a more abstract kind of shape

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.530 
definitely a more abstract kind of shape
so<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:02.850> not<00:04:03.890> it's<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:05.010> like<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.550> is<00:04:05.730> how

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
so it's not it's not like this is how

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.740 
so it's not it's not like this is how
you<00:04:06.570> create<00:04:06.990> realistic<00:04:07.380> form<00:04:07.830> but<00:04:08.750> there's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
you create realistic form but there's

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.500 
you create realistic form but there's
how<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:09.990> would<00:04:10.820> go<00:04:11.820> about<00:04:11.850> maybe<00:04:12.420> doing

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
how you would go about maybe doing

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
how you would go about maybe doing
something<00:04:13.080> with<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.230> larger<00:04:14.190> number<00:04:14.370> of

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
something with a larger number of

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.830 
something with a larger number of
individual<00:04:16.530> fibers<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.130> then<00:04:17.280> alpha<00:04:18.120> 58<00:04:18.510> is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
individual fibers and then alpha 58 is

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.810 
individual fibers and then alpha 58 is
sort<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:20.959> farthest<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.740> then<00:04:23.610> yeah<00:04:23.760> you

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
sort of the farthest and then yeah you

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.790 
sort of the farthest and then yeah you
do<00:04:24.060> get<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.420> a<00:04:24.450> lot<00:04:26.750> deal<00:04:27.750> with<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.050> or<00:04:28.230> you

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
do get this a lot deal with it or you

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.850 
do get this a lot deal with it or you
can<00:04:28.950> also<00:04:29.100> mask<00:04:29.550> off<00:04:30.860> your<00:04:31.860> hole<00:04:32.040> beforehand

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
can also mask off your hole beforehand

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:41.909 
can also mask off your hole beforehand
invert<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:36.510> then<00:04:37.190> look<00:04:38.190> at<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.750> super<00:04:39.750> quick

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
invert and then look at that super quick

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.700 
invert and then look at that super quick
so<00:04:42.460> yeah<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.999> wanted<00:04:43.569> you<00:04:43.659> to<00:04:43.749> also<00:04:44.050> show<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.530> mean

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
so yeah I wanted you to also show I mean

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.520 
so yeah I wanted you to also show I mean
obviously<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:46.270> can<00:04:46.449> smooth<00:04:46.659> it<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.349> looks

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
obviously you can smooth it and it looks

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.559 
obviously you can smooth it and it looks
more<00:04:48.009> like<00:04:48.189> skin<00:04:48.610> yeah

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
more like skin yeah

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.800 
more like skin yeah
see<00:04:49.870> this<00:04:50.020> is<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.259> more<00:04:51.150> boney<00:04:52.150> but<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:52.599> looks

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
see this is a more boney but this looks

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.749 
see this is a more boney but this looks
like<00:04:52.930> there's<00:04:53.379> tendons<00:04:54.189> going<00:04:54.490> through<00:04:54.610> the

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
like there's tendons going through the

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:00.559 
like there's tendons going through the
skin<00:04:54.969> here<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:58.080> basically<00:04:59.080> it

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
skin here so that is basically it

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.790 
skin here so that is basically it
there's<00:05:01.569> also<00:05:01.719> something<00:05:01.990> else<00:05:02.199> that<00:05:02.319> I<00:05:02.469> found

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
there's also something else that I found

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.080 
there's also something else that I found
out<00:05:02.949> for<00:05:03.249> if<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.400> really<00:05:03.669> want<00:05:03.849> to<00:05:03.939> do

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
out for if you really want to do

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.899 
out for if you really want to do
compression<00:05:04.990> wrinkles<00:05:05.409> and<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.889> don't<00:05:06.789> want

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
compression wrinkles and you don't want

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.010 
compression wrinkles and you don't want
to<00:05:06.939> waste<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.180> lot<00:05:07.270> of<00:05:07.330> time<00:05:07.419> when<00:05:07.779> I'm<00:05:07.900> just

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
to waste a lot of time when I'm just

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.070 
to waste a lot of time when I'm just
doing<00:05:08.229> sipper<00:05:08.529> quick<00:05:09.419> it's<00:05:10.419> really<00:05:10.810> really

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
doing sipper quick it's really really

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.629 
doing sipper quick it's really really
good<00:05:11.199> for<00:05:11.379> that<00:05:11.469> because<00:05:12.069> you<00:05:12.520> know

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
good for that because you know

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.559 
good for that because you know
compression<00:05:13.120> wrinkles<00:05:13.919> tend<00:05:14.919> to<00:05:15.069> form<00:05:15.340> these

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
compression wrinkles tend to form these

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:22.320 
compression wrinkles tend to form these
sharp<00:05:16.569> lines<00:05:17.340> going<00:05:18.340> through<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:20.909> just<00:05:21.909> a

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
sharp lines going through a just a

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.140 
sharp lines going through a just a
cylindrical<00:05:23.289> surface<00:05:23.830> like<00:05:24.009> this<00:05:24.219> like<00:05:25.000> say

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
cylindrical surface like this like say

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.890 
cylindrical surface like this like say
that's<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.389> pant<00:05:25.629> leg<00:05:25.779> or<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.819> shirt<00:05:30.779> put<00:05:31.779> these

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
that's a pant leg or a shirt put these

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.219 
that's a pant leg or a shirt put these
in<00:05:32.080> here<00:05:32.759> in<00:05:33.759> like<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.029> brick<00:05:34.389> kind<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:34.960> pattern

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
in here in like a brick kind of pattern

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.680 
in here in like a brick kind of pattern
like<00:05:35.740> this

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.010 

but<00:05:42.230> in<00:05:42.440> many<00:05:43.400> as<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.790> want

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.280 

and<00:05:48.020> then<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.830> need<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:49.100> do<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.280> little<00:05:49.520> bit<00:05:49.700> of

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
and then you need to do a little bit of

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:58.210 
and then you need to do a little bit of
massaging<00:05:51.940> I<00:05:54.790> like<00:05:55.790> to<00:05:55.910> just<00:05:56.120> do<00:05:56.870> a<00:05:57.170> quick<00:05:57.380> kind

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
massaging I like to just do a quick kind

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.790 
massaging I like to just do a quick kind
of<00:05:58.870> outline<00:05:59.870> about<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.650> forms<00:06:02.140> with<00:06:03.140> standard

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
of outline about the forms with standard

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.840 
of outline about the forms with standard
brush

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.310 

and<00:06:08.360> then<00:06:08.510> drop<00:06:08.690> down<00:06:08.720> a<00:06:08.900> couple<00:06:09.250> subdivisions

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
and then drop down a couple subdivisions

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:26.310 
and then drop down a couple subdivisions
and<00:06:12.320> just<00:06:12.530> sort<00:06:12.740> of<00:06:12.770> smooth<00:06:12.980> it<00:06:13.070> all<00:06:13.190> out

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.619 

then

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.059 

sometimes<00:06:30.349> it's<00:06:30.529> helpful<00:06:30.679> to<00:06:30.830> rebuild<00:06:31.460> the

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069 
sometimes it's helpful to rebuild the

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:38.829 
sometimes it's helpful to rebuild the
subdivisions<00:06:37.089> and<00:06:38.089> it<00:06:38.209> almost<00:06:38.389> never<00:06:38.569> looks

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:38.839 
subdivisions and it almost never looks

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:40.749 
subdivisions and it almost never looks
perfect<00:06:39.169> but<00:06:39.229> whatever<00:06:39.679> it's<00:06:40.309> super<00:06:40.610> quick

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
perfect but whatever it's super quick

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.149 
perfect but whatever it's super quick
and<00:06:41.629> it's<00:06:41.929> not<00:06:41.959> gonna<00:06:42.139> look<00:06:42.229> perfect

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
and it's not gonna look perfect

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:48.369 
and it's not gonna look perfect
you<00:06:43.459> can<00:06:43.610> get<00:06:43.729> over<00:06:43.759> it<00:06:45.099> and<00:06:46.449> then<00:06:47.449> this<00:06:47.899> is<00:06:48.080> the

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
you can get over it and then this is the

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:52.059 
you can get over it and then this is the
term<00:06:48.919> dynamic<00:06:49.069> rush<00:06:49.490> or<00:06:49.909> just<00:06:50.199> plain<00:06:51.199> our<00:06:51.349> sort

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:52.069 
term dynamic rush or just plain our sort

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:57.279 
term dynamic rush or just plain our sort
of<00:06:53.979> forming<00:06:54.979> these<00:06:55.509> these<00:06:56.509> more<00:06:56.899> tight

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
of forming these these more tight

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.409 
of forming these these more tight
creases<00:06:57.740> instead<00:06:58.369> of<00:06:58.490> the<00:06:59.419> like<00:06:59.569> blobby

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
creases instead of the like blobby

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:06.029 
creases instead of the like blobby
shapes<00:07:02.419> you<00:07:02.629> get<00:07:02.749> with<00:07:02.930> the<00:07:03.020> standard<00:07:03.379> brush

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:08.649 

right<00:07:07.039> now<00:07:07.189> I'm<00:07:07.249> holding<00:07:07.819> out<00:07:07.939> to<00:07:08.180> push<00:07:08.449> out

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659 
right now I'm holding out to push out

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:16.560 
right now I'm holding out to push out
instead<00:07:09.169> of<00:07:09.369> push<00:07:10.369> in

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.940 

and<00:07:17.020> it<00:07:17.890> doesn't<00:07:18.400> look<00:07:18.490> that<00:07:18.520> good<00:07:18.790> but<00:07:19.180> if<00:07:19.570> you

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950 
and it doesn't look that good but if you

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.990 
and it doesn't look that good but if you
if<00:07:20.950> you<00:07:21.040> play<00:07:21.250> with<00:07:21.400> it<00:07:21.430> for<00:07:21.520> a<00:07:21.700> little<00:07:21.910> bit

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
if you play with it for a little bit

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.570 
if you play with it for a little bit
more<00:07:22.180> than<00:07:22.960> I<00:07:23.080> have<00:07:23.260> here<00:07:23.590> you<00:07:24.130> can<00:07:24.160> get<00:07:24.370> it<00:07:24.430> to

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580 
more than I have here you can get it to

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.960 
more than I have here you can get it to
look<00:07:24.640> super<00:07:24.850> clean<00:07:25.210> and<00:07:26.160> then<00:07:29.370> you<00:07:30.370> know<00:07:30.490> after

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970 
look super clean and then you know after

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.830
