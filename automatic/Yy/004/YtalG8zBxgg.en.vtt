00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.500
My name is Max Daneri. I’m a professional bellydancer

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.280
 and teacher.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.380
I’m Argentinian, I live in Buenos Aires City

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.320
I graduated from three schools. First, I studied in Master Amir Thaleb’s school, the Arabian Dance School,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.780
in which I've graduated in 2012

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.560
and In 2014, I graduated from two other schools, the Yamil Annum’s Dance School,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560
where I currently work,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.540
 and Saida’s Dance School.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.820
Well, I think he is a complete dancer and artist.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.140
He captivates the audience with great technique

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.060
 and his freshness...

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.780
He can also change styles in a very easy way,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.020
and that’s important, that’s why I say he is a very complete artist.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.880
I met Max in a very special way,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.680
in a tribute performance for Saida,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.100
and that's when I got to know his real wit.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.280
I'm currently part of Master Yamil Annum's school teaching staff,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.620
I'm in charge of a course and I have the honour to substitute him in the superior courses,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.440
fourth and fifth year, when he is on tour around the world.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.160
I’m lucky he teaches at my school

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.800
I count on him to be my substitute

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.100
when I’m away

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.240
and my students say they’re fascinated with him

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.840
because he is very meticulous with his explanations

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.320
and that’s essential when you are a teacher.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.940
I think classes are fantastic because they offer me the opportunity to teach what I’ve learnt

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.920
and I can share my views on Arabian dance,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.680
that first...

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.880
and secondly they’re great because it's a place

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.880
where I can share what I love, right?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.960
and there is nothing better than sharing love. I see it that way...

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.540
Knowledge is something you acquire and it doesn’t take up much space...

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.100
it’s something you can share forever

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.100
because it’s an endless source within you. 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.960
It’s a gift from life

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.240
and… well, what could be better than to share it with people who love dancing as much as I do.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.900
The body plays an essential role in the dancer’s life;

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.620
it’s the only instrument that we have to experience life. That's why it's important for me to take care of it.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.900
I think Max can contribute his unique style

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.020
 to worldwide bellydance, a different version

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.900
 never seen before.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.240
I think he has a very clear language regarding dancing, something that nowadays

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.800
is not that common. I mean, you can see great things, dynamics…

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.860
but what’s often missing is usually the teaching and I think he is the right person to offer that.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.680
Max is a very adaptable person in many ways;

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.960
both personally and artistically. He is a very happy

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.000
very funny.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.160
He is very open, and expressive

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.240
and you can see that in his dancing. 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.820
What can I offer to the general public?

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.240
My spontaneity, I think.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.980
I think that’s my most valuable asset.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.880
In the technical aspect, I feel completely prepared to lead a class

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.720
And as an artist, I have my purest soul to offer.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.700
Dancing for me is...

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.860
the purest act of love in my life.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.234
When I can’t find a word, an expression, when I can’t find

00:06:37.234 --> 00:06:44.314
a way to express my feelings, my body needs to dance.
