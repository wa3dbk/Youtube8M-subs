00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
we're gonna go to the next position

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:38.150 
we're gonna go to the next position
number<00:01:26.670> four<00:01:26.940> I<00:01:36.290> just<00:01:37.290> imagine<00:01:37.740> having<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.040> good

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
number four I just imagine having a good

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.710 
number four I just imagine having a good
overdrive<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> push<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.300> harder

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
overdrive to push that a little harder

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
overdrive to push that a little harder
if<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.870> gonna<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.980> up<00:01:41.160> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
if you're gonna go for that kind of up a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670 
if you're gonna go for that kind of up a
little<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.240> psychedelic<00:01:42.630> by<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.350> vigor<00:01:43.500> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
little more psychedelic by the vigor of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.470 
little more psychedelic by the vigor of
way<00:01:43.860> beyond<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.160> one<00:01:44.490> I've<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> nice

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
way beyond that one I've got a nice

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.390 
way beyond that one I've got a nice
position<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:46.110> front<00:01:46.410> with<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.620> 59<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.370> a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
position up front with the 59 to get a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.780 
position up front with the 59 to get a
mortgage

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
mortgage

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.100 
mortgage
jazzy<00:01:48.000> time

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.650 

really<00:01:56.650> really<00:01:56.860> breakthrough<00:01:57.280> we<00:01:58.240> actually

really really breakthrough we actually

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.420 
really really breakthrough we actually
have<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> Paul<00:01:59.440> Reid<00:01:59.680> prototype<00:02:00.190> we'll<00:02:00.370> be

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
have a Paul Reid prototype we'll be

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:13.130 
have a Paul Reid prototype we'll be
talking<00:02:00.610> about<00:02:00.790> in<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> minute

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.870 
prototype and up here you can see that
this<00:02:54.550> was<00:02:54.700> used<00:02:54.880> by<00:02:55.120> seth<00:02:55.450> james<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.260> tour<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.850> I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
this was used by seth james on tour so I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.180 
this was used by seth james on tour so I
can<00:02:58.120> just<00:02:58.270> imagine<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:59.020> know<00:02:59.170> he<00:02:59.830> had<00:02:59.950> a<00:02:59.980> lot

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
can just imagine you know he had a lot

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.620 
can just imagine you know he had a lot
of<00:03:00.280> his<00:03:00.370> great<00:03:00.610> favorite<00:03:01.030> pedals<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.450> he

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
of his great favorite pedals that he

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.600 
of his great favorite pedals that he
used<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.959> drive<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:02.500> amplifier<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.340> again

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
used to drive this amplifier and again

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.039 
used to drive this amplifier and again
you<00:03:03.790> know<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.060> nice<00:03:04.299> that<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.690> has<00:03:04.720> such<00:03:05.019> a

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
you know it's nice that it has such a

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.650 
you know it's nice that it has such a
great<00:03:05.320> range<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:06.040> clean<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.910> also<00:03:07.330> it's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
great range for clean and also it's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.330 
great range for clean and also it's
really<00:03:07.989> modeled<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.590> for<00:03:08.769> one<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.040> those<00:03:09.160> am

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
really modeled that for one of those am

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.590 
really modeled that for one of those am
not<00:03:09.610> really<00:03:09.820> modeled<00:03:10.120> because<00:03:10.299> it's<00:03:10.420> just

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
not really modeled because it's just

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.680 
not really modeled because it's just
really<00:03:10.870> one<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.200> kind<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:12.580> its<00:03:13.420> model

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
really one of a kind is that its model

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.960 
really one of a kind is that its model
that<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> really<00:03:14.650> really<00:03:15.100> like<00:03:15.310> clean

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
that have a really really like clean

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:28.880 
that have a really really like clean
great<00:03:16.390> clean<00:03:16.750> time<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:19.049> don't<00:03:20.049> wanna<00:03:20.230> spank

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.559 

the<00:03:29.890> articulation<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.730> really<00:03:31.239> quite<00:03:31.420> good

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
the articulation is really quite good

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.460 
the articulation is really quite good
mostly<00:03:34.569> we're<00:03:34.690> gonna<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.959> any<00:03:35.140> kind<00:03:35.409> of

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
mostly we're gonna do any kind of

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.039 
mostly we're gonna do any kind of
roll-off<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.819> know<00:03:36.970> put<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.510> tube<00:03:37.720> screamer

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
roll-off so you know put a tube screamer

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.539 
roll-off so you know put a tube screamer
or<00:03:38.319> something<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.709> from<00:03:38.860> exotic<00:03:39.099> or<00:03:39.340> anything

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
or something in from exotic or anything

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.130 
or something in from exotic or anything
in<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:39.970> you're<00:03:40.150> just<00:03:40.360> gonna<00:03:40.480> be<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:41.019> gonna

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
in that you're just gonna be it's gonna

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.559 
in that you're just gonna be it's gonna
be<00:03:41.260> great<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.849> treble<00:03:43.209> middle

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
be great so you have a treble middle

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.899 
be great so you have a treble middle
bass<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.530> presence<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:45.069> control<00:03:45.400> on<00:03:45.579> here

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
bass and a presence of control on here

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.509 
bass and a presence of control on here
and<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.540> have<00:03:46.690> two<00:03:46.900> volumes<00:03:47.709> on<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> front

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
and you have two volumes on the front

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.580 
and you have two volumes on the front
that<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.760> can<00:03:49.030> actually<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:50.140> really<00:03:50.319> is<00:03:50.560> a

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
that you can actually it really is a

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:08.150 
that you can actually it really is a
really<00:03:50.890> good<00:03:51.310> shaping<00:03:51.849> quality<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.450> it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.670 

so<00:04:08.820> buoyant<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.450> lot<00:04:09.690> has<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.930> lot<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.170> pregame

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
so buoyant is a lot has a lot of pregame

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.370 
so buoyant is a lot has a lot of pregame
to<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.250> which<00:04:11.580> is<00:04:11.730> awesome<00:04:11.880> really<00:04:12.600> nice<00:04:12.840> now

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
to it which is awesome really nice now

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.750 
to it which is awesome really nice now
something<00:04:13.710> else<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:14.160> we<00:04:14.310> are<00:04:14.340> running

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
something else that we are running

through this entire time we've been
playing<00:04:25.260> through<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.560> custom<00:04:26.220> valve<00:04:26.490> tech

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
playing through this custom valve tech

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.420 
playing through this custom valve tech
cabinet<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.810> has<00:04:28.020> these<00:04:28.140> 875<00:04:29.130> hella

cabinet and this has these 875 hella
tones<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:30.180> 60<00:04:30.810> LS<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.470> it's<00:04:32.040> a<00:04:32.100> very

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
tones in 60 LS and it's a very

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.370 
tones in 60 LS and it's a very
articulate<00:04:33.180> emphasis<00:04:33.750> definitely<00:04:34.230> one<00:04:34.350> of

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
articulate emphasis definitely one of

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.780 
articulate emphasis definitely one of
the<00:04:34.470> cleaner<00:04:34.710> amps<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.130> I've<00:04:35.280> heard<00:04:35.520> in

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
the cleaner amps that I've heard in

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.720 
the cleaner amps that I've heard in
quite<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> while<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.990> think<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:38.220> know<00:04:38.280> this

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
quite a while and I think you know this

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.580 
quite a while and I think you know this
combination<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.810> right<00:04:39.960> here<00:04:40.260> would<00:04:40.440> make

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
combination just right here would make

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.470 
combination just right here would make
anybody<00:04:41.100> happy<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.610> stage<00:04:41.940> would<00:04:42.180> probably

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
anybody happy on stage would probably

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.970 
anybody happy on stage would probably
run<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.840> sound<00:04:43.080> guy<00:04:43.230> out<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.590> place<00:04:43.770> but

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
run the sound guy out of the place but

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.710 
run the sound guy out of the place but
hey<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.790> nice<00:04:44.970> thing<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.300> can<00:04:45.420> actually
