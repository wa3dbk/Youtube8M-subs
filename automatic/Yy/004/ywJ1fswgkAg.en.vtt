00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
all the right like like that is the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
all the right like like that is the
spine<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> armor<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.170> got<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.920> the

right dents and stuff not dense but

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.049 
right dents and stuff not dense but
places<00:00:50.219> where<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> should<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:53.789> face

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
places where it should be and the face

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
places where it should be and the face
of<00:00:54.090> probably<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.289> looks<00:00:55.590> exactly<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.340> Robert

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of probably it looks exactly like Robert

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.459 
of probably it looks exactly like Robert
Downey<00:00:56.910> jr.<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.780> who<00:00:57.930> plays<00:00:58.230> iron

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
Downey jr. because that's who plays iron

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.420 
Downey jr. because that's who plays iron
man<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.370> movie<00:00:59.670> Tony<00:00:59.879> snap<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:01.379> I'd<00:01:01.980> think

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
man in the movie Tony snap and I'd think

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.830 
man in the movie Tony snap and I'd think
that<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:02.910> hard<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.719> they

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that would be really hard to do but they

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.090 
that would be really hard to do but they
did<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> good<00:01:04.199> job<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:07.110> removable<00:01:07.470> breastplate

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
did a good job the removable breastplate

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.760 
did a good job the removable breastplate
there's<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.990> circuit<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.409> here

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there's all this circuit and in here

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.660 
there's all this circuit and in here
which<00:01:11.010> looks<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.549> nice<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:13.460> that's<00:01:14.460> about

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
which looks really nice and that's about

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
which looks really nice and that's about
it<00:01:16.310> okay<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.670> situation<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.979> wasn't

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it okay that situation I wasn't

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
it okay that situation I wasn't
expecting<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.549> much<00:01:20.700> articulation<00:01:21.180> because

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
expecting that much articulation because

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.249

restricted due to this piece of armor
here<00:01:44.640> which<00:01:45.299> doesn't<00:01:45.600> let<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.439> side

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because they you can take them off and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.160 
because they you can take them off and
on<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> replace<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.710> his<00:01:58.799> human<00:01:59.100> hands

won't break and how much made out of the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.020 
won't break and how much made out of the
same<00:02:19.890> material<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.880> slightly<00:02:21.150> stronger<00:02:23.030> so

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
same material just slightly stronger so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.110 
same material just slightly stronger so
the<00:02:24.060> hands<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:25.620> other<00:02:25.739> thing<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:29.120> going

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the hands the other thing is not going

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.780 
the hands the other thing is not going
what<00:02:30.810> made<00:02:30.989> out<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.350> same<00:02:31.380> stuff<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
what made out of the same stuff is the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
what made out of the same stuff is the
shoulder<00:02:33.390> pads<00:02:33.600> which<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.959> hate<00:02:34.170> personally

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
shoulder pads which I hate personally

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.410 
shoulder pads which I hate personally
because<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:37.130> lift<00:02:38.130> over<00:02:38.340> them<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:39.180> flies

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
because when you lift over them it flies

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.440 
because when you lift over them it flies
off<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.440> i<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.390> okay<00:02:42.390> so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
off so i don't really like that okay so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.020 
off so i don't really like that okay so
is<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.680> worth<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.069> I'd<00:02:44.310> say<00:02:44.550> it's<00:02:44.700> totally

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
is it worth it I'd say it's totally

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.080 
is it worth it I'd say it's totally
worth<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.209> because<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.650> only<00:02:46.950> customer<00:02:47.400> $13

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
worth it because this only customer $13

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.240 
worth it because this only customer $13
and<00:02:48.330> that's<00:02:48.540> more<00:02:49.080> than<00:02:49.290> less<00:02:49.860> than<00:02:49.890> half<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and that's more than less than half the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.090 
and that's more than less than half the
price<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.940> nut<00:02:51.090> Marvel<00:02:51.840> legend<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.920> my

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100
