you're well over 5,000 pounds it's a 225

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.899 
you're well over 5,000 pounds it's a 225
inches<00:02:23.730> long<00:02:24.799> which<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:25.829> Deuce<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.609> a<00:02:26.730> quarter

inches long which is Deuce and a quarter

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.170 
inches long which is Deuce and a quarter
I<00:02:27.090> guess<00:02:27.890> though<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.920> guess<00:02:29.459> they<00:02:29.670> gave<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I guess though I guess they gave that to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.160 
I guess though I guess they gave that to
the<00:02:30.269> Buick<00:02:30.629> line<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.109> 59<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.629> is<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> long

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
the Buick line in 59 but this is a long

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.220 
the Buick line in 59 but this is a long
ass<00:02:34.650> caddy<00:02:36.079> and<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.299> guess<00:02:39.629> that's<00:02:39.840> about<00:02:40.049> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
ass caddy and so I guess that's about it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.050 
ass caddy and so I guess that's about it
