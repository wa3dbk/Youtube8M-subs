probably<00:00:11.270> just<00:00:11.420> over<00:00:11.629> a<00:00:11.660> year<00:00:11.780> it's<00:00:12.410> running

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
probably just over a year it's running

only thing different is my own

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.700 
only thing different is my own
transmitter<00:00:16.670> and<00:00:16.790> receiver<00:00:17.029> in<00:00:17.270> it<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:18.349> like

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
transmitter and receiver in it and like

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.440 
transmitter and receiver in it and like
says<00:00:18.950> I've<00:00:19.250> had<00:00:19.310> it<00:00:19.580> for<00:00:19.700> over<00:00:19.880> a<00:00:19.910> year<00:00:20.000> I

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
says I've had it for over a year I

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.760 
says I've had it for over a year I
haven't<00:00:20.840> flown<00:00:20.960> it<00:00:21.199> for<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.380> while<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:21.740> I

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
haven't flown it for a while so I

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.929 
haven't flown it for a while so I
figured<00:00:22.010> I'd<00:00:22.100> throw<00:00:22.130> it<00:00:22.369> back<00:00:22.520> up<00:00:22.730> show

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
figured I'd throw it back up show

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.820 
figured I'd throw it back up show
everybody<00:00:23.330> that<00:00:23.390> these<00:00:24.199> things<00:00:24.410> really<00:00:24.619> do

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
everybody that these things really do

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.519 
everybody that these things really do
still<00:00:25.160> fly<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:25.609> hold<00:00:25.820> up<00:00:25.970> really<00:00:26.240> nice<00:00:26.470> try<00:00:27.470> to

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
still fly and hold up really nice try to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.830 
still fly and hold up really nice try to
see<00:00:27.710> how<00:00:27.830> well<00:00:28.039> she<00:00:28.220> still<00:00:28.460> flies<00:00:28.720> so<00:00:29.720> let's

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
see how well she still flies so let's

00:00:29.840 --> 00:01:16.570 
see how well she still flies so let's
get<00:00:29.990> her<00:00:30.080> up<00:00:30.199> and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:03:03.460 

if<00:01:17.580> brickhead<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> wire

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.160 

so<00:03:04.470> van<00:03:04.740> I've<00:03:05.070> only<00:03:05.220> got<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> 1,300<00:03:06.210> amp<00:03:06.600> no<00:03:06.930> amp

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
so van I've only got a 1,300 amp no amp

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:29.350 
so van I've only got a 1,300 amp no amp
battery<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.650> itself<00:03:19.700> cross<00:03:20.700> breeze<00:03:21.060> rudder

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.950 

not<00:03:30.360> bad<00:03:30.570> for<00:03:30.600> no<00:03:30.960> rudder<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.440> cross<00:03:31.650> breeze

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.500 

ok<00:03:36.960> for<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.470> flight<00:03:37.740> I<00:03:37.770> was<00:03:37.890> flying<00:03:38.160> on<00:03:38.550> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
ok for that flight I was flying on a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.410 
ok for that flight I was flying on a
3-cell<00:03:41.120> 1,300<00:03:42.120> milliamp<00:03:42.600> battery<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:45.360> it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
3-cell 1,300 milliamp battery so it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.270 
3-cell 1,300 milliamp battery so it
doesn't<00:03:45.690> push<00:03:46.050> out<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> ton<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.590> juice<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.160> it's

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
doesn't push out a ton of juice so it's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.180 
doesn't push out a ton of juice so it's
a<00:03:47.430> little<00:03:47.610> bit<00:03:47.700> slower<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.750> can<00:03:48.990> run<00:03:49.260> an<00:03:49.380> 1800

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
a little bit slower you can run an 1800

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.650 
a little bit slower you can run an 1800
or<00:03:50.250> 20<00:03:50.760> 200<00:03:50.940> million

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
or 20 200 million

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.360 
or 20 200 million
lipo<00:03:51.990> but<00:03:52.590> you're<00:03:52.680> gonna<00:03:52.770> have<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> put<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.280> up

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
lipo but you're gonna have to put it up

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.150 
lipo but you're gonna have to put it up
in<00:03:53.520> here<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.390> second<00:03:54.780> here<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:55.920> believe

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
in here in a second here and I believe

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.190 
in here in a second here and I believe
my<00:03:56.280> CD<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.730> found<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.270> got<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.540> markings<00:03:57.960> here

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
my CD I found I got the markings here

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200 
my CD I found I got the markings here
showing<00:03:59.130> where<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.280> need<00:03:59.460> to<00:03:59.490> sit<00:03:59.730> with<00:03:59.880> battery

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
showing where I need to sit with battery

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.910 
showing where I need to sit with battery
and<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.600> had<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.780> touch<00:04:00.960> this<00:04:01.140> up<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.560> fit<00:04:01.890> a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
and I had to touch this up it fit a

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.860 
and I had to touch this up it fit a
little<00:04:02.160> bit<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:03.210> does<00:04:03.420> produce<00:04:03.660> a

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
little bit and that does produce a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.630 
little bit and that does produce a
little<00:04:04.230> more<00:04:04.380> power<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.160> she<00:04:05.250> could<00:04:05.490> get<00:04:05.610> a

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
little more power so she could get a

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.210 
little more power so she could get a
little<00:04:05.910> bit<00:04:06.030> more<00:04:06.180> speed<00:04:06.480> out<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.750> her<00:04:07.220> that's

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
little bit more speed out of her that's

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.650 
little bit more speed out of her that's
why<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.430> was<00:04:08.550> kind<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.730> shocked<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.210> she<00:04:09.540> was

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
why I was kind of shocked it she was

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.410 
why I was kind of shocked it she was
kind<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.870> moving<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.200> little<00:04:10.320> slow<00:04:10.850> but<00:04:11.850> still

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
kind of moving a little slow but still

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.320 
kind of moving a little slow but still
fully<00:04:13.260> acrobatic<00:04:13.890> still<00:04:14.640> flies<00:04:14.850> like<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.120> champ

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
fully acrobatic still flies like a champ

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.580 
fully acrobatic still flies like a champ
still<00:04:15.870> sounds<00:04:16.140> great<00:04:16.350> thanks<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.489> watching
