00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
there's our hidden room ie it's how we

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.490 
there's our hidden room ie it's how we
rule<00:00:17.570> anyways<00:00:18.570> um<00:00:19.910> wait<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.180> oh<00:00:21.470> yeah<00:00:22.470> I

should probably get rid of that what to
my<00:00:25.320> Finland<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.029> supposed<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.420> glass

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
my Finland this is supposed to be glass

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.109 
my Finland this is supposed to be glass
I<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.590> thinking<00:00:28.830> putting<00:00:29.039> Lavin's<00:00:29.609> places

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
I was thinking putting Lavin's places

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.650 
I was thinking putting Lavin's places
this<00:00:30.240> glowstone<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.949> he<00:00:32.660> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
this glowstone right here but he the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.190 
this glowstone right here but he the
lava<00:00:33.899> would<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.559> stay<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.640> sit

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
lava would just stay and just sit

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
lava would just stay and just sit
basically<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.380> chill<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.890> area<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
basically just chill in this area and it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.790 
basically just chill in this area and it
was<00:00:39.260> not<00:00:40.260> fun<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.469> an<00:00:43.559> idea

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
was not fun but I actually have an idea

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.150 
was not fun but I actually have an idea
now<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.160> I'll<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.000> later<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:46.070> don't<00:00:47.070> even

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
now but I'll do that later I don't even

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.580 
now but I'll do that later I don't even
know<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.090> okay<00:00:49.340> anyways<00:00:50.340> yeah<00:00:50.969> so

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
know for but that's okay anyways yeah so

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.950 
know for but that's okay anyways yeah so
let's<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> again

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
let's do this again

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.900 
let's do this again
normal<00:00:54.960> stairs

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.390 

also<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.630> can<00:01:02.990> see<00:01:03.200> the<00:01:03.320> pistons<00:01:03.770> right<00:01:04.010> here

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
also you can see the pistons right here

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.040 
also you can see the pistons right here
when<00:01:05.710> when<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:06.890> happens<00:01:07.310> there<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.360> right

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
when when that happens there and right

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.230 
when when that happens there and right
through<00:01:09.290> there<00:01:09.440> but<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:10.670> doesn't<00:01:11.000> matter

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
through there but it doesn't matter

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.460 
through there but it doesn't matter
because<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.940> just<00:01:14.090> doesn't<00:01:14.360> don't<00:01:15.110> argue<00:01:15.260> with

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
because it just doesn't don't argue with

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.570 
because it just doesn't don't argue with
me<00:01:18.550> also<00:01:19.660> I<00:01:20.660> don't<00:01:21.440> have<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.770> room<00:01:22.040> set<00:01:22.070> up<00:01:22.340> here

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
me also I don't have a room set up here

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.240 
me also I don't have a room set up here
but<00:01:22.790> I<00:01:23.030> could<00:01:23.620> set<00:01:24.620> up<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.890> small<00:01:25.880> room<00:01:27.250> right

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
but I could set up this small room right

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.469 
but I could set up this small room right
there<00:01:29.830> yeah<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.670> don't<00:01:32.000> even<00:01:32.119> know<00:01:32.330> what

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
there yeah but I don't even know what

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.660 
there yeah but I don't even know what
I'm<00:01:32.570> gonna<00:01:32.690> put<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:32.930> here<00:01:33.229> I'm<00:01:33.920> actually<00:01:34.250> got

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
I'm gonna put in here I'm actually got

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.370 
I'm gonna put in here I'm actually got
an<00:01:34.790> idea

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
an idea

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.469 
an idea
if<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.590> make<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.009> like<00:01:37.460> way<00:01:37.759> bigger<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.300> could

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
if I make it like way bigger I could

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.570 
if I make it like way bigger I could
keep<00:01:38.690> all<00:01:38.960> my<00:01:39.020> dead<00:01:39.380> hookers<00:01:39.710> in<00:01:39.860> here<00:01:40.040> and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
keep all my dead hookers in here and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.390 
keep all my dead hookers in here and
you'd<00:01:40.700> be<00:01:40.820> epic<00:01:41.410> okay<00:01:42.410> so<00:01:42.470> if<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:42.979> make<00:01:43.130> one<00:01:43.280> of

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
you'd be epic okay so if you make one of

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.060 
you'd be epic okay so if you make one of
these<00:01:43.490> that's<00:01:43.910> what<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.180> have<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.509> do<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:45.070> so

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
these that's what you have to do and so

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.440 
these that's what you have to do and so
right<00:01:46.340> before<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.759> do<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:46.940> I<00:01:47.090> should<00:01:47.180> probably

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
right before I do that I should probably

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.660 
right before I do that I should probably
show<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.930> wiring<00:01:48.259> for<00:01:48.470> involving<00:01:49.460> dead

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
show you the wiring for involving dead

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.430 
show you the wiring for involving dead
hookers<00:01:50.000> into<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.360> room<00:01:50.660> make<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.229> bigger

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
hookers into this room make you bigger

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.480 
hookers into this room make you bigger
um<00:01:52.300> this<00:01:53.300> is<00:01:53.479> some<00:01:53.630> wiring<00:01:54.080> for<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.490> parts

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
um this is some wiring for the parts

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.820 
um this is some wiring for the parts
that<00:01:55.550> push<00:01:55.759> out<00:01:55.940> cuz<00:01:56.600> actually<00:01:57.050> this<00:01:57.649> is

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
that push out cuz actually this is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.350 
that push out cuz actually this is
actually<00:01:58.190> going<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.550> be<00:01:58.640> set<00:01:58.820> up<00:01:58.850> for<00:01:59.210> some

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
actually going to be set up for some

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.820 
actually going to be set up for some
lava<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.750> come<00:01:59.869> down<00:02:00.020> once<00:02:00.290> I<00:02:00.380> figure<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.649> way<00:02:00.800> to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
lava to come down once I figure a way to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.490 
lava to come down once I figure a way to
get<00:02:01.070> figure<00:02:01.640> out<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> way<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.090> get<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.110> lava<00:02:03.320> to

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
get figure out a way to get the lava to

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.920 
get figure out a way to get the lava to
disappear<00:02:04.010> when<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.190> wanted<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.520> but<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.420> think<00:02:05.600> I

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
disappear when I wanted to but I think I

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.130 
disappear when I wanted to but I think I
already<00:02:06.080> have<00:02:06.290> an<00:02:06.409> idea<00:02:06.650> because<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.820> am<00:02:08.209> so

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
already have an idea because I am so

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.250 
already have an idea because I am so
smart<00:02:10.420> well<00:02:11.420> actually<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.810> took<00:02:11.900> me<00:02:11.989> like<00:02:12.140> an

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
smart well actually it took me like an

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.180 
smart well actually it took me like an
hour<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.769> this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
hour to do this

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.340 
hour to do this
I<00:02:13.220> don't<00:02:13.459> know<00:02:15.910> anyways<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:17.810> under<00:02:18.110> this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
I don't know anyways and then under this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.789 
I don't know anyways and then under this
under<00:02:18.620> these<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:21.049> this<00:02:21.350> one<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.739> one

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
under these this one this one this one
