now we're going to get into strumming

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.789 
now we're going to get into strumming
patterns<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.879> what<00:00:03.510> these<00:00:03.720> are<00:00:03.799> basic

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
patterns and what these are basic

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.909 
patterns and what these are basic
acoustic<00:00:05.430> patterns<00:00:06.140> for<00:00:07.140> strumming<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.680> you

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
acoustic patterns for strumming that you

acoustic patterns for strumming that you
need<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> know<00:00:08.400> you're<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.360> find<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.900> lot

of songs as well of song books as well
as<00:00:14.370> just<00:00:14.580> patterns<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.269> need<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> know

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
as just patterns that you need to know

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.260 
as just patterns that you need to know
for<00:00:15.839> basic<00:00:16.139> accompaniment<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.090> just

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
for basic accompaniment and for just

playing you know just for fun and these

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.300 
playing you know just for fun and these
are<00:00:21.000> also<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.930> selected<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:22.769> chords

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
are also that selected these chords

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.859 
are also that selected these chords
because<00:00:23.490> they<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.820> nicely<00:00:24.060> together<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
because they go nicely together and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.230 
because they go nicely together and
we're<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.880> first<00:00:27.060> three

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
we're going to do the first three

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.630 
we're going to do the first three
examples<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.349> book<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.949> strumming

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
examples in your book on strumming

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.279 
examples in your book on strumming
pattern<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> start<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
pattern so we're going to start out and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.450 
pattern so we're going to start out and
I'm<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> rely<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.189> fretboard

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I'm going to rely on the fretboard

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.340 
I'm going to rely on the fretboard
diagrams<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> I've<00:00:33.660> given<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.230> your

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
notice that the patterns that I'm

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
notice that the patterns that I'm
showing<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> book<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.640> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
actually see how I'm playing them where

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.030 
actually see how I'm playing them where
I'm<00:01:03.629> putting<00:01:03.780> my<00:01:03.960> fingers<00:01:04.320> okay<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.650> let's<00:01:04.949> do

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I'm putting my fingers okay so let's do

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:19.510 
I'm putting my fingers okay so let's do
the<00:01:05.129> first<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:07.100> 1<00:01:08.100> 2<00:01:08.700> 3<00:01:08.990> 4

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.130 

okay<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:21.270> play<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.510> up<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:21.960> more<00:01:22.080> time

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
okay we play it up for you one more time

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.219 
okay we play it up for you one more time
and<00:01:22.350> I'll<00:01:22.440> play<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:23.010> slower<00:01:24.229> one

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and I'll play a little bit slower one

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:40.760 
and I'll play a little bit slower one
and<00:01:25.770> two<00:01:26.840> three<00:01:28.040> four

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.080 

so<00:01:41.770> what<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.040> need<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.310> notice<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.730> that<00:01:42.790> first

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
so what you need to notice in that first

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.840 
so what you need to notice in that first
example<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.750> there's<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.230> tie<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:45.130> tie

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
example is that there's a tie a tie

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.360 
example is that there's a tie a tie
between<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:47.290> two<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.620> then<00:01:48.160> the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
between the and of two and then the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.750 
between the and of two and then the
downbeat<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.270> three<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.440> you've<00:01:50.590> got<00:01:50.830> this<00:01:51.070> one

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
downbeat of three so you've got this one

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.180 
downbeat of three so you've got this one
and<00:01:52.180> two<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.140> three<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:54.190> four<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:55.390> okay<00:01:56.190> play

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
and two and three and four and okay play

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.190 
and two and three and four and okay play
it<00:01:57.220> for<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:57.520> again<00:01:57.580> it's<00:01:58.000> down<00:01:58.960> up<00:01:59.520> down<00:02:00.520> up

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200

down<00:02:10.899> up<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.770> we<00:02:11.830> get<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.100> going<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.550> sounds

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
down up and we get it going it sounds

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.500 
down up and we get it going it sounds
like<00:02:12.880> this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.390 

okay<00:02:24.700> now<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:26.030> example<00:02:26.690> two<00:02:27.250> we're<00:02:28.250> going<00:02:28.340> to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
okay now in example two we're going to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.040 
okay now in example two we're going to
have<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.930> same<00:02:30.170> chords<00:02:32.080> at<00:02:33.080> your<00:02:33.290> C<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.990> R<00:02:35.990> a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
have the same chords at your C and R a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.140 
have the same chords at your C and R a
minor

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.790 

but<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.360> time<00:02:42.599> we're<00:02:43.410> going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.590> have<00:02:43.770> a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
but this time we're going to have a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.430 
but this time we're going to have a
little<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.459> different<00:02:44.790> rhythm<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:46.319> can

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
little bit different rhythm and you can

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280 
little bit different rhythm and you can
have<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> dotted<00:02:47.099> quarter<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:48.200> at<00:02:49.200> the

have a dotted quarter on at the
beginning<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> each<00:02:49.739> measure<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.250> you've<00:02:50.370> got

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
beginning of each measure so you've got

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.050 
beginning of each measure so you've got
one<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.180> two<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:52.170> then<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:53.580> beat<00:02:53.790> comes

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
one and two and then and this beat comes

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.790 
one and two and then and this beat comes
on<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.720> let<00:02:54.840> me<00:02:54.870> play<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.350> the

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
okay now in the next example what we

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.620 
okay now in the next example what we
have<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.320> new<00:03:46.770> cord<00:03:47.160> where<00:03:47.940> you're<00:03:48.180> going<00:03:48.570> to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
have is a new cord where you're going to

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.470 
have is a new cord where you're going to
have<00:03:48.690> C<00:03:49.020> add<00:03:49.230> 9<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:49.980> what<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:50.970> means<00:03:51.240> is<00:03:51.450> that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
have C add 9 so what that means is that

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.380 
have C add 9 so what that means is that
you're<00:03:51.750> gonna<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.020> C<00:03:52.230> chord<00:03:53.300> start<00:03:54.300> off

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
you're gonna have a C chord start off

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.390 
you're gonna have a C chord start off
with<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.720> then<00:03:55.620> all<00:03:55.740> I'm<00:03:55.890> going<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.100> do<00:03:56.280> is
