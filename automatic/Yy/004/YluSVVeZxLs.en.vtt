00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
probably be a pretty good idea little

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.899 
probably be a pretty good idea little
did<00:01:51.109> I<00:01:51.229> know<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.439> it<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:52.100> fact<00:01:52.130> was<00:01:52.639> not

than everything but I actually did it so
oops<00:04:58.760> but<00:04:59.760> it<00:05:00.030> turned<00:05:00.480> out<00:05:00.600> for<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.840> better<00:05:00.990> I

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
oops but it turned out for the better I

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.790 
oops but it turned out for the better I
guess<00:05:01.410> anyway<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.670> here<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.030> decide<00:05:03.570> to

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
guess anyway so here I decide to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.960 
guess anyway so here I decide to
double-team<00:05:04.800> Groudon<00:05:05.310> because<00:05:05.640> I<00:05:05.670> wasn't

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
double-team Groudon because I wasn't

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.850 
double-team Groudon because I wasn't
sure<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.330> seed<00:05:06.720> bomb<00:05:06.990> was<00:05:07.200> gonna<00:05:07.320> care<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.740> or

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
sure a seed bomb was gonna care it or

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.120 
sure a seed bomb was gonna care it or
not<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.810> probably<00:05:09.810> would<00:05:10.290> have<00:05:10.320> just<00:05:10.770> because

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
not I I probably would have just because

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.030 
not I I probably would have just because
I've<00:05:11.550> notice<00:05:11.850> was<00:05:11.940> me<00:05:12.090> being<00:05:12.270> paranoid

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
I've notice was me being paranoid

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.160 
I've notice was me being paranoid
so<00:05:14.040> anyway<00:05:14.430> seed<00:05:14.700> bomb<00:05:14.940> goes<00:05:15.180> off<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.720> cried

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
so anyway seed bomb goes off and cried

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.730 
so anyway seed bomb goes off and cried
on<00:05:16.200> gets<00:05:16.770> C<00:05:17.700> pwned<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.420> then<00:05:19.170> cheering<00:05:19.560> girls

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.890 
rollout so anyway
I<00:06:20.040> thought<00:06:20.850> at<00:06:21.090> this<00:06:21.210> point<00:06:21.330> that<00:06:21.690> I<00:06:21.750> was

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
I thought at this point that I was

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.960 
I thought at this point that I was
completely<00:06:22.350> screwed<00:06:23.130> because<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:23.670> only<00:06:23.820> got

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
completely screwed because I only got

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.690 
completely screwed because I only got
two<00:06:24.180> guys<00:06:24.360> left<00:06:26.510> luckily<00:06:27.510> though<00:06:28.280> here<00:06:29.280> I'm

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
two guys left luckily though here I'm

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.300 
two guys left luckily though here I'm
able<00:06:30.030> to<00:06:30.090> get<00:06:30.240> my<00:06:30.300> rain<00:06:30.570> dad's<00:06:30.810> back<00:06:31.080> up<00:06:31.320> so

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
able to get my rain dad's back up so

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.820 
able to get my rain dad's back up so
what<00:06:33.120> I<00:06:33.150> was<00:06:33.360> thinking<00:06:33.750> is<00:06:33.900> lantern<00:06:34.440> slower

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
what I was thinking is lantern slower

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.750 
what I was thinking is lantern slower
than<00:06:35.100> omastar<00:06:35.400> so<00:06:36.800> lantern<00:06:37.800> probably<00:06:38.580> won't

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
than omastar so lantern probably won't

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.730 
than omastar so lantern probably won't
die<00:06:38.970> to<00:06:39.030> anything<00:06:39.690> because<00:06:39.990> he's<00:06:40.140> just<00:06:40.440> blind

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
die to anything because he's just blind

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.460 
die to anything because he's just blind
turn<00:06:41.130> and<00:06:41.340> omastar<00:06:42.270> probably<00:06:43.110> won't<00:06:43.320> be

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
turn and omastar probably won't be

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.720 
turn and omastar probably won't be

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.150 
part of the battle because Toma ohm ohm
Epona<00:07:20.610> star<00:07:21.350> well<00:07:22.350> what<00:07:22.560> it's<00:07:22.710> famous<00:07:22.950> for

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 
Epona star well what it's famous for

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.880 
Epona star well what it's famous for
just<00:07:24.090> hydro<00:07:24.540> pumping<00:07:24.870> stuff<00:07:25.140> to<00:07:25.260> get<00:07:25.470> here<00:07:25.800> we

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.890 
just hydro pumping stuff to get here we

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:32.300 
just hydro pumping stuff to get here we
go<00:07:26.070> boom<00:07:26.730> I<00:07:28.280> love<00:07:29.280> that<00:07:29.550> it's<00:07:29.880> so<00:07:30.030> awesome<00:07:31.310> yep

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310 
go boom I love that it's so awesome yep

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.920 
go boom I love that it's so awesome yep
so<00:07:32.700> now<00:07:32.970> that's<00:07:33.150> not<00:07:33.300> really<00:07:33.540> a<00:07:33.570> whole<00:07:33.690> lot<00:07:33.720> he

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
so now that's not really a whole lot he

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:41.000 
so now that's not really a whole lot he
can<00:07:34.080> do<00:07:34.260> except<00:07:34.620> for<00:07:34.740> killer<00:07:34.920> lantern<00:07:40.010> anyway

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.010 
can do except for killer lantern anyway

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.730 
can do except for killer lantern anyway
so<00:07:41.670> this<00:07:41.970> is<00:07:42.030> the<00:07:42.240> last<00:07:42.420> turn<00:07:42.690> and<00:07:42.990> I'm<00:07:43.140> faster

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 
so this is the last turn and I'm faster

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.410 
so this is the last turn and I'm faster
so<00:07:43.980> there's<00:07:44.190> really<00:07:44.400> nothing<00:07:44.910> he<00:07:45.000> can<00:07:45.150> do<00:07:45.270> at

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.420 
so there's really nothing he can do at

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.030 
so there's really nothing he can do at
this<00:07:45.510> point<00:07:45.810> so<00:07:46.080> yeah<00:07:46.320> it<00:07:46.500> was<00:07:46.560> a<00:07:46.650> good<00:07:46.860> battle

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.040 
this point so yeah it was a good battle

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.270 
this point so yeah it was a good battle
good<00:07:47.490> show<00:07:47.730> and<00:07:48.150> we<00:07:49.080> did<00:07:49.230> three<00:07:49.470> battles<00:07:49.860> he

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 
good show and we did three battles he

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.010 
good show and we did three battles he
uploaded<00:07:50.640> the<00:07:50.850> one<00:07:50.970> where<00:07:51.150> he<00:07:51.330> won<00:07:51.540> and<00:07:51.780> I<00:07:51.810> just

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 
uploaded the one where he won and I just

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.300 
uploaded the one where he won and I just
uploaded<00:07:52.320> this<00:07:52.530> one<00:07:52.740> because<00:07:52.980> it<00:07:53.070> was<00:07:53.160> the

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.310 
uploaded this one because it was the

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.600 
uploaded this one because it was the
shorter<00:07:53.640> of<00:07:53.670> the<00:07:53.790> two<00:07:53.910> where<00:07:54.510> I<00:07:54.540> won<00:07:54.930> anyway

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.610 
shorter of the two where I won anyway

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.820 
shorter of the two where I won anyway
