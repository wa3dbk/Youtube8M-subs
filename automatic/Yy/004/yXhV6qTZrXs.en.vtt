00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.639
 we are honest themselves aware of ourselves 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.080
 men men men or women with women 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.230
 communicate with all on equal and true 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.279
 we notice good words we think and speak 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 creatively through the feeling that 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.520
 we want to get from what it is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.039
 happens we like it there 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.689
 seemingly like simple things but if you 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.150
 get them on the subconscious that is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 takes you away to where you are not 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.980
 get into trouble through which 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.320
 then you will be aware of something 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.820
 sometimes in the next life you start 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.629
 form and myself where are you 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.360
 will occur 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.610
 if we condemn it through denial 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 offended notice some flaws 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.479
 that means we don't have enough capacity 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.580
 we do not want opportunities so we want 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.049
 some people come to me 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.519
 sorry plus top and now tell me how are you 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:56.159
 want to clarify we often don't think about 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.040
 what do we want and I noticed by myself 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.860
 that you start to think it's because I have so 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.580
 how would you like to kill you start to sink like 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.430
 I wish 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.650
 and this moment is not developed capacity 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.400
 we have to build up with us 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.990
 condemnation capacity is maximized 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.270
 there are favorable conditions where 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 whatsoever to us everywhere indicates 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.080
 lack of others 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.300
 for our either our country or our 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.910
 economy or live there hotels 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.200
 here did not regret it, but here it was possible 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.580
 do by two and here the light bulb is not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.380
 is burning 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.250
 the most important point to get on 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.130
 subconscious 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.620
 a habit that gives you the opportunity 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.350
 development and so when I gave the most 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.659
 primitive scheme up when you say 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.890
 in positive words you start already in 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 subconscious create conditions to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.920
 those words that will be activated 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.900
 cause sensations all of the past i 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.680
 will have to work on real 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.200
 in principle, already told that if 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 someone got drunk with power then we can say 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.210
 waited like a pig 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.790
 Russian from jellyfish somehow stretch and this one 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.799
 moment he is very significant in our 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.720
 life and when you start it 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.850
 translate a completely different terminology 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.490
 although there is already beginning to sausage 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.530
 can you tell what you think but 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.520
 the best option of course is to replace again 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.770
 very good to send people with 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.020
 on the one hand this is an episode from the movie 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.400
 and the other side I have every time 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.140
 when who does not appear to me 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.140
 which seems he goes soft
