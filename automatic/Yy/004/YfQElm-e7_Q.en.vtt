00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
think that's a big thing for me and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.260 
think that's a big thing for me and
that's<00:00:54.300> where<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.600> game<00:00:54.810> comes<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.740> hand

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
that's where my game comes in into hand

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.370 
that's where my game comes in into hand
but<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:57.780> time<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.080> got<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> make<00:00:58.350> sure

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
but at the same time we got to make sure

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.230 
but at the same time we got to make sure
we're<00:00:58.650> reliable<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.400> a<00:00:59.430> liability<00:00:59.820> on

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
we're reliable and not a liability on

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.540 
we're reliable and not a liability on
the<00:01:00.330> back<00:01:00.570> end<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.080> I<00:01:01.320> think<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.130> suits<00:01:02.220> making

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the back end so I think it suits making

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.130 

the<00:02:46.950> timing<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> past<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.480> Gaborik<00:02:48.900> is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
the timing and the past the Gaborik is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
the timing and the past the Gaborik is
perfect<00:02:49.650> what<00:02:50.070> Del<00:02:50.280> Zotto<00:02:50.490> when<00:02:50.760> he<00:02:50.820> takes<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
perfect what Del Zotto when he takes a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.460 
perfect what Del Zotto when he takes a
hit<00:02:51.270> me<00:02:51.390> everybody<00:02:51.810> thought<00:02:51.990> he<00:02:52.140> was<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.350> to

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
hit me everybody thought he was going to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.500 
hit me everybody thought he was going to
shoot<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.980> know<00:02:53.160> he<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.730> slide<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.180> puck<00:02:54.330> over

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.840 
shoot I know he just slide the puck over
but<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.960> perfect<00:02:55.410> pass<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:56.430> weird<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
but it's a perfect pass it's weird I

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.850 
but it's a perfect pass it's weird I
guess<00:02:57.360> being<00:02:57.390> young<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.840> especially<00:02:58.200> playing

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
guess being young and especially playing

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.230 
guess being young and especially playing
with<00:02:59.040> guys<00:02:59.160> were<00:02:59.430> married<00:02:59.850> I'm<00:03:00.030> used<00:03:00.180> to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
with guys were married I'm used to

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.970 
with guys were married I'm used to
playing<00:03:00.390> with<00:03:00.540> young<00:03:00.780> guys<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.680> it's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
playing with young guys and so it's

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
playing with young guys and so it's
definitely<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> big<00:03:02.490> change<00:03:02.820> but<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.570> know<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
definitely a big change but you know the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.990 
definitely a big change but you know the
guys<00:03:03.900> are<00:03:04.050> amazing<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.620> enough<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.550> a
