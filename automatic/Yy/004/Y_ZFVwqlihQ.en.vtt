00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
cord as stable as possible so I did that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.729

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.369 
it's not vibrating anymore I think okay
cool<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.739> fixed<00:02:27.870> about<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> half<00:02:29.170> an<00:02:29.290> hour

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
cool it's fixed about a half an hour

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.500 
cool it's fixed about a half an hour
later<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.769> starts<00:02:30.010> vibrating<00:02:30.160> again<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.480> i

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
later it starts vibrating again so i

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.420 
later it starts vibrating again so i
turn<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.959> thing<00:02:32.110> off<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:34.650> I've<00:02:35.650> used<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.400> a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
turn the thing off and I've used it a

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.430 
turn the thing off and I've used it a
little<00:02:36.700> bit<00:02:36.880> today<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.480> vibrated<00:02:37.959> some<00:02:38.230> more

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
little bit today it vibrated some more

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.020 
little bit today it vibrated some more
so<00:02:39.190> yeah<00:02:39.819> it's<00:02:40.980> I'm<00:02:41.980> not<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.730> hundred<00:02:42.849> percent

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so yeah it's I'm not one hundred percent

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.080 
so yeah it's I'm not one hundred percent
sure<00:02:43.360> what's<00:02:43.660> wrong<00:02:43.870> with<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.200> I'm<00:02:44.410> actually

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
sure what's wrong with it I'm actually

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.339 
sure what's wrong with it I'm actually
even<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.510> giving<00:02:46.840> myself<00:02:46.959> too<00:02:47.319> much

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
even that is giving myself too much

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.530 
even that is giving myself too much
credit<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.340> don't<00:02:48.579> know<00:02:48.760> what<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.510> wrong

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
credit I really don't know what is wrong

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.100 
credit I really don't know what is wrong
with<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.079> my<00:02:50.890> best<00:02:51.129> guess<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.540> it's

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
with it my best guess is that it's

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.119 
with it my best guess is that it's
something<00:02:53.590> wrong<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:56.500> some<00:02:56.829> sort<00:02:57.040> of

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
something wrong with like some sort of

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.190 
something wrong with like some sort of
internal<00:02:57.459> part<00:02:57.940> came<00:02:58.450> loose<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.110> just

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
internal part came loose and just

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.130 
internal part came loose and just
bumping<00:02:59.890> up<00:03:00.040> against<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.459> fan<00:03:01.079> or<00:03:02.079> something

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
bumping up against the fan or something

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.210 
bumping up against the fan or something
it<00:03:02.620> takes<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.950> while<00:03:03.129> for<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.579> get<00:03:03.879> there<00:03:04.180> but

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
it takes a while for it to get there but

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.620 
it takes a while for it to get there but
when<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.340> like<00:03:06.489> starts<00:03:06.850> working<00:03:07.299> really<00:03:07.480> hard

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
when it like starts working really hard

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.059 
when it like starts working really hard
I<00:03:08.139> guess<00:03:08.850> that's<00:03:09.850> what<00:03:10.060> happens<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.859> so<00:03:11.859> I

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
I guess that's what happens and so I

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.460 
I guess that's what happens and so I
need<00:03:12.639> to<00:03:12.730> have<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.000> looked<00:03:13.030> at<00:03:13.420> or<00:03:13.720> something

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
need to have it looked at or something

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.080 
need to have it looked at or something
but<00:03:14.799> whatever<00:03:15.190> until<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.670> happens<00:03:16.000> I'm

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
but whatever until that happens I'm

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.220 
but whatever until that happens I'm
going<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.269> be<00:03:16.359> using<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.630> different<00:03:16.930> computer

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
going to be using a different computer

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.710 
going to be using a different computer
and<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:18.519> don't<00:03:18.700> really<00:03:18.880> care<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.450> one

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and I don't really care for this one

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.979 
and I don't really care for this one
very<00:03:19.900> much<00:03:20.200> but<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:21.970> don't<00:03:22.239> know<00:03:22.359> how<00:03:22.720> often

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
very much but so I don't know how often

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.710 
very much but so I don't know how often
segments<00:03:23.709> are<00:03:23.799> going<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:23.980> be<00:03:24.099> coming<00:03:24.280> out<00:03:24.720> for

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
it not be bothered by the kids forever

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.190 
it not be bothered by the kids forever
which<00:04:16.829> would<00:04:16.980> be<00:04:17.100> kind<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.459> nice<00:04:17.660> but<00:04:18.660> it's

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
which would be kind of nice but it's

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.160 
which would be kind of nice but it's
kind<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.709> huge<00:04:19.950> step<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.060> I'm<00:04:21.900> obviously

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
kind of a huge step so I'm obviously

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.940 
kind of a huge step so I'm obviously
rather<00:04:22.740> nervous<00:04:23.040> about<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.680> it<00:04:25.680> might

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
rather nervous about this and it might

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.030 
rather nervous about this and it might
not<00:04:26.130> happen<00:04:26.430> I'd<00:04:27.420> like<00:04:27.690> for<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.140> but<00:04:29.010> I

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
not happen I'd like for it to but I

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.830 
not happen I'd like for it to but I
can't<00:04:29.280> guarantee<00:04:29.520> that<00:04:29.820> things<00:04:30.450> are<00:04:30.660> going<00:04:30.780> to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
can't guarantee that things are going to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.950 
can't guarantee that things are going to
work<00:04:31.130> out<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.520> an<00:04:32.640> extent<00:04:33.060> where<00:04:33.419> we're

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
work out to an extent where we're

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.510 
work out to an extent where we're
definitely<00:04:34.169> going<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.680> want<00:04:34.830> them<00:04:34.919> like<00:04:35.280> have
