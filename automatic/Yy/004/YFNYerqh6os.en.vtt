00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
travel is because the top is actually a

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.960 
travel is because the top is actually a
concealer<00:06:35.590> so<00:06:36.159> this<00:06:36.310> is<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.460> two<00:06:36.610> in<00:06:36.940> one

concealer so this is a two in one
product<00:06:37.360> and<00:06:37.570> it<00:06:37.630> has<00:06:37.750> a<00:06:37.780> little<00:06:37.930> mirror<00:06:38.289> on
