good and they don't really benefit you
in<00:03:17.970> any<00:03:18.120> situation<00:03:18.800> but<00:03:19.800> I'm<00:03:20.160> trying<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> do

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
in any situation but I'm trying to do

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.710 
in any situation but I'm trying to do
right<00:03:20.550> here<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.910> just<00:03:21.150> sort<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.330> stick<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.630> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
right here is just sort of stick to the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.290 
right here is just sort of stick to the
outer<00:03:21.900> edges<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.530> map<00:03:22.790> because<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.210> have

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
outer edges of the map because I do have

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.450 
outer edges of the map because I do have
an<00:03:24.540> i<00:03:24.690> do<00:03:25.170> not<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> suppressed<00:03:26.130> weapon

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
an i do not have a suppressed weapon

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.880 
an i do not have a suppressed weapon
right<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:26.760> I'm<00:03:27.450> sort<00:03:28.050> of<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.410> cruising

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
right now I'm sort of just cruising

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.930 
right now I'm sort of just cruising
around<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.160> spawns<00:03:30.290> trying<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.350> stick<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
around the spawns trying to stick the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.160 
around the spawns trying to stick the
outside<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.090> map<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.540> get<00:03:33.840> into<00:03:34.050> an

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
outside of the map and on get into an

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.440 
outside of the map and on get into an
engagement<00:03:34.470> with<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.400> or<00:03:35.610> more<00:03:35.640> people<00:03:36.240> and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
engagement with one or more people and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.420 
engagement with one or more people and
the<00:03:36.960> reason<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.260> threw<00:03:37.560> down<00:03:37.710> at<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.040> motion

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the reason I threw down at that motion

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.100 
the reason I threw down at that motion
sensor<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.000> couple<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.360> seconds<00:03:39.720> ago<00:03:39.930> is

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
sensor just a couple of seconds ago is

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.920 
sensor just a couple of seconds ago is
because<00:03:40.410> people<00:03:40.740> like<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.890> camp<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:42.510> ruins

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
because people like to camp in the ruins

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.720 
because people like to camp in the ruins
so<00:03:43.200> if<00:03:43.380> anyone<00:03:43.710> goes<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> ruins<00:03:44.490> all<00:03:44.610> have

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
so if anyone goes to the ruins all have

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.910 
so if anyone goes to the ruins all have
a<00:03:44.790> general<00:03:45.090> idea<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.630> are<00:03:45.750> there<00:03:45.990> but<00:03:46.740> i

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
a general idea that they are there but i

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.620 
a general idea that they are there but i
do<00:03:46.980> get<00:03:47.250> distracted<00:03:47.580> with<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.120> people<00:03:48.390> down

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
do get distracted with the people down

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.060 
do get distracted with the people down
by<00:03:48.870> these<00:03:49.020> rocks<00:03:49.320> i<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:49.680> actually<00:03:49.800> have<00:03:50.010> a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
by these rocks i don't actually have a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.130 
by these rocks i don't actually have a
call<00:03:50.280> out<00:03:50.460> for<00:03:50.490> this<00:03:50.910> area<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.540> should<00:03:51.990> probably

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
call out for this area I should probably

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.940 
call out for this area I should probably
get<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.720> these<00:03:54.720> guys<00:03:54.900> hold<00:03:55.680> my<00:03:55.860> attention
