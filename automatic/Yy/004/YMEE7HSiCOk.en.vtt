00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.810
 I say go 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.500
 This 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.330
 The explanation is 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.500
 At first it is such a position 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:51.460
 I do not know whether I got it, but it feels like Them's way of life 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.170
 The index finger is standing at the bone 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.050

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.330
 To know 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.110

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.110

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.420
