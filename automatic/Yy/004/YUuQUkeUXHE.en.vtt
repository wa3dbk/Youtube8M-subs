00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:13.069
 in the garage, you and nobody, we are going to discover how the aero 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:14.739
 the aunt of a car 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.159
 for this our volunteers this pnv shares modified by their owners 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.159
 and has arrived at the workshop ready to receive a coat of paint 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.320
 immediately the operators 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.659
 they get to work 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.769
 Several layers of lightweight mansilla and return alicart leave the body in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.380
 perfect state 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.190
 so it's time to go papering the whole body in a way 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.190
 definitive and move to the paint booth 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.100
 Before painting, you have to defend the entire surface thoroughly so that you do not 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.530
 there is no rest 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.780
 once finished 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.119
 we only have to mix the paint and they started painting 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.769
 after two layers separated by several hours 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.769
 the car stays overnight in the cabin 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.400
 with the finished painting 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.240
 It is time to move on to the part that concerns us today 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.840
 airbrushing 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.270
 the first step is to put tape where the drawing will go 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.570
 the painter's tape 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 is rotting much of the side that is 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.690
 then the decree is applied 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.670
 both the shapes and the colors 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.860
 have been previously agreed with the web 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.240
 so it only remains to fix the leaves ical carlos drawings on top of the tape 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.550
 yellow 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.780
 it's time to empty the parts that should go paint 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.620
 a small tool is used for this work 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.590
 you have to carefully cut the yellow tape that the paint only has 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.600
 two days and it could deteriorate 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.759
 so with surgical precision 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.759
 some parts of the reef are being removed 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.990
 before painting the one that covers well the lower part of the car so that it does not receive 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.930
 painting accidentally 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.930
 a ribbon with plastic serves for this work 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.960
 it's time to go to work 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.950
 rodolfo color red 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.820
 and company 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.020
 little by little the drawing is covered with the zapillo 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
 ture grenade 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.409
 the gate has also been filled with tape 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.419
 since here go to another institution 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.419
 A particular 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.919
 the painting is over 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.919
 Now it's time to lift the whole pint 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.699
 there are still many steps to the final finish 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:59.169
 it's time to take the brush arm yourself with patience and make all the edges 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.929
 of the disbursement 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.189
 the drawing begins to take shape 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.740
 a different style has been sought for the classic action 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.210
 away from tattoos are the most fashionable dreams within the world of the bull 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:17.189
 the intention of the gate also takes its final aspect and we can see as one 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.739
 from the sides is almost finished 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.600
 it takes more than ten hours to complete each of the sides 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.579
 with its corresponding epoch 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.709
 yes, things do not get complicated 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.419
 after seeing the retouching and completing the letters of inscriptions that 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.639
 requested the owner of the model 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.179
 it's time to finish the job inside the paint booth 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.850
 one of the specialists 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.890
 He puts on a full suit with a mask to see the expiration at the time 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.499
 being here is the only element with toxic components 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.120
 that water paints 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.199
 they do not have chemical solvents 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.909
 so we get out of the paint booth and see how the body of the pnv 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.909
 pactÃ³ mandoble 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:11.009
 this car stays overnight in the cabin to dry completely until 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.029
 that in the morning the tires are mounted and removed from this rock 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.349
 the tires have taken a separate job 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.369
 they have been painted have been covered with a material called gold leaf in small 

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:31.369
 blades 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.470
 and now they're going to be the tastings so you do not miss this one 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:44.249
 the pnv begins to receive its parts for the final assembly 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:46.860
 the men 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.050
 the bumper grill 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.539
 now the door jacks 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.559
 the rear windows 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.620
 The exhaust pipe 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.090
 even the pilots and mirrors 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.090
 go back to your site 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.449
 our car has been terminal 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.809
 we have seen very quickly how the bodywork is finished 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.409
 modify affected completely 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.639
 c airbrushing and it has been given a final finish 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.110
 It takes several days to complete this process and can only do so 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.430
 make authentic specialists so that the result 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.430
 it would be perfect 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.379
 to us yes it seems to us this bmv has achieved a personal aesthetic and 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.460
 attractive without resorting to an inelegant color 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.960
 both airbrushing and tires are innovative 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.439
 And the result 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.729
 just great 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.779
 very soon we will know more tricks of the world of tuning 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.740
 in the garage tuning peanuts 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.639
 Do not miss it
