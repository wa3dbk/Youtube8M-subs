you<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.170> two<00:00:31.380> ways<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.160> want<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.430> use<00:00:32.550> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
you in two ways if you want to use it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.100 
you in two ways if you want to use it
how<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:34.079> use<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.559> create<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> rig<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
how you can use it not create a rig that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.869 
how you can use it not create a rig that
doesn't<00:00:37.110> work<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.410> well<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.670> create

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
doesn't work so well so when we create

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.250 
doesn't work so well so when we create
the<00:00:38.969> skeleton<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.450> gives<00:00:39.480> us<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.960> auto

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the skeleton it gives us this auto

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
the skeleton it gives us this auto
skeleton<00:00:40.770> generator<00:00:41.129> tool<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.570> creates<00:00:42.780> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
skeleton generator tool and it creates a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.069 
skeleton generator tool and it creates a
very<00:00:43.079> flat<00:00:43.559> planar<00:00:43.860> skeleton<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.750> if<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.899> look

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
very flat planar skeleton and if we look

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.209 
very flat planar skeleton and if we look
at<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:48.170> local<00:00:49.170> rotation<00:00:49.410> axes<00:00:49.680> Maya

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
at the local rotation axes Maya

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
at the local rotation axes Maya
generates<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.329> tool<00:00:51.539> they're

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
generates with this tool they're

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
generates with this tool they're
basically<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.710> world<00:00:53.100> aligned<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
basically all world aligned and that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.939 
basically all world aligned and that
makes<00:00:54.780> sense<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> joints<00:00:55.860> are

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
makes sense because all the joints are

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
makes sense because all the joints are
built<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:57.469> in<00:00:58.579> a<00:00:59.579> flat<00:01:00.000> plane<00:01:00.480> I'm<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
built in a in a flat plane I'm going to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
built in a in a flat plane I'm going to
display<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> local<00:01:02.070> rotation<00:01:02.309> axes<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> now

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
display the local rotation axes so now

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.539 
display the local rotation axes so now
if<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.080> were<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:05.339> ahead<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.900> edit<00:01:06.900> this

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
if I were to go ahead and edit this

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.940 
if I were to go ahead and edit this
clavicle<00:01:08.549> position<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.960> lot<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.590> may

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
clavicle position which I do a lot I may

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580 
clavicle position which I do a lot I may
exaggerate<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.260> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.380> see

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
exaggerate this a little bit you can see

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.460 
exaggerate this a little bit you can see
that<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.130> skeleton<00:01:14.580> doesn't<00:01:15.360> update<00:01:15.840> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that the skeleton doesn't update so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.219 
that the skeleton doesn't update so
normally<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.330> use<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> orient<00:01:18.990> joint

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
normally it would use the orient joint

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.940 
normally it would use the orient joint
tool

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:43.719 

okay<00:01:27.950> usually<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:29.060> works<00:01:41.920> I'm<00:01:42.920> sure<00:01:43.189> that<00:01:43.369> zero

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
okay usually it works I'm sure that zero

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.990 
okay usually it works I'm sure that zero
there<00:01:44.539> we<00:01:44.659> go<00:01:44.810> weird<00:01:45.350> all<00:01:45.950> right<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.340> now<00:01:46.880> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
there we go weird all right so now the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.569 
there we go weird all right so now the
disoriented<00:01:47.689> if<00:01:48.679> we<00:01:48.890> go<00:01:49.009> back<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.220> the

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
disoriented if we go back to the

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.069 
disoriented if we go back to the
character<00:01:49.970> controls<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:50.780> we<00:01:50.929> adjust

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
character controls and we adjust

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.590 
character controls and we adjust
something<00:01:51.530> like<00:01:51.799> neck<00:01:52.070> neck<00:01:52.670> count<00:01:52.970> let's<00:01:53.360> say

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
something like neck neck count let's say

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.649 
something like neck neck count let's say
you<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.409> see<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.799> this<00:01:55.070> axis<00:01:55.729> flipped<00:01:56.479> out

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
you can see that this axis flipped out

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.139 
you can see that this axis flipped out
and<00:01:58.299> inside<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.770> at<00:02:00.770> least<00:02:01.009> for<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.700> full

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
and inside the at least for the full

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.059 
and inside the at least for the full
version<00:02:02.330> Maya<00:02:02.690> under<00:02:03.319> skeleton<00:02:03.799> there's<00:02:04.009> a

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
version Maya under skeleton there's a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.940 
version Maya under skeleton there's a
way<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.420> nearer<00:02:05.420> left<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:05.899> right<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.590> only

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
way to nearer left and right this only

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.100 
way to nearer left and right this only
does<00:02:07.100> position<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.750> basically<00:02:08.750> every<00:02:08.959> time

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
does position and basically every time

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.020 
does position and basically every time
we<00:02:09.200> do<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.319> change<00:02:09.619> any<00:02:09.920> edits<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.580> skeleton

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
we do a change any edits to the skeleton

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.809 
we do a change any edits to the skeleton
you<00:02:11.060> do<00:02:11.330> are<00:02:11.959> going<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.140> get<00:02:12.349> corrupted<00:02:12.890> which

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
you do are going to get corrupted which

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.660 
you do are going to get corrupted which
is<00:02:13.970> no<00:02:14.150> good<00:02:14.980> most<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.130> time<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.549> don't

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
is no good most of the time you don't

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.720 
is no good most of the time you don't
want<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.440> default<00:02:18.440> skeleton<00:02:18.920> shape<00:02:19.220> you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
want that default skeleton shape you

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.479 
want that default skeleton shape you
want<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.000> fit<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.330> your<00:02:20.360> character<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.489> this

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
want to fit it to your character so this

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.309 
want to fit it to your character so this
is<00:02:22.640> good<00:02:22.880> for<00:02:22.910> an<00:02:23.180> initial<00:02:23.569> pass<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.110> then

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
is good for an initial pass and then

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
right here is not going to help you now

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.569 
right here is not going to help you now
the<00:02:30.560> reason<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:33.310> important<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.400> know<00:02:34.549> is

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
the reason this is important to know is

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.640 
the reason this is important to know is
that<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.180> definition<00:02:35.750> by<00:02:36.019> default<00:02:36.410> will<00:02:36.620> be

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
that the definition by default will be

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.599 
that the definition by default will be
set<00:02:37.010> up<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.250> use<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.549> character<00:02:38.739> but<00:02:39.739> I'm

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
set up to use this character but I'm

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.309 
set up to use this character but I'm
going<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.910> recommend<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.630> if<00:02:42.019> you<00:02:42.049> use

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
going to recommend that you if you use

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.830 
going to recommend that you if you use
the<00:02:42.500> skeleton<00:02:42.859> generator<00:02:43.190> just<00:02:43.489> use<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.630> for

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the skeleton generator just use it for

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.660 
the skeleton generator just use it for
the<00:02:44.930> initial<00:02:45.260> pass<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.799> then<00:02:46.069> go<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
the initial pass and then go into the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.670 
the initial pass and then go into the
outliner<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.780> we're<00:02:47.930> going<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.140> turn<00:02:48.470> off

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
outliner and we're going to turn off

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.509 
outliner and we're going to turn off
show<00:02:49.370> dag<00:02:50.060> objects<00:02:50.480> only<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.370> we're<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.489> to

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
show dag objects only and we're going to

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.670 
show dag objects only and we're going to
grab<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.970> node<00:02:53.239> HIPAA<00:02:53.900> skeleton<00:02:54.319> generator

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
grab this node HIPAA skeleton generator

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.160 
grab this node HIPAA skeleton generator
and<00:02:54.950> delete<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.790> now<00:02:56.239> these<00:02:56.810> are<00:02:57.049> no

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170

still<00:03:02.180> map<00:03:02.359> though<00:03:03.069> but<00:03:04.069> let's<00:03:04.910> say<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.239> want

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
still map though but let's say we want

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.530 
still map though but let's say we want
to<00:03:05.620> fix<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.769> Orient's<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.970> we'll<00:03:08.269> go<00:03:08.450> ahead

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
to fix the Orient's so we'll go ahead

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.140 
to fix the Orient's so we'll go ahead
and<00:03:08.739> Orion<00:03:09.739> joint<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.220> then<00:03:10.850> we're<00:03:10.940> going<00:03:11.060> to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
and Orion joint and then we're going to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.530 
and Orion joint and then we're going to
use<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.540> skeleton<00:03:12.049> mirror<00:03:12.319> joint<00:03:12.590> tool<00:03:13.540> just

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
use the skeleton mirror joint tool just

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.940 
use the skeleton mirror joint tool just
make<00:03:14.660> sure<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.989> search<00:03:15.170> for<00:03:15.410> left<00:03:15.620> and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
make sure you search for left and

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.580 
make sure you search for left and
replace<00:03:16.370> with<00:03:16.579> right<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.389> it<00:03:17.989> replaces

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
replace with right so that it replaces

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.830 
replace with right so that it replaces
the<00:03:18.950> default<00:03:19.069> name<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.730> then<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.540> can<00:03:20.690> just

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the default name and then you can just

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.590 
the default name and then you can just
go<00:03:20.959> back<00:03:21.139> in<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.579> remap<00:03:23.650> your<00:03:24.650> nodes<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:26.540> can

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
go back in and remap your nodes you can

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.750 
go back in and remap your nodes you can
just<00:03:26.840> double<00:03:27.109> click<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:28.100> once<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.430> remap

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
just double click and once you remap

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.880 
just double click and once you remap
your<00:03:28.940> nodes

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.030 

you<00:03:36.890> can<00:03:37.190> characterize<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:39.040> your

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
you can characterize it and your

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.090 
you can characterize it and your
skeleton<00:03:40.460> will<00:03:40.610> be<00:03:40.810> set<00:03:41.810> up<00:03:41.840> with<00:03:42.350> better

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
skeleton will be set up with better

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.510 
skeleton will be set up with better
Orient's<00:03:43.610> if<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.390> finish<00:03:44.780> those<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:46.370> can

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
Orient's if I finish those and you can

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.580 
Orient's if I finish those and you can
still<00:03:46.730> use<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.150> table<00:03:47.510> mat<00:03:47.810> characterization

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
still use the table mat characterization

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.430 
still use the table mat characterization
node<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:49.040> save<00:03:49.910> yourself<00:03:50.240> some<00:03:50.360> time<00:03:50.570> now

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
node and save yourself some time now

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.620 
node and save yourself some time now
once<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.100> once<00:03:52.550> you've<00:03:52.700> got<00:03:52.910> your<00:03:52.940> skeleton

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
once you once you've got your skeleton

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.510 
once you once you've got your skeleton
generated<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.710> may<00:03:54.860> have<00:03:55.010> changed<00:03:55.400> the

generated and you may have changed the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.420 
generated and you may have changed the
names<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.090> remap<00:03:56.750> things<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.220> go<00:03:58.340> ahead

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
names and remap things you can go ahead

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.290 
names and remap things you can go ahead
and<00:03:58.580> do<00:03:59.090> an<00:03:59.330> edit<00:03:59.680> definition<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.090> go<00:04:02.090> ahead

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
and do an edit definition and go ahead

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.670 
and do an edit definition and go ahead
and<00:04:02.450> save<00:04:02.720> your<00:04:04.090> definition<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:05.930> can<00:04:06.170> save

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
and save your definition so you can save

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.580 
and save your definition so you can save
this<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.640> your<00:04:08.510> own<00:04:08.570> custom<00:04:08.990> skeleton<00:04:09.410> name

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
this as your own custom skeleton name

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.050 
this as your own custom skeleton name
and<00:04:09.830> you'll<00:04:10.490> be<00:04:10.580> able<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.790> recharacterize

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
and you'll be able to recharacterize

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.880 
and you'll be able to recharacterize
without<00:04:11.840> having<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.260> use<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.500> skeleton

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
without having to use the skeleton

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.670 
without having to use the skeleton
builder<00:04:13.190> each<00:04:13.790> time<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.300> have<00:04:14.960> to<00:04:15.080> redo<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.560> by

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
builder each time and have to redo it by

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.040 
builder each time and have to redo it by
hand<00:04:15.920> so<00:04:16.520> you<00:04:16.580> can<00:04:16.970> reuse<00:04:17.150> these<00:04:17.570> definitions

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
hand so you can reuse these definitions

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.790 
hand so you can reuse these definitions
and<00:04:18.770> it<00:04:18.920> creates<00:04:19.520> a<00:04:19.580> little<00:04:19.700> XML<00:04:20.150> file<00:04:20.360> that

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
and it creates a little XML file that

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.920 
and it creates a little XML file that
maps<00:04:21.800> everything<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> hope<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.510> helps

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
maps everything so I hope that helps

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.350 
maps everything so I hope that helps
Thanks
