out<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.200> sunlight<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.830> needs<00:01:49.980> in<00:01:50.190> direct

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
out of sunlight it needs in direct

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.780 
out of sunlight it needs in direct
sunlight<00:01:50.940> as<00:01:52.220> basically<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.370> want<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.520> sit<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
sunlight as basically you want to sit it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.060 
sunlight as basically you want to sit it
on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> counter<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.570> light<00:01:55.080> shines<00:01:55.860> through

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
on the counter or light shines through

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.090 
on the counter or light shines through
but<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.870> never<00:01:57.990> want<00:01:58.380> sunlight<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
but not on it you never want sunlight to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.250 
but not on it you never want sunlight to
hit<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.460> because<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.880> actually<00:02:00.150> killed<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
hit it because it actually killed the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260 
hit it because it actually killed the
mycelium<00:02:01.950> which<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> stop<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> growth<00:02:02.940> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
mycelium which to stop the growth and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.050 
mycelium which to stop the growth and
kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.510> basically<00:02:04.230> melt<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> mushroom<00:02:05.100> so

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
kind of basically melt the mushroom so

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.749 
kind of basically melt the mushroom so
if<00:02:06.300> you<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:07.220> some<00:02:08.220> light<00:02:08.369> shining

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
if you just have some light shining

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.669 
if you just have some light shining
through<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.940> window<00:02:09.239> somewhere<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
through a window somewhere that the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.089 
through a window somewhere that the
signing

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
signing

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.979 
signing
but<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.730> brightness<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.269> just<00:02:12.569> sit<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.840> right

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
but the brightness is just sit it right

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.430 
but the brightness is just sit it right
there<00:02:13.170> usually<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.560> counter<00:02:14.069> does<00:02:14.940> good<00:02:15.440> you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
there usually a counter does good you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.050 
there usually a counter does good you
can<00:02:16.590> grow<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.860> under<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.220> us<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.519> lights<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
can grow it under for us and lights you

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.270 
can grow it under for us and lights you
just<00:02:19.049> don't<00:02:19.230> want<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.469> right<00:02:19.680> underneath<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
just don't want it right underneath it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.610 
just don't want it right underneath it
or<00:02:20.430> nothing

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
or nothing

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.949 
or nothing
but<00:02:21.830> yeah<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.430> should<00:02:22.670> grow<00:02:22.790> pretty<00:02:23.629> easy<00:02:23.810> as

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
but yeah it should grow pretty easy as

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.930 
but yeah it should grow pretty easy as
long<00:02:24.080> as<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.230> keep<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.590> misted<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.790> don't

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
long as you keep it misted you don't

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.520 
long as you keep it misted you don't
want<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> miss<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.629> mushroom<00:02:27.049> Kitty<00:02:27.290> when<00:02:27.470> I

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
want to miss the mushroom Kitty when I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.369 
want to miss the mushroom Kitty when I
miss<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.920> inside<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.640> cover<00:02:28.849> bag<00:02:29.379> so

without<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.390> it's<00:02:32.390> been<00:02:32.810> ruined<00:02:34.959> I'm<00:02:35.959> not<00:02:36.140> sure

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
without it it's been ruined I'm not sure

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.809 
without it it's been ruined I'm not sure
