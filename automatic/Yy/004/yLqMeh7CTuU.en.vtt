in<00:00:08.940> Fort<00:00:09.179> Collins<00:00:09.210> Colorado<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:10.200> asked<00:00:10.920> them

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
in Fort Collins Colorado I asked them

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.380 
in Fort Collins Colorado I asked them
how<00:00:11.370> they<00:00:11.400> designed<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.179> tested<00:00:12.480> their<00:00:12.929> cases

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.460 

the<00:00:18.390> first<00:00:18.600> thing<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.840> start<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.230> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the first thing we start with is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.460 
the first thing we start with is
obviously<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> device<00:00:20.490> itself<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.470> what

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
obviously the device itself and what

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.019 
obviously the device itself and what
OtterBox<00:00:22.830> does<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.430> make<00:00:23.609> rugged

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
OtterBox does is we make rugged

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.250 
OtterBox does is we make rugged
protection<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:25.080> those<00:00:25.199> devices<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.960> we<00:00:27.960> start

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
protection for those devices so we start

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.400 
protection for those devices so we start
with<00:00:28.910> just<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.119> surface<00:00:30.570> itself<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.349> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
with just the surface itself and we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.740 
with just the surface itself and we
build<00:00:31.650> from<00:00:31.830> there<00:00:32.329> otterbox<00:00:33.329> probably<00:00:33.660> more

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
build from there otterbox probably more

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
build from there otterbox probably more
than<00:00:33.870> any<00:00:34.020> other<00:00:34.140> case<00:00:34.350> manufacturer<00:00:35.070> out

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
than any other case manufacturer out

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.180 
than any other case manufacturer out
there<00:00:35.399> does<00:00:36.329> rugged<00:00:36.750> protection<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.890> mean

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
there does rugged protection so I mean

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.260 
there does rugged protection so I mean
just<00:00:38.340> looking<00:00:38.520> at<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.700> product<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> can

you're going to retain silicone plastic

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.920 
you're going to retain silicone plastic
in<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:06.270> example<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.720> our<00:01:06.780> defender<00:01:07.170> series

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930

this rugged as possible and keep that
look<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.229> eliminate<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.770> much<00:01:16.920> best

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
look and you know eliminate as much best

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
look and you know eliminate as much best
intrusion<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.909> possible<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.390> taking<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.049> lot

intrusion as possible just taking a lot

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
intrusion as possible just taking a lot
of<00:01:19.650> factors<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.250> into<00:01:20.700> place<00:01:20.909> silicone<00:01:21.750> is

of factors in the into place silicone is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
of factors in the into place silicone is
probably<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.710> know<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.100> been<00:01:23.250> around<00:01:23.759> since

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
probably you know it's been around since

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.260 
probably you know it's been around since
I've<00:01:24.180> been<00:01:24.299> our<00:01:24.390> daughters<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.320> what

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
I've been our daughters you know what

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.429 
I've been our daughters you know what
this<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.330> pretty<00:01:27.659> much<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> outside<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
this is pretty much on the outside of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
this is pretty much on the outside of
every<00:01:28.619> device<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.460> vary<00:01:30.030> every<00:01:30.119> defender

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
every device that we vary every defender

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.969 
every device that we vary every defender
case<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.530> durable

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
case that we have it's just as durable

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.520 
case that we have it's just as durable
you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:33.079> material<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.200> really

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
you know material it's really

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.100 
you know material it's really
heat-resistant<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.689> drops

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
heat-resistant I can take drops

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
heat-resistant I can take drops
extremely<00:01:37.920> well<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.820> kind<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
extremely well you know so it's kind of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.590 
extremely well you know so it's kind of
the<00:01:39.150> foundation<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:40.369> what<00:01:41.369> our<00:01:41.430> cases<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the foundation of what our cases are and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.920 
the foundation of what our cases are and
then<00:01:43.369> we<00:01:44.369> generally<00:01:44.759> underneath<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.509> defender

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
then we generally underneath on defender

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.800 
then we generally underneath on defender
cases<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.610> polycarbonate<00:01:47.810> assembly

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
cases we have a polycarbonate assembly

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
cases we have a polycarbonate assembly
so<00:01:49.220> polycarbonate<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.549> good

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so polycarbonate is a really good

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.770 
so polycarbonate is a really good
material<00:01:51.149> because<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
material because I

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.730 
material because I
and<00:01:52.869> it's<00:01:53.020> really<00:01:53.170> drop<00:01:53.440> resistant<00:01:54.010> it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and it's really drop resistant it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.920 
and it's really drop resistant it
doesn't<00:01:56.740> generally<00:01:57.040> shatter<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.720> then<00:01:58.810> on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
doesn't generally shatter so and then on

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.230 
doesn't generally shatter so and then on
cases<00:01:59.320> like<00:01:59.350> our<00:01:59.590> tablet<00:01:59.950> case<00:02:00.100> or<00:02:00.580> for<00:02:00.940> cases

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
cases like our tablet case or for cases

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.789 
cases like our tablet case or for cases
like<00:02:01.270> our<00:02:01.509> tablet<00:02:01.780> cases<00:02:01.930> we<00:02:02.170> do<00:02:02.290> things<00:02:02.560> like

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
like our tablet cases we do things like

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.760 
like our tablet cases we do things like
put<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> soft<00:02:03.640> material<00:02:04.600> on<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.720> inside<00:02:05.049> so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
put a soft material on the inside so

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.779 
put a soft material on the inside so
filter<00:02:06.759> foam<00:02:07.060> or<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.130> hearing<00:02:09.369> at<00:02:09.580> that

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
filter foam or so I like hearing at that

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.390 
filter foam or so I like hearing at that
one<00:02:10.000> we've<00:02:10.330> got<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.690> felt<00:02:11.560> liner<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.280> when

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
one we've got this felt liner so when

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.710 
one we've got this felt liner so when
you're<00:02:12.489> sliding<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.850> device<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.300> there<00:02:13.450> just

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you're sliding your device in there just

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.390 
you're sliding your device in there just
kind<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.959> trails<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.800> make<00:02:14.980> sure<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.160> doesn't

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
kind of trails that make sure it doesn't

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.750 
kind of trails that make sure it doesn't
get<00:02:15.459> scratched<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.000> inside<00:02:17.760> OtterBox

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
get scratched on the inside OtterBox

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.910 
get scratched on the inside OtterBox
also<00:02:19.090> does<00:02:19.270> things<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.690> pc<00:02:20.050> windows<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.650> if

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
also does things like pc windows so if

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.160 
also does things like pc windows so if
you<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.160> have<00:02:21.310> an<00:02:21.400> exposed<00:02:21.700> area<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.870> did<00:02:22.989> these

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
you do have an exposed area we did these

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.840 
you do have an exposed area we did these
manatee<00:02:23.560> windows<00:02:23.860> yeah<00:02:24.100> we<00:02:24.220> definitely<00:02:24.430> try

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
manatee windows yeah we definitely try

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.350 
manatee windows yeah we definitely try
to<00:02:24.910> take<00:02:25.450> both<00:02:26.140> stuff<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.830> we<00:02:27.360> learn

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
to take both stuff that we learn

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360 
to take both stuff that we learn
internally<00:02:29.080> from<00:02:29.320> using<00:02:29.680> our<00:02:29.800> cases<00:02:30.220> and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
internally from using our cases and

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.130 
internally from using our cases and
testing<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:31.090> know<00:02:31.209> we<00:02:31.360> try<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.570> test<00:02:31.810> our

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
testing you know we try to test our

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.440 
testing you know we try to test our
product<00:02:32.530> as<00:02:32.650> much<00:02:32.830> as<00:02:32.980> possible<00:02:33.130> as<00:02:33.640> well<00:02:34.269> as

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
product as much as possible as well as

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
product as much as possible as well as
taking<00:02:34.720> customer<00:02:36.330> customer<00:02:37.330> suggestions<00:02:38.170> and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
taking customer customer suggestions and

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.840 
taking customer customer suggestions and
you<00:02:38.650> know<00:02:38.769> if<00:02:38.890> they<00:02:39.010> have<00:02:39.160> some<00:02:39.340> complaints

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
you know if they have some complaints

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.979 
you know if they have some complaints
taking<00:02:40.150> them<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.360> heart<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.600> figuring<00:02:40.989> out

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
taking them to heart and figuring out

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.160 
taking them to heart and figuring out
how<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:41.230> can<00:02:41.470> remedy<00:02:42.250> those<00:02:42.430> issues<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.360> good

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
how we can remedy those issues so a good

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.710 
how we can remedy those issues so a good
example<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:44.800> typing<00:02:45.370> angles<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.940> this

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
example is that typing angles that this

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.900 
example is that typing angles that this
has<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.170> couple<00:02:47.590> great<00:02:47.800> media<00:02:48.190> modes<00:02:48.430> but<00:02:48.700> not

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
has a couple great media modes but not

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.670 
has a couple great media modes but not
necessarily<00:02:49.450> one<00:02:49.720> that's<00:02:49.959> great<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.319> typing

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
necessarily one that's great for typing

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.330 
necessarily one that's great for typing
a<00:02:50.830> lot<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.489> customers<00:02:51.970> wanted<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:54.220> know

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
a lot of customers wanted it so you know

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.580 
a lot of customers wanted it so you know
incorporated<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.180> pretty-pretty<00:02:55.870> elegantly

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
incorporated it pretty-pretty elegantly

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.900 
incorporated it pretty-pretty elegantly
so<00:02:56.890> testing<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.850> do<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.269> lot<00:02:58.660> internally<00:02:59.910> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
so testing we do a lot internally to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.460 
so testing we do a lot internally to
test<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:01.329> functionality<00:03:01.810> whenever<00:03:02.320> we're

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
test for functionality whenever we're

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.880 
test for functionality whenever we're
designing<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.980> case<00:03:03.190> will<00:03:03.489> be<00:03:03.610> praying<00:03:04.000> off<00:03:04.239> the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
designing a case will be praying off the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.259 
designing a case will be praying off the
prototypes<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.190> fitting<00:03:06.670> them<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.150> and

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
prototypes and fitting them to it and

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.300 
prototypes and fitting them to it and
making<00:03:07.480> sure<00:03:07.780> everything's<00:03:08.230> exposed<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.010> as

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
making sure everything's exposed and as

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.860 
making sure everything's exposed and as
Center<00:03:10.090> as<00:03:10.209> possible<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.400> such<00:03:12.400> things

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
Center as possible and such things

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.060 
Center as possible and such things
testing<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> camera<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.560> make<00:03:14.709> sure<00:03:14.890> there's

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
testing the camera to make sure there's

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.580 
testing the camera to make sure there's
no<00:03:15.570> interference<00:03:16.570> between<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.959> flashing<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.470 

thing<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.379> it<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.950> will<00:03:36.040> pull<00:03:36.340> tell<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.330> how

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
thing but it it will pull tell you how

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.270 
thing but it it will pull tell you how
many<00:03:37.540> pounds<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.140> force<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.560> takes<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.920> get<00:03:39.220> a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
many pounds of force it takes to get a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.130 
many pounds of force it takes to get a

device out of the holster how far along
to<00:03:41.620> break<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:42.640> break<00:03:42.879> something<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.629> have<00:03:43.720> to

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
to break to break something you have to

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.960 
to break to break something you have to
stretch<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.379> silicone<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.159> can<00:03:45.310> also<00:03:45.459> push

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
stretch the silicone you can also push

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.539 
stretch the silicone you can also push
to<00:03:46.720> see<00:03:46.900> how<00:03:47.079> how<00:03:47.500> much<00:03:47.739> force<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.220> takes<00:03:48.250> to

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
to see how how much force it takes to
