00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 and well for many years it has been said 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.799
 For many years, it has been better said 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.030
 said that the progress of a society is 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.660
 measured by the treatment he gives his 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.090
 animals 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.250
 in Mexico, the abuse that is given to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 puppies and cats for example is 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 indescribable but there is still a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400
 heroes who are dedicated to take care of them and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.820
 protect them I present these beings of 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820
 sidewalks 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.869
 although each puppy is a new 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.879
 experience a new opportunity is the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.710
 first and only dog sanctuary in 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.170
 Latin America 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 everyday miracles do 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.970
 canines restore and rehabilitate dogs 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.879
 in very extreme situations like cases 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.030
 of cancer without blind deaf feet 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 burned tortured paralyzed raped 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.450
 drugged macheteados mutilated all of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.610
 what the human being is capable of 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.020
 and the story with a sad beginning is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.120
 became a great opportunity to 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.520
 help the most vulnerable to whom 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.600
 have no voice to ask for help so 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.730
 does as a result of an unfortunate event 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.970
 that was the death of my dachshund 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.800
 I nail he drowned in my house I do not 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.690
 I understood why he had died because 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.110
 I was very young I did not understand the meaning 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.390
 of his death and I started to rescue one and 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.160
 to another and now you can say that the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.330
 sense of death of the slave it 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.330
 called canine miracles 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.159

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.229
 house and given his time to 128 puppies 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.399
 that she herself has picked up from the street or 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.170
 that have led him with very few 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.049
 possibilities of living in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.630
 more extreme situations more sad the 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.909

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.710

 world he had the very bad luck of 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.140
 cross in the path of a group of 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.049
 each one of the crimes like when 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.929
 they cut them to humans that are 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.179

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.970

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.769
 14 people are part of this 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.349
 project that has returned his life what 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.940
 same rice with milk has played here and 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.780
 lemon 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.940
 chilaquil 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.800
 is that it bears the name of food because 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.800
 she says they are food for the soul 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.460
 by means of caress therapy 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.830
 nutritional projects and treatments 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.020
 doctors often very expensive the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.150
 animals have another chance and they 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.290
 they give an opportunity to another the seer of 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.780
 view 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.530
 look at children with cerebral palsy with 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:46.480
 Down syndrome or older adults or 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.790
 street children autistic children and they 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.070
 help us to save caress therapy 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.510
 to the dogs without knowing that they themselves 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.000
 they are receiving the woman that all 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.020
 the days do miracles and she is part 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.020
 of the dreams of sidewalks 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.560
 we already saw it there are still people who 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.050
 makes the treatment of animals in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.330
 mexico speak well in the rest of the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.099
 trot and it is also a subject that has been 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.180
 tried a lot but we still do not get the 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.700
 20 not as it should to protect 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.700
 animals 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.580
 it's really a question that seems 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.930
 we do not fit in the head but it's the way 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.209
 which reflects the state of a 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.069
 society we already said it and it's worth much more 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.530
 It's worth adopting a puppy that 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.690
 buy it and thus end this circle 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.010
 vicious of abuse 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.910
 terrible good fortunately there are 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.910
 organizations like this
