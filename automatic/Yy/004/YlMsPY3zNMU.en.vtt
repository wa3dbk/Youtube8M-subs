but I never was interested in them and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.630 
but I never was interested in them and
it<00:00:33.360> has<00:00:35.570> viewing<00:00:36.570> limbs<00:00:36.780> viewfinder<00:00:37.640> probably

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it has viewing limbs viewfinder probably

no sign no company name on it and
eventually<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.170> decided<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.739> try<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.160> into

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
eventually I decided to try and get into

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.840 
eventually I decided to try and get into
it<00:00:59.609> see<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:01.640> had<00:01:02.640> some

it see what was in there had some
trouble<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> eventually<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> found<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.229> the

Roebuck<00:01:14.189> 1905<00:01:16.340> but<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> thing<00:01:17.460> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
Roebuck 1905 but the thing that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.899 
Roebuck 1905 but the thing that
interested<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.270> were<00:01:18.570> these<00:01:18.720> wooden<00:01:19.259> things

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
interested me were these wooden things

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.920 
interested me were these wooden things
there's<00:01:20.909> sort<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.180> an<00:01:21.299> empty<00:01:21.570> compartment

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
there's sort of an empty compartment

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.030 
there's sort of an empty compartment
that<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.380> hold<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:23.869> then<00:01:24.869> there's<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.560> more

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that would hold two then there's a more

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
that would hold two then there's a more
tight<00:01:26.479> active<00:01:27.479> compartment<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.200> i<00:01:28.320> assume

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
tight active compartment which i assume

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.120 
tight active compartment which i assume
is<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:31.100> photo-taking<00:01:32.150> compartment<00:01:34.130> which

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
is the photo-taking compartment which

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.310 
is the photo-taking compartment which
holds<00:01:35.430> another<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.909> very<00:01:36.900> tight<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.170> would

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
holds another one very tight so I would

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.510 
holds another one very tight so I would
assume<00:01:40.520> someone<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:42.590> get<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:43.890> three<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
assume someone would get maybe three of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.859 
assume someone would get maybe three of
these<00:01:44.700> film<00:01:45.689> holders<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.750> load<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.079> with

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
these film holders and load them up with

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.730 
these film holders and load them up with
here's<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> guess<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.130> know

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
here's what I guess and I don't know

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.420 
here's what I guess and I don't know
these<00:01:55.740> look<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.070> glass<00:01:56.610> plates<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:59.130> looks

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
these look like glass plates this looks

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.540 
these look like glass plates this looks
like<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.909> rubber<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> cardboard

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
like a rubber or a cardboard

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.960 
like a rubber or a cardboard
and<00:02:03.550> they<00:02:04.030> would<00:02:04.150> load<00:02:04.330> these<00:02:04.630> up<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:08.759> put<00:02:09.759> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and they would load these up and put the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.450 
and they would load these up and put the
side<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.509> said<00:02:10.720> exposed<00:02:11.820> inside<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:14.460> notice

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
side that said exposed inside I notice

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.820 
side that said exposed inside I notice
this<00:02:15.580> one<00:02:15.790> doesn't<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.330> plate<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:19.830> assume

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
this one doesn't have a plate I assume

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.290 
this one doesn't have a plate I assume
ease<00:02:21.100> were<00:02:21.220> not<00:02:21.370> film<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.790> guess<00:02:21.970> these<00:02:22.150> were

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
ease were not film I guess these were

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.200 
ease were not film I guess these were
dry<00:02:22.570> plates<00:02:23.310> maybe<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.490> sent<00:02:24.760> them<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:24.970> for

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
dry plates maybe they sent them out for

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.670 
dry plates maybe they sent them out for
development<00:02:25.720> later<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.020> really<00:02:26.350> don't<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.590> I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
development later I really don't know I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.850 
development later I really don't know I
don't<00:02:26.800> know<00:02:26.920> anything<00:02:27.190> about<00:02:27.310> photography

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
don't know anything about photography

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.970 
don't know anything about photography
but<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.750> was<00:02:31.750> wondering<00:02:31.960> if<00:02:32.230> they<00:02:32.410> were<00:02:32.740> in<00:02:32.860> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
but I was wondering if they were in the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.740 
but I was wondering if they were in the
dark<00:02:33.250> every<00:02:33.790> time<00:02:33.940> they<00:02:34.090> took<00:02:34.210> an<00:02:34.360> exposure

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
dark every time they took an exposure

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.050 
dark every time they took an exposure
they<00:02:34.959> would<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.410> switch<00:02:36.280> these<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:36.940> they

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
they would have to switch these so they

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.020 
they would have to switch these so they
probably<00:02:37.300> got<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> dark<00:02:37.959> somewhere<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
probably got in the dark somewhere and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.090 
probably got in the dark somewhere and
took<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.060> out<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.320> proud<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.650> flip<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.920> over

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
took that out and proud to flip it over

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.620 
took that out and proud to flip it over
I<00:02:42.250> notice<00:02:42.610> there's<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.850> couple<00:02:43.150> little<00:02:43.240> nubs

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
I notice there's a couple little nubs

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.440 
I notice there's a couple little nubs
here<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.230> would<00:02:44.380> have<00:02:44.500> been<00:02:45.060> helpful<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
here that would have been helpful to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.400 
here that would have been helpful to
know<00:02:47.760> when<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.880> side<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.360> said<00:02:49.540> exposed<00:02:49.930> was

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
know when the side that said exposed was

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.280 
know when the side that said exposed was
right<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:52.140> guess<00:02:53.140> they<00:02:53.290> could<00:02:53.440> take<00:02:54.239> six

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
right I guess they could take six

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.750 
right I guess they could take six
exposures<00:02:56.290> during<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.800> day<00:02:56.980> before<00:02:57.310> they<00:02:57.580> had

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
exposures during the day before they had

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.540 
exposures during the day before they had
to<00:02:57.880> call<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.209> quits<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:59.760> like<00:03:00.760> these<00:03:02.220> nice<00:03:03.220> would

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
to call it quits I like these nice would

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.770 
to call it quits I like these nice would
I<00:03:03.760> think<00:03:03.970> it's<00:03:04.120> cherry<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:06.190> there's<00:03:06.370> no

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
I think it's cherry that there's no

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.630 
I think it's cherry that there's no
company<00:03:07.780> name<00:03:07.989> on<00:03:08.230> here<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:11.370> did<00:03:12.370> as<00:03:12.489> much

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
company name on here I did as much

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.150 
company name on here I did as much
research<00:03:13.060> as<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.360> could<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.900> they<00:03:14.800> look<00:03:15.040> a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
research as I could and I they look a

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.940 
research as I could and I they look a
little<00:03:15.310> bit<00:03:15.580> like<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:17.019> was<00:03:17.170> Sears<00:03:17.560> Sears

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
little bit like if it was Sears Sears

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.780 
little bit like if it was Sears Sears
had<00:03:18.220> an<00:03:18.370> in-house<00:03:18.760> shop<00:03:19.330> named<00:03:19.660> Connolly<00:03:20.790> that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
had an in-house shop named Connolly that

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.370 
had an in-house shop named Connolly that
made<00:03:22.000> some<00:03:22.299> cameras<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.810> looks<00:03:22.989> somewhat<00:03:23.350> like

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
made some cameras it looks somewhat like

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.070 
made some cameras it looks somewhat like
this<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.310> shutter<00:03:25.150> speed<00:03:25.510> selector<00:03:25.959> was

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
this but this shutter speed selector was

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.460 
this but this shutter speed selector was
over<00:03:26.290> here<00:03:27.060> or<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.480> wasn't<00:03:28.930> there<00:03:29.320> was<00:03:29.440> a

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
over here or if it wasn't there was a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.009 
over here or if it wasn't there was a
second<00:03:29.890> viewfinder<00:03:30.400> over<00:03:30.610> here<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.150> there

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
second viewfinder over here and there

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.350 
second viewfinder over here and there
was<00:03:32.110> also<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.380> company<00:03:32.769> named<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.280> Western

was also a company named a Western
camera<00:03:34.360> which<00:03:34.660> was<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> part<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.290> something

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500

called Rochester camera Rochester

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.430 
called Rochester camera Rochester
optical<00:03:38.769> eventually<00:03:39.810> four<00:03:40.810> or<00:03:40.930> five<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.170> these

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
optical eventually four or five of these

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.110 
optical eventually four or five of these
that<00:03:41.799> were<00:03:41.920> eventually<00:03:42.160> bought<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.549> light<00:03:42.820> by

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
that were eventually bought a light by

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.970 
that were eventually bought a light by
Kodak<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:44.730> got<00:03:45.730> into<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.390> front<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:50.590> see<00:03:50.799> what

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
Kodak I got into the front to see what

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.479 
Kodak I got into the front to see what
was<00:03:51.130> behind<00:03:51.160> here<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.340> here's<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.850> shutter

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
was behind here and here's the shutter

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:07.150 
was behind here and here's the shutter
pretty<00:03:57.489> simple

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.310 

and<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.340> we<00:04:08.460> can<00:04:08.610> see<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:09.000> going<00:04:09.270> right<00:04:10.170> the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
and if we can see that going right the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.539 
and if we can see that going right the
other<00:04:10.440> way<00:04:10.650> here<00:04:15.500> if<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:17.010> move<00:04:17.190> proved<00:04:17.459> it

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
other way here if you can move proved it

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.300 
other way here if you can move proved it
all<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.790> way<00:04:17.910> over<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.090> t<00:04:18.480> I<00:04:19.160> guess<00:04:20.160> that's

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
all the way over to t I guess that's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.110 
all the way over to t I guess that's
like<00:04:20.549> our<00:04:20.730> Bowl<00:04:21.030> what<00:04:21.420> we<00:04:21.570> would<00:04:21.720> call<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:23.030> and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.730 

it's<00:04:27.120> constantly<00:04:27.600> open<00:04:27.960> now<00:04:28.080> until<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.410> press

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
it's constantly open now until I press

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.410 
it's constantly open now until I press
it<00:04:28.770> again<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:32.340> apparently<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.180> little

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
it again so this apparently the little

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.840 
it again so this apparently the little
lever<00:04:33.660> here<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.880> what<00:04:36.180> controls<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:37.080> shutter

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
lever here is what controls the shutter

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:50.200 
lever here is what controls the shutter
from<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.060> angle

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.480 

see<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.020> move<00:04:51.259> as<00:04:51.560> we<00:04:51.710> get<00:04:51.860> more<00:04:51.889> towards<00:04:52.370> the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
see that move as we get more towards the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.820 
see that move as we get more towards the
bulb

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.400 

and<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.700> was<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.540> as<00:04:59.870> far<00:05:00.080> as<00:05:00.110> how<00:05:00.350> the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
and that was it as far as how the

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.940 
and that was it as far as how the
shutter<00:05:00.740> works<00:05:01.120> couldn't<00:05:02.120> be<00:05:02.240> simpler<00:05:05.950> yes

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
shutter works couldn't be simpler yes

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:21.420 
shutter works couldn't be simpler yes
it's<00:05:07.190> locked<00:05:07.490> man<00:05:17.740> so<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:19.220> viewfinder<00:05:20.150> is

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
it's locked man so the viewfinder is

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.710 
it's locked man so the viewfinder is
totally<00:05:22.430> clouded<00:05:22.910> up<00:05:23.030> looks<00:05:23.360> like<00:05:23.510> it's<00:05:23.660> just

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
totally clouded up looks like it's just

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.190 
totally clouded up looks like it's just
a<00:05:23.900> simple<00:05:24.230> prism<00:05:24.680> I<00:05:25.450> really<00:05:26.450> can't<00:05:26.690> hardly<00:05:26.990> see

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
a simple prism I really can't hardly see

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.330 
a simple prism I really can't hardly see
anything<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.680> when<00:05:27.890> I<00:05:27.920> look<00:05:28.070> through<00:05:28.250> the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
anything that when I look through the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.730 
anything that when I look through the
viewfinder<00:05:28.370> is<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.570> operator<00:05:29.960> would<00:05:32.740> but

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
viewfinder is the operator would but

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.070 
viewfinder is the operator would but
that's<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.520> camera<00:05:34.910> I'm<00:05:35.120> not<00:05:35.480> sure<00:05:35.540> the<00:05:35.930> name

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
that's the camera I'm not sure the name

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.050 
that's the camera I'm not sure the name
of<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.320> manufacturer<00:05:36.860> or<00:05:37.220> exactly<00:05:37.760> how<00:05:37.910> it's

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
of the manufacturer or exactly how it's

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.730 
of the manufacturer or exactly how it's
used<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.450> think<00:05:38.660> it's<00:05:38.780> something<00:05:38.990> called<00:05:39.410> a<00:05:39.500> dry

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
used I think it's something called a dry

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.030 
used I think it's something called a dry
plate<00:05:43.420> that's<00:05:44.420> my<00:05:44.630> best<00:05:44.900> guess<00:05:45.020> as<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.410> how<00:05:45.920> it

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
plate that's my best guess as to how it

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.940 
plate that's my best guess as to how it
works<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:47.110> like<00:05:48.110> I<00:05:48.230> say<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:48.500> might<00:05:48.770> be<00:05:48.920> a

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
works and like I say it might be a

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.100 
works and like I say it might be a
Connelly<00:05:49.490> or<00:05:49.700> a<00:05:49.990> western<00:05:50.990> camera<00:05:51.500> or

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
Connelly or a western camera or

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.440 
Connelly or a western camera or
rochester<00:05:55.660> optical<00:05:56.660> company<00:05:56.840> camera
