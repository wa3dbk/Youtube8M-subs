as I said today we're not going to clean
this<00:02:50.459> okay<00:02:51.459> put<00:02:51.819> this<00:02:51.939> back<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.530> car

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.510 

trial<00:03:10.250> sceptic<00:03:10.790> down<00:03:11.030> back

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:33.440 

only<00:03:18.240> one<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.540> find<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.960> which<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.760> crook<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.970> I

I think this is a curve to us about
which<00:03:38.580> one
