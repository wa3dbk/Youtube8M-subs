00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
browsing around the back you can see

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.979

that<00:01:02.820> we've<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> camera<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.870> not

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that we've got a camera here I'm not

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
that we've got a camera here I'm not
exactly<00:01:04.290> sure<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> resolution<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.489> on

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
exactly sure what the resolution is on

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
exactly sure what the resolution is on
that<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.990> tell<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.500> probably

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that but you can tell that it's probably

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
that but you can tell that it's probably
not<00:01:08.580> great<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.299> tablet<00:01:09.810> cameras<00:01:10.200> never

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
not great because tablet cameras never

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.929 
not great because tablet cameras never

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
just stock that in there we go and the
keyboard<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.200> really<00:01:19.200> nice<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:19.920> this

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
keyboard is really really nice now this

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
keyboard is really really nice now this
is<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> business<00:01:20.700> focused<00:01:21.360> device<00:01:21.689> that

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
is a business focused device that

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
is a business focused device that
actually<00:01:22.560> comes<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.979> bit<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> track

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
actually comes with a bit of a track

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.859 
actually comes with a bit of a track
point<00:01:23.790> along<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.180> side<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.750> see

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
point along this side there you can see

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.890 
point along this side there you can see
the<00:01:25.020> Kensington<00:01:25.619> lock<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.720> that's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the Kensington lock I think that's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.899 
the Kensington lock I think that's
another<00:01:28.110> form<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> keyboard<00:01:29.549> lock<00:01:29.700> maybe

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
another form of the keyboard lock maybe

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.600 
another form of the keyboard lock maybe
a<00:01:30.210> full-size<00:01:30.900> VGA<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.040> full<00:01:32.250> size<00:01:32.400> HDMI

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
a full-size VGA and a full size HDMI

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
a full-size VGA and a full size HDMI
which<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> always<00:01:33.900> great<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.560> trying

even<00:01:47.909> down<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> fact<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.200> keys

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
even down to the fact that the keys

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.050 
even down to the fact that the keys
almost<00:01:49.799> had<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.220> bit<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.399> sculpting<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
almost had a little bit of sculpting in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
almost had a little bit of sculpting in
them<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.990> much<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.350> you'd<00:01:52.500> find<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
them not as much as you'd find with a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.130 
them not as much as you'd find with a
think<00:01:53.130> pad<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:54.090> still<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> there

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
think pad but it's still kind of there

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
think pad but it's still kind of there
now<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.860> track<00:01:56.189> point<00:01:56.520> seems<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.390> nice<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
now the track point seems very nice and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.950 
now the track point seems very nice and
responsive<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.310> of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
responsive it's got that same kind of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.440 
responsive it's got that same kind of
kind<00:02:01.620> of<00:02:01.740> finished<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.970> found<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
kind of finished that you found on the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
kind of finished that you found on the
on<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.590> ThinkPad<00:02:04.950> devices<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.580> have<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
on the ThinkPad devices and you have to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.109 
on the ThinkPad devices and you have to
the<00:02:07.070> right<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.190> left<00:02:08.310> shift<00:02:08.580> keys<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:08.940> there

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the right and left shift keys down there

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.760 
the right and left shift keys down there
now<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.450> also<00:02:09.630> have<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:10.170> full-size

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
now you we also have a full-size

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.290 
now you we also have a full-size
trackpad<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.640> honest<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.150> I'm

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
trackpad that to be honest with you I'm

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.630 
trackpad that to be honest with you I'm
not<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.780> fond<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.380> seems<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.740> bit<00:02:13.920> bouncy

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
not that fond of it seems a bit bouncy

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.880 
not that fond of it seems a bit bouncy
and<00:02:15.060> inaccurate<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.500> doesn't<00:02:16.770> really

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and inaccurate and it doesn't really

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.080 
and inaccurate and it doesn't really
click<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.310> top<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.820> does<00:02:17.940> at<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
click with the top and it does at the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150 
click with the top and it does at the
bottom<00:02:18.480> there's<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.350> few<00:02:19.650> things<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:20.130> on

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
bottom there's a few things going on

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.440 
bottom there's a few things going on
with<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> don't<00:02:20.880> like<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.360> have

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
with that that I don't like but you have

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.630 
with that that I don't like but you have
the<00:02:21.690> track<00:02:21.900> point<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.740> guess<00:02:23.310> maybe<00:02:23.459> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the track point so I guess maybe you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.550 
the track point so I guess maybe you
can't<00:02:23.820> complain<00:02:24.240> too<00:02:24.780> much<00:02:24.810> then<00:02:25.350> when<00:02:25.470> we

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
can't complain too much then when we

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.340 
can't complain too much then when we
close<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.850> take<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> look<00:02:28.020> around<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
close this up and take a look around the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.540 
close this up and take a look around the
other<00:02:28.500> side<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.950> where<00:02:29.100> all<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
other side this is where all of the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.800 
other side this is where all of the
connectivity<00:02:29.880> important<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:30.720> is

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
connectivity important from this is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.000 
connectivity important from this is
where<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.990> can<00:02:31.140> tell<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.470> they've<00:02:31.650> gone<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
where you can tell that they've gone the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.699 
where you can tell that they've gone the
extra<00:02:32.100> mile<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.870> business<00:02:34.440> user

there's<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.680> sudden<00:02:46.680> that's<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.160> micro<00:02:47.550> USB<00:02:47.940> port

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
there's a sudden that's a micro USB port

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.979 
there's a sudden that's a micro USB port
also<00:02:48.900> oh<00:02:49.280> cool<00:02:50.280> there's<00:02:51.180> our<00:02:51.390> battery<00:02:51.720> lights

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
also oh cool there's our battery lights

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.229 
also oh cool there's our battery lights
there's<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.560> volume<00:02:52.770> rocker<00:02:53.220> power<00:02:53.730> button

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
there's the volume rocker power button

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.210 
there's the volume rocker power button
and<00:02:54.390> there's<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.930> full-size<00:02:55.230> SD<00:02:55.709> card<00:02:55.950> there<00:02:56.130> as

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
and there's a full-size SD card there as

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.740 
and there's a full-size SD card there as
well<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.670> actually<00:02:57.150> comes<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.510> an

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
well so this actually comes with an

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.449 
well so this actually comes with an
absolute<00:02:58.590> ton<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.660> connectivity<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:01.050> that

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
absolute ton of connectivity is that

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.199 
absolute ton of connectivity is that
still<00:03:02.459> similar

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
still similar

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.900 
still similar
oh<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.630> SD<00:03:04.020> or<00:03:04.050> sim<00:03:04.500> oh<00:03:04.800> yeah<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.549> know<00:03:05.730> it's

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
oh is it SD or sim oh yeah I know it's

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.970 
oh is it SD or sim oh yeah I know it's
sim<00:03:06.209> you're<00:03:06.570> totally<00:03:06.900> right<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.680> even

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
sim you're totally right because even

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.860 
sim you're totally right because even
has<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.310> pop<00:03:08.519> thing<00:03:08.820> did<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.239> get<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> micro

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
has the pop thing did you get the micro

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.960 
has the pop thing did you get the micro
SD<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:11.190> over<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:11.820> this

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
SD of it like I see over there so this

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.910 
SD of it like I see over there so this
is<00:03:12.090> ghost-free<00:03:12.360> G<00:03:12.660> bunch<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.110> as<00:03:13.290> well<00:03:13.470> 3G

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
is ghost-free G bunch of it as well 3G

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.729 
is ghost-free G bunch of it as well 3G
module<00:03:14.070> yeah<00:03:14.580> absolutely<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.440> weight<00:03:16.440> wise

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
module yeah absolutely so weight wise

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.259 
module yeah absolutely so weight wise
this<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.280> little<00:03:17.610> on<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> heavier<00:03:18.180> side

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
this is a little on the heavier side

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.720 
this is a little on the heavier side
because<00:03:18.750> we<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.620> huge<00:03:19.860> batteries<00:03:20.370> both

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
because we have the huge batteries both

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.970 
because we have the huge batteries both
in<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.330> keyboard<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:22.049> then<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.410> tablets

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
in the the keyboard and then the tablets

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.490 
in the the keyboard and then the tablets
so<00:03:23.130> I'm<00:03:23.250> guessing<00:03:23.519> like<00:03:23.549> 1.6<00:03:24.450> kilos<00:03:24.870> or<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.260> for

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
so I'm guessing like 1.6 kilos or so for

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.460 
so I'm guessing like 1.6 kilos or so for
this<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.220> is

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
this so it is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.820 
this so it is

just seems like a very solid device that

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.130 
just seems like a very solid device that
was<00:03:36.310> or<00:03:36.820> let<00:03:37.270> me<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:37.510> go<00:03:37.630> over<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.900> specs

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
was or let me just go over the specs

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.980 
was or let me just go over the specs
actually<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:38.740> hit<00:03:38.920> Scott<00:03:39.130> Core<00:03:39.430> M<00:03:39.640> 4<00:03:40.570> gigabytes

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990

this is actually a core mm device before
I<00:03:50.620> left<00:03:50.800> that<00:03:50.890> out<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.280> video<00:03:51.490> all<00:03:51.970> excited
