hair kind of just wind it around and

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.820 
hair kind of just wind it around and
then<00:01:44.140> go<00:01:44.590> around<00:01:44.830> once<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.380> then<00:01:47.500> go<00:01:47.620> around

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
then go around once and then go around

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.390 
then go around once and then go around
again<00:01:48.160> just<00:01:48.970> like<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.780> where<00:01:50.020> it's<00:01:50.740> kind

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
again just like this to where it's kind

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.030 
again just like this to where it's kind
of<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.790> front<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.869> then<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.260> take<00:01:53.530> my<00:01:53.770> hair

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
of in the front and then I take my hair

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.400 
of in the front and then I take my hair
elastic<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.910> then<00:01:55.570> wrap<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.110> around<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.619> bun

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
elastic and then wrap it around the bun

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.230 
elastic and then wrap it around the bun
so<00:01:59.410> then<00:01:59.530> you'll<00:01:59.680> have<00:01:59.800> kind<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.190> tight<00:02:00.760> bun

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
so then you'll have kind of a tight bun

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.040 
so then you'll have kind of a tight bun
on<00:02:01.509> top<00:02:01.540> like<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.479> then<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.690> next<00:02:04.840> thing

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
on top like this and then the next thing

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.370 
on top like this and then the next thing
that<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.320> do<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.190> um<00:02:06.729> start<00:02:07.600> pulling<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:08.229> the
