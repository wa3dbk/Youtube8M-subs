00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
do it on both sides

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.219 
do it on both sides
where's<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.610> okay<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to place a dispenser above that like so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.630 
to place a dispenser above that like so
and<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.220> both<00:01:23.400> sides

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and then you're going to also place a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.270 
and then you're going to also place a
dispenser<00:01:27.259> next<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> tripwire<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
dispenser next to the tripwire like that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.969 
dispenser next to the tripwire like that
and<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.390> both<00:01:30.600> sides<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.110> then

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and you can do that both sides and then

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.660 
and you can do that both sides and then
you<00:01:32.100> want<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:35.990> place<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.350> block<00:01:37.530> above<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.979> like

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
should take away some of the health so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.140 
should take away some of the health so
it'd<00:02:38.860> be<00:02:38.920> easier<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.519> attack<00:02:39.880> and
