the ball much much better after watching
this<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.360> Kratz<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.870> movement<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
this and Kratz in this movement and this

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.630 
this and Kratz in this movement and this
is<00:00:44.640> applying<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.300> an<00:00:45.539> iron<00:00:45.809> only<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.829> tip<00:00:47.100> so

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is applying to an iron only this tip so

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.950 
is applying to an iron only this tip so
be<00:00:47.760> careful<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.239> don't<00:00:48.390> try<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.600> bring<00:00:48.780> this

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
be careful we don't try and bring this

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.930 
be careful we don't try and bring this
too<00:00:49.200> much<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:49.739> would<00:00:50.340> swing<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:50.850> our

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
too much into our would swing or our

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
too much into our would swing or our
driver<00:00:51.270> swings<00:00:51.690> certainly<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.890> don't

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
driver swings certainly because we don't

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
driver swings certainly because we don't
really<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.789> descended<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
really want to be descended into the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.939 
really want to be descended into the
back<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> ball<00:00:55.140> too<00:00:55.320> much<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> wood

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
back of the ball too much with the wood

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.680 
back of the ball too much with the wood
but<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.030> an<00:00:57.120> iron<00:00:57.239> I've<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.539> got

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
but we can do with an iron I've just got

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
but we can do with an iron I've just got
mid<00:00:57.870> iron<00:00:58.079> I've<00:00:58.289> got<00:00:58.440> me<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> time<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
mid iron I've got me a time just to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
mid iron I've got me a time just to
demonstrate<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.239> movement<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
demonstrate this movement and now the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
demonstrate this movement and now the
reason<00:01:02.460> why<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.270> important<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
reason why this is so important is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
reason why this is so important is
because<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> club<00:01:04.920> comes<00:01:05.159> into<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> back

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
because as the club comes into the back

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.929 
because as the club comes into the back
of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> golf<00:01:06.270> ball<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> be

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
of the golf ball we don't want to be

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
of the golf ball we don't want to be
losing<00:01:08.939> any<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> power<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.290> come<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
losing any of that power as we come in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.960 
losing any of that power as we come in
to<00:01:10.650> hit<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> ball<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.369> don't<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to hit the ball so we don't want to be

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.480 
to hit the ball so we don't want to be
hitting<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> floor<00:01:12.479> too<00:01:12.659> far<00:01:12.900> behind

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
hitting the floor too far behind

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.469 
hitting the floor too far behind
otherwise<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.729> club's<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> come<00:01:15.330> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
otherwise the club's going to come in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.630 
otherwise the club's going to come in
and<00:01:15.689> lose<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.470> much<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> power<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and lose so much of the power into the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060 
and lose so much of the power into the
floor<00:01:17.939> instead<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> power<00:01:19.320> from<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> club

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
floor instead of the power from the club

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
floor instead of the power from the club
head<00:01:20.280> transferring<00:01:21.210> onto<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> golf<00:01:21.720> ball<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
head transferring onto the golf ball and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
head transferring onto the golf ball and
then<00:01:22.560> obviously<00:01:22.830> helping<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.880> most

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
then obviously helping you get your most

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
then obviously helping you get your most
distance<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> important

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
distance then one of the important

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
distance then one of the important
things<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.820> whole<00:01:27.119> movement<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.930> making

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
things in this whole movement is making

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.069 
things in this whole movement is making
sure<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.820> find<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.329> bottom<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.930> our

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
sure that we can find the bottom of our

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.920 
sure that we can find the bottom of our
golf<00:01:31.409> swing<00:01:31.530> much<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.189> consistently<00:01:32.909> now<00:01:33.840> if

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
golf swing much more consistently now if

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
golf swing much more consistently now if
I<00:01:34.020> also<00:01:34.110> identify<00:01:34.259> bottom<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.310> golf<00:01:35.640> swing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I also identify bottom out of golf swing

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580
