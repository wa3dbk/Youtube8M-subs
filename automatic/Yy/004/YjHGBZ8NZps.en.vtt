00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.310 
I believed at the time that I wrote the
Sleeping<00:00:06.319> Beauty<00:00:06.350> trilogy<00:00:07.100> that<00:00:07.460> that<00:00:08.320> sex

Sleeping Beauty trilogy that that sex

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.289 
Sleeping Beauty trilogy that that sex
was<00:00:09.530> good<00:00:09.799> which<00:00:10.100> I<00:00:10.340> still<00:00:10.670> believe<00:00:11.000> actually

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
was good which I still believe actually

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.690 
was good which I still believe actually
and<00:00:11.750> that<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:12.559> body<00:00:12.769> was<00:00:13.099> good<00:00:13.370> and<00:00:13.639> that

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
and that the body was good and that

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.940 
and that the body was good and that
physicality<00:00:14.480> was<00:00:14.719> a<00:00:14.900> great<00:00:15.139> mystery<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:15.860> it

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
physicality was a great mystery and it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.859 
physicality was a great mystery and it
was<00:00:16.070> something<00:00:16.250> that<00:00:16.400> we<00:00:16.700> could<00:00:17.000> trust

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
was something that we could trust

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.650 
was something that we could trust
ourselves<00:00:18.110> to<00:00:18.680> celebrate<00:00:19.189> and<00:00:19.430> explore<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.210> I

ourselves to celebrate and explore and I

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.590 
ourselves to celebrate and explore and I
felt<00:00:21.020> that<00:00:21.289> no<00:00:22.029> sadomasochistic<00:00:23.029> pornography

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.880 
them but I'm very glad I did those books
I<00:01:43.909> wanted<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.479> get<00:01:44.689> those<00:01:44.930> fantasies<00:01:45.439> out<00:01:45.619> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
I wanted to get those fantasies out and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.100 
I wanted to get those fantasies out and
wanted<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.159> get<00:01:46.280> them<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.610> paper<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.840> have<00:01:48.079> a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
wanted to get them on paper and I have a

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.370 
wanted to get them on paper and I have a
sense<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:49.210> they<00:01:50.210> provide<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.720> kind<00:01:51.049> of<00:01:51.140> window

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
sense that they provide a kind of window

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.249 
sense that they provide a kind of window
into<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.009> psyche<00:01:52.430> that's<00:01:52.640> kind<00:01:52.909> of<00:01:53.000> rare<00:01:53.270> so

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
into the psyche that's kind of rare so

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.319 
into the psyche that's kind of rare so
that<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.829> was<00:01:55.070> my<00:01:55.220> thinking<00:01:55.640> when<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.820> did<00:01:56.119> it

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
that that was my thinking when I did it

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.690 
that that was my thinking when I did it
now<00:01:56.630> those<00:01:56.990> books<00:01:57.290> are<00:01:57.470> out<00:01:57.590> there<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.159> they

now those books are out there and they

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.910 
now those books are out there and they
go<00:01:58.909> on<00:01:59.090> they<00:01:59.329> actually<00:01:59.509> sell<00:01:59.960> very<00:02:00.229> well<00:02:00.350> a

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
go on they actually sell very well a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.459 
go on they actually sell very well a
normal<00:02:01.520> person<00:02:02.240> could<00:02:02.810> probably<00:02:03.020> live<00:02:03.320> off

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
normal person could probably live off

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.280 
normal person could probably live off
