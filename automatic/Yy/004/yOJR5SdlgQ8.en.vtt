my little fellow Strider now the reason
I<00:03:35.380> call<00:03:35.560> out<00:03:35.710> this<00:03:35.890> pet<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.280> because<00:03:36.580> he<00:03:36.670> does<00:03:36.850> a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
I call out this pet is because he does a

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.450 
I call out this pet is because he does a
cloud<00:03:37.210> effect<00:03:37.360> which<00:03:37.810> thunders<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:39.100> Thunder

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
cloud effect which thunders the Thunder

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.160 
cloud effect which thunders the Thunder
stack<00:03:39.730> up<00:03:39.940> three<00:03:40.150> times<00:03:40.390> pretty<00:03:41.020> much

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
stack up three times pretty much

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.280 
stack up three times pretty much
reducing<00:03:41.710> their<00:03:41.830> armor<00:03:42.160> by<00:03:42.280> 12%<00:03:43.200> meaning<00:03:44.200> that

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
reducing their armor by 12% meaning that

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.020 
reducing their armor by 12% meaning that
you're<00:03:44.470> going<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.650> hit<00:03:44.830> harder<00:03:45.100> now<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.700> mobs

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
you're going to hit harder now the mobs

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.000 
you're going to hit harder now the mobs
right<00:03:46.300> outside<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.780> door<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.080> found<00:03:47.470> are<00:03:47.860> the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
right outside this door I found are the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.270 
right outside this door I found are the
best<00:03:48.220> ones<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.610> do<00:03:48.850> at<00:03:49.150> my<00:03:49.360> eye<00:03:49.540> level<00:03:50.280> because

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
best ones to do at my eye level because

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.700 
best ones to do at my eye level because
you<00:03:51.970> can<00:03:52.120> go<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.570> very<00:03:52.750> top<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.350> right

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
you can go to the very top and right

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.310 
you can go to the very top and right
there<00:03:53.950> before<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.370> hit<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.640> second<00:03:55.000> boss

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
there before you hit the second boss

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
there before you hit the second boss
stand<00:03:56.320> at<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.470> doorway<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:56.980> they<00:03:57.190> will

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
stand at that doorway and they will

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.740 
stand at that doorway and they will
constantly<00:03:57.550> spawn<00:03:58.030> but<00:03:58.180> as<00:03:58.270> soon<00:03:58.390> as<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.630> go

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
constantly spawn but as soon as you go

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.060 
constantly spawn but as soon as you go
in<00:03:58.870> there<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.110> hit<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.320> second<00:03:59.680> boss<00:03:59.800> they

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
in there and hit the second boss they

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.460 
in there and hit the second boss they
stop<00:04:00.340> spawning<00:04:00.640> now<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.630> reason<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.290> picked

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
stop spawning now the reason I picked

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.120 
stop spawning now the reason I picked
this<00:04:02.740> spot<00:04:02.890> right<00:04:03.040> here<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.750> pretty<00:04:04.750> simple

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
this spot right here is pretty simple

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.950 
this spot right here is pretty simple
because<00:04:06.130> they<00:04:06.790> come<00:04:07.000> down<00:04:07.210> and<00:04:07.270> they<00:04:07.570> pretty

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
because they come down and they pretty

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.660 
because they come down and they pretty
much<00:04:08.140> jump<00:04:08.470> off<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:08.920> you're<00:04:09.040> not<00:04:09.160> gonna<00:04:09.550> be

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
much jump off so you're not gonna be

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.330 
much jump off so you're not gonna be
really<00:04:10.240> overwhelmed<00:04:10.960> unless<00:04:11.770> you're<00:04:11.980> like<00:04:12.160> me

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
really overwhelmed unless you're like me

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.020 
really overwhelmed unless you're like me
you<00:04:12.520> thought<00:04:12.750> fire<00:04:13.750> trap<00:04:14.080> or<00:04:14.320> whatnot<00:04:14.500> just<00:04:15.030> to

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
you thought fire trap or whatnot just to

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.640 
you thought fire trap or whatnot just to
get<00:04:16.210> more<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.930> way<00:04:17.020> they're<00:04:17.170> not<00:04:17.260> jumping

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
get more that way they're not jumping

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.830 
get more that way they're not jumping
off<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:17.980> side<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.580> you<00:04:18.700> have<00:04:18.880> all<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.330> aggro

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
off the side so you have all the aggro

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.740 
off the side so you have all the aggro
you<00:04:20.200> know<00:04:20.320> what<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.470> mean<00:04:21.330> but<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.420> reason<00:04:22.690> I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
you know what I mean but the reason I

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.980 
you know what I mean but the reason I
picked<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.170> butt<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.330> can<00:04:25.810> pretty

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
picked this butt is so that I can pretty

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.080 
picked this butt is so that I can pretty
much<00:04:26.080> run<00:04:26.530> back<00:04:26.860> inside<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.520> building<00:04:27.850> if<00:04:27.970> I

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
much run back inside the building if I

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.570 
much run back inside the building if I
start<00:04:28.360> getting<00:04:28.630> overwhelmed<00:04:29.410> if<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:30.070> need<00:04:30.310> a

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
start getting overwhelmed if I need a

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.640 
start getting overwhelmed if I need a
coffee<00:04:30.940> break<00:04:31.300> neither<00:04:31.840> go<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.230> bathroom

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
coffee break neither go to the bathroom

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.920 
coffee break neither go to the bathroom
or<00:04:32.770> something<00:04:33.010> if<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:34.210> go<00:04:34.390> up<00:04:34.540> there<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.810> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
or something if you go up there to the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.420 
or something if you go up there to the
very<00:04:35.110> top<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.560> don't<00:04:35.800> really<00:04:35.980> have<00:04:36.190> that

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
very top you don't really have that

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.610 
very top you don't really have that
option<00:04:36.670> that's<00:04:37.150> why<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.330> love<00:04:37.690> this<00:04:37.870> right<00:04:38.380> down

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
here because you always have the option

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.520 
here because you always have the option
of<00:04:40.360> running<00:04:40.510> back<00:04:40.900> inside<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:42.090> healing<00:04:43.090> up
