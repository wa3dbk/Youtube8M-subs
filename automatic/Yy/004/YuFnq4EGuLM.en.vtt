00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 will perform all the waves for the same 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.670
 sense and we tip the the little pincer like that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.309
 is worth all the layers that are 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.970
 made like this and always in the same 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.390
 I will show you a layer for 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 that you can see it but you can see it is 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 very easy has no greater mystery 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 we just take a lock we put 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.980
 the tongs like that and we roll it up 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.450
 get to the tip when we get to the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.750
 point we hold a few seconds 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.110
 and slowly 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.440
 we release them and let them fall and go 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.440
 catching 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.170
 all the locks in this way 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.020
 we roll up we roll up 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.590
 the tip in the same position and 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.590
 we hold 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.610
 always the same on the same side with more or 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.610
 less the same amount of hair 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.229
 and we do exactly the same 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.229
 go 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.500
 when it is hot 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.610
 we let go 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 is this 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090
 and here 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 let's see 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.000
 to the point 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.730
 well you see that they are for the same 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:56.790
 I felt the wave and what we do 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:00.300
 It is with a comb 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.730
 let's comb it 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.730
 and we will achieve this 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.549
 you can comb with your hands 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.610
 we open what is that of I was born there and how 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.610
 you can see 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.370
 we will be this wave in water you see 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:33.870
 he takes us like that when he is not seeing here 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.730
 then here and at the tip it is very easy to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 is carrying a lot to me 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.820
 personally I really like it if you want 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.450
 mark them more what you can do is 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.840
 introduce the tongs up a little 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.840
 The hair 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.140
 you can put as many times as you want 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.670
 here another clamp 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.740
 or if you do not paint smaller than that 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.130
 and then with the remote lacquer 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 apply a little bit of lacquer you leave it 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.260
 dry it will go doing all the layers and 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.579
 You are left with this wave that now 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.650
 is carrying a lot is very nice and you 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.010
 you see it 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.380
 marked all the waves without the tweezers 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.450
 you have already seen it 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.250
 the important thing is to do all the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.410
 waves and then let them dry 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.040
 with a long mane we would do 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.510
 all over the hair the same leaving the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.510
 wave and curl in the same position 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.170
 to make translations with the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.550
 tongs instead of placing 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.950
 tongs and we put it vertically and 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.290
 Ideally, roll it to one side 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.210
 and the other corkscrew roll it to the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.770
 another side you can also make a strip 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.950
 to one side and the other entity 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.590
 next to the other side good and what 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.260
 you will see that it is very easy simply 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:12.030
 place is the vertical trend in 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.100
 reality is the hair to the tip and 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.900
 we leave it a few seconds until it 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.540
 hot and we lower it 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.660
 I'm going to make a lock so that 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.660
 we can 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.490
 we lower our hair 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.400
 and let's do a side 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.690
 a lock to one side 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.590
 tenacious and downward we roll up 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.590
 we hold a few seconds 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.509
 we let them go 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.880
 we take our lock now towards another 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.889
 side 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.819
 we apply 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.819
 we hold it 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.800
 do not let go to the other side 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.300
 we count 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.490
 let's see 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.450
 to the point 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.390
 seconds 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.600
 until the other 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.920
 and we show them to the other side 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.670
 we roll up 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.670
 we count 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:38.600
 and you're good and you see the effect that 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.529
 there are loose ringlets you are already a 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.680
 little bit of lacquer 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:46.449
 and we have left 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.559
 good uniform they are curled up like this 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.559
 they look pretty 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.050
 and all we have to do is go 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:59.780
 rolling the hair with the same 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.780
 position but to one side and towards
