00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and by the way I'm gonna be reviewing

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.370 
and by the way I'm gonna be reviewing
the<00:01:38.880> prime<00:01:39.060> trilogy<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> whole<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.290> not

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the prime trilogy as a whole and not

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.780 
the prime trilogy as a whole and not
each<00:01:40.560> individual<00:01:41.009> game<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.640> all

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
each individual game because they all

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.359 
each individual game because they all
follow<00:01:42.060> largely<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.780> same<00:01:42.810> formula<00:01:43.409> Prime's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
follow largely the same formula Prime's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.950 
follow largely the same formula Prime's
premise<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> fairly<00:01:45.149> simple<00:01:45.509> really

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
premise is fairly simple really

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
premise is fairly simple really
but<00:01:46.320> Metroid<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.040> about<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but Metroid is all about the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
but Metroid is all about the
presentation<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.299> consider<00:01:48.840> Metroid<00:01:49.229> Prime<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
presentation I consider Metroid Prime a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
presentation I consider Metroid Prime a
work<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.920> art<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.280> much<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.820> video<00:01:51.090> game

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
work of art as much as I do a video game

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.249 
work of art as much as I do a video game
because<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> game's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
because of the way all the game's

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.660 
because of the way all the game's
elements<00:01:52.680> come<00:01:52.799> together<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.220> create<00:01:53.490> an

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
elements come together to create an

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
elements come together to create an
unforgettable<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.450> immersive<00:01:54.869> experience

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
unforgettable and immersive experience

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.990 
unforgettable and immersive experience
Metroid<00:01:56.100> games<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.460> always<00:01:56.579> been<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.939> way

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
Metroid games have always been this way

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
Metroid games have always been this way
really<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.570> Metroid<00:01:57.930> Prime<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> first

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
really but Metroid Prime was the first

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.649 
really but Metroid Prime was the first
3d<00:01:59.219> Metroid<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.329> first-person

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
3d Metroid and it was in first-person

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.170 
3d Metroid and it was in first-person
which<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:01.680> admit<00:02:01.950> made<00:02:02.159> me<00:02:02.340> highly

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
which I will admit made me highly

kind of battle accident and it's not

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.090 
kind of battle accident and it's not
until<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.139> start<00:03:26.410> looking<00:03:26.440> around<00:03:26.799> and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
until you start looking around and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.500 
until you start looking around and
scanning<00:03:27.549> your<00:03:27.609> environments<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.359> can

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510

piece together exactly what happened and
I<00:03:30.220> think<00:03:30.280> that's<00:03:30.609> really<00:03:30.790> cool<00:03:31.120> instead<00:03:31.780> of

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
I think that's really cool instead of

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.420 
I think that's really cool instead of
the<00:03:31.930> game<00:03:32.079> being<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:32.500> alright<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.190> here's

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
the game being like alright so here's

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.460 
the game being like alright so here's
what<00:03:33.639> happened<00:03:34.150> or<00:03:34.239> just<00:03:34.480> showing<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.260> what

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
what happened or just showing you what

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.319 
what happened or just showing you what
happened<00:03:35.920> they<00:03:36.310> let<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.609> find<00:03:36.880> out<00:03:37.000> on<00:03:37.150> your

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
happened they let you find out on your

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.210 
happened they let you find out on your
own<00:03:37.480> which<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.780> much<00:03:38.170> more<00:03:38.380> fun<00:03:38.590> if<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.739> ask<00:03:38.980> me

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
own which is much more fun if you ask me

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.890 
own which is much more fun if you ask me
I<00:03:39.459> guess<00:03:39.910> this<00:03:40.060> wouldn't<00:03:40.239> be<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.420> full<00:03:40.630> review

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
I guess this wouldn't be a full review

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.300 
I guess this wouldn't be a full review
if<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.079> didn't<00:03:41.260> talk<00:03:41.380> about<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> boring<00:03:42.010> shit

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310
