that's<00:00:05.160> Randy<00:00:05.520> I'm<00:00:05.609> getting<00:00:05.850> ready<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
that's Randy I'm getting ready to the

that's Randy I'm getting ready to the
symbol<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:08.010> think<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.670> gonna<00:00:08.760> be<00:00:08.879> the<00:00:08.969> last

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
symbol I think this is gonna be the last

steps for the dry run
I<00:00:11.630> have<00:00:12.630> already<00:00:12.870> programmed<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.469> Marlin

you<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.489> align<00:00:23.610> this<00:00:23.759> a<00:00:23.790> bit<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.270> only

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
you can align this a bit but I can only

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.900 
you can align this a bit but I can only
find<00:00:24.630> two<00:00:24.739> and<00:00:25.739> then<00:00:25.919> reattach<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.610> ramps

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910

two<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> them<00:00:35.610> because<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.030> noble<00:00:36.240> experiment

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
two of them because the noble experiment

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.610 
two of them because the noble experiment
told<00:00:36.840> me<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.970> x<00:00:38.970> axis<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.810> the<00:00:39.930> z<00:00:39.960> axis

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
told me that the x axis and the z axis

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.320 
told me that the x axis and the z axis
run<00:00:40.920> backwards<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.970> fix<00:00:42.150> that<00:00:42.240> in

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
run backwards and you can fix that in

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
run backwards and you can fix that in
the<00:00:42.360> firmware<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.990> just<00:00:43.080> take<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the firmware or you can just take the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.630 
the firmware or you can just take the
cable<00:00:43.650> out<00:00:43.740> flip<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> over<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.220> plug<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> back

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
cable out flip it over and plug it back

ultimately<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.810> may<00:00:45.930> change<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> former<00:00:46.560> but

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
ultimately I may change the former but

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.020 
ultimately I may change the former but
for<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> time<00:00:47.040> being<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.310> just<00:00:47.340> swapped<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
way down I have another friend that told

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
way down I have another friend that told
me<00:00:57.540> that<00:00:57.720> there's<00:00:58.290> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.560> dimple<00:00:59.400> on<00:00:59.579> top

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
me that there's a little dimple on top

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.069 
me that there's a little dimple on top
here<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:00.090> they<00:01:00.180> put<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> ball<00:01:00.570> bearing<00:01:00.750> there

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
here that they put a ball bearing there

here that they put a ball bearing there
it'll<00:01:01.440> ride<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.190> sure<00:01:02.310> you<00:01:02.370> put<00:01:02.520> your

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it'll ride it you make sure you put your

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
it'll ride it you make sure you put your
shaft<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.060> way<00:01:03.120> down<00:01:03.300> otherwise<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.500> can

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
shaft all the way down otherwise you can

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.990 
shaft all the way down otherwise you can
get<00:01:04.680> compression<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.339> spring<00:01:05.399> and<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
get compression in the spring and you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.190 
get compression in the spring and you
don't<00:01:06.149> want<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.899> it's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
don't want that because you're it's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
don't want that because you're it's
carrying<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.620> weight<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> whole

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.300 
gantry in the whole x-axis but I'm going
to<00:01:11.430> slide<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> way<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
to slide it all the way down and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:22.499 
to slide it all the way down and
compress<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:37.800 

I'm<00:01:36.909> going<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.119> turn<00:01:37.329> them<00:01:37.420> both<00:01:37.570> together

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
I'm going to turn them both together

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.590 
I'm going to turn them both together
about<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.500> same<00:01:38.680> number<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.920> rotations<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.479> I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
about the same number of rotations and I

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.690 
about the same number of rotations and I
keep<00:01:40.780> turning<00:01:40.930> them<00:01:41.170> until<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:45.189> threaded<00:01:45.579> rod

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
keep turning them until the threaded rod

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.429 
keep turning them until the threaded rod
is<00:01:46.390> flush<00:01:46.840> with<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.229> top<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:48.360> nut<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
is flush with the top of the nut this

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.630 
is flush with the top of the nut this
means<00:01:50.619> kind<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.890> tight<00:01:51.189> spine

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
means kind of tight spine

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.800 
means kind of tight spine
so<00:01:51.729> I'm<00:01:51.820> gonna<00:01:51.939> do<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.299> I'm<00:01:52.450> gonna<00:01:52.570> do<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.720> little

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a little

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.029 
so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a little
trick<00:01:53.110> I'm<00:01:53.259> gonna<00:01:53.429> loosen<00:01:54.429> up<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.770> screws

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
trick I'm gonna loosen up the screws

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.130 
trick I'm gonna loosen up the screws
holding<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:59.880> nut<00:02:00.880> for<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.179> z<00:02:01.329> axis<00:02:01.750> because

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
holding the nut for the z axis because

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.230 
holding the nut for the z axis because
there's<00:02:02.740> no<00:02:02.860> guarantee<00:02:03.219> that<00:02:03.250> when<00:02:03.640> these

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
there's no guarantee that when these

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.880 
there's no guarantee that when these
were<00:02:04.420> assembled<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.229> factory<00:02:05.649> that<00:02:05.860> they

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
were assembled the factory that they

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.440 
were assembled the factory that they
were<00:02:06.069> straight<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:08.819> also<00:02:09.819> is<00:02:10.000> no<00:02:10.119> guarantee

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
were straight and also is no guarantee

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.930 
were straight and also is no guarantee
that<00:02:10.569> my<00:02:10.690> threaded<00:02:11.019> rods<00:02:11.230> don't<00:02:11.940> perfectly

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
that my threaded rods don't perfectly

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.490 
that my threaded rods don't perfectly
straight<00:02:13.120> either<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:14.080> there's<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.260> little<00:02:14.410> bit

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
straight either so there's a little bit

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.600 
straight either so there's a little bit
of<00:02:14.590> playing<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> right<00:02:15.099> now<00:02:15.220> I'll<00:02:15.370> tighten

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
of playing it right now I'll tighten

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.039 
of playing it right now I'll tighten
that<00:02:15.730> up<00:02:15.790> later<00:02:16.000> but<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.360> moment<00:02:16.540> and

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
that up later but for the moment and

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.410 
that up later but for the moment and
leave<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.290> play<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.940> makes<00:02:19.090> me<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.329> it's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
leave the play in it makes me think it's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.780 
leave the play in it makes me think it's
from<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.599> lot<00:02:19.720> easier<00:02:20.019> okay<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.880> I've<00:02:22.000> got<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:23.790> x

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
from a lot easier okay so I've got the x

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.670 
from a lot easier okay so I've got the x
stage<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:27.690> got<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.370> z<00:02:30.370> mounts<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.500> okay<00:02:32.500> my

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
stage on got the z mounts in okay my

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.250 
stage on got the z mounts in okay my
install<00:02:33.160> cable<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.660> want<00:02:34.660> any<00:02:34.870> stress<00:02:35.230> right

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
install cable I want any stress right

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.780 
install cable I want any stress right
this<00:02:35.530> will<00:02:35.680> come<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.010> plugs<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.489> want<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.700> make

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
this will come in plugs I want to make

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.890 
this will come in plugs I want to make
sure<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:37.000> comes<00:02:37.150> out<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.420> side<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.720> gantry

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
sure it comes out the side of the gantry

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.740 
sure it comes out the side of the gantry
there<00:02:38.970> all<00:02:39.970> right<00:02:40.120> everything's<00:02:40.420> hooked<00:02:40.540> up

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there all right everything's hooked up

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.940 
there all right everything's hooked up
I'm<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:43.019> dry<00:02:44.019> run<00:02:44.260> test<00:02:44.500> let's<00:02:44.769> see

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I'm going to do a dry run test let's see

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.080 
I'm going to do a dry run test let's see
if<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> power<00:02:45.549> supply<00:02:45.609> turns<00:02:46.030> on

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
if the power supply turns on

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:03.920 
if the power supply turns on
it's<00:02:48.690> 15<00:02:49.230> volts<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:51.330> cables<00:02:51.660> reach<00:02:52.640> table

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.220 

and<00:03:04.290> ground<00:03:04.590> up<00:03:04.769> first

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and ground up first

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.229 
and ground up first
this<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:06.920> not<00:03:07.069> priority<00:03:07.280> loma<00:03:07.879> it's<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.150> a

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
this is not priority loma it's just a

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.170 
this is not priority loma it's just a
test<00:03:08.510> power<00:03:08.750> supply<00:03:08.959> for<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.170> time<00:03:09.349> being<00:03:09.560> i

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
test power supply for the time being i

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.340 
test power supply for the time being i
took<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.299> power<00:03:11.480> cable

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.199 

right

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
right

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.890 
right
controller<00:03:18.900> came<00:03:19.170> up

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
controller came up

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.759 
controller came up
so<00:03:21.440> let's<00:03:21.620> see<00:03:21.890> I'm<00:03:21.950> going<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:23.319> go<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.379> the

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
so let's see I'm going to go to the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.970 
so let's see I'm going to go to the
preparer

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
preparer

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.510 
preparer
scroll<00:03:27.980> down

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.780 

move<00:03:31.090> axis<00:03:32.280> let's<00:03:33.280> say<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:33.520> have<00:03:33.640> one

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
move axis let's say we have one

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.560 
move axis let's say we have one
millimeter

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
millimeter

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.000 
millimeter
let's<00:03:35.560> start<00:03:35.680> with<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.920> X<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.530> one<00:03:38.680> way<00:03:38.800> later

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
let's start with the X so one way later

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.750 
let's start with the X so one way later
posited<00:03:41.190> should<00:03:42.190> probably<00:03:42.370> measure<00:03:42.580> that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
posited should probably measure that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.890 
posited should probably measure that
make<00:03:42.880> sure<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.060> one<00:03:43.150> millimeter<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.630> seems<00:03:43.810> to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
make sure to one millimeter it seems to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.320 
make sure to one millimeter it seems to
be<00:03:43.960> moving<00:03:44.260> back<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.790> zero<00:03:46.860> okay

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
be moving back to zero okay

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.480 
be moving back to zero okay
down<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.600> why<00:03:49.810> push<00:03:51.090> turn

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.700 

okay<00:03:55.910> that's<00:03:56.150> positive<00:03:56.660> as<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.080> here<00:03:57.590> he

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
okay that's positive as that here he

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.410 
okay that's positive as that here he
goes<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:57.950> way<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.820> extruder<00:03:59.090> will<00:03:59.240> come

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
goes that way the extruder will come

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.910 
goes that way the extruder will come
back<00:03:59.570> so<00:03:59.750> that's<00:03:59.930> good<00:04:00.140> that's<00:04:00.260> positive<00:04:00.710> why

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.630 

the<00:04:03.920> distance<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.370> are<00:04:04.550> probably<00:04:04.820> close<00:04:05.260> Z

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
the distance this are probably close Z

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.480 
the distance this are probably close Z
so<00:04:07.640> 1<00:04:08.240> millimeter<00:04:08.570> up<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.900> gonna<00:04:09.020> be<00:04:09.170> bad

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
so 1 millimeter up is gonna be bad

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.590 
so 1 millimeter up is gonna be bad
because<00:04:10.490> it's<00:04:10.730> gonna<00:04:10.820> put<00:04:11.030> off<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.210> top<00:04:11.360> let's

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
because it's gonna put off the top let's

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.060 
because it's gonna put off the top let's
try<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.870> anyway<00:04:12.610> okay<00:04:13.610> one<00:04:13.760> no<00:04:13.880> later<00:04:14.060> up<00:04:15.070> back

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
try it anyway okay one no later up back

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.740 
try it anyway okay one no later up back
down<00:04:16.780> okay

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
down okay

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.589 
down okay
let's<00:04:20.750> try<00:04:20.989> one<00:04:21.170> more<00:04:21.200> let's<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:21.860> the

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.640 

auto<00:04:29.139> home

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
everything is good the Axia should each

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:45.330 
everything is good the Axia should each
pull<00:04:35.550> back<00:04:35.729> one<00:04:35.940> at<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> time<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:36.710> X

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.020 

see<00:04:47.040> probably<00:04:48.040> need<00:04:48.340> some<00:04:48.460> oil<00:04:48.670> somewhere

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
see probably need some oil somewhere

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.460 
see probably need some oil somewhere
here<00:04:49.420> squeaks<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.000> can<00:04:52.180> see<00:04:52.420> my<00:04:52.660> forehead

here squeaks and I can see my forehead
Roger<00:04:53.680> wobbling<00:04:54.510> so<00:04:55.510> they're<00:04:55.720> not<00:04:55.810> perfectly

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320
