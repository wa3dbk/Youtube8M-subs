00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and like I said I've had this watch for

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
and like I said I've had this watch for
about<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> month<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> during<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.360> I've

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
about a month and during the time I've

about a month and during the time I've
had<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> watch<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:35.280> watch<00:01:35.460> has<00:01:35.670> been

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
had with the watch the watch has been

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
had with the watch the watch has been
keeping<00:01:36.180> great<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.750> considering<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
keeping great time considering that it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
keeping great time considering that it
is<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.100> automatic<00:01:38.640> watch<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.530> what<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
is an automatic watch and what this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
is an automatic watch and what this
means<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.610> watch<00:01:41.820> functions<00:01:42.390> by<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
means is that the watch functions by the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
means is that the watch functions by the
use<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.409> many<00:01:43.649> intricate<00:01:44.520> mechanical<00:01:45.119> parts

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
use of many intricate mechanical parts

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.590 
use of many intricate mechanical parts
instead<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.619> having<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> quartz<00:01:48.390> watch

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
instead of having it be a quartz watch
