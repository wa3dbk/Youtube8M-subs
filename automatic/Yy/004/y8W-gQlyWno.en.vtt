 Hello

 three super easy and delicious snacks 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.470
 to see this world cup we started 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.690
 the first thing we will do in a few potatoes 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:22.070
 riots that their presence 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.200

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.650
 we will add the cheese that is coming 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.650
 molten 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.170
 we stir a little 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.070
 until you get this result 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.680
 it does not have to stay a bit this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.480
 then in a bowl we place our 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.220
 favorite potatoes 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.220
 we add English sauce 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.870

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.670
 a few drops of lime 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.860
 we repeat the same place the potatoes 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.150
 then the highs 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.150
 and since we have already done 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.570
 the second option is cheese in chile 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.610

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.290
