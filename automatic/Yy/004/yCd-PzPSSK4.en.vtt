00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.590
 It is well known that the main 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
 advantage of the compact is its size and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.280
 therefore its portability the size 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.380
 general is marked by the size of 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.080
 the optics that in turn depends on the 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.460
 sensor size that we use 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.840
 obviously a small camera implies a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.610
 small sensor whose main 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.259
 deficiency is the low capacity of 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.899
 capture the light that enters in turn by a 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.000
 small optics to alleviate this lack 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.500
 manufacturers look for optics 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.210
 possible burdens at the same time that the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.300
 technology offers them more and more 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.130
 specific aids such is the case of the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.929
 new web picks of 330 that today 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.000
 we present a prodigy of performance 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.260
 in low light conditions let's see it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.289
 detail 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.539
 the coolpix of 330 incorporates an optics 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.699
 5x zoom equivalent to 24 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.280
 120 mm and one the university 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.109
 maximum of f 1.8 in stabilized angular 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.690
 optically with the latest vr technology 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.890
 from nikon to this grand opening you will be 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.229
 adds a respectable CMOS sensor 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.969
 backlit 12.2 megapixels that 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.500
 is able to collect enough 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.020
 direct as the part that would be lost 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 behind all this for the sake of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.229
 get both the best approaches 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 possible as the maximum performance in 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.520
 poor light conditions besides the iris 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.770
 Seven-sheet mechanical and integration 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.720
 of hr lenses and high index 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.979
 refraction inside facilitate the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.590
 transit of light the most way 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.880
 stable and efficient as possible to the sensor 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.860
 but his style is reduced body 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.600
 hides much more gunpowder people is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.429
 Integrated compatibility and bike with 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.780
 smart devices full hd video 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.390
 and lcd monitor and high efficiency 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.310
 raw file nr w to get the maximum 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.200
 image quality and processing capacity 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.000
 in post-production picture control 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.130
 coolpix to profile the images from 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.509
 the origin and manual modes psa m al 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.909
 reach of the thumb on the wheel 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.640
 commands everything in a metal housing of 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.220
 the highest quality so is the new 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.550
 blame 330 the compact or with more 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.550
