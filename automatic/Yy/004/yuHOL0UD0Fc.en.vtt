00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
because there is no faux taillight or

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.659 
because there is no faux taillight or
the<00:05:28.190> lens<00:05:28.910> for<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.750> back<00:05:30.200> so<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:31.310> course<00:05:31.490> you

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
the lens for the back so of course you

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.940 
the lens for the back so of course you
get<00:05:31.789> stickers<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:33.020> they<00:05:33.349> don't<00:05:33.560> look<00:05:33.710> bad<00:05:33.919> I

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
get stickers and they don't look bad I

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.860 
get stickers and they don't look bad I
ended<00:05:34.400> up<00:05:34.520> trimming<00:05:34.760> them<00:05:35.000> down<00:05:35.240> just<00:05:35.720> a

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
ended up trimming them down just a

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.219 
ended up trimming them down just a
little<00:05:35.900> bit<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.440> fit<00:05:36.620> inside<00:05:37.130> of<00:05:37.190> this

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
little bit to fit inside of this

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.279 
little bit to fit inside of this
extruded<00:05:39.229> area<00:05:39.650> look<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.490> little<00:05:40.669> nicer<00:05:40.910> I<00:05:41.419> also

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
extruded area look a little nicer I also

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.150 
extruded area look a little nicer I also
put<00:05:43.840> it<00:05:44.840> looks<00:05:45.050> like<00:05:45.199> a<00:05:45.229> power<00:05:45.530> switch<00:05:45.800> but

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
put it looks like a power switch but

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.000 
put it looks like a power switch but
it's<00:05:46.310> supposed<00:05:46.580> to<00:05:46.729> be<00:05:46.789> the<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:48.530> button<00:05:48.860> and

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
it's supposed to be the the button and

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.879 
it's supposed to be the the button and
the<00:05:49.130> key<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:49.550> open<00:05:49.849> up<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.150> back<00:05:50.330> so<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:51.650> course

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
the key to open up the back so of course

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.409 
the key to open up the back so of course
you<00:05:51.979> had<00:05:52.070> to<00:05:52.130> put<00:05:52.310> that<00:05:52.460> sticker<00:05:52.789> on<00:05:52.910> there<00:05:53.270> I

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
you had to put that sticker on there I

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.980 
you had to put that sticker on there I

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.680 
on my RCS but I put this one on there
just<00:06:00.380> because<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:01.130> feature<00:06:01.789> was<00:06:02.090> so<00:06:02.360> large

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
just because the feature was so large

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.879 
just because the feature was so large
that<00:06:03.199> kind<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:04.280> needed<00:06:04.580> something<00:06:04.970> there<00:06:05.889> not

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
that kind of needed something there not

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.520 
that kind of needed something there not
much<00:06:07.070> going<00:06:07.400> on<00:06:07.520> in<00:06:07.729> the<00:06:07.820> front<00:06:07.970> either<00:06:08.530> just

do<00:06:20.240> not<00:06:20.599> plan<00:06:21.050> on<00:06:21.289> hooking<00:06:21.680> up<00:06:21.800> these<00:06:21.979> light

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
do not plan on hooking up these light

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.760 
do not plan on hooking up these light
buckets<00:06:22.430> but<00:06:22.909> I<00:06:22.940> did<00:06:23.240> put<00:06:23.900> false<00:06:24.349> LEDs<00:06:25.190> in

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
buckets but I did put false LEDs in

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.809 
buckets but I did put false LEDs in
to<00:06:25.889> the<00:06:27.830> into<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.949> lens<00:06:29.160> just<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.550> give<00:06:29.669> it<00:06:29.759> a

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
to the into the lens just to give it a

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.990 
to the into the lens just to give it a
better<00:06:29.970> look<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:31.800> also<00:06:32.099> the<00:06:32.280> Chevy<00:06:32.729> sticker

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
better look and also the Chevy sticker

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.499 
better look and also the Chevy sticker
because<00:06:33.270> it's<00:06:33.629> pretty<00:06:33.960> much<00:06:34.080> necessary<00:06:34.470> and

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
because it's pretty much necessary and

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.779 
because it's pretty much necessary and
that's<00:06:36.509> about<00:06:36.750> it<00:06:37.139> for<00:06:37.560> the<00:06:37.770> stickers<00:06:38.280> on<00:06:38.520> this

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
that's about it for the stickers on this

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.969 
that's about it for the stickers on this
one<00:06:39.090> of<00:06:39.509> course<00:06:39.810> I'll<00:06:39.960> put<00:06:40.139> the<00:06:40.259> team<00:06:40.500> Baxter

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979

sticker<00:06:41.220> on<00:06:41.490> there<00:06:41.759> and<00:06:44.150> probably<00:06:45.150> Castle

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
sticker on there and probably Castle

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.469 
sticker on there and probably Castle
sticker<00:06:45.990> on<00:06:46.229> there<00:06:46.530> cuz<00:06:46.800> I<00:06:47.069> really<00:06:48.030> like<00:06:48.330> the

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
sticker on there cuz I really like the

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:49.999

Castle<00:06:48.870> products<00:06:49.349> and<00:06:49.590> I<00:06:49.680> use<00:06:49.889> them

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
Castle products and I use them

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.369 
Castle products and I use them
everywhere<00:06:50.580> so<00:06:50.909> Castle<00:06:51.690> sticker<00:06:52.020> probably

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
everywhere so Castle sticker probably

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.860 
everywhere so Castle sticker probably
goes<00:06:52.590> on<00:06:52.860> put<00:06:53.639> those<00:06:53.789> on<00:06:54.000> most<00:06:54.210> of<00:06:54.330> my<00:06:54.449> vehicles

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
goes on put those on most of my vehicles

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.879 
goes on put those on most of my vehicles
but<00:06:55.050> that's<00:06:55.229> about<00:06:55.440> it

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
but that's about it

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.969 
but that's about it
so<00:06:56.629> so<00:06:57.629> that's<00:06:57.750> about<00:06:57.990> it<00:06:58.169> for<00:06:58.349> the<00:06:58.470> body<00:06:58.680> I

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
so so that's about it for the body I

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:00.890 
so so that's about it for the body I
want<00:06:59.430> to<00:06:59.580> keep<00:06:59.729> this<00:06:59.909> one<00:07:00.120> simple<00:07:00.509> and<00:07:00.750> that's

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
want to keep this one simple and that's

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.140 
want to keep this one simple and that's
what<00:07:01.080> I<00:07:01.110> did<00:07:01.380> I<00:07:01.650> don't<00:07:01.740> have<00:07:02.009> any<00:07:02.159> other<00:07:02.370> RCS

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
what I did I don't have any other RCS

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.719 
what I did I don't have any other RCS
with<00:07:03.509> the<00:07:03.720> silver<00:07:04.229> bodies<00:07:04.560> so<00:07:04.860> this<00:07:05.430> one's<00:07:05.639> a

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 
with the silver bodies so this one's a

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:07.580 
with the silver bodies so this one's a
little<00:07:05.849> bit<00:07:06.060> different<00:07:06.419> for<00:07:06.599> me<00:07:06.780> and<00:07:06.930> that's

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
little bit different for me and that's

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.939 
little bit different for me and that's
just<00:07:07.889> enough<00:07:08.159> so<00:07:08.580> I<00:07:08.900> only<00:07:09.900> have<00:07:10.169> one<00:07:10.199> problem

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
just enough so I only have one problem

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.010 
just enough so I only have one problem
with<00:07:11.099> this<00:07:11.280> body<00:07:11.550> and<00:07:11.819> that's<00:07:12.360> the<00:07:12.599> fact<00:07:12.780> that

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
with this body and that's the fact that

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.159 
with this body and that's the fact that
it's<00:07:13.169> too<00:07:13.409> clean<00:07:13.710> right<00:07:13.949> now
