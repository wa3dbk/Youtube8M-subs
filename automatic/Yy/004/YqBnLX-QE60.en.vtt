00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hi everyone on the channel or glps you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.890
 today I would like to review here 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.570
 such a fridge sylvanian families 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.450
 strange they have a fridge even more 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.910
 food and than in my fridge and so 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.670
 let's consider all this without 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.300
 much ado my ordinary, I 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.390
 already got this set 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.480
 damn how would you pull it out here 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 I already got this set already collected all 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 I put all the packaging up and here we are 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.360
 actually fridge let's get started 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.300
 Our review from it on the fridge is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.719
 these are the notes you can say 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.370
 let's see what is written here 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.660
 what I understand the recipe 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.789
 actually you are probably not interested 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.530
 It is what is written here and actually 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.930
 nothing could lead 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.079
 well, except for the word milk milk butter it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 oil, if at all correctly read on 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.340
 the table is incomprehensible to me further on such 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.960
 here are the notes written next 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 some kind of party in honor of the soup 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.009
 Birthday Well, on the last note 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.900
 In general, the text I parse, thank God that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.090
 right now again would have to shine their 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.890
 wonderful knowledge of english 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.860
 let's see what's inside 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:34.680
 we have nothing inside the fridge 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.170
 naturally Duc top it all became there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.030
 we put so far everything in this 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.100
 wrapping the only thing that can be 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.170
 say goal on done along with 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.380
 housewives so these are such eggs 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.100
 so this is what we have about the refrigerator and below 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.950
 freezer here we have a lot of all sorts 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.969
 packs that I told you already 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.340
 glued together for quite a while so first 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.149
 us packaging this such a packaging with 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.119
 ice cream as far as I understood and by the way 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.799
 it was not so difficult 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.739
 collect because not thank god zion 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.530
 from cardboard because these are new sets 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.569
 either in old sets of sylvanian families 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.060
 All such packaging here was necessary 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.340
 make paper 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.469
 it was very difficult further on 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.299
 we have a package with this 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:32.129
 cheese as far as I understood 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:35.840
 then orange juice mica 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:40.219
 very further packaging with some more 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.959
 ice cream press with butter and 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:45.959
 the last package is a package with 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.139
 such a dessert package is obtained 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.150
 very nice and beautiful main thing 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.909
 that everything is very well done here and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.359
 qualitatively but now let's go to 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.000
 plastic ground say and so have 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.489
 we have a basket in which we need 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.449
 put these vegetables here 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:11.819
 broccoli carrot and pepper to pepper 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:17.159
 next we have the yogurt itself itself 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:20.310
 ice cream milk and tomato sauce just 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:22.949
 and ketchup as many say let's 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.879
 let's arrange all the refrigerators 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:28.979
 although why I do not know, I think 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.090
 what to show you 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:34.919
 let me take this one off right away 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.810
 it's all the same difficult all these here 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.329
 small things melt inside 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.930
 fridge and nothing 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:47.699
 drop it let's try it 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:53.549
 do ok so next we have 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:55.370
 video with milk right here with windows 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.099
 to put 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:05.599
 now let the vegetables put the fridge be 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:08.780
 here and so on ice cream now we 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:17.269
 we will get it all packing cardboard 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:19.280
 i really keep in the freezer so weird in 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.720
 this time it's okay even 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.510
 nothing fell said lina and no kettle 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.610
 turned the fridge in general, I think 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.710
 what is normally put everything 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.800
 so here it all looks very 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.139
 nice little neat guys this 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:42.020

 here everything is very well thought out but 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.150
