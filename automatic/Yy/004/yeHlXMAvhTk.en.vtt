ones that actually somewhat correlate
into<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> storyline<00:00:14.759> maybe<00:00:15.150> as<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:15.900> what<00:00:16.379> if

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
into the storyline maybe as in what if

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.590 
into the storyline maybe as in what if
not<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.190> plain<00:00:17.580> old<00:00:17.609> fight<00:00:18.119> as<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.510> I'm

Gohan<00:00:21.810> against<00:00:22.410> perfect<00:00:23.010> cell<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.430> know

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
Gohan against perfect cell you know

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.939 
Gohan against perfect cell you know
because<00:00:23.910> that's<00:00:24.090> an<00:00:24.420> absolute<00:00:24.900> take<00:00:25.619> right

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
because that's an absolute take right

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.560 
because that's an absolute take right
from<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> storyline<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> figured<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.510> i

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
from the storyline I figured what i

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.990 
from the storyline I figured what i
could<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:27.930> devorah<00:00:28.560> vs<00:00:29.130> majin<00:00:29.340> buu<00:00:29.640> because

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
could do is devorah vs majin buu because

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.840 
could do is devorah vs majin buu because
if<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.510> guys<00:00:30.660> remember<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:31.520> shortly<00:00:32.520> after

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
if you guys remember right shortly after

majin buu was hatched deborah started
getting<00:00:34.770> iffy<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.309> whether<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.000> they

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
getting iffy on whether or not they

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
getting iffy on whether or not they
should<00:00:36.300> let<00:00:36.600> him<00:00:36.840> live<00:00:37.500> because<00:00:37.739> he<00:00:37.920> thought

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
should let him live because he thought

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.830 
should let him live because he thought
you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.790> majin<00:00:39.059> buu<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.480> too<00:00:39.660> powerful

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you know majin buu was just too powerful

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.810 
you know majin buu was just too powerful
to<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.290> stopped<00:00:40.710> when<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.100> needed<00:00:41.280> him<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> he

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
to be stopped when they needed him to he

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
to be stopped when they needed him to he
couldn't<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.239> controlled<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.559> pretty

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
couldn't be controlled and it was pretty

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.310 
couldn't be controlled and it was pretty
much<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.879> devorah<00:00:45.840> tried<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
much right actually and devorah tried to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.450 
much right actually and devorah tried to
kill<00:00:46.500> him<00:00:46.620> i'm<00:00:46.710> pretty<00:00:46.920> sure<00:00:47.100> he<00:00:47.219> threw<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
kill him i'm pretty sure he threw a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.310 
kill him i'm pretty sure he threw a
spear<00:00:47.850> item<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:48.180> something<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
spear item or something like that but I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840 
spear item or something like that but I
started<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> wonder<00:00:49.770> what<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.129> Tabora<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:50.700> at

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
started to wonder what if Tabora was at

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.840 
started to wonder what if Tabora was at
full<00:00:51.090> power<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.070> absolutely<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.610> wanted

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
full power and absolutely really wanted

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
full power and absolutely really wanted
to<00:00:53.969> kill<00:00:54.180> majin<00:00:54.570> buu<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.770> he<00:00:55.860> was

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
to kill majin buu you know as in he was

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.380 
to kill majin buu you know as in he was
absolutely<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.760> sure<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.210> his<00:00:57.360> goal

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
absolutely for sure that was his goal

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.770 
absolutely for sure that was his goal
and<00:00:57.719> wasn't<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.440> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.480> should<00:01:00.480> maybe

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and wasn't just kind of a should maybe

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.160 
and wasn't just kind of a should maybe
stop<00:01:01.260> possibly<00:01:02.100> sort<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:04.080> gonna

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
stop possibly sort of so I'm we're gonna

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
stop possibly sort of so I'm we're gonna
find<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.530> archipelago<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.670> like

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
find on archipelago just because I like

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
find on archipelago just because I like
that<00:01:06.000> map<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.439> could<00:01:07.650> fight<00:01:07.860> on

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that map and I'm like we could fight on

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.260 
that map and I'm like we could fight on
mountains<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:08.970> probably<00:01:09.150> be

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
mountains because that would probably be

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.969 
mountains because that would probably be
the<00:01:09.450> closest<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.650> actually

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the closest to when it was actually

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.969 
the closest to when it was actually
going<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.049> like

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
going on but I don't know I like

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890 
going on but I don't know I like
archipelago<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> pretty<00:01:15.210> cool<00:01:15.450> map<00:01:15.689> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
archipelago it's a pretty cool map and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.929 
archipelago it's a pretty cool map and
the<00:01:16.650> cutscene<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> place<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.880> us

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the cutscene that a place if one of us

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.429 
the cutscene that a place if one of us
gets<00:01:18.119> knocked<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> arena<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
gets knocked out of the arena is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
gets knocked out of the arena is
actually<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.159> badass<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.820> love<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.450> this
