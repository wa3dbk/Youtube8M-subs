focused<00:00:09.780> damage<00:00:10.080> because<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.620> can<00:00:10.740> see<00:00:10.920> they

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
focused damage because you can see they

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.709 
focused damage because you can see they
actually<00:00:11.700> not<00:00:11.849> regenerate<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.389> maybe<00:00:12.570> they

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
actually not regenerate and maybe they

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.030 
actually not regenerate and maybe they
changed<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:13.139> they<00:00:13.290> used<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.559> generate<00:00:13.740> hit

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
changed it they used to generate hit

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
changed it they used to generate hit
points<00:00:14.309> rather<00:00:14.910> rapidly<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> looks<00:00:15.929> like

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
points rather rapidly but it looks like

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.390 
points rather rapidly but it looks like
they've<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.440> adjusted<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> more<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
they've actually adjusted it to more of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.859 
they've actually adjusted it to more of
a<00:00:17.520> tanking<00:00:17.850> unit<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.090> almost<00:00:18.240> wonder<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:18.539> David

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
a tanking unit I almost wonder if David

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.349 
a tanking unit I almost wonder if David
Camm<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.140> now<00:00:19.289> using<00:00:20.250> roaches<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:20.850> their<00:00:21.180> old

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
Camm is now using roaches in their old

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.000 
Camm is now using roaches in their old
capacity<00:00:21.930> which<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.140> kind<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.470> retreat<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
capacity which is kind of a retreat and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
capacity which is kind of a retreat and
regenerate<00:00:23.430> unit<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:24.269> looks<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.779> they

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
regenerate unit it looks like now they

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
regenerate unit it looks like now they
just<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.199> more<00:00:25.560> set<00:00:25.859> hit<00:00:26.010> point<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.699> noonie

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
just have more set hit point so noonie

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.790 
just have more set hit point so noonie
actually<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.390> able<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> run<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.869> down<00:00:28.109> he's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
actually be able to run it down he's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320 
actually be able to run it down he's
taken<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.340> damage<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.730> themselves<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.240> he

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
taken some damage on themselves but he

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.700 
taken some damage on themselves but he
still<00:00:30.449> has<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.660> lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.900> else<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.349> spare

still has a lot of else to spare
probably<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:32.910> test<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.420> natural

David<00:00:49.890> came<00:00:50.010> hiding<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.489> spire<00:00:50.789> behind<00:00:51.449> his

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
David came hiding that spire behind his

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.880 
David came hiding that spire behind his
natural<00:00:51.899> expansion<00:00:52.170> let<00:00:52.440> me<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> good<00:00:52.710> look

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
natural expansion let me get a good look

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.430 
natural expansion let me get a good look
at<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.300> new<00:00:54.300> knees<00:00:54.480> first<00:00:54.660> person<00:00:55.050> view<00:00:55.199> here

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
at a new knees first person view here

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.510 
at a new knees first person view here
and<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.070> observer<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and you can see with that observer you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
and you can see with that observer you
seeing<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> roach<00:00:57.030> Warren<00:00:57.360> he's<00:00:57.870> seeing<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
seeing the roach Warren he's seeing the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.799 
seeing the roach Warren he's seeing the
additional<00:00:58.680> gas<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.489> he<00:00:59.699> doesn't<00:01:00.690> look

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
additional gas I think he doesn't look

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.180 
additional gas I think he doesn't look
like<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> saw<00:01:01.230> any<00:01:01.440> additional<00:01:01.829> gasping

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
like you saw any additional gasping

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
like you saw any additional gasping

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
place of that natural secondary but

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
place of that natural secondary but
taking<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> look<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.100> let's<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.489> he<00:01:05.580> sees

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
taking a look here let's see if he sees

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.969 
taking a look here let's see if he sees
that<00:01:05.970> spire<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> react<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that spire and is going to react to and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.649 
that spire and is going to react to and
it<00:01:08.070> looks<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.369> unfortunately<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.299> nuni

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it looks like unfortunately for nuni

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.240 
it looks like unfortunately for nuni
he's<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> good<00:01:11.040> look<00:01:11.130> at

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
he's not going to get a good look at

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760 
he's not going to get a good look at
that<00:01:11.400> spire<00:01:11.700> located<00:01:12.299> right<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that spire located right there at all so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.649 
that spire located right there at all so
and<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.520> he's<00:01:14.909> thinking<00:01:15.060> he's<00:01:15.420> seeing

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and I think he's thinking he's seeing

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630

and<00:01:21.900> yeah<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.369> disasters<00:01:24.030> for

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and yeah this is actually disasters for

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.130 
and yeah this is actually disasters for
nuni<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.720> he's<00:01:24.840> good<00:01:24.990> he's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
nuni because I think he's good he's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.240 
nuni because I think he's good he's
already<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> lot<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> zealots<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
already got a lot of zealots on the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.380 
already got a lot of zealots on the
field<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.850> gone<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.150> stalkers

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
field I think you do gone with stalkers

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.480 
field I think you do gone with stalkers
had<00:01:28.140> he<00:01:28.229> realized<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.770> there's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> mule<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
had he realized that there's the mule is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
had he realized that there's the mule is
coming<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.180> he's<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> continue<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
coming and he's going to continue to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.280 
coming and he's going to continue to
produce<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.650> zealots<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.070> probably<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
produce the zealots and probably get a

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
produce the zealots and probably get a
colossus<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.950> support<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
colossus to kind of support this and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.069 
colossus to kind of support this and
again<00:01:35.939> try<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.689> high<00:01:36.869> ground

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
again try to go for that high ground

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.030 
again try to go for that high ground
advantage<00:01:37.259> looks<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.710> he's<00:01:37.860> already

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
advantage looks like he's already

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
advantage looks like he's already
getting<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.520> charge<00:01:38.790> research<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.689> those

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
getting that charge research so those

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.270 
getting that charge research so those
eltz<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.380> effective<00:01:40.710> also<00:01:41.009> getting<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
eltz be more effective also getting a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.679 
eltz be more effective also getting a
Templar<00:01:41.610> archives<00:01:41.939> interestingly<00:01:42.240> enough

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
Templar archives interestingly enough

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.179 
Templar archives interestingly enough
and<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.350> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> curious<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.920> he's<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and I'm kind of curious if he's going to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
and I'm kind of curious if he's going to
follow<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:44.729> some<00:01:45.000> high<00:01:45.119> templar<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
follow this up with some high templar to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.960 
follow this up with some high templar to
do<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.560> group<00:01:47.100> storming<00:01:47.670> perhaps

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
do some of that group storming perhaps

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.399 
do some of that group storming perhaps
thinking<00:01:48.210> there's<00:01:48.540> more<00:01:48.689> roaches<00:01:48.899> along<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
thinking there's more roaches along the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.929 
thinking there's more roaches along the
way<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:49.770> perhaps<00:01:50.220> thinking<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:50.909> might

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
way or perhaps thinking that there might

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.219 
way or perhaps thinking that there might
be<00:01:51.060> banging<00:01:51.570> somewhere<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> near<00:01:52.200> future

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
be banging somewhere in the near future

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
be banging somewhere in the near future

of his units here but it looks like the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.759 
of his units here but it looks like the
first<00:02:58.239> formulas<00:02:58.720> running<00:02:59.319> out<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.470> fields

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
these muta list he's going to end up

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.330 
these muta list he's going to end up
losing<00:03:10.629> his<00:03:10.720> entire<00:03:10.780> nexus<00:03:11.349> his<00:03:11.769> best<00:03:12.010> bet<00:03:12.220> is

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
losing his entire nexus his best bet is

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.979 
losing his entire nexus his best bet is
just<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.579> go<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:13.030> an<00:03:13.150> all<00:03:13.359> an<00:03:13.510> attack<00:03:13.780> with

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
just to go with an all an attack with

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.080 
just to go with an all an attack with
these<00:03:14.109> Colossus<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:15.280> these<00:03:15.459> zealots<00:03:15.609> right

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
these Colossus with these zealots right

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.670 
these Colossus with these zealots right
on<00:03:16.299> that<00:03:16.449> natural<00:03:16.810> expansion<00:03:17.079> he's<00:03:17.379> not<00:03:17.560> going

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
on that natural expansion he's not going

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.289 
on that natural expansion he's not going
to<00:03:17.739> be<00:03:17.799> able<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:18.040> stop<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:18.970> these<00:03:19.060> mules

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
to be able to stop it with these mules

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.180 
to be able to stop it with these mules
looks<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:19.629> he<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.780> turning<00:03:20.199> to<00:03:20.290> do<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.650> but

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
looks like he is turning to do so but

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.699 
looks like he is turning to do so but
yeah<00:03:21.609> his<00:03:22.060> main<00:03:22.359> completely<00:03:22.989> exposed<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:23.650> it

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
yeah his main completely exposed so it

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.780 
yeah his main completely exposed so it
looks<00:03:23.829> like<00:03:23.919> David<00:03:24.250> came<00:03:24.370> with<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.579> big

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
looks like David came with a big

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.819 
looks like David came with a big
advantage<00:03:25.180> there<00:03:25.629> but<00:03:26.079> David<00:03:26.349> Kim<00:03:26.470> does<00:03:26.650> have

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
advantage there but David Kim does have

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.009 
advantage there but David Kim does have
to<00:03:26.949> fight<00:03:27.160> off<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.819> rest<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.120> these<00:03:28.180> troops<00:03:28.480> he

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
to fight off the rest of these troops he

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.330 
to fight off the rest of these troops he
might<00:03:29.230> lose<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.590> Queen<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.919> meantime<00:03:30.099> but

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
might lose the Queen in the meantime but

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.710 
might lose the Queen in the meantime but
he'll<00:03:30.430> still<00:03:30.519> probably<00:03:31.209> come<00:03:31.419> out<00:03:31.510> with<00:03:31.629> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
he'll still probably come out with the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.059 
he'll still probably come out with the
victory<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:32.019> looks<00:03:32.620> like<00:03:32.709> he's<00:03:32.889> going<00:03:32.980> to

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
victory here looks like he's going to

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.770 
victory here looks like he's going to
run<00:03:33.160> up<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.340> these<00:03:33.430> roaches<00:03:33.609> again<00:03:34.030> very<00:03:34.329> very

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
run up in these roaches again very very

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.479 
run up in these roaches again very very
good<00:03:34.930> units<00:03:35.230> against<00:03:35.560> cells<00:03:35.799> but<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.160> charge

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
good units against cells but that charge

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.979 
good units against cells but that charge
now<00:03:36.760> running<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.150> there<00:03:37.510> getting<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.810> very

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
provide some degree of defense and it

forge<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:16.080> doesn't<00:05:16.440> look<00:05:16.500> like<00:05:16.650> he<00:05:16.770> has<00:05:16.860> enough

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
forge it doesn't look like he has enough

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.560 
forge it doesn't look like he has enough
to<00:05:17.250> really<00:05:17.430> defend<00:05:17.760> against<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.510> I

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
to really defend against this and I

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.760 
to really defend against this and I
don't<00:05:18.750> think<00:05:18.870> he<00:05:18.990> produce<00:05:19.170> any<00:05:19.440> units<00:05:19.680> of

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
don't think he produce any units of

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.900 
don't think he produce any units of
those<00:05:19.890> robotics<00:05:20.280> facility<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.700> are<00:05:20.760> really

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
those robotics facility that are really

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.730 
those robotics facility that are really
going<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.060> help<00:05:21.210> him<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:22.110> stalkers<00:05:22.530> getting
