00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.460
 Welcome to another profile. 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.200
 I am going to talk about the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.360
 third pedro henrique 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.490
 it has the following components 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.690
 processor is an effect 6 300 with the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.940
 motherboard gigabyte gear 78 mts2 of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.000
 Ram memory is a little corner of four 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.789
 gigas of the visible brand pdr 3333 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.119
 hba1c mega-hertz and 1 terabyte gate 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.329
 j3 video card is an area of ​​77 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.000
 seventy from a spin to xfx the source is a 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.600
 cei three beques ian 50 r black edition 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.640
 of the cabinet a home tech g fire show 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 his computer first image to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 cabinet overview of his housekeeping 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.030
 the cables of this cabinet brand for me 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.219
 It's novelty but what can I say that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.780
 the cabinet exported a nice relationship 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.390
 setting it up a configuration 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.430
 but it has an excellent cost 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.210
 benefit and already performs well 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.180
 cool 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.280
 in this other image we see and the f6 300 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 It's refrigerated, he concluded . 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.210
 for those who do not know the word death 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.920
 means that the club that comes with the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 then when you buy a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.299
 processor arm and come with that spoon 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 and we can also see the comb 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.010
 memory brand 4g 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.939
 there we have the hd seagate that is 1 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.790
 terabyte 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.210
 He only has this hd in his image. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.189
 see his video card that is from xfx is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 hd7 70 a video card than the model 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.630
 but it plays games there with 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.150
 excellent graphics such as 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.280
 robert 4 in the middle in full hd and one 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 very economical insert that will not 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.240
 spend a lot of energy so her 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.369
 very low and this means that you do not 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 need to invest very important 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.259
 xfx works with the model of 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.909
 refrigeration gouche in this series 7000 will 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.840
 tell me that it is very efficient and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.490
 silent 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.619
 then this video card has cost 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.570
 very good benefit and is recommended 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.520
 by the majority of the forum goes beyond 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.520
 lnet as his video card does not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.110
 loses a lot on the day he put a fountain 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.620
 three technicians who do not have 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.690
 more than 80%, but already guarantees 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.470
 there you run the settings that it 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.360
 It has 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.150
 although I do not recommend putting a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.610
 source of this I preferred to put some 6 x 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.959
 4 30 will give you certain that despite having 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.120
 a lower power 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.680
 it has a much better efficiency than 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 in the end it will give you a 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.810
 power greater than this source there but 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.850
 in the configuration of it is running nice 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.770
 and we have a 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.870
 cabinet that obviously looks pretty and 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.630
 Nice has a simple action that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.120
 machines of this caliber and legal cobain 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.580
 designer and handsome he has an air flow 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.040
 also reasonable he placed the lion in the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.870
 front of 12 cm and one behind 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.820
 two centimeters because already 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.370
 enough to have a cool airflow 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.680
 this cabinet he has four sb 2.0 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 front and for those who play rich more than 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.500
 two people is ideal for you to place 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.660
 a joystick, right? 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.910
 and has a side acrylic and you 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.230
 can view part of the processor 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.700
 and the video card 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.630
