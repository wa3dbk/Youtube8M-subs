00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.969
 hello everyone welcome to the saffron yellow kitchen today we prepare together 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.730
 the olives all'ascolana are a typical Marche appetizer but that by now comes 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.340
 recognized and enjoyed throughout Italy 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.400
 in this case while tales from the school filled with meat but vi 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.250
 remember that there are also those with the stuffing of viamichelin fish ingredients 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.259
 so what we need 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.130
 a kilo of oliver of the soft variety of Ascoli 30 grams of breadcrumbs 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.170
 80 grams of grated Parmesan cheese 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.580
 a new grated rind of half a lemon 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.740
 a pinch of nutmeg a pinch even say cloves 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.690
 ground 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.180
 200 250 ml of white wine salt 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.630
 a small rib of celery a small carrot half onion 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.610
 100 grams of chicken breast 100 grams of beef 100 grams of meat of 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.590
 swine 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.520
 then 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.240
 for you to learn and pretend we will have breadcrumbs 2 eggs of flour and half 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.080
 liter of olive oil 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 then we prepare the olives together with Ascoli 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.960
 first homes in a pan 3 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil e 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 then I added a mince made with carrot celery that onion 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.780
 and if I do keys altogether for a 15 to 20 minutes and then add the beef veal 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 beef and pork that has been cut into small cubes 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.860
 at this point I fry everything 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.010
 after which when the meat is well browned add the glass of wine 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.070
 white release smoking over very gentle heat all if 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.080
 it will take place around one hour 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.290
 while the meat is cooking we do not devote ourselves to the dripping of our own 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.270
 Ascoli 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 The only thing to do is to take a small boxcutter and start the process 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.989
 practice a pale skill starting at the ends 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.760
 italian elika must be practiced as when you intend to peel a photo 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.230
 without ever having to break the peel so to speak so we pass the most 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.319
 as close as possible to the core you see looking for. not to break the peel too 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.679
 because then from the olivander harry composed with the internal filling 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.849
 when the carmen has finished cooking levine shaded we adjust salt 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.409
 after which we turn off and leave to cool 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.779
 once the meat has cooled we could found it with the blades of a 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:53.459
 mixer for example that returns. very consistency in a very fine grain 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.279
 end 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.849
 at this point we can add the grated lemon rind 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.899
 the cloves e 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.899
 nutmeg 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.499
 place 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.779
 grated cheese 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.869
 the bread crumbs and reduced son 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.889
 a very fine powder 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.119
 all we have to do is knead 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.439
 if necessary, adjust salt 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.439
 and let it sit for a few minutes 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.219
 and here we are finally at the moment when we have to stuff our go live 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.419
 so let's take a small piece of filling 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.910
 which must be more or less the same volume as what you have wrong 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.800
 Trento. hazel we open 1 pound we insert 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.719
 ok let's put it back together again perfectly and proceed like this with a 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.719
 some patience up interesting 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:07.730
 once stuffed and the compounds all the lire at the time of talking to her 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.680
 then we will pass my bank in the flour in the beaten egg and in the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.719
 bread crumbs 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.599
 after this sequence if you still want more fanatec olive trees 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.250
 let's say a lot more bread-making let's pass them again in the new one 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.599
 and again in breadcrumbs at this point here is the result we fry then 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.599
 I'm very hot 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.999
 we extract and when they are golden brown 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.119
 and here we are finally after so much effort in ours all'ascolana are ready for 

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:49.139
 be served I recommend you can serve them both hot and cold and they will be 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.630
 equally good 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.890
 then the saffron yellow I greet the next video recipe
