something to learn all those shapes is
I'm<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.980> picking<00:00:32.250> everything<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:32.940> again

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I'm not picking everything and I'm again

this<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.780> concentrates<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> left

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
this really concentrates on the left

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.840 
this really concentrates on the left
hand<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> most

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
hand which I think it's the most

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.590 
hand which I think it's the most
important<00:00:36.570> part<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.820> let's<00:00:38.820> learn<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> first

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
important part so let's learn the first

the<00:00:47.430> first<00:00:47.700> notice<00:00:48.000> pick<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> next<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:48.690> are

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the first notice pick the next two are

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
the first notice pick the next two are
hammered<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:50.940> study<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.329> an

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hammered on and then study with an

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.139 
hammered on and then study with an
upstroke<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.340> pick<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> next<00:00:53.550> three<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.030> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
upstroke I pick the next three so it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:03.100 
upstroke I pick the next three so it's
down<00:00:54.480> Hammer<00:00:55.379> hammer<00:00:55.530> um

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.750 

let's<00:01:03.890> have<00:01:04.129> a<00:01:04.190> look<00:01:04.309> at<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.460> right<00:01:04.610> hand

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
let's have a look at the right hand

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:15.480 
let's have a look at the right hand
again<00:01:05.120> and

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

if<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.610> were<00:01:16.700> going<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.880> play<00:01:17.030> without<00:01:17.210> the

if you were going to play without the
left-hander<00:01:18.020> if<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:18.170> like

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.390 

sometimes<00:01:26.750> I<00:01:26.870> do<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:27.560> up<00:01:27.680> lefthand<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.250> to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
sometimes I do it up lefthand is to

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.300 
sometimes I do it up lefthand is to
focus<00:01:28.940> on<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.450> on<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:29.930> right<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:33.100> let's<00:01:34.100> all

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
focus on the on the right and let's all

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.400

to<00:01:34.430> play<00:01:34.610> each<00:01:34.850> one<00:01:35.090> slowly<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:35.720> can<00:01:36.140> get

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
to play each one slowly so you can get

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:51.700 
to play each one slowly so you can get
