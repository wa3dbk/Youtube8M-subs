00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.410
 hi friends and quickies with moritz 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.850
 and low a bit of stop 3 of games 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.040
 silly ones that I've had 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.910
 is a bit unfortunate in some 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.230
 tactical aspect but let's see if 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.970
 I can recover a little bit against 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.619
 moritz maurice has very little the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.260
 then lose with this would be a 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 serious disaster make attack tower treat 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 tower to the gym 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.189
 I against this attack sometimes like the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.250
 afip and other times I do not eat it depends 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.130
 how am I in the mood 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.570
 today I'm not going to play 6 because this one is 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.220
 playing fast and it looks like only 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.340
 they know well 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.580
 now you are going to eat and eat the g7 so 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.950
 I have to follow juana g6 now but 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.770
 I think I do not like that 6 oleson plays 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.960
 theory and michael could you eat and drink 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.440
 of king is now possible 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.829
 I do not think we have an error but it should not 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.829
 be this 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.610
 Well, I'm going to eat here about 35 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.140
 and I'm going to play 6 it will only take moment 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.300
 we do not need to react here in 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.690
 the flank 12 5 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.480
 when you play with hong kong little elo and 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.770
 worse than you in principle is good not 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.240
 enter brave major their 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 campitos is something that I have that is very 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.299
 very good you are doing 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.590
 sometimes it's better to make a line 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.280
 secondary but that forces him to think 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.439
 by itself and this usually these 3 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.340
 13 4 that the truth does not have any 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.979
 felt and now it just went well 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.560
 because of this check and input 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.079
 des in red 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.310
 for pulled off the horse and had tama fingers 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.119
 that was very hard that I do not know why they have 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.050
 done talking about 2 that seemed 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.550
 very hard 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.290
 it comes but can not recover but 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.110
 neither is priority clear metro 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.670
 defend and attacked lv2 but as you see 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.800
 now in stable will think for itself 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.340
 same I already have that I have a very idea 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.470
 hidden that is three I think I'm going 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.450
 to make three pawn for and horse for 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 five this is going there is a surprise 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.590
 tremendous look what a surprise is going to 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.420
 take with 3 dredger now there is a 'vis 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.780
 to vis' of ladies your lady is not 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.860
 protected and has a core 5 horse that 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.990
 can be very interesting set 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.370
 very funny this play taking advantage 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.040
 that his lady is stuck in the dry 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.830
 well as you see stage of the theory 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 I may not have done the best but it's 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.950
 the fast game and it does not matter either 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.110
 too important is to get your 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.410
 place as soon as possible and force her to think 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.210
 itself 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.210
 and normally 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.799
 If your opponent is weaker then in 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.290
 force her to think for herself because she 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.939
 creates some difficulties or I do not think 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.909
 that he, like the horse, I am going to change 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:50.519
 yours or bishop's 7 possibly 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.530
 long block now lamination adame and of 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.030
 3 so I worked 3 must be unique 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.030
 for him here because he has to defend 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.530
 the pawn since 32 account worked 3 I have 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.030
 what to think 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.290
 what can be the best move 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.290
 probably go horseback 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.590
 He has gone here but he is leaving 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.430
 worse I do not think I 'm riding on the 5 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.620
 has left him a little bit touched 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.620
 and now against reich and one last one is 96 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.550
 now he is getting into a situation 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.280
 very very very dangerous 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.070
 here my intuition is telling me of 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.800
 play here of 5 will open diagonal of 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.800
 bishop and all will be flowers languages 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.280
 the 5 with which the horse makes it 3 nothing 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.330
 by pawn this looks very good 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.390
 intuition tells me that that has to be 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.040
 the play open the diagonal of the bishop and 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.340
 there with lady and four and look for a network 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.340
 of mate 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.500
 looks like the right move 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.130
 its king and in the center can hold it 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.140
 by moritz it's not very thin and it's 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.100
 well but in principle against this one had 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.100
 planned 4 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.710
 or the radio here and now I guess every 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.090
 day by city has the best look if 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.970
 horse for horse is for horses 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.639
 mate attacked the lady too and now as 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.590
 you see the strength of the bishop 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.109
 then we will look at the theory of the mind to 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.850
 see if this opening is well played or 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.300
 do not 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.300
 but 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.340
 well this is good avoid the mates 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.099
 then let's see deal remembering who 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.110
 You see one should eat it and I think it's 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.379
 what I'm going to do but before it should be 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.020
 even greater is not that there is no debate 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.669
 debate for both the games the tower and 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.040
 is and now I'm just going to keep an eye on you 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.660
 be fine and the bird 5 as a check 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.610
 he will do horseback riding horse 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.639
 pawn 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.430
 and immediately I would touch the leaves the 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.449
 fast game well let's make a 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.430
 which I have not done so far 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.529
 I'm not going to open on the screen and I'm going to 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.009
 load the value that is the book of 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.900
 openings that I have better then in 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.139
 principle we can take a look for 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.339
 see if it's been that once but for 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.669
 transposition we have reached the 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.669
 french 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.389
 Apply 56 of 47 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.180
 the 5 horses of 7h 4 is the second most 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.440
 popular but bishop for them in fact 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.230
 that was correct but to 6 that the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.580
 player is already well and hires May 4 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.540
 well he has done to play to connect 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.680
 because 5 h because 5 and 5 or whatever it is 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.260
 theoretical that I have done as you can see 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.100
 this blog g6 apparently is the most 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.260
 Strong has done has made payable here 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.350
 I do not remember what but a rare play has 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.850
 done f4 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.480
 I'm pretty sure it has to be 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.480
 a loose watery 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.610
 the black is clearly better after 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.770
 of this x of 45 people that I have actually 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.970
 nailed the answer which is 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.160
 pretty good because you would say that the 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.600
 introduction this function of g-6 is the 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.270
 play that he has to do and I 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.860
 would hit with f5 stephenie cross is work 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.490
 in control 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.639
 and because he used to do everything for 8-7 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.310
 like the lady and takes good because since 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:24.200
 it makes us positive for the future 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.200
 I'm going to go back there, cc 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.580
 and it has even been good to throw a 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.849
 look at that position then you have already 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.080
 seen I was able to go back quite well 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.080
 you have moritz 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.850
 and we all have some information 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.569
 in fact 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.550
 enough games I presume rating is 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.439
 2.149 that is not far from mine or 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.270
 be that possibly as a little better 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:54.050
 of what he has done and good until the 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.050
 next chao
