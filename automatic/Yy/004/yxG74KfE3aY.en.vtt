00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 extremely difficult and there is only worth 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.470
 expect a rival probably at some 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.840
 mistakes again mistakes and so friends 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.090
 the beginning of the card nsk again remind 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 what we comment with alexey principle 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.590
 as is customary in the lan-finals 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.850
 without any information before 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.560
 moment as one second team will 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.500
 understand who is where is specific 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.800
 tank well and setup on your screens this 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.779
 350 100 two from each third two t1 each 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
 principle so far that card with some kind 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.500
 magical with the stages of the technique is not us 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.690
 surprises but here's how it goes plays already 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.719
 another thread issue is played from the bottom base 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 the command mayn't work from the top base 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.309
 so well and water then see what to do 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.620
 there will be one of the teams in fact 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.110
 Here it is very interesting to watch it. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.989
 also interesting fucking well, that's another 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.180
 parties have friends here here here 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.190
 something special I will probably or not here 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.870
 Somehow it's hard for me to have 3 teams 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.590
 knocking all the same the fact that the curtains are 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 first light 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.390
 yes here anri us in the light on it was 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.859
 backache heard the command and understand 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.690
 people are most likely trying now 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.330
 to execute the mayndy dime they understand that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 tried to make unity now but for the light 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.250
 it was not all the equipment we saw 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.860
 only one tank and it can 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.360
 be anything you need to ask for now 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 switch probably another team 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.159
 let's go to the blue ones let's see what's here 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 happens of course we remember how the beginning 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.420
 rounds tried to do on the go there under 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.180
 approved until lit up we tried 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.119
 answer on the illuminated tank lumbago 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 and finding and that is movement it is not 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.509
 very good, but in principle 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.079
 such a picture we have see what 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.930
 will be on the principle of waiting for the first 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.490
 contact 1 intelligence and of course the first 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.710
 first fight but probably all the same 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.750
 you know a miniature tacker 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.439
 what we are shown now is what we are 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.530
 see about how controlled 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.140
 map each of the parties as far as here 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.210
 drives you the opportunity to go do not go 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.759
 shine under the chamber 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.680
 considering all this we already have about that 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.469
 imagine how you should finish yourself 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.100
 but also a talent final team to him 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.960
 cooked 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.060
 very long and the main task such 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.069
 main task for each team 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.620
 It was to get to the LAN final and of course 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.950
 here win get quite good 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.260
 prize to become a champion but still 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.720
 of course we will have our favorite cliff 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.160
 our favorite mines are very cool 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.300
 cards this season on which we 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.090
 look at a huge amount 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.580
 Dynamic interesting meat shares such 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.010
 for rub but last time basically 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.050
 we talked about it and on the cliff map 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.780
 in fact, you can also play neat from 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.670
 protection but not everyone is able to give 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.610
 for now let's see here probably too 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.560
 how will the teams act 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.860
 came up with a guy trying to implement 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.040
 possibility of that side 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.120
 for which they play well this side on 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.549
 which they now did the calculation here it is 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.400
 one tank and a pair of tanks play it 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.100
 yes, but of course itâ€™s still very 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.280
 calm the situation so well, if everything is so 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.630
 will happen of course we must 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.760
 we are afraid of it all tankmen are afraid of something 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.730
 if everything is played there it will cause either 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.140
 11 debates 00 then later but honestly I 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.030
 very , very much 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.739
 liked the sandy river and and such 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.180
 gift for all those who watched the match 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.600
 which will end in a draw 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.390
 and of course the real test 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.310
 crazy nerves i don't know screams and under 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.109
 tank vault after all tank crews 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.480
 Of course, China is a bit heavy 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.739
 only one card 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.600
 either capture the base or don't give 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.350
 seize the base in the same turn because 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.660
 teams 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.579
 initially knew what format would be 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.160
 happen here 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.200
 each meeting on the lan final and here 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.590
 just work on the last card on 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.940
 possible assault defense was rather 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.100
 most worked out 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.109
 as they play every day 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.489
 Essentially on these maps, but what will be 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.290
 on the lan final and what's possible with us 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.170
 today will be very often the last 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.540
 the sixth card is most likely these 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.069
 blanks that now have a pocket 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.310
 each skoy but ahead we still have two 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.250
 maps where there should be a serious action 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.650
 it and the cliff it and the mines so for now 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.660
 let 's bet on these two 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.400
 follow up to eventually understand 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.859
 still who focused on 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.989
 this is a cap I'm sure that 1 2 teams are 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.190
 strategy where they still have good 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.019
 strong cards on which teams 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.820
 cool inferior there are weaknesses 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.949
 where the team does not perform well 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.930
 so each team has a plan for this 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.720
 match and that's who where I will risk 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.090
 We already think the next or immediately 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.630
 we will see cards so far very calmly 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.979
 teams don't see a friend 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.410
 there is no light flying constantly 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.310
 shells on the building in the direction of the enemy 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.130
 try there guys 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.100
 some blinds somebody sypanut 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.960
 caterpillar creed on hang nose anna 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.490
 kotova here are the blinds the blinds and this 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.740
 time no light occurs and 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.740
 in fact absolutely absolutely calm 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.760
 the situation on the map is also in principle 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.830
 true and for whom now 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.289
 the secret will not reveal that all the same guys 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.419
 they divided the floor there they saw it 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.729
 this is well understood and already understood it 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.590
 I haven't understood this for quite a while. 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.539
 guys who play tanks that 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.370
 they play constantly in 742 well, no one at all 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.020
 reading is going on somewhere 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.400
 there the fence broke everyone already knows that 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.020
 happens where what each tank 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.930
 staying with rivals but this is when you 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.580
 you study your opponents well 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.590
 and of course it's hard for me to forget 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.050
 it's always hard to be a champion let's say 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.550
 the guys like us constantly need 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.250
 just think of something new because 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.900
 that they are being watched in principle and thatâ€™s all 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.610
 these teams are here gathered for 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.470
 they look at him very much they know how they are 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.139
 play what each player's position does 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.159
 of each tank and therefore very hard 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.800
 now play at such a high level 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.990
 constantly but guys coping with it 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.930
 42 seconds of us and you see that 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.289
 we got missing only here here 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.590
 on the NSC card on its 500 second land 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.599
 they rest in peace but in general 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.729
 good was a tank more expensive was a tank good and 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.940
 will not think there is another little bit 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.650
 okay, it turns out that this card is more likely 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.659
 all over with some no one's 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.030
 the result and at the end of two cards 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.370
 we will still be a team which 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.750
 scores here are periodically for 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.550
 light and began to pass just what we 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.169
 saw diadora there somewhere in the middle of green 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.210
 there is also a light zico yes yes small 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.729
 but I have the same 5 last minute and here already 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.350
 Well, of course there are theoretical chances 33 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.780
 seconds grab the base but 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.760
 of course you need to try 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.490
 so that the opponent also tried not to 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.530
 fall not kill and probably even 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.530
 nothing else to do such a situation 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.310
 when time is short, everything remains the goal 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.530
 you in the sight 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.760
 you need to be just lazy but what 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.560
 now it will actually go 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.430
 completely different game on the idea 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.320
 2 open cards and we expect a lot 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.540
 there are crazy fights and i'm sure all the same 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.390
 here somewhere here's a card you know very much 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.530
 interestingly performed by a guy from mein 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.960
 the mines are very interesting by the way at all 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.610
 question about the mines that there will be 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.510
 is it traditional 35 second 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.270
 contact center 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.640
 either this is something completely different 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.440
 played last week by the way not 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.970
 we forget the unity team won the test 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.880
 championship formats 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.220
 768 unlimited by level i.e. 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.990
 Tens were her in the final virtus.pro there 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.240
 was very hard by 50 but where there 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.370
 all came under unity but I think that in 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.810
 anyway, the whole thing looked who 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.800
 did not look at our youtube channel 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.530
 replays of matches 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.050
 unity na'vi and virtus.pro and of course 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.590
 teams moment on dozens of format 78 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.590
 also
