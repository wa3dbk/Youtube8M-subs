00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
phasing facing toward the neck I don't

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
phasing facing toward the neck I don't
use<00:00:40.260> any<00:00:40.460> pedals<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.180> kind

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
use any pedals just because it is kind

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.110 
use any pedals just because it is kind
of<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> new<00:00:42.690> setup<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.170> me<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.700> now<00:00:44.730> I'm

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
of a new setup for me so as of now I'm

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
of a new setup for me so as of now I'm
just<00:00:45.390> using<00:00:45.629> mxr<00:00:46.379> Dinah<00:00:46.590> comp<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.219> bit

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
just using mxr Dinah comp a little bit

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.250 
just using mxr Dinah comp a little bit
of<00:00:47.430> compression<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:48.300> i<00:00:48.600> think<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.020> kind<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
of compression which i think is kind of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310 
of compression which i think is kind of
a<00:00:49.350> must<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> clean<00:00:50.070> channel<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.320> eight

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
a must with a clean channel and eight

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
reverb and some delay also for speakers

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.009 
reverb and some delay also for speakers
I'm<00:01:00.510> using<00:01:00.660> an<00:01:00.930> open<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.789> avatar<00:01:02.789> cab<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I'm using an open back avatar cab with a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.170 
I'm using an open back avatar cab with a
be<00:01:04.409> fitter<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> energy<00:01:05.280> 12<00:01:05.549> H<00:01:05.880> 30<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
be fitter the energy 12 H 30 in it

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.140 
be fitter the energy 12 H 30 in it
throughout<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.770> using<00:01:11.150> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
throughout this I will be using the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200 
throughout this I will be using the
piezo<00:01:12.450> option<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.340> piezo<00:01:14.760> Eggman<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
piezo option the piezo Eggman and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
piezo option the piezo Eggman and
magnetics<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> main<00:01:17.159> decks<00:01:17.340> just

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
magnetics and then the main decks just

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.859 
magnetics and then the main decks just
so<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> how<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.780> all

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so you can kind of see if how they all

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.390 
so you can kind of see if how they all
react<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> clean<00:01:20.759> channel

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.460 

okay<00:01:28.270> I'm<00:01:28.390> let's<00:01:28.540> start<00:01:28.720> off<00:01:28.780> here<00:01:28.810> using<00:01:29.350> this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
okay I'm let's start off here using this

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.760 
okay I'm let's start off here using this
flip<00:01:29.740> position<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.720> I'll<00:01:31.780> be<00:01:31.900> using<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.410> neck

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
flip position so I'll be using the neck

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.820 
flip position so I'll be using the neck
pickup<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.190> air<00:01:33.310> Norden<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.850> magnetics<00:01:34.330> and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
pickup the air Norden the magnetics and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.970 
pickup the air Norden the magnetics and
the<00:01:35.830> okay<00:01:36.400> so<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.780> use<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.170> when<00:01:38.680> I'm

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
the okay so like you use this when I'm

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.210 
the okay so like you use this when I'm
playing<00:01:39.280> kind<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.270> finger<00:01:40.810> picking<00:01:40.990> style

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
playing kind of a finger picking style

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.250 
playing kind of a finger picking style
just<00:01:42.220> because<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.820> think<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.630> gives<00:01:43.720> me<00:01:43.930> the
