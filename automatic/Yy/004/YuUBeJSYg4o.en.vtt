00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
enough to do the job and if the car

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.790 
enough to do the job and if the car
rolls<00:01:26.000> over<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.570> fuel<00:01:26.990> should<00:01:27.140> stay<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.560> there

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
rolls over the fuel should stay in there

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.170 
rolls over the fuel should stay in there
so<00:01:28.280> just<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.580> make<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.729> as<00:01:28.880> safe<00:01:28.970> as<00:01:29.090> possible

there's<00:02:27.640> clearly<00:02:27.910> more<00:02:28.239> energy<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> car

there's clearly more energy in the car
but<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> still<00:02:29.890> doesn't<00:02:30.220> look<00:02:30.569> unwieldy<00:02:34.830> now

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830
