how to take care of your spa caring for

how to take care of your spa caring for
a<00:00:23.130> spa<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> basically<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> same<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.570> taking

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
a spa is basically the same as taking

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.560 
a spa is basically the same as taking
care<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.650> pool<00:00:25.859> except<00:00:26.699> everything<00:00:27.210> happens

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
care of a pool except everything happens

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.200 
care of a pool except everything happens
much<00:00:27.779> faster<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:29.369> follow<00:00:29.580> these<00:00:29.880> simple

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
much faster if you follow these simple

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
much faster if you follow these simple
steps<00:00:30.420> you'll<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.349> able<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> keep<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.980> spa

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
steps you'll be able to keep your spa

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.350 
steps you'll be able to keep your spa
just<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:32.759> clean<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.360> clear<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.380> pool<00:00:35.360> one

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
just as clean and clear as your pool one

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.119 
just as clean and clear as your pool one
of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> biggest<00:00:36.989> differences<00:00:37.410> between<00:00:37.680> pool

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
of the biggest differences between pool

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.760 
of the biggest differences between pool
and<00:00:38.370> spa<00:00:38.579> care<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.600> bromine<00:00:40.140> tablets<00:00:40.590> are

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and spa care is that bromine tablets are

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950 
and spa care is that bromine tablets are
commonly<00:00:41.190> used<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.640> sanitize<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> spa<00:00:42.570> instead

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
commonly used to sanitize a spa instead

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650 
commonly used to sanitize a spa instead
of<00:00:43.379> party<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:44.579> bromine<00:00:45.030> holds<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.510> better

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
of party because bromine holds up better

in<00:00:45.930> heat<00:00:46.399> chlorine<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.879> used<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.750> it's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in heat chlorine can be used but it's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.490 
in heat chlorine can be used but it's
recommended<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.410> use<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> sodium<00:00:50.129> dichlorite

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
recommended to use a sodium dichlorite

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.630 
recommended to use a sodium dichlorite
even<00:00:52.500> though<00:00:52.620> chlorine<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> less<00:00:53.460> expensive

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
even though chlorine is less expensive

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760 
even though chlorine is less expensive
you'll<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> add<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.230> often<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.680> your

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you'll have to add it more often to your

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.840 
you'll have to add it more often to your
spa<00:00:56.809> many<00:00:57.809> chemicals<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.469> specific<00:00:59.039> spawns

spa many chemicals have specific spawns

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
spa many chemicals have specific spawns
because<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> strength<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.870> those<00:01:00.960> chemicals

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
because the strength of those chemicals

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
because the strength of those chemicals
are<00:01:01.559> better<00:01:01.800> suited<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.850> smaller<00:01:03.149> size

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
are better suited for the smaller size

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
are better suited for the smaller size
of<00:01:03.719> spas<00:01:03.930> compared<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.680> pools

version of chlorite that's just response
spas<00:01:11.820> also<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.659> drained<00:01:12.930> every<00:01:13.530> three

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
spas also need to be drained every three

spas also need to be drained every three
to<00:01:13.920> four<00:01:14.070> months<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.330> extend<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> life

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
to four months this will extend the life
