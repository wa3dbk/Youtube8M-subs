00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.510 
you figure out where you would actually

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.810 
you figure out where you would actually
start<00:00:06.050> the<00:00:06.260> set<00:00:06.470> of<00:00:06.590> stairs<00:00:06.920> in<00:00:07.640> a

exactly what I'm gonna do in this video

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.779 
exactly what I'm gonna do in this video
I<00:00:46.989> went<00:00:47.989> ahead<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:48.589> drew<00:00:48.859> a<00:00:48.890> stairway<00:00:49.519> in

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
I went ahead and I drew a stairway in

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.860 
I went ahead and I drew a stairway in
there<00:00:50.089> just<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.480> give<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:50.750> an<00:00:50.839> idea<00:00:52.690> kind<00:00:53.690> of

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
there just to give you an idea kind of

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.360 
there just to give you an idea kind of
you<00:00:54.019> know<00:00:54.170> hey<00:00:54.350> this<00:00:54.589> is<00:00:54.739> where<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.100> stairs

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
you know hey this is where the stairs

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.910 
you know hey this is where the stairs
we'd<00:00:56.089> like<00:00:56.329> them<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.809> go<00:00:56.989> this<00:00:57.350> is<00:00:57.410> where<00:00:57.710> we

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
we'd like them to go this is where we

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.180 
we'd like them to go this is where we
would<00:00:58.039> like<00:00:58.249> them<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.519> start<00:00:59.109> but<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:01.129> said

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
would like them to start but like I said

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.700 
would like them to start but like I said
that<00:01:01.850> isn't<00:01:02.390> always<00:01:02.600> going<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.079> be<00:01:03.289> the<00:01:03.469> case

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
that isn't always going to be the case

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.770 
that isn't always going to be the case
first<00:01:04.550> thing<00:01:04.790> you're<00:01:04.940> going<00:01:05.090> to<00:01:05.210> need<00:01:05.450> to<00:01:05.600> do

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
first thing you're going to need to do

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.910 
first thing you're going to need to do
is<00:01:05.810> draw<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.500> line<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:07.310> vertical<00:01:07.610> line<00:01:08.150> from<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
is draw a line a vertical line from the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.870 
is draw a line a vertical line from the
farthest<00:01:10.550> point<00:01:11.290> where<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.010> Headroom<00:01:13.490> would

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
farthest point where the Headroom would

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.320 
farthest point where the Headroom would
be<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.240> lowest<00:01:14.510> in<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.980> stairway<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:17.090> that's

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
be the lowest in the stairway and that's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.750 
be the lowest in the stairway and that's
usually<00:01:17.540> going<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:17.990> be<00:01:18.080> on<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.860> side<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
usually going to be on the side of the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.890 
usually going to be on the side of the
stairway<00:01:20.300> coming<00:01:20.900> down<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:22.450> if<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.690> could

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
stairway coming down so if you could

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.950 
stairway coming down so if you could
just<00:01:24.050> imagine<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.160> had<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.820> beam<00:01:26.390> like<00:01:26.750> we

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
just imagine if you had a beam like we

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.090 
just imagine if you had a beam like we
have<00:01:27.200> here<00:01:27.620> for<00:01:27.860> example<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:30.740> wanted<00:01:31.010> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
have here for example and you wanted the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.590 
have here for example and you wanted the
stairway<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.520> go<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.000> opposite<00:01:32.420> direction

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
stairway to go in the opposite direction

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.900 
stairway to go in the opposite direction
then<00:01:33.410> this<00:01:33.620> line<00:01:33.950> would<00:01:34.280> be<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.760> other

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
then this line would be on the other

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.690 
then this line would be on the other
side<00:01:35.230> so<00:01:36.230> if<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:36.500> want<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.950> stairway<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.370> go

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
side so if you want the stairway to go

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.350 
side so if you want the stairway to go
up<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:39.140> kind<00:01:39.230> of<00:01:39.350> imagine<00:01:39.680> coming<00:01:40.670> down<00:01:41.120> the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
up just kind of imagine coming down the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.710 
up just kind of imagine coming down the
stairway<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:41.930> is<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.770> site<00:01:42.980> of<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.250> beam<00:01:43.720> or

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
stairway that is the site of the beam or

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.800 
stairway that is the site of the beam or
the<00:01:45.520> head<00:01:46.520> out<00:01:46.550> whatever<00:01:47.150> you're<00:01:47.360> dealing

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the head out whatever you're dealing

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.320 
the head out whatever you're dealing
with<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.620> will<00:01:48.860> be<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.160> side<00:01:49.370> where<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.120> will

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
with that will be the side where it will

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.630 
with that will be the side where it will
be<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.600> lowest<00:01:52.060> point<00:01:53.060> on<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.890> stairway

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
be the lowest point on the stairway

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.370 
be the lowest point on the stairway
that'll<00:01:55.910> be<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.150> side<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:56.870> will<00:01:57.080> need<00:01:57.320> to

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
that'll be the side that we will need to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.980 
that'll be the side that we will need to
concern<00:01:57.860> ourselves<00:01:57.890> with<00:01:58.600> now<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.630> went<00:01:59.930> ahead

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
concern ourselves with now I went ahead

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.110 
concern ourselves with now I went ahead
and<00:02:00.140> put<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.560> stairway<00:02:00.980> back<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.610> its

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
and put the stairway back in its

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.180 
and put the stairway back in its
original<00:02:02.270> spot<00:02:03.110> kind<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.620> where<00:02:03.800> where<00:02:04.070> we

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
original spot kind of where where we

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.800 
original spot kind of where where we
wanted<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.550> start<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.420> can<00:02:05.570> see

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
wanted to start with and you can see

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.469 
wanted to start with and you can see
that<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> line<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.500> actually<00:02:06.950> underneath<00:02:07.790> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
that the line is actually underneath the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.800 
that the line is actually underneath the
stairway

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
stairway

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.830 
stairway
and<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.220> work<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:12.450> will

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and this is not going to work we will

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.380 
and this is not going to work we will
need<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.250> adjustments<00:02:14.370> here<00:02:15.239> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
need to make some adjustments here and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.760 
need to make some adjustments here and
move<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.680> stairway<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.569> point<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.590> where

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
move the stairway to a point to where

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.880 
move the stairway to a point to where
the<00:02:20.099> Headroom<00:02:20.489> clearance<00:02:21.090> will<00:02:21.959> work<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the Headroom clearance will work and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.370 
the Headroom clearance will work and
again<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.150> you're<00:02:24.450> working<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.020> tight

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
again if if you're working with a tight

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.979 
again if if you're working with a tight
area<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.090> only<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> couple<00:02:27.780> of

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
area and you only have a couple of

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.990 
area and you only have a couple of
inches<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.440> fudge<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.280> might<00:02:29.519> have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.849> make

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
inches to fudge you might have to make

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.040 
inches to fudge you might have to make
further<00:02:30.650> modifications<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.840> again<00:02:33.840> those

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
further modifications and again those

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.780 
further modifications and again those
modifications<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.220> done<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.610> variety

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
modifications can be done in a variety

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.430 
modifications can be done in a variety
of<00:02:36.090> ways<00:02:36.830> mainly<00:02:37.830> focusing<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.660> design<00:02:39.900> of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
of ways mainly focusing on the design of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.920 
of ways mainly focusing on the design of
the<00:02:40.739> stairway<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.519> like<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.970> said<00:02:42.209> if<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.569> only

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the stairway and like I said if you only

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.190 
the stairway and like I said if you only
have<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> small<00:02:43.769> amount<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.610> space<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.930> might

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
have a small amount of space you might

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.729 
have a small amount of space you might
not<00:02:46.470> even<00:02:46.709> be<00:02:46.980> able<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.250> build<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.090> stairway

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
not even be able to build the stairway

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.199 
not even be able to build the stairway
now<00:02:49.739> let's<00:02:49.950> pretend<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.459> I'm<00:02:50.760> trying<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
now let's pretend like I'm trying to

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.580 
now let's pretend like I'm trying to
figure<00:02:51.360> everything<00:02:51.780> out<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.440> we're<00:02:52.560> just

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
figure everything out and we're just

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.920 
figure everything out and we're just
designing<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.760> stairs<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.569> don't<00:02:54.780> really

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
designing the stairs and we don't really

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.259 
designing the stairs and we don't really
know<00:02:55.140> where<00:02:55.319> they're<00:02:55.500> going<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.799> start<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:57.000> do

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
know where they're going to start we do

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.020 
know where they're going to start we do
need<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.660> start<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.799> vertical<00:02:59.430> line<00:02:59.670> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
need to start with the vertical line and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.229 
need to start with the vertical line and
the<00:03:00.989> seven-foot<00:03:01.650> mark<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.370> say<00:03:02.610> 7<00:03:03.030> foot

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
the seven-foot mark and I say 7 foot

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.930 
the seven-foot mark and I say 7 foot
even<00:03:03.420> though<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.980> building<00:03:04.980> code<00:03:05.190> might<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.670> 6

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
even though the building code might be 6

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.120 
even though the building code might be 6
foot<00:03:06.180> 8<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.480> your<00:03:06.599> area<00:03:07.049> just<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.709> give<00:03:07.920> you

foot 8 in your area just to give you

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.710 
foot 8 in your area just to give you
room<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:09.810> case<00:03:10.340> your<00:03:11.340> stairway<00:03:12.330> you're<00:03:12.599> going

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
room in case your stairway you're going

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.490 
room in case your stairway you're going
to<00:03:12.780> put<00:03:12.959> some<00:03:13.200> type<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.739> decorative<00:03:14.489> step<00:03:15.180> on

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
to put some type of a decorative step on

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.890 
to put some type of a decorative step on
carpeting<00:03:16.500> might<00:03:16.709> raise<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.160> up<00:03:17.280> an<00:03:17.430> inch

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
carpeting might raise it up an inch

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.530 
carpeting might raise it up an inch
something<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.079> that<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.190> want<00:03:20.540> in

have<00:04:14.160> four<00:04:15.120> steps<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.950> five<00:04:16.950> risers<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.739> in

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
have four steps and five risers and in

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.420 
have four steps and five risers and in
our<00:04:20.880> stairway<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.890> going<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.130> base

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
our stairway and this is going to base

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.820 
our stairway and this is going to base
to<00:04:23.460> help<00:04:23.880> us<00:04:24.000> before<00:04:24.389> we<00:04:24.539> even<00:04:24.570> build<00:04:25.139> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
to help us before we even build the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.659 
to help us before we even build the
stairs<00:04:26.690> we<00:04:27.690> can<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:28.080> do<00:04:28.289> we<00:04:28.530> can<00:04:28.680> simply<00:04:29.100> go

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
stairs we can just do we can simply go

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.330 
stairs we can just do we can simply go
from<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.060> point<00:04:30.440> go<00:04:31.440> all<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.770> way<00:04:31.800> down<00:04:32.100> to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
from this point go all the way down to

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.370 
from this point go all the way down to
the<00:04:32.460> bottom<00:04:35.150> take<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.389> measurement<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.350> for

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
the bottom take that measurement and for

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.439 
the bottom take that measurement and for
example<00:04:38.039> let's<00:04:38.280> just<00:04:38.580> say<00:04:38.789> that<00:04:39.030> we<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.419> a

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
example let's just say that we have a

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.210 
example let's just say that we have a
measurement<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.729> 35<00:04:41.729> inches<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.919> we<00:04:43.919> have

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
measurement of 35 inches and we have

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.020 
measurement of 35 inches and we have
seven<00:04:45.000> inch<00:04:45.470> risers<00:04:46.470> we've<00:04:47.430> figured<00:04:47.729> out<00:04:47.970> our

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
seven inch risers we've figured out our

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.550 
seven inch risers we've figured out our
rise<00:04:48.479> this<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:48.870> how<00:04:49.110> many<00:04:49.289> risers<00:04:49.770> we<00:04:50.520> need<00:04:51.560> we

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
rise this is how many risers we need we

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.240 
rise this is how many risers we need we
can<00:04:52.590> simply<00:04:53.100> divide<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.880> number<00:04:53.940> up<00:04:55.250> take

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
can simply divide that number up take

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.080 
can simply divide that number up take
the<00:04:56.400> 35<00:04:56.910> inches<00:04:58.009> divide<00:04:59.009> it<00:04:59.190> by<00:04:59.340> seven<00:04:59.880> and

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
the 35 inches divide it by seven and

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.730 
the 35 inches divide it by seven and
then<00:05:00.599> that's<00:05:00.780> going<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:00.990> give<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.410> five

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
then that's going to give you five

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.360 
then that's going to give you five
risers<00:05:02.630> from<00:05:03.630> those<00:05:03.990> five<00:05:04.289> risers<00:05:04.889> you<00:05:05.130> will

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
risers from those five risers you will

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.730 
risers from those five risers you will
be<00:05:05.520> able<00:05:05.699> to<00:05:06.000> use<00:05:06.330> that<00:05:06.570> as<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.810> starting<00:05:07.440> point

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
be able to use that as a starting point

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.080 
be able to use that as a starting point
and<00:05:08.160> go<00:05:09.000> four<00:05:09.449> steps<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:11.310> other<00:05:11.580> direction

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
and go four steps in the other direction

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.490 
and go four steps in the other direction
to<00:05:13.039> find<00:05:14.039> your<00:05:14.280> starting<00:05:14.789> point<00:05:15.090> for<00:05:16.020> example

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
to find your starting point for example

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.370 
to find your starting point for example
if<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.740> have<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:16.979> 10<00:05:17.490> inch<00:05:17.759> tread<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:19.229> have

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
if you have a 10 inch tread and you have

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.450 
if you have a 10 inch tread and you have
four<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.740> them<00:05:20.570> then<00:05:21.570> you<00:05:21.960> will<00:05:22.199> simply<00:05:22.470> go<00:05:22.919> 40

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
four of them then you will simply go 40

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.180 
four of them then you will simply go 40
inches<00:05:23.849> from<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:24.630> vertical<00:05:25.110> point<00:05:25.560> of<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
inches from the vertical point of the

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.760 
inches from the vertical point of the
headroom<00:05:26.669> on<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.300> floor<00:05:27.570> of<00:05:28.289> course<00:05:28.560> now<00:05:28.710> you

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
headroom on the floor of course now you

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.560 
headroom on the floor of course now you
will<00:05:29.070> go<00:05:29.280> your<00:05:29.940> measurement<00:05:30.330> will<00:05:30.449> be

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
will go your measurement will be

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.420 
will go your measurement will be
horizontal<00:05:30.900> you're<00:05:31.440> gonna<00:05:31.590> go<00:05:31.770> 40<00:05:32.159> inches

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
horizontal you're gonna go 40 inches

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.879 
horizontal you're gonna go 40 inches
horizontal<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.870> will<00:05:34.080> basically<00:05:34.289> be<00:05:34.740> the

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
horizontal that will basically be the

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.779 
horizontal that will basically be the
starting<00:05:35.280> point<00:05:35.580> for<00:05:36.479> your<00:05:36.990> stairway<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.760> I

trust<00:06:26.639> me<00:06:27.259> especially<00:06:28.259> if<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.940> city<00:06:29.940> wants

trust me especially if the city wants
two<00:06:30.539> more<00:06:30.900> homes<00:06:31.169> built<00:06:31.529> in<00:06:31.710> the<00:06:31.830> area<00:06:32.010> by<00:06:32.340> the

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
two more homes built in the area by the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.120 
two more homes built in the area by the
home<00:06:32.700> builder<00:06:33.360> so<00:06:33.870> I<00:06:34.139> guess<00:06:34.680> that<00:06:34.860> would<00:06:34.950> be<00:06:35.010> a

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
home builder so I guess that would be a

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.770 
home builder so I guess that would be a
totally<00:06:35.520> another<00:06:35.729> video

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780
