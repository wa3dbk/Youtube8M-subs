not something new totally new me we have

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.969 
not something new totally new me we have
had<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.909> galaxy<00:01:48.630> s2<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.020> everything<00:01:49.350> but

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
had that in galaxy s2 in everything but

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.280 
had that in galaxy s2 in everything but
to<00:01:50.310> use<00:01:50.729> hold<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.140> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to use hold in like this and then you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.690 
to use hold in like this and then you
still<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.009> go<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:54.770> yeah<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
still think to go in and out yeah it's a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.370 
still think to go in and out yeah it's a
it<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.540> works<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.960> web<00:01:58.140> browser<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
it also works in the web browser so

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.800 
it also works in the web browser so
web<00:02:00.070> page<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.670> want<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.909> kill<00:02:01.180> too<00:02:01.329> soon<00:02:01.570> and

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
web page you want to kill too soon and

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.539 
web page you want to kill too soon and
then<00:02:02.530> that's<00:02:02.770> kinda<00:02:03.070> nice

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
then that's kinda nice

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.060 
then that's kinda nice
pantomime<00:02:04.149> icon<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:05.079> basically<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.619> way<00:02:06.039> to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
pantomime icon it's basically a way to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.880 
pantomime icon it's basically a way to
rely<00:02:06.759> calls<00:02:07.149> by<00:02:07.539> filtering<00:02:08.019> advice<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.679> this

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
rely calls by filtering advice like this

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.790 
rely calls by filtering advice like this
so<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.489> can<00:02:09.519> just<00:02:09.819> hold<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.810> one<00:02:11.170> down<00:02:11.500> like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
so you can just hold the one down like

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.199 
so you can just hold the one down like
this<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.340> then<00:02:12.640> even<00:02:13.209> stupid<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.640> change

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
this and then even stupid and I change

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.910 
this and then even stupid and I change
the<00:02:16.300> sensitivity<00:02:16.599> because<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.530> felt<00:02:17.890> that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the sensitivity because I felt that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.550 
the sensitivity because I felt that
normal<00:02:18.610> was<00:02:18.940> kind<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.480> slow<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:20.260> not<00:02:20.349> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
normal was kind of slow so it's not a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.520 
normal was kind of slow so it's not a
and<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.340> fastest<00:02:21.819> but<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.510> pretty<00:02:22.840> fast<00:02:23.080> and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and the fastest but it's pretty fast and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.440 
and the fastest but it's pretty fast and
it's<00:02:23.800> guilt<00:02:23.980> way<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.030> all<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.209> those

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it's guilt way and you have all of those

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's guilt way and you have all of those
settings<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.230> stuff<00:02:26.410> over<00:02:27.099> here<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.480> go

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
settings and stuff over here if you go

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.089 
settings and stuff over here if you go
to<00:02:28.690> motion<00:02:29.130> till<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.370> not<00:02:30.970> assume<00:02:31.510> but

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
to motion till to not assume but

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.440 
to motion till to not assume but
pantomime<00:02:33.099> icon<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:34.060> change<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
pantomime icon you change the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.180 
pantomime icon you change the
sensitivity<00:02:34.750> over<00:02:35.380> here<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.799> don't<00:02:35.980> like

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
sensitivity over here if you don't like

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.520 
sensitivity over here if you don't like
the<00:02:36.340> curtain<00:02:36.610> sensitivity<00:02:37.299> that's<00:02:38.290> what<00:02:38.500> I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the curtain sensitivity that's what I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.509 
the curtain sensitivity that's what I
did<00:02:38.860> then<00:02:39.849> we<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.180> can't<00:02:40.540> browse<00:02:40.930> images

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
did then we have can't browse images

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.910 
did then we have can't browse images
basically<00:02:42.519> let's<00:02:43.209> say<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.450> are<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:44.230> an<00:02:44.500> image

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
basically let's say you are on an image

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.910 
basically let's say you are on an image
and<00:02:45.390> then<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.870> are<00:02:47.140> zoomed<00:02:47.410> in<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.769> can

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
and then and you are zoomed in you can

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.979 
and then and you are zoomed in you can
hold<00:02:48.190> down<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.700> then<00:02:48.849> move<00:02:49.360> around<00:02:49.480> looking

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
hold down and then move around looking

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.960 
hold down and then move around looking
at<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.410> picture<00:02:50.829> let's<00:02:51.370> go<00:02:51.489> see<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:51.849> are

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
at the picture let's go see we are

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.229 
at the picture let's go see we are
zoomed<00:02:52.329> in<00:02:52.510> right<00:02:52.810> now<00:02:52.959> let's<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.940> ahead

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
zoomed in right now let's see go ahead

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.660 
zoomed in right now let's see go ahead
assume<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:55.690> then<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.380> hold<00:02:57.250> one<00:02:57.400> down

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
assume in then you can hold one down

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.690 
assume in then you can hold one down
like<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.329> then<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.630> wrong<00:02:59.489> pretty<00:03:00.489> nice

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
go ahead and go back you also have shape

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.610 
go ahead and go back you also have shape
to<00:03:18.880> website<00:03:19.950> around<00:03:20.950> okay<00:03:22.079> shake<00:03:23.079> top<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.440> is
