00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.370
 it is essential that the surface be 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.980
 imperfect civilian like holes or 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.230
 protuberances in such a way that it is what 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.660
 more couple possible to achieve a good 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.119
 adhesion of the mantle to the plate 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
 must have good slopes towards 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.940
 the downspouts or if you put minimum slope 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.660
 suggested 3% the surface of the plate 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.450
 must be clean free of debris 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.940
 liquid fats and no set mud and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.399
 dry remember that to perform this 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.320
 waterproofing work with mantle 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.690
 asphalt should always use the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.910
 following security elements glasses 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.800
 of protection mitten gloves and the 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.350
 appropriate clothes to do the job 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.510
 before installed the top covers in 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.790
 the concrete plates and verified the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.909
 Installation requirements apply 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.270
 Asphaltic emulsion buffers in proportion 3 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.640
 to 1 to achieve a proper primer 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.430
 which should be allowed to dry for 12 hours 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.799
 the mixture is a slurry whose function 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.470
 The main one is to cover or seal 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.970
 pores of the concrete to allow a 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.540
 greater adherence of the mantle to the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.540
 surface 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.280
 apply the mantle with aluminum mobile 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.740
 this is applied with gas flame to a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.520
 temperature from 10 to 60 degrees 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.520
 centigrade 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.040
 if you want to apply bituminous paint 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.190
 remember that one gallon yields 100 meters 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.190
 linear 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.340
 remember that the lifespan is from 5 to 7 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.160
 years as long as I 'm checking 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.060
 constantly painting every 18 months 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.060
 of transfers
