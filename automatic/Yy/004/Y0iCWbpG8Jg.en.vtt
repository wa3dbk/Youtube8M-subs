00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
from Daiso were hair curlers I believe

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640

it<00:01:32.310> came<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.610> four<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.409> they're

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it came with four and I think they're

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.469 
it came with four and I think they're
one<00:01:34.890> inch<00:01:35.070> thick<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.909> thought<00:01:36.119> I'd<00:01:36.270> use

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
one inch thick and I thought I'd use

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.580 
one inch thick and I thought I'd use
them<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:36.960> bangs<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.520> haven't<00:01:38.939> really

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
them for my bangs but I haven't really

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.020 
them for my bangs but I haven't really
devoted<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.860> time<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.369> doing<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
devoted much time to doing this so I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.350 
devoted much time to doing this so I
can't<00:01:42.329> tell<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.689> how<00:01:43.100> long<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.159> holds<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
can't tell you how long it holds but it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.270 
can't tell you how long it holds but it
definitely<00:01:45.570> does<00:01:45.990> curls<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> highly

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
definitely does curls so I highly

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.950 
definitely does curls so I highly
recommend<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.270> came<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.450> four<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
brought the other one for my sister so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.630 
brought the other one for my sister so
she<00:02:10.259> has<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:11.400> each<00:02:11.730> box<00:02:12.060> comes<00:02:12.420> with

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.640 
she has that but each box comes with
I<00:02:18.280> think<00:02:19.280> each<00:02:19.459> box<00:02:19.850> comes<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.330> 80<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.140> total

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
I think each box comes with 80 so total

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.980 
I think each box comes with 80 so total
that's<00:02:21.860> 160<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.760> that's<00:02:22.970> less<00:02:23.180> than<00:02:23.360> one<00:02:23.660> set

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
that's 160 so that's less than one set
