00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.299
 since the dawn of time that appetite 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.139
 comes to gnaw us is what we have 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.139
 never enough 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.690
 so I'm stÃ©phane subway I honor 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.270
 and the privilege of playing the role of 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.770
 count von roll up vampire ball prom 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.450
 vampires the leader of the vampires 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.690
 I have the good fortune to play this role all 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.860
 the evenings here at mogador and 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.610
 and the adventures continue and again 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.610
 until June 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.629
 against fang colloquium it's a vampire 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.679
 between things be clear he has 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.979
 a few hundred years 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:45.250
 the tale hopes each year organized a 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:47.229
 prom the famous vampire ball and there 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.869
 invite fresh flesh 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.460
 this year he set the goal 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:54.190
 to have that 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.140
 the innkeeper's daughter chagall of the coup 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.439
 he will do everything to attract him to his 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:07.090
 cave and chew I had put a lot 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:08.440
 of time to familiarize myself because I 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.970
 take one time I'm a diesel and 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.399
 I need some curtains to be in 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.380
 confidence to also feel the confidence 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.130
 others and that's for me it's 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.200
 hyper important 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.080
 there I can begin to express myself to 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.060
 play to be the character even though I 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.360
 I understood it to be different 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.580
 thing 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.039
 this is where I think we have to 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.750
 mature so I think that 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.780
 it's a good time to come and see the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.780
 show 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.950
 Yes 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.530
 I will not do it in the American way 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.210
 saying yes it takes four hours of 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.640
 concentration it's absolutely not true 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.439
 I see this is really happening 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.060
 last minute because I'm it's 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.920
 and that's the same for me 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.420
 I really like being with 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.500
 other I like to mess up I like 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.570
 to joke 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.440
 that's how I work like that dramatizes 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.420
 and then enjoy the people of the moment 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.040
 and after there is obviously just before the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.500
 return from jarry of the room where there is 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.600
 two three minutes where I ask myself where I 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.250
 focus and that I see there we come back 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.130
 most of what I was told 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.700
 and yes it had it takes three minutes 1 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.320
 So much for my part we continue to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.550
 watch 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.660
 come see the vampire ball what 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.640
 is great is that people who 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
 come who make the move he goes out to 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.540
 the room stand out enchanted and people 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.650
 are standing in the end and they spend 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.870
 really two and a half hours of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.480
 extraordinary show entertainment 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.880
 visually beautiful songs 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.070
 the sets the costumes of rest me 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.959
 even impressed by the movements of 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.739
 body every time I see them I 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.130
 am a bit of the vampire ball and that's 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.130
 a reality 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.870
 it's you that when it's 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.830
 it allows him 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.830
 it kills
