00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.389 
you can see a little bit better now this
is<00:00:32.899> a<00:00:32.960> technique<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.500> friend<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:33.950> mine<00:00:34.100> showed

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
is a technique a friend of mine showed

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.889 
is a technique a friend of mine showed
me<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.360> believe<00:00:35.629> she<00:00:36.440> got<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:36.890> from<00:00:37.489> a

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
me and I believe she got it from a

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.720 
me and I believe she got it from a
retailer<00:00:38.899> called<00:00:39.109> guy<00:00:39.320> grant<00:00:39.679> got<00:00:40.010> uriah

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
retailer called guy grant got uriah

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.610 
retailer called guy grant got uriah
ganas<00:00:41.539> I<00:00:41.660> think<00:00:41.809> is<00:00:41.899> how<00:00:42.019> you<00:00:42.050> pronounce<00:00:42.170> it

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
ganas I think is how you pronounce it

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.680 
ganas I think is how you pronounce it
and<00:00:42.829> she<00:00:43.670> does<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.850> lot<00:00:43.940> bootie<00:00:44.210> retouching

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
and she does a lot bootie retouching

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.660 
and she does a lot bootie retouching
here<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:44.929> the<00:00:44.989> UK<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.129> well<00:00:46.429> this<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:46.640> a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
here in the UK so well this is a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.759 
here in the UK so well this is a
technique<00:00:47.030> that<00:00:47.089> this<00:00:47.839> was<00:00:48.019> passed<00:00:48.260> on<00:00:48.409> to<00:00:48.469> me

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
technique that this was passed on to me

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.189 
technique that this was passed on to me
and<00:00:49.249> it<00:00:49.370> again<00:00:49.640> it's<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.909> very<00:00:49.940> quick<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.690> easy

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
and it again it's a very quick and easy

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.259 
and it again it's a very quick and easy
technique<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.519> sow<00:00:52.760> thought<00:00:52.969> it'd<00:00:53.059> be<00:00:53.089> useful

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
technique and sow thought it'd be useful

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:59.840 
technique and sow thought it'd be useful
to<00:00:53.480> show<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:53.780> where<00:00:54.260> in<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:54.649> video

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630 

what<00:01:00.600> we're<00:01:00.750> now<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.140> photoshop<00:01:01.649> cs3<00:01:02.010> quite<00:01:02.550> an

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
what we're now in photoshop cs3 quite an

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
what we're now in photoshop cs3 quite an
old<00:01:02.760> version<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.210> Photoshop<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.530> could

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
old version of Photoshop but you could

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.499 
old version of Photoshop but you could
probably<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.549> Photoshop<00:01:06.180> Elements

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
probably do this in Photoshop Elements

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.320 
probably do this in Photoshop Elements
as<00:01:06.900> well<00:01:07.280> okay<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.729> gonna<00:01:08.909> remove<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
as well okay so I'm gonna remove this

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
as well okay so I'm gonna remove this
curves<00:01:09.690> layer<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.259> I<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.560> put<00:01:10.950> on

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
curves layer which is I just put on

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
curves layer which is I just put on
really<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.549> dark<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> skin<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:12.479> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
really just a dark on the skin down so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.050 
really just a dark on the skin down so
you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.799> blotchiness<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.880> gonna

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you can see the blotchiness I'm gonna

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300 
you can see the blotchiness I'm gonna
just<00:01:15.270> remove<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> reason<00:01:17.070> we've

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
just remove that now the reason we've

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.480 
just remove that now the reason we've
got<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.640> magenta<00:01:18.560> red<00:01:19.560> blotches<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
got these magenta red blotches is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
got these magenta red blotches is
because<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.539> a<00:01:21.659> discoloration<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
because there is a discoloration in the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.010 
because there is a discoloration in the
skin<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.789> correct<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:25.009> use<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
skin so to correct that we can use a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.570 
skin so to correct that we can use a
adjustment<00:01:28.020> layer<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.409> we're<00:01:29.039> going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> use

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
adjustment layer and we're going to use

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.330 
adjustment layer and we're going to use
a<00:01:29.759> selective<00:01:30.659> color<00:01:30.960> adjustment<00:01:31.080> layer<00:01:32.069> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
a selective color adjustment layer and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
a selective color adjustment layer and
so<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.630> by<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:33.869> down<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.530> selective

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so we do that by going down to selective

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.669 
so we do that by going down to selective
color<00:01:35.690> now<00:01:36.690> you've<00:01:37.020> got<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> choice<00:01:37.350> here

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
color now you've got a choice here

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.669 
color now you've got a choice here
we<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.580> go<00:01:38.880> straight<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.289> make<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
we can just go straight in and make the

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.249 
we can just go straight in and make the
adjustments<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.789> first<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> want<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.080> you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.160 
layer so I'm going to go into selective
color<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.179> want<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.390> target<00:01:51.810> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
color and what we want to target this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
color and what we want to target this
wreath<00:01:52.560> gonna<00:01:52.830> depends<00:01:53.429> on<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> type<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> skin

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
wreath gonna depends on the type of skin

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
wreath gonna depends on the type of skin
and<00:01:54.479> how<00:01:54.929> light<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.580> but<00:01:56.580> we're<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and how light it is but we're going to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.180 
and how light it is but we're going to
be<00:01:57.210> targeting<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.750> magentas<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.649> start<00:01:58.950> with

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
be targeting the magentas to start with

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.520 
be targeting the magentas to start with
and<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.000> may<00:02:00.240> well<00:02:00.479> need<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:00.840> go<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.350> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and but we may well need to go out of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.950 
and but we may well need to go out of
there<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.920> into<00:02:02.100> into<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.970> Reds<00:02:03.209> but<00:02:03.840> we'll

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
there and into into the Reds but we'll

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.139 
there and into into the Reds but we'll
start<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.469> magentas<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.000> want

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
start off in magentas and what we want

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.819 
start off in magentas and what we want
to<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.509> reduce<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> magenta

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
to do is we reduce some of the magenta

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.620 
to do is we reduce some of the magenta
in<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.429> now<00:02:08.579> if<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.850> increase<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.509> can

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
in here now if I increase it you can

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.680 
in here now if I increase it you can
somebody<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.310> those<00:02:11.310> areas<00:02:12.060> popping<00:02:12.450> up<00:02:12.570> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
somebody see those areas popping up a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.830 
somebody see those areas popping up a
bit<00:02:12.840> better<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.380> I'm<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.130> juice<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.030> see

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
bit better so I'm very juice it and see

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.259 
bit better so I'm very juice it and see
how<00:02:16.230> much<00:02:16.470> that's<00:02:17.459> gonna<00:02:17.640> make<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.820> difference

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
how much that's gonna make a difference

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.750 
how much that's gonna make a difference
you<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.620> sliding<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.579> put

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
you can see as I'm sliding you can put

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.170 
you can see as I'm sliding you can put
it<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.000> screen<00:02:21.299> now<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.890> lips<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.670> fingers

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it on screen now the lips the fingers

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.110 
it on screen now the lips the fingers
and<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.720> cheek<00:02:25.049> areas<00:02:25.730> coming<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:26.910> quite

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and the cheek areas coming out quite

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.979 
and the cheek areas coming out quite
nicely<00:02:27.359> so<00:02:27.840> drop<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.709> down<00:02:29.269> about<00:02:30.269> 80%<00:02:30.780> now

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
nicely so drop that down about 80% now

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.569 
nicely so drop that down about 80% now
keep<00:02:31.320> an<00:02:31.470> eye<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.769> your<00:02:31.859> image<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.459> you

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
keep an eye on your image because you

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.690 
keep an eye on your image because you
don't<00:02:32.820> want<00:02:33.030> some<00:02:33.780> nasty<00:02:34.230> side<00:02:34.530> effects<00:02:34.890> when

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
don't want some nasty side effects when

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.770 
don't want some nasty side effects when
you<00:02:35.760> start<00:02:36.000> moving<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:36.359> around<00:02:36.510> with

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you start moving this around with

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.039 
you start moving this around with
selective<00:02:37.380> colors<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.549> get<00:02:38.760> some

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
selective colors you can get some

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.349 
selective colors you can get some
unwanted<00:02:40.310> cut<00:02:41.310> discoloration<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.180> other

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
unwanted cut discoloration in other

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.030 
unwanted cut discoloration in other
areas<00:02:42.980> also<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.549> can<00:02:44.700> try<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.750> add<00:02:46.440> some

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
areas also we can try and add some

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.620 
areas also we can try and add some
yellow<00:02:47.250> now<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.790> something<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.209> making

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
yellow now that something that's making

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.340 
yellow now that something that's making
much<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.709> difference<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.090> area<00:02:51.359> so

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
much of a difference in this area so

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.130 
much of a difference in this area so
let's<00:02:52.530> leave<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.739> back<00:02:53.010> at<00:02:53.160> zero<00:02:53.989> let's<00:02:54.989> go

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
let's leave that back at zero let's go

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.840 
let's leave that back at zero let's go
into<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> Reds<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.010> we've<00:02:56.130> already<00:02:56.280> done<00:02:56.609> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
into the Reds and we've already done a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.030 
into the Reds and we've already done a
mostly<00:02:57.329> heavy<00:02:57.600> lifting<00:02:57.989> here<00:02:58.109> already<00:02:58.440> but

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
mostly heavy lifting here already but

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.500 
mostly heavy lifting here already but
sometimes<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.640> worth<00:02:59.700> going<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.269> Reds

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
sometimes it's worth going to the Reds

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.280 
sometimes it's worth going to the Reds
and<00:03:00.780> seeing<00:03:01.500> what<00:03:02.310> happens<00:03:02.670> there<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.299> we

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
and seeing what happens there and we

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.539 
and seeing what happens there and we
don't<00:03:04.440> want<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.709> take<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:04.890> too<00:03:05.130> far<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:05.459> you

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
don't want to take this too far but you

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.330 
don't want to take this too far but you
can<00:03:05.670> see<00:03:05.819> us<00:03:05.910> making<00:03:06.180> quite<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.540> big<00:03:06.750> difference

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
can see us making quite a big difference

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.590 
can see us making quite a big difference
but<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.489> making<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.820> big<00:03:08.850> difference<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
but it's making a big difference to the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.490 
but it's making a big difference to the
majority<00:03:10.229> image<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:11.930> we<00:03:12.930> can<00:03:13.079> muster

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
majority image so we can muster

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.230 
majority image so we can muster
a<00:03:13.560> bit<00:03:13.890> later<00:03:14.070> on<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.370> let's<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:14.880> drop<00:03:15.060> this

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
a bit later on so let's just drop this

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.230 
a bit later on so let's just drop this
down<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> bit<00:03:15.690> more<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.370> that's<00:03:17.610> where<00:03:17.820> we<00:03:17.940> were

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
down a bit more so that's where we were

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.470 
down a bit more so that's where we were
at<00:03:18.570> zero<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:20.220> still<00:03:20.490> quite<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> bit<00:03:21.180> red

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
at zero and it's still quite a bit red

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.170 
at zero and it's still quite a bit red
in<00:03:21.600> there<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.020> it's<00:03:22.170> true<00:03:22.500> drove<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.190> down<00:03:23.490> to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
in there so it's true drove this down to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.910 
in there so it's true drove this down to
around<00:03:24.240> 30%<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.350> we<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.530> always<00:03:25.620> come<00:03:25.830> back

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
around 30% so we can always come back

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.010 
around 30% so we can always come back
and<00:03:25.980> adjust<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.490> and<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:27.330> try<00:03:27.510> adding<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:27.930> a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
and adjust this and just try adding in a

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.650 
and adjust this and just try adding in a
bit<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.230> yellow<00:03:28.740> again<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:30.090> kind<00:03:30.270> of<00:03:30.450> bounce

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
bit of yellow again to kind of bounce

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.590 
bit of yellow again to kind of bounce
that<00:03:31.490> but<00:03:33.080> 20%<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.920> bad<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:36.390> other<00:03:36.480> thing

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
that but 20% to bad and the other thing

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.240 
that but 20% to bad and the other thing
we<00:03:36.690> can<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:36.959> if<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.200> want<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.500> lighten<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:38.220> skin

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
we can do if we want to lighten the skin

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.160 
we can do if we want to lighten the skin
a<00:03:38.520> little<00:03:38.580> bit<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:39.150> perhaps<00:03:39.360> take<00:03:39.780> out<00:03:39.990> some

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
a little bit with perhaps take out some

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.520 
a little bit with perhaps take out some
of<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.320> black<00:03:40.590> if<00:03:41.520> we<00:03:41.670> want<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.410> bear<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.500> mind

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
of the black if we want to bear in mind

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.960 
of the black if we want to bear in mind
don't<00:03:44.010> worry<00:03:44.190> about<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.400> hair<00:03:44.610> we're<00:03:44.940> going

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
don't worry about the hair we're going

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.729 
don't worry about the hair we're going
to<00:03:45.150> mess<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:45.450> off<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:48.080> somewhere<00:03:49.080> perhaps

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
to mess it off and somewhere perhaps

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.060 
to mess it off and somewhere perhaps
around<00:03:50.160> 30%<00:03:51.060> looks<00:03:51.630> quite<00:03:51.900> nice<00:03:52.050> click<00:03:52.620> okay

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
around 30% looks quite nice click okay

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.930 
around 30% looks quite nice click okay
so<00:03:53.670> now<00:03:53.850> we<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.060> have<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> look<00:03:54.330> at<00:03:54.390> before<00:03:54.750> and

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
so now we can have a look at before and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.640 
so now we can have a look at before and
after<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.150> can<00:03:57.209> assess<00:03:57.480> make<00:03:57.690> quite<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.290> big

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
after you can assess make quite a big

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.740 
after you can assess make quite a big
difference<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.400> the<00:04:00.360> next<00:04:00.480> thing<00:04:00.630> I'm<00:04:00.720> going

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
difference so the next thing I'm going

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.590 
difference so the next thing I'm going
to<00:04:00.900> do<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.860> mask<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.850> master<00:04:03.480> image

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
to do is to just mask the master image

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600 
to do is to just mask the master image
and<00:04:04.020> just<00:04:04.050> apply<00:04:04.830> those<00:04:05.040> adjustments<00:04:05.250> just

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
and just apply those adjustments just

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.180 
and just apply those adjustments just

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.820 

so<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:11.880> any<00:04:12.030> just<00:04:12.420> mask<00:04:12.720> off<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:12.960> the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
so in any just mask off the the

so in any just mask off the the
selective<00:04:14.370> color<00:04:14.940> adjustment<00:04:15.080> now<00:04:16.080> we<00:04:16.530> could

and<00:05:36.210> then<00:05:36.390> obviously<00:05:36.600> go<00:05:36.990> over<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.740> lips<00:05:37.980> here

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
and then obviously go over the lips here

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.810 
and then obviously go over the lips here
somewhat<00:05:40.230> and<00:05:40.980> if<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:41.190> find<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.520> it's<00:05:41.669> a<00:05:41.700> bit

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
somewhat and if you find that it's a bit

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.510 
somewhat and if you find that it's a bit
too<00:05:42.060> much<00:05:42.240> which<00:05:42.480> she<00:05:42.570> probably<00:05:43.110> is<00:05:43.500> we<00:05:44.400> can

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
too much which she probably is we can

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.460 
too much which she probably is we can
just<00:05:44.730> drop<00:05:44.910> down<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.630> opacity<00:05:45.840> if<00:05:46.200> you've

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
just drop down the opacity if you've

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.860 
just drop down the opacity if you've
haven't<00:05:46.800> got<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.040> pretty<00:05:47.310> sensitive<00:05:47.870> tablet

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
haven't got a pretty sensitive tablet

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.960 
haven't got a pretty sensitive tablet
just<00:05:49.050> dropped<00:05:49.350> on<00:05:49.470> the<00:05:49.530> opacity<00:05:49.970> remember

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
just dropped on the opacity remember

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.750 
just dropped on the opacity remember
just<00:05:51.120> go<00:05:51.300> in<00:05:51.419> a<00:05:51.480> bit<00:05:51.630> gently<00:05:52.310> and<00:05:53.310> bring<00:05:53.640> that

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
just go in a bit gently and bring that

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.800 
just go in a bit gently and bring that
back<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.390> little<00:05:54.450> bit<00:05:55.169> and<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.590> tongue<00:05:56.810> and

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
back a little bit and the tongue and

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.320 
back a little bit and the tongue and
that<00:05:58.050> just<00:05:58.260> enabled<00:05:58.680> us<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.919> bit<00:05:59.160> more<00:05:59.190> of<00:05:59.400> a<00:05:59.520> an

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
that just enabled us a bit more of a an

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.260 
that just enabled us a bit more of a an
actual<00:06:00.780> effect<00:06:01.100> like<00:06:02.100> sir

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.060 

okay<00:06:06.270> I<00:06:06.540> said<00:06:07.230> done<00:06:07.470> that<00:06:07.590> quite<00:06:07.800> quickly

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
okay I said done that quite quickly

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.420 
okay I said done that quite quickly
let's<00:06:08.340> just<00:06:08.520> zoom<00:06:08.550> out<00:06:10.010> and<00:06:11.010> that's<00:06:11.160> why

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
let's just zoom out and that's why

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.950 
let's just zoom out and that's why
really<00:06:11.700> we<00:06:11.850> don't<00:06:11.970> need<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.390> move<00:06:12.540> bothering

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
really we don't need to move bothering

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.900 
really we don't need to move bothering
with<00:06:13.140> that<00:06:13.200> mask<00:06:13.800> on<00:06:13.950> this<00:06:14.130> again<00:06:14.370> a<00:06:14.520> major

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
with that mask on this again a major

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.540 
with that mask on this again a major
wouldn't<00:06:15.870> just<00:06:16.110> literally<00:06:16.710> paint<00:06:16.980> away<00:06:17.130> the

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
wouldn't just literally paint away the

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.850 
wouldn't just literally paint away the
adjustment<00:06:18.150> so<00:06:18.660> there's<00:06:18.990> before<00:06:19.380> there's

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
adjustment so there's before there's

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.760 
adjustment so there's before there's
after<00:06:20.160> so<00:06:20.700> again<00:06:21.570> we've<00:06:21.900> come<00:06:22.229> quite<00:06:22.650> a<00:06:22.740> long

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
after so again we've come quite a long

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.879 
after so again we've come quite a long
way<00:06:22.890> in<00:06:23.190> a<00:06:23.250> very<00:06:23.280> short<00:06:23.760> space<00:06:24.000> of<00:06:24.060> time

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.010 

so<00:06:29.580> our<00:06:29.699> image<00:06:29.939> is<00:06:30.090> pretty<00:06:30.330> much<00:06:30.479> finished<00:06:30.719> now

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
so our image is pretty much finished now

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.999 
so our image is pretty much finished now
but<00:06:31.229> there's<00:06:31.469> one<00:06:31.560> other<00:06:31.620> thing<00:06:31.860> I'll<00:06:31.979> just

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
but there's one other thing I'll just

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.189 
but there's one other thing I'll just
discuss<00:06:32.909> with<00:06:33.060> you<00:06:33.240> when<00:06:33.930> you're<00:06:34.050> making

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
discuss with you when you're making

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.779 
discuss with you when you're making
these<00:06:34.319> kind<00:06:34.620> of<00:06:34.650> changes<00:06:34.889> it's<00:06:35.250> a<00:06:35.520> good<00:06:35.699> idea

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
these kind of changes it's a good idea

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.420 
these kind of changes it's a good idea
just<00:06:36.030> just<00:06:36.900> have<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.080> quick<00:06:37.379> look<00:06:37.620> at<00:06:37.949> the<00:06:38.280> mode

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
just just have a quick look at the mode

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.610 
just just have a quick look at the mode
this<00:06:38.580> looks<00:06:38.789> absolutely<00:06:39.150> fine<00:06:39.629> but<00:06:39.990> what

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
this looks absolutely fine but what

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.050 
this looks absolutely fine but what
about<00:06:40.650> if<00:06:41.009> I<00:06:41.099> change<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.900> blending<00:06:42.900> mode<00:06:42.960> to

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
about if I change the blending mode to

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.270 
about if I change the blending mode to
limit<00:06:45.060> like<00:06:45.270> say<00:06:45.569> color<00:06:46.099> look<00:06:47.099> at<00:06:47.189> the

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
limit like say color look at the

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.929 
limit like say color look at the
difference

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:47.939 
difference

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.350 
difference
there's<00:06:48.300> before<00:06:49.759> there<00:06:50.759> look<00:06:51.150> at<00:06:51.270> her

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
there's before there look at her

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.610 
there's before there look at her
freckles<00:06:51.629> and<00:06:52.259> now<00:06:52.710> change<00:06:53.039> it<00:06:53.159> to<00:06:53.310> color<00:06:54.620> it

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
freckles and now change it to color it

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.320 
freckles and now change it to color it
for<00:06:55.800> what<00:06:55.889> the<00:06:55.949> freckles<00:06:56.280> back<00:06:56.430> at<00:06:56.639> and<00:06:57.120> what

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
for what the freckles back at and what

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.450 
for what the freckles back at and what
the<00:06:57.449> color<00:06:57.659> mode<00:06:57.870> does<00:06:58.139> it<00:06:58.259> just<00:06:58.439> enables<00:06:59.310> the

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
the color mode does it just enables the

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.159 
the color mode does it just enables the
just<00:06:59.789> a<00:06:59.879> color<00:07:00.090> information<00:07:00.330> to<00:07:00.719> come<00:07:00.900> through

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
just a color information to come through

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.439 
just a color information to come through
so<00:07:01.439> we're<00:07:01.889> still<00:07:02.099> getting<00:07:02.430> all<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.819> changes

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
so we're still getting all the changes

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.230 
so we're still getting all the changes
that<00:07:03.689> we've<00:07:04.169> done<00:07:04.669> correcting<00:07:05.669> that<00:07:05.789> redness

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
that we've done correcting that redness

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.679 
that we've done correcting that redness
in<00:07:06.419> the<00:07:06.509> face<00:07:06.750> as<00:07:07.469> before<00:07:08.039> there's<00:07:08.250> after<00:07:08.689> but

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:09.689 
in the face as before there's after but

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:11.959 
in the face as before there's after but
what<00:07:09.930> it<00:07:10.020> enables<00:07:10.409> to<00:07:10.529> do<00:07:10.740> is<00:07:11.069> we're<00:07:11.849> not

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:11.969 
what it enables to do is we're not

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.059 
what it enables to do is we're not
changing<00:07:12.240> in<00:07:12.599> luminosity<00:07:12.930> values<00:07:13.529> so<00:07:13.800> if<00:07:13.949> we

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.069 
changing in luminosity values so if we

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.559 
changing in luminosity values so if we
decide<00:07:14.460> that<00:07:14.490> actually<00:07:14.879> we<00:07:14.969> do<00:07:15.090> want<00:07:15.539> to

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569 
decide that actually we do want to

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.170 
decide that actually we do want to
lighten<00:07:15.930> the<00:07:16.050> the<00:07:16.830> skin<00:07:17.189> quite<00:07:17.460> so<00:07:17.639> much<00:07:17.789> we

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
lighten the the skin quite so much we

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.850 
lighten the the skin quite so much we
could<00:07:18.330> perhaps<00:07:18.419> go<00:07:18.719> and<00:07:18.900> just<00:07:19.139> try<00:07:19.379> that<00:07:19.560> color

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
could perhaps go and just try that color

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.860 
could perhaps go and just try that color
mode<00:07:20.069> and<00:07:20.789> that<00:07:20.879> retains<00:07:21.270> I<00:07:21.479> said<00:07:21.689> just

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
mode and that retains I said just

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.260 
mode and that retains I said just
retains<00:07:22.169> her<00:07:22.349> freckles<00:07:22.650> in<00:07:23.580> her<00:07:23.699> face<00:07:23.909> which<00:07:24.090> I

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
retains her freckles in her face which I

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.689 
retains her freckles in her face which I
see<00:07:24.449> I<00:07:24.479> prefer<00:07:24.689> or<00:07:25.529> we<00:07:25.740> could<00:07:25.919> just<00:07:25.949> go<00:07:26.219> back<00:07:26.430> in

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 
see I prefer or we could just go back in

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:28.429 
see I prefer or we could just go back in
and<00:07:26.939> I<00:07:27.180> remember<00:07:27.509> you<00:07:27.569> can<00:07:27.689> still<00:07:27.960> go<00:07:28.110> back<00:07:28.259> in

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:28.439 
and I remember you can still go back in

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:31.129 
and I remember you can still go back in
and<00:07:28.620> maybe<00:07:28.770> change<00:07:29.460> the<00:07:29.699> black<00:07:30.509> content<00:07:31.020> in

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 
and maybe change the black content in

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.409 
and maybe change the black content in
there<00:07:31.319> as<00:07:31.439> well<00:07:31.650> so<00:07:31.710> always<00:07:32.639> worth<00:07:32.909> having<00:07:33.360> a
