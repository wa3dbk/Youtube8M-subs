00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
but hopefully oh this look at this it's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.770 
but hopefully oh this look at this it's
a<00:01:14.070> crack<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.119> thug<00:01:15.830> what<00:01:17.600> has<00:01:18.600> an

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
a crack now it's a thug what has an

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
a crack now it's a thug what has an
energy<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> back<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.830> got<00:01:19.950> an<00:01:20.009> electric

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
energy on the back so we got an electric

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.969 
energy on the back so we got an electric
energy<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:21.030> our<00:01:21.259> electric<00:01:22.259> type<00:01:22.470> crockner

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

also<00:03:37.410> Japanese<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.160> that's<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> what<00:03:39.570> is

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
also Japanese and that's like a what is

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.690 
also Japanese and that's like a what is
that<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:40.140> growl<00:03:40.620> if<00:03:40.829> in<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.070> background<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.579> you

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
that a growl if in the background if you

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.199 
that a growl if in the background if you
can<00:03:41.850> tell<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:43.709> thought<00:03:44.610> for<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.850> second<00:03:45.120> might

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
can tell I thought for a second might

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.600 
can tell I thought for a second might
have<00:03:45.299> been<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.570> float<00:03:45.780> soul<00:03:46.019> but<00:03:46.610> vocals

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
have been like a float soul but vocals

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.240 
have been like a float soul but vocals
too<00:03:47.850> new<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.930> guess<00:03:49.170> growl<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:49.769> makes<00:03:50.070> more

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
too new I guess growl if makes more

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.009 
too new I guess growl if makes more
sense<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:52.140> we<00:03:52.410> got<00:03:52.560> ourselves<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:53.370> dratini<00:03:54.269> I

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
sense and we got ourselves a dratini I

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.590 
sense and we got ourselves a dratini I
think<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.410> looks<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.709> sticker<00:03:56.600> sleep

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
think that looks like a sticker sleep

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.920 
think that looks like a sticker sleep
here<00:03:57.810> yeah<00:03:58.430> maybe<00:03:59.430> i<00:03:59.790> don't<00:04:00.299> know<00:04:00.450> maybe<00:04:00.690> just

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
