to answer these questions the first

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.990 
to answer these questions the first
thing<00:02:21.960> we<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.770> understand<00:02:23.730> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
thing we have to do is understand that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.020 
thing we have to do is understand that
an<00:02:24.300> imbalance<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.170> any<00:02:26.030> significant

an imbalance is any significant

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.090 
an imbalance is any significant
difference<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.050> two<00:02:28.260> respective

difference in the two respective
positions<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:32.250> sounds<00:02:32.760> rather<00:02:33.270> empty<00:02:33.840> how

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
positions this sounds rather empty how

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.980 
positions this sounds rather empty how
can<00:02:34.740> such<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> simplistic<00:02:35.670> thought<00:02:36.120> how<00:02:36.810> can

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
can such a simplistic thought how can

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.220 
can such a simplistic thought how can
such<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> simplistic<00:02:37.770> thing<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.790> important<00:02:39.330> the

such a simplistic thing be important the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.590 
such a simplistic thing be important the
answer<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.190> far<00:02:41.490> from<00:02:41.820> simplistic

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
answer is that it's far from simplistic

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.750 
answer is that it's far from simplistic
and<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:43.170> easy<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.590> grasp<00:02:43.980> concept
