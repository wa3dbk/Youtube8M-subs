00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 good 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.130
 this information that I will give to 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.420
 you today have surely heard it 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:23.940
 or read in movies in books in 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 theaters even in children's stories 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.450
 There are many mythological creatures many 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.740
 famous and others not 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 I have selected five of them that 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:42.230
 I consider most attractive and most famous of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.340
 all 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.800
 good people today he presented the 5 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.800
 most famous mythological creatures 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.870
 but 5 although its original form was a 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.730
 hybrid genius of woman and birds 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.550
 subsequently the representation more 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.660
 common that is described by a beautiful woman 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.940
 with fish tail instead of legs 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.730
 He talked about the dinners they are also from 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.670
 Greek mythology 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:21.600
 she many know them for that reason 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.600
 by its half of humans and fish tail 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.300
 but four had two generations of 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.350
 cyclops the first generation was 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.570
 known as craftsmen and builders 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.120
 they were giant with a single in the middle of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.930
 forehead 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.870
 and I had a horrible temper they were 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.730
 strong stubborn and had brusque 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.090
 emotions 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:52.200
 eventually his name came to be 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.860
 a synonym of strength and power 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.590
 and they used it to refer to weapon 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.380
 especially well manufactured the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.020
 second generation of Cyclops was a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.619
 tribe of huge monsters of a single 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.069
 eye discovered by odyssey in a remote 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.569
 island was said to be related 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.150
 with the giants and with a Phoenician tribe 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.400
 it is also said that they were born of 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.980
 a drop of blood that fell to the ground 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.980
 when they castrated Oran 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.590
 but gray in Greek mythology a 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.680
 severe was the guardian of the doors 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.740
 from hell the severe was a monster 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.830
 of three heads and a snake tail 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.950
 he protected that no live will enter and 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.660
 no dead left the existence of the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.140
 infernal weight at the entrance of the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.620
 Underworld apparently was already present 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.970
 in European mythology because apparently 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.400
 in the myths of other European peoples 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.400
 like the case of the bloody dog 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.640
 but two Western cultures and 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.970
 orientals have imagined this reptile 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.430
 giant with wings may be due to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.560
 contact with crocodiles alligators and 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.340
 hawks along with the findings of 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 fossils of flying reptiles the dragon 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.870
 it was believed to be from mythology 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.879
 western because now the dragon is a 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.519
 mythological animal that appear in 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.940
 various forms in different cultures 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.579
 around the world with different 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.950
 associated symbolism the function of 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.079
 diverse cultures that has represented the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.230
 Dragon figure plays a role 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.500
 important as a guardian god or as a 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.950
 enemy mighty monster therefore 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.950
 the image and figure of the dragon has been 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.709
 varied and has been interpreted from very 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.709
 diverse form throughout history 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.650
 but not in Medusa Greek mythology 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.530
 it was known as a tonic monster 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.769
 feminine that turned everything into stone 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.250
 the one who looked her straight in the eyes 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.930
 she was beheaded by ips or who 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.210
 after having beheaded her she used her 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.880
 head as a weapon 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.430
 after that he gave it to the goddess 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.700
 they had to put it on their shield 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.580
 since ancient times the image of the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.310
 Medusa's head seems represented in 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.460
 an anti pike that drives away the known evil 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.800
 like colic neon I would like to know her 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.110
