 a dash 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.630
 on chips 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:03:01.099
 seasoning it stays on language of course 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:03.830
 minus the fact that the chips themselves are not soaked 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:12.790
 so unlike we just 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:12.790
 dusted tidied up stays on the tongue 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.560
 if a little bit 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.459
 do not immediately gnaw can bind seasoning 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.769
 thats just potato chips already and 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:45.440
 taste 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:50.599
 getting lost but this is our throw in the bank there 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.599
 crumbled when in transit 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.140

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.680

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.680
 what 1 for tasty then already 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.140
 slightly dry 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:36.550
 dry mouth can be felt well 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.550
 due to seasoning 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.890
 I think we will be the last to taste 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.750
