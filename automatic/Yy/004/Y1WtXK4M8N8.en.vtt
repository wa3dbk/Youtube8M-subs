00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
a set of very affordable I think very

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.230 
a set of very affordable I think very

classic<00:00:18.779> humbuckers<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.400> name<00:00:20.550> implies

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
classic humbuckers as the name implies

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.509 
classic humbuckers as the name implies
they're<00:00:21.210> fitted<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.619> strong<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
they're fitted with the not so strong a

they're fitted with the not so strong a
mikela<00:00:24.210> formulation<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.680> toes<00:00:25.920> rather<00:00:26.220> than

mikela formulation the toes rather than

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.859 
mikela formulation the toes rather than
the<00:00:26.400> fives<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> think<00:00:27.210> while<00:00:27.510> they're<00:00:27.720> less

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the fives and I think while they're less

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
the fives and I think while they're less
powerful<00:00:28.349> they're<00:00:28.470> certainly<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:28.830> tone

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
powerful they're certainly very tone

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669 
powerful they're certainly very tone
soon<00:00:29.660> there<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.140> lash<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.529> though

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
soon there was a bit of a lash up though

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.430 
soon there was a bit of a lash up though
when<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.949> came<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.750> fitting<00:00:33.750> them<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> hot

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
when it came to fitting them to the hot

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.670 
when it came to fitting them to the hot
rod

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
rod

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.920 
rod
everything<00:00:35.280> started<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:35.820> very<00:00:36.510> well<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
everything started out very well and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.010 
everything started out very well and
ended<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.230> extremely<00:00:37.649> messy<00:00:39.020> unfortunately

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
ended up extremely messy unfortunately

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.479 
ended up extremely messy unfortunately
when<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> cut<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> plates<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.190> made<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
when I cut the plates and made the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.610 
when I cut the plates and made the
calculations<00:00:41.809> I've<00:00:42.809> done<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.260> basis

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
calculations I've done so on the basis

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
calculations I've done so on the basis
for<00:00:43.739> using<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.250> very<00:00:44.460> small<00:00:44.670> pellets<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
for using some very small pellets and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.360 
for using some very small pellets and
then<00:00:45.750> without<00:00:45.930> thinking<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.620> found<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.219> much

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
then without thinking I found some much

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.770 
then without thinking I found some much
better<00:00:47.610> parts<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.360> they're<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> lot

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
better parts but because they're a lot

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.950 
better parts but because they're a lot
bigger<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.320> hence<00:00:50.239> at<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.270> last<00:00:51.510> minute<00:00:51.840> when

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
bigger and hence at the last minute when

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
bigger and hence at the last minute when
I<00:00:52.020> had<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> come<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.710> demo<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.190> realized<00:00:53.489> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
I had to come to do demo I realized it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
I had to come to do demo I realized it
wasn't<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> fit<00:00:54.329> together<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> on

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
wasn't all going to fit together but on

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
wasn't all going to fit together but on
the<00:00:55.770> plus<00:00:55.920> side<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> guitar<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.879> looks

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the plus side of the guitar that looks

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
the plus side of the guitar that looks
this<00:00:57.449> ropey<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.739> believe<00:00:58.980> me<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this ropey and believe me a lot of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
this ropey and believe me a lot of
customers<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.210> fairly<00:01:00.570> rapid<00:01:00.930> guitar<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
customers are fairly rapid guitar if it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
customers are fairly rapid guitar if it
if<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.609> guitar<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.420> row<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.840> concerned

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
if a guitar that's this row be concerned
