which is in the ever loved light town so

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.530 
which is in the ever loved light town so
I<00:00:26.070> picked<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.520> master<00:00:26.850> key<00:00:26.970> off<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.240> start

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.570 
I picked the master key off the start
and<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.990> implored<00:00:28.410> everybody<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.190> the<00:00:29.370> same

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and I implored everybody to do the same

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
and I implored everybody to do the same
although<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.270> can't<00:00:30.690> buy<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> master<00:00:31.590> key

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
although you can't buy the master key

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.709 
although you can't buy the master key
from<00:00:31.980> somebody<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.489> depths<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.540> only

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
from somebody in the depths the only

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.290 
from somebody in the depths the only
problem<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.339> that<00:00:35.339> makes<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.940> depth<00:00:36.149> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
problem is that makes the depth is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
problem is that makes the depth is
mandatory<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.499> master<00:00:37.800> key<00:00:37.949> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
mandatory and with the master key you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
mandatory and with the master key you
can<00:00:38.280> completely<00:00:38.640> skip<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.199> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
then this should be perfect but that is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.100 
then this should be perfect but that is
the<00:01:08.820> dog<00:01:08.969> that<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.149> open<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> master

key<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.469> this<00:01:10.649> is<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> path<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.369> leads<00:01:11.520> down

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
key and this is the path that leads down

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.359 
key and this is the path that leads down
into<00:01:11.880> black<00:01:12.390> town<00:01:13.070> normally<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.219> would<00:01:14.340> have

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
into black town normally you would have

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
into black town normally you would have

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to open a door in the depths and go down

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.050

this<00:01:16.890> ridiculous<00:01:17.759> charade<00:01:18.180> fest<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.930> nonsense

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
this ridiculous charade fest of nonsense

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.639 
this ridiculous charade fest of nonsense
but<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.899> only<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.409> put<00:01:22.560> up

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
but this way you only have to put up

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.319 
but this way you only have to put up
with<00:01:22.740> too<00:01:22.890> much<00:01:23.009> bullshit<00:01:23.490> far<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.969> a<00:01:24.000> couple

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
with too much bullshit far for a couple

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.600 
with too much bullshit far for a couple
of<00:01:24.390> minutes<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.710> we're<00:01:26.009> introduced<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of minutes and we're introduced to the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
of minutes and we're introduced to the
first<00:01:26.850> thing<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.149> hate<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.960> area<00:01:28.380> did

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
first thing I hate about this area did

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.350 
first thing I hate about this area did
you<00:01:28.920> notice<00:01:29.219> how<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.549> transitioned<00:01:30.180> into

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you notice how when we transitioned into

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
you notice how when we transitioned into
the<00:01:30.539> cave<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.990> lighting<00:01:31.439> went<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.829> shit<00:01:32.070> for

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the cave the lighting went to shit for

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700 
the cave the lighting went to shit for
no<00:01:32.399> real<00:01:32.670> reason<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.869> completely<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> know

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
no real reason it completely you know

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920 
no real reason it completely you know
the<00:01:35.189> color<00:01:35.430> correction<00:01:35.789> went<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.509> green

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the color correction went really green

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
the color correction went really green
and<00:01:36.960> dank<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.799> dark<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.369> nasty<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.299> made

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and dank and dark and nasty and it made

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
and dank and dark and nasty and it made
the<00:01:39.750> draw<00:01:39.960> distance<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.560> difficult<00:01:41.039> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the draw distance really difficult to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.670 
the draw distance really difficult to
see<00:01:41.280> what's<00:01:41.490> coming<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.320> don't<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.500> why

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
see what's coming and I don't know why

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.039 
see what's coming and I don't know why
it<00:01:43.740> does<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.219> it's<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.700> stylistic<00:01:45.329> choice<00:01:45.630> but

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it does it it's a stylistic choice but

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
them toward you with the boss so you

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.160 
them toward you with the boss so you
take<00:02:32.240> them<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.810> one

a low level but I just made them look

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.160 
a low level but I just made them look

the head she's gonna do an area of

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.820 
the head she's gonna do an area of
effect<00:06:32.789> really<00:06:33.539> damaging<00:06:34.080> really<00:06:34.650> dangerous

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
effect really damaging really dangerous

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.580 
effect really damaging really dangerous
but<00:06:35.669> notice<00:06:36.360> how<00:06:36.510> I'm<00:06:36.750> timing<00:06:37.110> at<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.380> last

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
but notice how I'm timing at the last

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.680 
but notice how I'm timing at the last
possible<00:06:38.010> moment<00:06:38.370> to<00:06:38.610> roll<00:06:38.789> then<00:06:39.300> I<00:06:39.389> do<00:06:39.449> some

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
possible moment to roll then I do some

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.600 
possible moment to roll then I do some
attacks<00:06:39.990> then<00:06:40.500> I<00:06:40.620> get<00:06:40.800> out<00:06:40.919> of<00:06:41.070> there<00:06:41.220> so<00:06:41.490> if

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
attacks then I get out of there so if

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.730 
attacks then I get out of there so if
she<00:06:41.729> can't<00:06:41.940> do<00:06:42.150> you<00:06:42.630> know<00:06:42.780> any<00:06:43.139> of<00:06:43.289> the<00:06:43.380> area<00:06:43.650> of

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
she can't do you know any of the area of

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.620 
she can't do you know any of the area of
the<00:06:43.830> Phoenix<00:06:44.220> an<00:06:44.400> area<00:06:44.789> of<00:06:44.970> effect<00:06:45.060> nonsense

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
the Phoenix an area of effect nonsense

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.680 
the Phoenix an area of effect nonsense
that's<00:06:45.810> a<00:06:46.020> cloth<00:06:46.919> stomp<00:06:47.220> get<00:06:48.090> away<00:06:48.300> from<00:06:48.360> that

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
that's a cloth stomp get away from that

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.900 
that's a cloth stomp get away from that
one<00:06:48.870> push<00:06:49.860> back<00:06:50.070> forward<00:06:50.490> she's<00:06:50.789> gonna

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
one push back forward she's gonna

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.700 
one push back forward she's gonna
breathe<00:06:51.150> my<00:06:51.360> lava<00:06:51.630> so<00:06:52.139> this<00:06:52.320> should<00:06:52.530> probably

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
breathe my lava so this should probably

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.150 
breathe my lava so this should probably
be<00:06:53.010> managed

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
be managed

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.900 
be managed

the weapon or something like that the
pyro<00:06:59.650> months<00:06:59.890> is<00:07:00.010> probably<00:07:00.130> not<00:07:00.340> gonna<00:07:00.520> help

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640
