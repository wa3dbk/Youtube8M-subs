one he's been right with everything else

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.940 
one he's been right with everything else
so<00:02:49.390> far<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.530> media<00:02:50.980> are<00:02:51.190> starting<00:02:51.549> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
so far now the media are starting to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.759 
so far now the media are starting to
make<00:02:53.950> these<00:02:54.099> claims<00:02:54.280> about<00:02:54.609> things<00:02:55.000> happening

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
make these claims about things happening

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.080 
make these claims about things happening
so<00:02:56.769> yeah<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.579> go<00:02:57.700> down<00:02:57.879> guys

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
so yeah I think you can I go down guys

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.039 
so yeah I think you can I go down guys
um<00:03:00.629> about<00:03:01.739> 15<00:03:02.739> millions<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.159> lot<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.370> money<00:03:04.049> but

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
um about 15 millions a lot of money but

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.470 
um about 15 millions a lot of money but
I<00:03:05.109> do<00:03:05.200> think<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.980> all<00:03:06.129> obviously<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.670> he's<00:03:06.819> in

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
I do think in all obviously that he's in

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.819 
I do think in all obviously that he's in
a<00:03:07.599> better<00:03:07.720> bracket<00:03:08.170> than<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.409> lakes<00:03:08.590> or<00:03:08.769> a

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
a better bracket than the lakes or a

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.140 
a better bracket than the lakes or a
5-yard<00:03:09.310> pass<00:03:09.489> on<00:03:10.920> down<00:03:11.920> here<00:03:12.099> in<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.370> domain

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
5-yard pass on down here in the domain

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.849 
5-yard pass on down here in the domain
so<00:03:13.540> I'm<00:03:13.690> not<00:03:13.840> too<00:03:14.049> concerned<00:03:14.290> about<00:03:14.590> her

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
so I'm not too concerned about her

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.289 
so I'm not too concerned about her
Oliver<00:03:17.859> do<00:03:17.980> now<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.340> work<00:03:18.489> out<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.849> know<00:03:18.910> out

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
Oliver do now is work out you know out

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.030 
Oliver do now is work out you know out
that<00:03:19.480> held<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.079> transfer<00:03:20.470> fee<00:03:20.680> structure

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
that held the transfer fee structure

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.129 
that held the transfer fee structure
through<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.840> know<00:03:23.849> maybe<00:03:24.849> maybe<00:03:25.840> they<00:03:26.049> will

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
through you know maybe maybe they will

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.659 
through you know maybe maybe they will
get<00:03:26.319> 15<00:03:26.739> min<00:03:26.919> in<00:03:27.099> one<00:03:27.280> go<00:03:27.519> another<00:03:29.549> it'd<00:03:30.549> be

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
get 15 min in one go another it'd be

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.059 
get 15 min in one go another it'd be
nice<00:03:30.790> if<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:31.030> was<00:03:31.150> like<00:03:31.329> 10<00:03:31.989> million<00:03:32.200> with

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
nice if it was like 10 million with

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.089 
nice if it was like 10 million with
potentially<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.090> room<00:03:34.650> 5<00:03:35.650> million<00:03:36.010> in

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
potentially up to room 5 million in

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.009 
potentially up to room 5 million in
bonuses<00:03:36.280> based<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.030> success<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.720> stuff<00:03:37.870> like

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
bonuses based on success and stuff like

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.449 
bonuses based on success and stuff like
that<00:03:38.079> but<00:03:38.290> often<00:03:38.739> it's<00:03:38.889> going<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.129> be<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> case

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
that but often it's going to be the case

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.830 
that but often it's going to be the case
I<00:03:39.609> think<00:03:39.790> they're<00:03:39.879> going<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.030> get<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.209> full<00:03:40.419> 15

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
I think they're going to get a full 15

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.339 
I think they're going to get a full 15
million<00:03:41.169> for<00:03:41.379> him<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:42.599> obviously<00:03:43.599> then<00:03:44.139> we'll

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
million for him and obviously then we'll

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.780 
million for him and obviously then we'll
work<00:03:44.530> out<00:03:44.709> payment<00:03:44.949> structure<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.669> how

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
work out payment structure as to how

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.189 
work out payment structure as to how
they<00:03:45.970> received<00:03:46.299> that<00:03:46.449> 50<00:03:46.780> men<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.139> world

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
they received that 50 men in the world

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.559 
they received that 50 men in the world
Gary<00:03:47.410> all<00:03:47.530> in<00:03:47.650> one<00:03:47.799> go<00:03:48.060> usually<00:03:49.060> its<00:03:49.180> bid<00:03:49.329> over

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
Gary all in one go usually its bid over

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.569 
Gary all in one go usually its bid over
the<00:03:49.660> course<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.109> contract<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.680> know<00:03:50.799> the

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
the course of a contract you know the

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.099 
the course of a contract you know the
duration<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:55.389> might<00:03:55.510> play<00:03:55.660> out<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.959> get

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
duration but that might play out to get

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.990 
duration but that might play out to get
