the scene so you know they talked about
the<00:00:05.020> three<00:00:05.230> different<00:00:05.500> mics<00:00:05.680> on<00:00:05.860> the<00:00:05.980> device

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.220 
the three different mics on the device

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.670 
the three different mics on the device
so<00:00:07.150> if<00:00:07.300> you<00:00:07.420> go<00:00:07.540> to<00:00:07.600> audio<00:00:07.840> scenes<00:00:08.350> in<00:00:08.560> your

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
so if you go to audio scenes in your

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.280 
so if you go to audio scenes in your
camcorder<00:00:08.920> you<00:00:09.880> can<00:00:10.030> actually<00:00:10.210> easily<00:00:10.960> select

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
camcorder you can actually easily select

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.790 
camcorder you can actually easily select
what<00:00:11.830> type<00:00:11.860> of<00:00:12.070> audio<00:00:12.840> feed<00:00:13.840> you<00:00:14.019> want<00:00:14.290> for<00:00:14.710> the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
what type of audio feed you want for the

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.560 
what type of audio feed you want for the
device<00:00:15.070> so<00:00:15.370> for<00:00:15.550> example<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.970> narrative<00:00:16.390> is

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
device so for example the narrative is

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.270 
device so for example the narrative is
if<00:00:16.780> you're<00:00:16.900> taking<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.289> video<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:17.920> you<00:00:18.039> want<00:00:18.160> to

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
if you're taking a video and you want to

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.400 
if you're taking a video and you want to
actually<00:00:18.369> they're<00:00:18.760> actually<00:00:19.030> narrate<00:00:19.720> the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
actually they're actually narrate the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.840 
actually they're actually narrate the
back<00:00:20.650> mike<00:00:20.920> is<00:00:21.130> actually<00:00:21.430> what's<00:00:21.610> going<00:00:21.730> to<00:00:21.789> be

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
back mike is actually what's going to be

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.460 
back mike is actually what's going to be
picking<00:00:22.060> up<00:00:22.210> majority<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.810> sound<00:00:23.080> so<00:00:23.350> that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
picking up majority the sound so that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.050 
picking up majority the sound so that
way<00:00:23.590> it'll<00:00:23.710> be<00:00:23.800> focused<00:00:24.130> on<00:00:24.220> you<00:00:24.430> versus<00:00:24.789> the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
way it'll be focused on you versus the

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.939 
way it'll be focused on you versus the
other<00:00:25.270> things<00:00:25.630> in<00:00:25.750> your<00:00:25.840> environment<00:00:25.949> then

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
other things in your environment then

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.470 
other things in your environment then
you've<00:00:27.070> got<00:00:27.220> outdoors<00:00:27.670> which<00:00:28.000> you<00:00:28.180> don't

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
you've got outdoors which you don't

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.330 
you've got outdoors which you don't
utilize<00:00:28.900> like<00:00:29.199> noise<00:00:29.410> cancellation<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:30.279> it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
utilize like noise cancellation and it

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.759 
utilize like noise cancellation and it
kind<00:00:30.520> of<00:00:30.550> cuts<00:00:30.820> on<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.150> wind<00:00:31.480> noise<00:00:31.660> so<00:00:32.619> that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
kind of cuts on the wind noise so that

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.319 
kind of cuts on the wind noise so that
way<00:00:32.920> you'll<00:00:33.069> have<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.280> better<00:00:33.819> experience

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
way you'll have a better experience

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.059 
way you'll have a better experience
there<00:00:34.780> you've<00:00:35.050> got<00:00:35.079> every<00:00:35.499> day<00:00:35.620> which<00:00:35.829> all

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.069 
there you've got every day which all

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.680 
there you've got every day which all
three<00:00:36.309> mics<00:00:36.519> are<00:00:36.699> lit<00:00:36.879> up<00:00:36.999> that<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.269> capturing

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
three mics are lit up that is capturing

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.059 
three mics are lit up that is capturing
everything<00:00:37.929> in<00:00:38.170> your<00:00:38.289> environment<00:00:38.499> that's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.069 
everything in your environment that's

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.930 
everything in your environment that's
pretty<00:00:39.249> clever<00:00:39.339> is<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.579> something<00:00:39.909> that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
pretty clever is that something that

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.329 
pretty clever is that something that
Motorola<00:00:40.389> or<00:00:40.870> context<00:00:41.620> of<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.889> motorola<00:00:42.219> at

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
Motorola or context of the motorola at

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.829 
Motorola or context of the motorola at
it<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.609> then<00:00:42.729> you've<00:00:42.850> got<00:00:42.879> subjects<00:00:43.539> so<00:00:43.719> this

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
it and then you've got subjects so this

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:44.610 
it and then you've got subjects so this
is<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.079> know<00:00:44.139> you've<00:00:44.289> got<00:00:44.319> that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
is you know you've got that

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.349 
is you know you've got that
five-year-old<00:00:45.039> birthday<00:00:45.249> party<00:00:45.789> and<00:00:45.969> you

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
five-year-old birthday party and you

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.599 
five-year-old birthday party and you
want<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:46.899> focus<00:00:47.079> on<00:00:47.319> child<00:00:47.829> saying<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.370> all

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
want to focus on child saying and all

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:49.829 
want to focus on child saying and all
the<00:00:48.789> other<00:00:48.909> noise<00:00:49.149> and<00:00:49.389> people<00:00:49.449> are<00:00:49.659> going

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
the other noise and people are going

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.599 
the other noise and people are going
around<00:00:49.929> you<00:00:50.229> it<00:00:50.589> then<00:00:50.769> fires<00:00:51.039> up<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.309> front

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
around you it then fires up the front

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.549 
around you it then fires up the front
life<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.089> take<00:00:52.239> priority<00:00:52.479> so<00:00:53.229> that<00:00:53.260> way<00:00:53.499> you

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
life to take priority so that way you

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.049 
life to take priority so that way you
can<00:00:53.769> hear<00:00:54.010> what<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.339> deal<00:00:54.579> with<00:00:54.729> the<00:00:54.819> child

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
can hear what the deal with the child

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.789 
can hear what the deal with the child
saying<00:00:55.389> maybe<00:00:55.749> what<00:00:56.139> somebody's<00:00:56.440> whispering

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
saying maybe what somebody's whispering

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.709 
saying maybe what somebody's whispering
in<00:00:56.920> their<00:00:57.010> here<00:00:57.249> versus<00:00:57.670> everything<00:00:57.999> okay<00:00:58.659> so

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
in their here versus everything okay so

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.239 
in their here versus everything okay so
there's<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.019> front<00:00:59.199> like<00:00:59.379> a<00:00:59.409> back<00:00:59.679> mike<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.159> a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
there's a front like a back mike and a

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.129 
there's a front like a back mike and a
noise<00:01:00.489> cancellation<00:01:01.239> like<00:01:01.359> that<00:01:01.479> exactly<00:01:01.719> so

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:02.139 
noise cancellation like that exactly so

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:03.389 
noise cancellation like that exactly so
like<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.379> can<00:01:02.499> actually<00:01:02.619> see<00:01:02.799> there's<00:01:03.280> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
like you can actually see there's the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.160 
like you can actually see there's the
pinhole<00:01:03.789> mic<00:01:03.969> on<00:01:04.150> that<00:01:04.360> on<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.750> front<00:01:04.989> there

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
pinhole mic on that on the front there

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.900 
pinhole mic on that on the front there
there's<00:01:05.440> one<00:01:05.500> on<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.710> back<00:01:05.830> side<00:01:06.220> there's<00:01:06.850> one

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
there's one on the back side there's one

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.990 
there's one on the back side there's one
on<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.180> top<00:01:07.330> of<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.570> phone<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:08.910> that's<00:01:09.910> a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
on the top of the phone so that's a

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.220 
on the top of the phone so that's a
pretty<00:01:10.300> that's<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.660> pretty<00:01:10.840> neat<00:01:11.020> feature

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
pretty that's a pretty neat feature

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.660 
pretty that's a pretty neat feature
especially<00:01:11.470> because<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.100> high<00:01:12.280> video

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
especially because of the high video

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.820 
especially because of the high video
capability<00:01:13.360> or<00:01:13.390> high<00:01:13.600> definition<00:01:14.140> video<00:01:14.230> to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
capability or high definition video to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.320 
capability or high definition video to
be<00:01:14.920> able<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.130> do<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.340> with<00:01:15.490> sound<00:01:15.790> as<00:01:15.970> well<00:01:16.150> is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
be able to do that with sound as well is

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.970 
be able to do that with sound as well is
pretty<00:01:16.570> amazing<00:01:16.780> then<00:01:17.440> you<00:01:17.560> guys<00:01:17.680> all<00:01:17.860> heard
