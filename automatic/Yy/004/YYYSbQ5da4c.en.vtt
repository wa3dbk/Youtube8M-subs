00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.660
 so 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.219
 welcome to Kiel TV 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.219
 and today I have something very special for you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.019
 To many people whom we imagine the garden say yes it all super 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.949
 We would also like to have great ideas 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.599
 we also understand that with the order of the and everything super APA 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.810
 we already have Gorr 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.100
 We have just thought about what can we do there 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.070
 Detlef d 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.900
 with and develop 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
 Now we have the world exclusive for her 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.950
 There is nothing to order on the internet 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.840
 the 1 data for the city treasury I will be getting shorter and shorter I have here 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.340
 then you can not believe the regime 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.220
 around 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.460
 So this is the starter set 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.500
 is not a leak 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.020
 can be purchased free of charge from us, we can do Siemens send 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.130
 and I do not know 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.140
 come and me », I'll just wave and work 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.200
 you open Prof and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.080
 with 1 4 that's for me that's not just joy 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.680
 So of course you can configure a No completely with 80 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 Participants yes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.470
 and to get to the bottom of it, the garden was in the garden 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.330
 at the cathedral Trier 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.030
 always ready to worry 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 is forced 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.260
 Edmonton Alberta 12 everything works fine 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.609
 and around 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.659
 so that is that even under the influence of drugs were the look 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.190
 what's now 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.820
 and you can 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.380
 Just order and now the best thing you can do after work is done 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.610
 Pröll's percent rents from Bernanke to her old garden shed 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.020
 You need to set up a beautiful garden so you save yourself 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.929
 time money 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.929
 and have an important message right away 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:16.650
 this 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.499
 instead of off 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.339
 it is 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.709
 presumptive posts advertise percent I stop
