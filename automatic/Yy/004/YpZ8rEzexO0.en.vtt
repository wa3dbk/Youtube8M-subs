00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
out of fuel because we want to test the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880 
out of fuel because we want to test the
fuel<00:01:59.310> consumption<00:01:59.850> for<00:01:59.970> tomorrow<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.890> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
fuel consumption for tomorrow and the

fifth<00:02:02.100> qualifying<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.909> car<00:02:03.569> was<00:02:03.720> also<00:02:04.050> very

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
fifth qualifying the car was also very

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.309 
fifth qualifying the car was also very
fast<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:05.399> made<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.240> trial<00:02:06.600> mistake<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
fast but I made the trial mistake and

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.430 
fast but I made the trial mistake and
then<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.710> lose<00:02:07.890> 56<00:02:08.519> seconds<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> stopped<00:02:09.780> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
then I lose 56 seconds so I stopped so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.460 
then I lose 56 seconds so I stopped so
now<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.709> are<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.160> third<00:02:11.790> position<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:13.170> think

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
now we are in third position and I think

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.170 
now we are in third position and I think
it's<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.860> good<00:02:14.010> starting<00:02:14.370> point<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:14.880> tomorrow

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's a good starting point for tomorrow

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.699 
it's a good starting point for tomorrow
and<00:02:15.569> we<00:02:15.690> will<00:02:15.720> fight<00:02:16.080> through<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and we will fight through the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.490 
and we will fight through the
semi-finals<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.580> hopefully<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> final<00:02:18.600> will

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
semi-finals and hopefully the final will

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.370 
semi-finals and hopefully the final will
also<00:02:19.769> be<00:02:19.890> okay<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.870> you're<00:02:22.080> looking<00:02:22.170> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
you have to touch the curb with a little

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.800

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
or you will crash the car so you must

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.690 
or you will crash the car so you must
also<00:03:09.510> be<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:10.049> careful<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.739> it's<00:03:11.579> very

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
also be very careful so it's very

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.660 
also be very careful so it's very
important<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.329> be<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.220> front<00:03:14.519> of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
important to be in the in the front of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.330 
important to be in the in the front of
the<00:03:14.790> final<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.600> starting<00:03:15.930> point<00:03:16.170> our<00:03:17.040> car

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the final in the starting point our car

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.030 
the final in the starting point our car
is<00:03:17.370> very<00:03:18.000> very<00:03:18.510> confident<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.319> very<00:03:19.470> easy<00:03:19.950> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
is very very confident and very easy to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.270 
is very very confident and very easy to
drive<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.480> think<00:03:21.630> for<00:03:21.870> semi<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.709> final<00:03:23.130> we

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
drive so I think for semi and final we

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.110 
drive so I think for semi and final we
have<00:03:23.430> good<00:03:23.850> setup<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.510> very<00:03:24.750> good<00:03:25.700> God<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.940> go

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
have good setup and very good God to go

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.890 
have good setup and very good God to go
very<00:03:27.420> long<00:03:27.600> time<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:27.989> very<00:03:28.560> stable<00:03:28.889> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
very long time and very stable and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.990 
very long time and very stable and
strategy<00:03:30.900> where<00:03:31.079> we<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.470> go<00:03:32.130> very<00:03:32.430> easy<00:03:32.639> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
strategy where we just go very easy to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.840 
strategy where we just go very easy to
final<00:03:33.720> without<00:03:34.139> mistakes<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.010> just<00:03:35.040> finish

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
final without mistakes and just finish

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.330

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
and in the final

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.180 
and in the final
we<00:03:38.580> will<00:03:38.849> fight<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.330> them<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:40.470> pre<00:03:40.709> positions

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190
