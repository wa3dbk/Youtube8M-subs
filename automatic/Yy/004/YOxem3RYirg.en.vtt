00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.330
 come down like shelves with objects they 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.530
 she has repeats in the kitchen 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.750
 including the bathroom that you can see there 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.030
 in the boxing photo this makes a composition 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.799
 unique to the area with the full 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.710
 Entire apartment bring this 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.820
 warmth and refinement and sophistication 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.610
 environment with which we worked with 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.189
 two primary colors in the environment that is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.790
 the dark brown the greater is a shape 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.970
 cream eucatex de la creme that also 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.130
 it's an eucatex monkey everything is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.500
 mixed with a michelangelo tree 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.380
 and labor was of the mp 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.210
 neco is a weapon and paraná so he is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.590
 worked and worked on the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.930
 tv with the fireplace all the workbench 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.420
 the bathroom counter also the people 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.399
 used this landmark and paraná and the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.280
 that every part does not exist only one 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.560
 dap is a full wall is at the bottom of the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.890
 From the kitchen, everyone is waiting for me. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.830
 This brought this air but the ambient show 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.180
 What is everyone approving of? 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.920
 is a very important thing is also the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.320
 which makes all this integration in the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.910
 room with the bedroom is not a carpet 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.340
 We realize it's our other partner 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.550
 office that also pulls into the colors 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.300
 curtain dates which is type one 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.460
 champagne 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.830
 another important piece in our choice 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.770
 within the composition of the environment 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.710
 was thus the sideboard the dining table and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.720
 those around the nightstand who leather 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.470
 designer érica gonçalves from that one 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.120
 curitiba 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.890
 another key piece to work on 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.670
 type of compact apartment are the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.690
 mirrors 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.180
 they have to be in strategic point 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.280
 the project that the project here at home 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.020
 color we threw behind the bed where it was 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.650
 the main vision of those who arrive at 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.350
 environment 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.290
 giving more breadth and appearing 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.620
 an environment is actually much larger than 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 looks 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.540
 we used here in the project the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.280
 to fire fireplaces that are 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.030
 very successful 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.250
 the kitchen was crafted all open 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.560
 continuing with the environmental proposal 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.450
 integrated to all spaces, we are the people 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.950
 placed the dining table against a 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.930
 mirror is has the cooker to count on until 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.820
 It was you that works very well. 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.110
 main suspect in his daily life 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.209
 of the kitchen is the refrigerator and the xs is that 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.830
 is attached to the joinery at the door of the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.200
 cabinet would then open a cabinet 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.230
 thinking it is a simple closet in the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.870
 the whole refrigerator as here in the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.950
 temperatures are extremely high. 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.900
 low 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.730
 we wanted to bring one more element 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.370
 for the bathroom being featured 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.800
 In the space of the house color is the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.260
 then the entire bank in the sea ​​in the parana 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.000
 is heated by tech house and soon in 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.890
 sequence enters the part of the wet area 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.670

 tub and the toilet on brown strength 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.340
 one of the main points and who arrives at 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.400
 environment 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.430
 That 's where the photographer james 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.230
 Ferreira Grandson where he worked on his photo. 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.690
