00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this is a press car it goes in the hands

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.819 
this is a press car it goes in the hands
of<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.880> these<00:01:33.000> crazy<00:01:33.240> media<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:34.350> included

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
of all these crazy media that's included

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.410 
of all these crazy media that's included
and<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.189> guess<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> protect<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and I guess they want to protect it and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
and I guess they want to protect it and
then<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.750> peel<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
then you just peel that off when you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
then you just peel that off when you
sell<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> car<00:01:38.490> yeah<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
sell the car yeah I think that's the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.060 
sell the car yeah I think that's the
idea<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.350> anyone<00:01:40.619> that's<00:01:40.740> actually

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
on that theme right in that this car has

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
on that theme right in that this car has
evolved<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> feedback<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.299> the

old-fashioned kind of car you know I

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.610 
old-fashioned kind of car you know I
know<00:02:19.180> Honda<00:02:19.600> motorcycles<00:02:20.110> one<00:02:20.230> year<00:02:20.380> they<00:02:20.500> go

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
know Honda motorcycles one year they go

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.340 
know Honda motorcycles one year they go
v4<00:02:21.070> then<00:02:21.490> inline<00:02:21.820> four<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.480> v-twin<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
v4 then inline four then v-twin and and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.310 
v4 then inline four then v-twin and and
each<00:02:23.890> year<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:24.520> engine<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.570> out<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
each year your engine is out I like the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.620 
each year your engine is out I like the
constant<00:02:26.800> refinement<00:02:27.520> over<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.270> over<00:02:28.510> again

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
constant refinement over and over again

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.500 
constant refinement over and over again
I<00:02:28.780> know<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.170> think<00:02:29.350> last<00:02:29.740> year<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.070> was<00:02:30.190> like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
I know I think last year it was like

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.670 
I know I think last year it was like
approximately<00:02:31.510> 400<00:02:31.900> horsepower<00:02:32.110> now<00:02:32.440> it's<00:02:32.590> up

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
approximately 400 horsepower now it's up

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.640 
approximately 400 horsepower now it's up
to<00:02:32.710> what<00:02:32.890> 435<00:02:33.520> 35<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:35.050> know<00:02:35.170> they<00:02:35.350> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
to what 435 35 and you know they the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.950 
to what 435 35 and you know they the
whole<00:02:35.950> rear<00:02:36.820> engine<00:02:37.150> six-cylinder<00:02:37.750> thing

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
whole rear engine six-cylinder thing

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.530 
whole rear engine six-cylinder thing
they<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:39.210> sound<00:02:40.210> is<00:02:40.390> so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
they it's it's that sound is so

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.570 
they it's it's that sound is so
distinctive<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.110> think<00:02:41.290> anyone<00:02:42.040> would<00:02:42.220> would

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
distinctive I think anyone would would

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.490 
distinctive I think anyone would would
know<00:02:42.790> when<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.090> comes<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.570> it's<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.200> manual

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
know when it comes in it's a manual

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.250 
know when it comes in it's a manual
6-speed<00:02:45.010> right<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.690> if<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.870> know<00:02:47.110> your

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
6-speed right and and if you know your

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.570 
6-speed right and and if you know your
Porsches<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.740> know<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.220> normally

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
Porsches you know this is the normally

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.250 
Porsches you know this is the normally
aspirated<00:02:48.760> version<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.570> lot<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.810> people<00:02:50.080> like

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
aspirated version a lot of people like

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.350 
aspirated version a lot of people like
the<00:02:50.470> turbo<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.550> does<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:51.910> more<00:02:52.090> power

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
the turbo and it does have more power

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.200 
the turbo and it does have more power
but<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.110> more<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:54.250> ultimate<00:02:54.730> driver's

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210
