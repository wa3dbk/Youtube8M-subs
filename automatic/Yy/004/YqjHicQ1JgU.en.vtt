00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone today we will cook 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.880
 Delicious potato cake 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.300
 the cake I'm generally very easy to prepare 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.090
 it is very easy to prepare so we only 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.330
 only cocoa coconut is needed 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:26.269
 Almond Nut Raisin 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.269
 butter cookies 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.399
 condensed milk and vanilla sugar is a miracle 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.399
 the recipe is ingeniously simple all proportions 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.379
 will be listed under the video in the description 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:45.020
 the first thing we do is poly 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:48.570
 raisin raisins hot water and diseases and 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.030
 while we prepare our our mind for 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.949
 by persons first thing we grind 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 small chip cookies 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.550
 but you probably already noticed that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 cookies like oatmeal but it is far 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
 not all on and cookies but just like 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.920
 oatmeal cookies prepared missed 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.540
 through a meat grinder through a large mesh 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.400
 so the next thing we will do is 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 mix a creamy macro with a bead 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.790
 butter will need to melt the butter we 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 the end will not melt it must 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.900
 become a little bit so warm 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.860
 the main oil needs to be soft to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.960
 it was easy it was possible to mix condensed milk 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.590
 add condensed milk already melted 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.590
 butter 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.070
 condensed milk should be thick and liquid 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.670
 now you need to be very careful 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.850
 stir so now we need to add 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:54.000
 cocoa 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:56.090
 I think our cat is half way easier 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.190

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.190

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.810
 add vanilla sugar to smell and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.280
 of taste 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:27.000

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.250
