00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
rooftop rumble solo this is actually a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.670

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
clip from that this i'm using in this

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.650 
clip from that this i'm using in this
video<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.160> course<00:00:45.079> i'm<00:00:46.079> using<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.129> adder

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
video of course i'm using the adder

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.819 
video of course i'm using the adder
which<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:50.870> important<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:51.899> expensive<00:00:52.500> us<00:00:52.649> i

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
which is important very expensive us i

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.910 
which is important very expensive us i
believe<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.340> still<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> most<00:00:55.260> expensive

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
believe it's still the most expensive

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
believe it's still the most expensive
car<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> game<00:00:58.699> but<00:00:59.699> point<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.600> back

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
window a low profile back window it's
actually<00:01:06.049> more<00:01:07.049> accurately<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> point<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.720> in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
actually more accurately the point is in

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.649 
actually more accurately the point is in
fact<00:01:10.380> there's<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.549> much<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.090> shoot<00:01:12.360> through
