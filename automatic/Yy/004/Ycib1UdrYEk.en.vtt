00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.210
 about the machine what's going on 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 g &amp; d finished myself through my experience 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.999
 three goals that seems interesting to me 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.119
 for this machine 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.119
 firstly there is a purely medical aspect 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.779
 and for this head to this medical aspect 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.779
 I draw from my own experience but also and especially 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.820
 of the functional rehabilitation unit of chc de clermont ferrand 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.489
 who uses this machine on a daily basis 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.610
 it seems that this machine 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.420
 Watercolor is very interesting 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.100
 so that especially the hands 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.910
 traumatic hands 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.860
 hands two of the maths zte 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.129
 the dystrophy argos tomorrow spied of course 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.890
 also in a letter to the improvement of scars to sion 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.780
 there is a second goal 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.140
 killer even one action after flex 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.710
 we can start from the theoretical base 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.190
 Chinese 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 in e2 therapy what is called zone therapy 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.929
 which makes that for the groove mas motion puts pressure on an area 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.600
 we will have an action obviously on this black zone 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.280
 but we can have an action also from a distance 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.590
 so this is the whole of this plantar dwelling 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.830
 palmer 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.900
 which makes it possible to act remotely on a pathology further 2 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.360
 the place located either by hand or foot example 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 in case of pathologies of the shoulder of course it is not a fracture 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 a tendon rupture 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.880
 but if you have tendonitis of the shoulder you may be able to find a point 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.650
 painful 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.030
 at the level of the foot 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.159
 at the base of the fifth metatarsal of the fifth metatarsal 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990
 p at that time if the person 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.010
 done watercolor sessions repeat customers putting this area there 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.270
 first league may also have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.810
 in addition to the side care 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.480
 an interesting improvement 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.130
 finally a third interesting aspect emerges from the use of this 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.970
 watercolor 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.249
 cv well-being 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.749
 whoever annihilates his feet in the Senate even once 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.259
 in this device 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.059
 can not deny that 20 minutes after 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059
 it is a feeling of lightness and well-being 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.259
 Why 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.479
 because 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.479
 there is a traffic problem 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.379
 who does what 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.909
 improvement 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.129
 this makes all our weight individuals of all our body from there 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.129
 traffic 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.870
 as a doctor obviously I can not deny that the circulation and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.239
 primary 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.279
 if there is stagnation a slowdown a concession it can 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.549
 to be at the origin of pathologies that will of course have to be treated differently 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.019
 so what brings this device safe in terms of well-being and well 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.879
 simply an improvement in traffic 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.379
 because we know very well that the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.429
 on crossroads will be well 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:09.029
 arteriovenous extremely bringing and that way we well 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.409
 risk of having a well-being 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.559
 and therefore good health by improved circulation and maintained 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.589
 so definitive what about watercolor 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.799
 i believe that m 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.679
 we must continue without doubt 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.469
 to seek the why and the how 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.159
 benefits that can be derived from this 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.379
 your device it is necessary especially I think that to try 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:41.449
 because all the results for now seemed to go in a way the 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:42.289
 challenges that 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.339
 both for our health and for our well-being
