do stress is that you guys need to get

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.340 
do stress is that you guys need to get
organic<00:00:47.340> raw<00:00:47.820> honey<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.390> manuka<00:00:49.050> honey<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
organic raw honey or manuka honey a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.200 
organic raw honey or manuka honey a
really<00:00:49.829> good<00:00:50.100> type<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.489> honey<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
really good type of honey because that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.610 
really good type of honey because that
kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> honey<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.469> your

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
kind of honey is really good for your

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.709 
kind of honey is really good for your
skin<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.309> recipe<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.180> one-to-one

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
skin this recipe is like a one-to-one

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.990 
skin this recipe is like a one-to-one
ratio<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> use<00:00:56.670> half<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
ratio so you don't have to use half a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.880 
ratio so you don't have to use half a
teaspoon<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> find<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.710> than

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
teaspoon but I find that is more than

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
teaspoon but I find that is more than
enough<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.309> my<00:00:59.430> skin<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> sort<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
enough for my skin so this is sort of a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.599 
enough for my skin so this is sort of a
tricky<00:01:01.050> part<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.800> need<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> add<00:01:02.160> enough

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
tricky part you just need to add enough

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.910 
tricky part you just need to add enough
lemon<00:01:03.149> juice<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.840> form<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.229> thick<00:01:04.439> paste<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
lemon juice to form a thick paste you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
lemon juice to form a thick paste you
don't<00:01:05.040> want<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> add<00:01:05.309> too<00:01:05.580> much<00:01:05.729> lemon<00:01:06.090> juice

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
don't want to add too much lemon juice

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.120 
don't want to add too much lemon juice
so<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.930> soupy<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so that it's like soupy but you want it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800 
so that it's like soupy but you want it
to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.340> able<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.610> stick<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.119> skin<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> not

makeup I use this witch hazel scrub on
the<00:03:04.290> parts<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.620> my<00:03:04.739> face<00:03:04.919> that<00:03:05.160> have<00:03:05.310> breakouts

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the parts of my face that have breakouts

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.640 
the parts of my face that have breakouts
so<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.150> dab<00:03:06.389> it<00:03:06.419> on<00:03:06.750> where<00:03:07.109> I<00:03:07.139> need<00:03:07.500> it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
so I just dab it on where I need it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.069 
so I just dab it on where I need it
because<00:03:07.919> it's<00:03:08.130> an<00:03:08.250> astringent<00:03:08.609> toner<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
because it's an astringent toner so it

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.789 
because it's an astringent toner so it
helps<00:03:10.410> control<00:03:10.919> those<00:03:11.299> nasty<00:03:12.299> little<00:03:12.870> spots<00:03:13.470> I

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
helps control those nasty little spots I

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.349 
helps control those nasty little spots I
recently<00:03:14.370> have<00:03:14.700> been<00:03:14.790> using<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> spot

treatment and what's different is that

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.390 
treatment and what's different is that
it's<00:03:17.190> 2%<00:03:17.849> salicylic<00:03:18.090> acid<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.049> super<00:03:19.829> strong
