00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
let's just think about that for what

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
let's just think about that for what
could<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.240> mean<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.659> free-for-all<00:01:13.380> mode<00:01:13.740> I'm

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
could that mean a free-for-all mode I'm

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.499 
could that mean a free-for-all mode I'm
pretty<00:01:14.369> sure<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.760> got<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.060> thought<00:01:15.299> about

pretty sure you got to thought about

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
pretty sure you got to thought about
that<00:01:15.750> before<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.380> maybe<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.340> been

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that before and maybe there have been

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
that before and maybe there have been
complications<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:18.689> thinking<00:01:19.140> about

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
complications but as I'm thinking about

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.499 
complications but as I'm thinking about
it<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.650> can't<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.270> problem

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it I just can't see what the problem

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.140 
it I just can't see what the problem
with<00:01:21.840> having<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.320> free-for-all<00:01:23.100> mode<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
with having a free-for-all mode would I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
with having a free-for-all mode would I
think<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.590> fun<00:01:25.920> to
