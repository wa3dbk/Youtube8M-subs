don't<00:00:46.710> actually<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.520> cold<00:00:47.879> by<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> future

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
don't actually get cold by the future

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540

fires<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:49.200> only<00:00:49.410> call<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
fires as they only call you when you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.580 
fires as they only call you when you
first<00:00:50.820> aggro<00:00:51.300> them<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.350> dodged

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
first aggro them and if you just dodged

out<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.370> use<00:00:53.550> staff<00:00:53.969> number<00:00:54.360> two

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
out of the way or use staff number two

out of the way or use staff number two
they<00:00:55.920> can't<00:00:56.129> hit<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.390> they're<00:00:57.660> really

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
they can't hit you so they're really

quite<00:00:58.020> easy<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.530> bunch<00:00:58.800> them<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
quite easy just bunch them up and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.929 
quite easy just bunch them up and
shedder<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:02.250> sort<00:01:02.609> two<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
shedder and you sort two and that's it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:23.530 
shedder and you sort two and that's it
later<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.330> easily

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.570 

now<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:24.350> I'm<00:01:24.470> gonna<00:01:24.590> do<00:01:24.800> here<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.130> I'm<00:01:25.370> gonna

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
right here will die very quickly there's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.170 
right here will die very quickly there's
one<00:01:51.500> knob<00:01:51.740> in<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:51.980> back<00:01:52.070> that's<00:01:52.580> ranged<00:01:53.030> and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
one knob in the back that's ranged and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.180 
one knob in the back that's ranged and
didn't<00:01:53.450> get<00:01:53.660> bunched<00:01:53.900> up<00:01:54.170> that's<00:01:54.770> okay<00:01:54.920> we'll

take<00:01:55.340> care<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.670> them<00:01:55.820> afterwards

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.600 

they<00:02:11.900> are<00:02:12.110> five<00:02:12.410> or<00:02:12.620> six<00:02:12.860> dead<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.310> then<00:02:13.430> we'll

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
they are five or six dead and then we'll

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.140
