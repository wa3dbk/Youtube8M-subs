 hope to win and this in fact 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 trust to matthieu to move on to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.379
 fund unjustly mathieu you have 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.370
 placed in the lead, it's quite logical 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.070
 it's the art form evening the number 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 three sergeants of the rib the horse comes back 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.449
 at the top announced this time barefoot 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.339
 deferré of the 4 so unavoidable base 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.470
 that's how you said philippe 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.150
 sergeant gibbs is really the base in 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 reinforced concrete of this test 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.780
 it represents great training 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 form of jean louis jean loïc claude 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 sorry forgiveness before at both 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.479
 last meetings we had we had 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.610
 we had a resident of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.320
 franck leblanc and christian bigeon 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.360
 which continues to shine during 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.040
 winter but now jean luc dersoir 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 went into the dance 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.930
 he really realized two beautiful 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 last meetings since d since 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 early winter she has already won eight 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.299
 races including two quintés with narrative 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.280
 jeloca gypsy rim sergeant of the rib 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.260
 during his last attempt 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.400
 at the entrance of the last turn you 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.590
 count your tickets were really 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.110
 little trot and it's a horse a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.420
 synthetic 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.560
 it was necessary to shake the chips at mid-line 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.700
 right but still kept it a 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.530
 good third place 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 there he will be deferré of four feet on 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.590
 know it's jean loïc claude dersoir 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.040
 when to undo all four feet 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.320
 the powder 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.820
 so there it now counts a lot of 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.230
 legroom 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.090
 the opposition is largely in his 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.370
 strings it will be straightened from the four feet 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 a long distance to his 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.010
 entire convenience 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 this is the penalty the meeting for me if 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.920
 they enter the meetings these 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.720
 ads and do not forget why not 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.150
 could not play win it can be 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.880
 interesting even if rappaz 50 groups 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.890
 were worth opposite number 8 rygiel so the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.670
 horse remains on two successes including one on 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.310
 the course of the day 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.680
 jose ehrbeck deferrer of the four there too 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 essential to paper here is the nar 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.370
 jean luc dersoir was very happy 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.140
 to have just put no one who has him 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.209
 given a tailor-made course in the back 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.250
 of the leader and we know it's open there 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.350
 superbly sprung to win 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.140
 easily the palm there he meets 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.280
 substantially the same opposition 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.810
 after June, you really need him 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.060
 give to my background like what he did 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.190
 not a huge room for maneuver but 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.209
 the Belgian devil is in the sulky so 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.620
 everything should be fine 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.910
 the horse stayed in the best 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.410
 provisions she picked up a little bit of 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.430
 freshness for this commitment and will be at 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.049
 new free of four feet 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.700
 all fires are too much training 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.680
 expected we will have understood in the third 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.120
 position the number 13 littoral quartz 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.400
 so there his mentor did not hesitate to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 tell us this is the target race of the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.610
 meeting here he can not dream a 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.890
 better commitment to the earnings ceiling 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.910
 on a distance to stand at his 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.070
 entire convenience 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.600
 he will be deferré of four feet him 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.549
 unlike ryu jiel body site 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.110
 where a coastal and oral forgiveness can be 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.250
 to roll in port where the far is not 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.640
 a problem he has a hold at all 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.610
 test 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.540
 so he also has a lot 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.280
 assets in his game 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.420
 I was the beautiful wild bunch 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.850
 chances of finishing in a quinté is 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.400
 okay in fourth position precisely 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.750
 the number 4 rezone casone then his 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.519
 to go success attests its form 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.110
 now sakura next that you 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.910
 do not worry me it does not worry me anymore 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.530
 that it is presented by a coach 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.230
 very very skilled who had to do just 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.310
 the interview since its recent success - 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.080
 had somewhat disappointed 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.240
 November 27 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.100
 in a quinté I expected a beautiful 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.720
 attempt is certainly he had joined a 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.520
 little bit of bad luck but he had me 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.900
 not really convinced while the 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.360
 last time he is ahead is my favorite 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.550
 Sergeant rib between time outside 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.020
 outside of him it was really 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.090
 show very very brave to go 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.270
 at the pole he had to still ride on 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.130
 this attempt so david thomain of 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.450
 ceases to illustrate it also since 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.740
 start of the meeting which clear him 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.410
 can follow in great confidence 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.830
 okay a small outsider in the fifth 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.090
 position the number 1 she this w feydeau 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.100
 so on the rising 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.720
 johanna linguist it can be funny there 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.350
 paying a small coast here it is my 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.930
 little find 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.550
 wf and last last time 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.290
 packed me she came to finish in 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.139
 a pleasant action without having all 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.090
 his ease to finish each time 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.680
 that she ran over the 2700 meters of 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.389
 the big track and market 14 at all 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.060
 trips so if at 30,14 this thursday forgiveness 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.889
 this Wednesday there is largely a place in 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.750
 khat is simple and frankly because 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.270
 that it launches quickly and should 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.030
 quickly be close to the head horses 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.820
 forgiveness and after must really that 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.380
 opens if it has the right course its 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.160
 place in 15 years we are wary it can 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.600
 spice up the reports 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.070
 before you ask for a little reminder 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.770
 your selection I saw that you had 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.220
 placed the number 10 star 2009 in 8th 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.680
 position 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.780
 it's going to be one of the logical favorites 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.970
 of the race why so low a star 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.470
 2009 déerré of the four jean michel 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.160
 bazire it is sure that before the blow that 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.930
 draws attention 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.430
 but the 2700 meters of the big track 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.840
 it's really the end of the world for 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.740
 it is especially the coast that remains to him 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.660
 across the throat 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.550
 we could see him during his 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.289
 penultimate exit met that 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.430
 females that day was already 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.860
 barefooted with four feet with jeans 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.120
 Michel and I knew how to pacify him 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.950
 do a little bit to finish but 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.560
 really nothing very interesting 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.000
 the street but the closed cap even good 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.240
 months before the coup I do not believe it 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.400
 a lot 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.139
 you do not believe it is guarded because 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.910
 it's jmb because we know cats or 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.440
 closed cap so we know it means 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.849
 hamas and then for those jmj 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.410
 here are the brave she emanates grass in 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.700
 a course but I really believe that 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.320
 the wrong coast tickets for the album 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.520
 okay but you ask a little 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.889
 reminder of your selection you 8 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.150
 okay then ridden monday as I 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.150
 wanted to say first the three 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.110
 sergeants of the rib on the 8th of July the 13th 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:59.110
 littoral quartz leucate rezéen cayennais 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.479
 the asi health w feydeau the 12th feel the 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.490
 fourteen priori and the 10 stars winne 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.280
 is ok regarding the day board 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.020
 part on a field reduced to 5.5 from 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.060
 base you've understood it must-have 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.940
 the 3rd and the 8th sergeant of the rib and original 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.039
 and behind we placed las the 4 the 6 the 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.960
 say the 12th on the 13th and the 14th 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.750
 it's a game that will cost va t in euros 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.639
 we can play at 50% we can play at 10% 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.780
 it's a race that looks pretty 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.560
 open but still with bases 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.180
 solid enough 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.440
 so I advise you to follow mathieu 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.539
 especially that it looks hot especially 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.190
 with his favorite 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.750
