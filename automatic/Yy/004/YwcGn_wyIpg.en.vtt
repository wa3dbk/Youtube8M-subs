about<00:00:05.460> one<00:00:05.819> particular<00:00:05.970> lick<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:06.839> been

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
about one particular lick that I've been

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.560 
about one particular lick that I've been
playing<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.580> thought<00:00:08.760> what<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:08.970> do<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.360> just

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
playing so I thought what I do is just

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.540 
playing so I thought what I do is just
go<00:00:09.719> over<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.290> play<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.860> hopefully

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
go over it how to play it and hopefully

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.459 
go over it how to play it and hopefully
you<00:00:11.849> can<00:00:12.030> make<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.389> go<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> subject<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.290> quite

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
you can make it go to subject be quite

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:44.540 
you can make it go to subject be quite
popular<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.389> it's<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.690> one

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.760 

mmm

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770 

it's<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:50.070> actually<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.579> difficult<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
it's not actually that difficult in a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.319 
it's not actually that difficult in a
difficult<00:00:51.989> part<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> accuracy<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
difficult part this is the accuracy and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.090 
difficult part this is the accuracy and
it<00:00:54.809> obviously<00:00:54.930> making<00:00:55.500> me<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:55.949> some

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
it obviously making me to get some

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.660 
it obviously making me to get some
spilling<00:00:56.790> so<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.620> three<00:00:59.129> string<00:00:59.370> sweeps

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
spilling so it's all three string sweeps

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
spilling so it's all three string sweeps
with<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.269> with<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.989> tapping<00:01:01.290> one<00:01:01.890> note

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
with it with like tapping one note

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.399 
with it with like tapping one note
pretty<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.899> sweet

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
pretty much so the first the first sweet

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
pretty much so the first the first sweet
position<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.399> look<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.759> a<00:01:08.790> G

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
position you're going to look at as a G

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.550 
position you're going to look at as a G
minor<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.720> three<00:01:09.899> string<00:01:10.140> sweep<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
minor and it's a three string sweep so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.550 
minor and it's a three string sweep so
there's<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> G<00:01:11.070> yeah<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.180> there's<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.869> g

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
there's a G yeah and there's your g

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.350 
there's a G yeah and there's your g
sweep

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.440 

so<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> sweep<00:01:25.829> there<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.490> tap<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
so we will do a sweep there and tap a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.109 
so we will do a sweep there and tap a
genome<00:01:28.049> she's<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.490> 15th<00:01:29.880> fret

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
genome she's here which is the 15th fret

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.630 
genome she's here which is the 15th fret
the<00:01:30.270> East<00:01:30.390> Room<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:34.640> just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the East Room so you want to go just

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:48.100 
the East Room so you want to go just
them<00:01:38.869> let's<00:01:39.869> meet<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.259> again

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.900 

Oh

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.670 

that's<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.060> first<00:01:52.270> bit<00:01:52.360> we<00:01:53.320> would<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.500> do

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
that's the first bit we would have do

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.620 
that's the first bit we would have do
there<00:01:53.920> if<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.220> think<00:01:54.460> about<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.420> G

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
there if you think about the to the G

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.630 
there if you think about the to the G
minor<00:01:55.930> pentatonic<00:01:56.230> scale<00:01:56.740> or<00:01:57.040> e<00:01:57.100> work<00:01:57.370> knives

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
notes in there but you think about the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.700 
notes in there but you think about the
notes<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:02.140> get<00:02:02.530> from<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.860> g<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.760> can<00:02:03.910> go<00:02:04.060> g<00:02:04.330> a

notes you get from the g you can go g a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.950 
notes you get from the g you can go g a
a<00:02:05.820> show<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.180> want<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.360> go<00:02:10.480> you<00:02:10.750> can

with<00:02:15.100> something<00:02:15.340> I've<00:02:15.430> got<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.090> we've<00:02:16.210> got

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
with something I've got so if we've got

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.430 
with something I've got so if we've got
 r<00:02:16.990> g<00:02:17.500> g<00:02:18.250> minor<00:02:18.460> sweep<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:19.290> wouldn't<00:02:20.290> got

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
 r g g minor sweep I wouldn't got

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.270 
 r g g minor sweep I wouldn't got
here<00:02:20.850> which<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.510> sharp<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.740> we<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:23.980> play<00:02:24.130> an

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
here which is a sharp and we can play an

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.930 
here which is a sharp and we can play an
a<00:02:24.940> shop<00:02:25.240> major<00:02:25.990> sweep<00:02:31.530> from<00:02:32.530> there<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.100> you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
a shop major sweep from there and you

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.470 
a shop major sweep from there and you
can<00:02:34.120> get<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.720> what<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.560> they<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:39.480> sorry

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
can get and what that they can be sorry

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.559 
can get and what that they can be sorry
this<00:02:40.960> C<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.940> you'd<00:02:43.150> get

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:03:02.970 

you<00:02:50.140> got<00:02:50.319> three<00:02:50.590> sweeps<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.620> it's<00:03:02.739> just<00:03:02.829> a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
you got three sweeps so it's just a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.379 
you got three sweeps so it's just a
caterer<00:03:03.249> then<00:03:03.370> tap<00:03:03.549> in<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.730> right<00:03:03.879> date<00:03:04.090> so

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
caterer then tap in the right date so

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:12.440 
caterer then tap in the right date so
our<00:03:04.780> first<00:03:04.930> note<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.200> there<00:03:05.469> so

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.330 

then<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:13.540> want<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.780> work<00:03:13.900> up<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.350> next<00:03:15.010> week's

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
then we want to work up to next week's

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.900 
then we want to work up to next week's
hear<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:18.130> low<00:03:18.340> here<00:03:20.220> jumps<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.400> sharps<00:03:21.790> you

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
hear this low here jumps in a sharps you

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:30.180 
hear this low here jumps in a sharps you
walk<00:03:22.210> up<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.480> head<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.370> go

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.390 

when<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.300> no<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:32.010> slide<00:03:33.010> your<00:03:33.220> hand

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
when you do that no you slide your hand

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.310 
when you do that no you slide your hand
up<00:03:33.580> obviously<00:03:33.790> gets<00:03:34.120> you<00:03:34.240> an<00:03:34.300> exposition<00:03:34.750> so

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.300 

then<00:03:41.320> you're<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.470> doing<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:41.800> same<00:03:41.950> kind<00:03:42.010> of

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
then you're just doing the same kind of

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.370 
then you're just doing the same kind of
liq<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.300> they'll<00:03:43.540> see<00:03:43.690> tapping<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.110> different

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
liq but they'll see tapping a different

00:03:44.380 --> 00:04:03.369 
liq but they'll see tapping a different
note<00:03:47.610> same<00:03:48.610> goes<00:03:48.760> for<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:48.910> back<00:03:49.060> right<00:03:49.360> down

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.020 

relatively<00:04:04.379> straightforward<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.519> then<00:04:05.730> move

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
relatively straightforward and then move

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.369 
relatively straightforward and then move
up<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:08.989> see<00:04:10.909> and<00:04:11.909> don't<00:04:12.750> see<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.019> want<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.230> tell

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
up to see and don't see you want to tell

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.649 
up to see and don't see you want to tell
the<00:04:13.560> scene<00:04:13.769> up<00:04:13.950> here<00:04:14.330> it's<00:04:15.330> obviously<00:04:15.569> an

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
the scene up here it's obviously an

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.060 
the scene up here it's obviously an
octane<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.430> their<00:04:18.199> so<00:04:19.199> and<00:04:19.560> then<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.889> same

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
octane of their so and then do the same

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.920 
octane of their so and then do the same
thing<00:04:21.860> to<00:04:22.860> get<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.250> know<00:04:23.430> you'd<00:04:23.910> be<00:04:23.940> here

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:50.990 

they<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.080> want<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.260> go

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:10.410 

and<00:04:52.000> spits<00:04:52.360> in<00:04:52.540> so<00:04:52.720> using<00:04:52.960> go

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.750 

oh<00:05:10.500> just<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.650> go<00:05:11.740> back<00:05:11.890> down<00:05:11.920> again<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.640> that

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
oh just to go back down again to that

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:39.180 
oh just to go back down again to that
like<00:05:12.910> they're<00:05:14.640> just<00:05:15.640> doing<00:05:15.760> that<00:05:38.070> that's<00:05:39.070> your

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
like they're just doing that that's your

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.740 
like they're just doing that that's your
tapping<00:05:39.490> sequence<00:05:39.880> so<00:05:40.240> we'll<00:05:40.390> see<00:05:40.570> then<00:05:40.720> you

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
tapping sequence so we'll see then you

00:05:40.750 --> 00:06:12.270 
tapping sequence so we'll see then you
could<00:05:40.960> just<00:05:41.050> do<00:05:41.200> a<00:05:41.440> lot<00:05:42.070> together<00:05:42.220> so<00:05:42.720> go

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.370 

you

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.670 

the<00:06:21.010> last<00:06:21.190> bit<00:06:21.430> is<00:06:21.460> just<00:06:21.760> a<00:06:21.850> run<00:06:22.120> through<00:06:22.420> the

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
the last bit is just a run through the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:37.629 
the last bit is just a run through the
whole<00:06:23.680> kind<00:06:23.920> of<00:06:24.040> position<00:06:24.400> of<00:06:24.460> that<00:06:24.610> scratch

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:43.839 

back<00:06:38.639> up<00:06:38.819> again<00:06:41.689> up<00:06:42.689> to<00:06:43.019> what<00:06:43.379> would<00:06:43.469> that<00:06:43.529> be

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
back up again up to what would that be

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:57.730 
back up again up to what would that be
18<00:06:50.359> you<00:06:51.359> get

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.920 

you

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:22.080 

a<00:07:01.360> little<00:07:02.360> bit<00:07:02.449> faster

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.780 

it's<00:07:23.090> not<00:07:23.300> that<00:07:23.540> difficult
