this what you do is you let that dry for
a<00:02:29.710> little<00:02:29.830> while<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:30.880> you'd<00:02:31.060> rebuff<00:02:31.540> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
a little while and then you'd rebuff it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.200 
a little while and then you'd rebuff it
just<00:02:32.170> as<00:02:32.350> its<00:02:32.530> drying<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.910> doesn't

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
just as its drying so that it doesn't

leave any streaking it's very important

with<00:02:36.640> white<00:02:36.910> polish<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.890> last<00:02:39.160> little

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
with white polish to do that last little

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.790 
with white polish to do that last little
step<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.940> process<00:02:40.420> otherwise<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.620> will

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
step on the process otherwise you will

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.150 
step on the process otherwise you will
end<00:02:42.070> up<00:02:42.160> with<00:02:42.280> lines<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.940> will<00:02:43.060> streak<00:02:44.160> so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
end up with lines and it will streak so

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.720 
end up with lines and it will streak so

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
and that's how you would clean and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.860 
and that's how you would clean and
