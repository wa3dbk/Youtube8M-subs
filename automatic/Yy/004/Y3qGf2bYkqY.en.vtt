00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
the the positive thing is from the first

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.339 
the the positive thing is from the first
quarter<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.970> second<00:00:09.389> quarter<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
quarter of the second quarter to the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.900 
quarter of the second quarter to the
third<00:00:10.710> quarter<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.190> fourth<00:00:11.400> quarter<00:00:11.639> we

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
third quarter of the fourth quarter we

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.959 
third quarter of the fourth quarter we
got<00:00:12.090> better<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.990> played<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:14.400> said<00:00:14.849> we

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
got better as we played and I said we

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.550 
got better as we played and I said we
got<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> get<00:00:15.360> better<00:00:15.509> every<00:00:15.929> day<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.379> think

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
got to get better every day and I think

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.580 
got to get better every day and I think
we<00:00:16.680> got<00:00:16.710> better<00:00:17.100> each<00:00:17.310> quarter<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.439> when<00:00:19.439> we

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
we got better each quarter and when we

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.029 
we got better each quarter and when we
went<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.850> halftime<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.750> talked<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> kids

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
went in at halftime I talked to the kids

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.050 
went in at halftime I talked to the kids
out<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> field<00:00:24.260> told<00:00:25.260> them<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.310> did

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
out on the field told them that that did

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.700 
out on the field told them that that did
not<00:00:27.210> want<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.570> play<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.990> way<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.170> were<00:00:28.410> playing

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
not want to play the way we were playing

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620 
not want to play the way we were playing
and<00:00:28.980> I'd<00:00:29.099> expect<00:00:29.580> us<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.090> better<00:00:30.300> than<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and I'd expect us to do better than that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.659 
and I'd expect us to do better than that
and<00:00:30.990> had<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.740> heart-to-heart<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.550> we

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and had a little heart-to-heart and we

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.910 
and had a little heart-to-heart and we
went<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.300> made<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.890> adjustment<00:00:34.890> or

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
went in and we made some adjustment or

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
went in and we made some adjustment or
coaches<00:00:35.340> did<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> good<00:00:35.730> job<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:36.510> could<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:37.079> kids

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
coaches did a good job or could our kids

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
coaches did a good job or could our kids
could<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.680> went<00:00:37.860> either<00:00:37.980> direction<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
could have went either direction and I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.880 
could have went either direction and I
thought<00:00:39.750> they<00:00:39.930> went<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> positive<00:00:40.680> direction

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
thought they went a positive direction

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.680 
thought they went a positive direction
that's<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> credit<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> coaches

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that's not a credit to the coaches

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
that's not a credit to the coaches
that's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.020> credit<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> kids<00:00:43.829> because

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that's a credit to the kids because

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830 
that's a credit to the kids because
they're<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> ones<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.210> playing<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
they're the ones that are playing and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.470 
they're the ones that are playing and
they<00:00:46.559> reach<00:00:46.800> down<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.879> grab

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
they reach down in there and and grab

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.360 
they reach down in there and and grab
something<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.320> bought<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.190> our

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
something and they bought in I think our

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
something and they bought in I think our
coaches<00:00:51.210> certain<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.809> certainly<00:00:52.170> did<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
coaches certain you know certainly did a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
coaches certain you know certainly did a
good<00:00:52.559> job<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:53.100> keeping<00:00:53.280> their<00:00:53.910> composure<00:00:54.360> but

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
good job at keeping their composure but

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.139 
good job at keeping their composure but
the<00:00:55.199> kids<00:00:55.469> responded<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.520> thought<00:00:56.969> they

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the kids responded and I thought they

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
the kids responded and I thought they
played<00:00:57.199> maybe<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.350> didn't<00:00:58.530> play<00:00:58.649> technically

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
played maybe we didn't play technically

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.889 
played maybe we didn't play technically
well<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> time<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> second<00:01:00.570> half<00:01:00.750> but

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
well all the time in the second half but

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.979 
well all the time in the second half but
they<00:01:01.050> did<00:01:01.289> play<00:01:01.469> hard<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.960> know

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
they did play hard and I think you know

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.560 
they did play hard and I think you know
I<00:01:04.110> wish<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.739> know<00:01:04.830> had<00:01:05.280> four<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:06.090> five<00:01:06.299> more

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
I wish we you know had four or five more

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
I wish we you know had four or five more
minutes<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> football<00:01:07.530> game<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.159> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
minutes in that football game but we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490 
minutes in that football game but we
didn't<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.810> were<00:01:09.990> stronger<00:01:10.260> than

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
didn't and I think we were stronger than

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
didn't and I think we were stronger than
the<00:01:10.740> USC<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> end<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> game<00:01:11.790> no<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the USC at the end of the game no I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.880 
the USC at the end of the game no I
don't<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> mean<00:01:13.260> we're<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
don't think so I mean we're not going to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.950 
don't think so I mean we're not going to
change<00:01:14.040> anything<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.640> we've<00:01:15.270> done<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> mean

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
change anything we we've done I mean

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.649 
change anything we we've done I mean
it's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.380> situation<00:01:17.220> where<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:18.090> marquice

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it's a situation where you know marquice

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
it's a situation where you know marquice
went<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.409> max<00:01:19.950> came<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.490> did<00:01:20.610> well

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
went out and max came in and did well

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
went out and max came in and did well
and<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> great<00:01:21.630> thing<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.020> us

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and I think that's a great thing for us

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
and I think that's a great thing for us
because<00:01:22.650> we'd<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.850> aggressive<00:01:24.150> with

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
because we'd like to be aggressive with

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 
because we'd like to be aggressive with
our<00:01:24.630> quarterback<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.009> now

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
our quarterback and what we do and now

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310 
our quarterback and what we do and now
we<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.549> we've<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.479> two<00:01:27.689> kids<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.170> are

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
we know that we've got two kids that are

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
we know that we've got two kids that are
capable<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.860> playing<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> mean<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
capable of playing so I mean that's a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.600 
capable of playing so I mean that's a
good<00:01:30.329> good<00:01:30.900> good<00:01:31.200> situation<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
good good good situation to be in and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.569 
good good good situation to be in and
and<00:01:32.850> I'm<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.930> worried<00:01:34.290> about<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.979> near<00:01:35.430> as

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
and I'm not worried about that near as

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.640 
and I'm not worried about that near as
much<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.750> I'm<00:01:36.869> worried<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.500> other

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
much as I'm worried about some other

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
much as I'm worried about some other
