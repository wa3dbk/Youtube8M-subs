factories<00:00:07.140> designs<00:00:07.580> there<00:00:08.580> -<00:00:09.290> you<00:00:10.290> know<00:00:10.670> -

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
factories designs there - you know -

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.740 
factories designs there - you know -
ideas<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.740> basically<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.849> depends<00:00:15.630> on

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
ideas and basically it all depends on

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.260 
ideas and basically it all depends on
what<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.230> want<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.680> now<00:00:17.520> let's<00:00:17.850> cover<00:00:18.029> off

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
what you want to do now let's cover off

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.000 
what you want to do now let's cover off
on<00:00:18.420> what<00:00:18.660> they<00:00:18.779> actually<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.260> before<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.890> get

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
on what they actually are before we get

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.490 
on what they actually are before we get
too<00:00:20.220> far<00:00:20.250> into<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.720> one<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> left<00:00:22.230> is

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
too far into it the one on the left is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.560 
too far into it the one on the left is
expandable<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.269> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
expandable the one on the right is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.429 
expandable the one on the right is
modular<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.980> would<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:26.699> opinion<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
modular that would be my opinion I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
modular that would be my opinion I
always<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:28.740> an<00:00:29.039> expandable<00:00:29.580> Factory

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
always think about an expandable Factory

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.930 
always think about an expandable Factory
as<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.929> finished<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:32.369> could<00:00:32.610> increase

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
as it's not finished you could increase

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.750 
as it's not finished you could increase
the<00:00:33.180> size<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.899> want<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.550> modular<00:00:35.550> one

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the size of it if you want a modular one

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.510 
the size of it if you want a modular one
I<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.079> being<00:00:37.559> complete

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I kind of think of it as being complete

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.190 
I kind of think of it as being complete
and<00:00:38.760> discrete<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.420> itself<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and discrete in itself and if you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
and discrete in itself and if you
plunked<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.620> down<00:00:40.800> again<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:42.030> be

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
plunked it down again it would be

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.350 
plunked it down again it would be
complete<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.750> mind<00:00:45.930> let's

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
complete so with that in mind let's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
complete so with that in mind let's
increase<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.980> expandable

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
increase this one so this is expandable

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.760 
increase this one so this is expandable
but<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> modular<00:00:51.870> expandable<00:00:52.500> design

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but it is a modular expandable design

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.590 
but it is a modular expandable design
this<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> other<00:00:53.910> hand<00:00:54.210> we're<00:00:54.449> going

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this one on the other hand we're going

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
this one on the other hand we're going
to<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.809> building<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.620> know<00:00:55.739> these<00:00:56.430> bad<00:00:56.670> boys

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
to be building you know these bad boys

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
to be building you know these bad boys
off<00:00:57.120> into<00:00:57.420> blue<00:00:57.600> yonder<00:00:57.960> okay<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.039> this

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
off into blue yonder okay just like this

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
off into blue yonder okay just like this
and<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.180> expand<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> design<00:01:01.140> now

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and that's how we expand the design now

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.729 
and that's how we expand the design now
the<00:01:02.219> two<00:01:02.399> differences<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.320> that<00:01:04.320> obviously

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the two differences are that obviously

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.350 
the two differences are that obviously
this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.250> more<00:01:05.850> brute<00:01:06.270> force<00:01:07.250> in<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:09.030> little

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
this is more brute force in in my little

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.929 
this is more brute force in in my little
example<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:11.010> brute<00:01:11.610> force

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
example here there are brute force

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
example here there are brute force
modular<00:01:12.630> designs<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.409> I'm<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> show

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
modular designs and I'm going to show

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.480 
modular designs and I'm going to show
you<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.400> very<00:01:14.670> shortly<00:01:15.380> but<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you one very shortly but I think that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.450 
you one very shortly but I think that
this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.119> these<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:18.960> two<00:01:19.170> ideas<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.040> new

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this is these are two ideas that new

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.440 
this is these are two ideas that new
players<00:01:20.790> don't<00:01:21.090> use<00:01:21.750> enough<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.240> they'll<00:01:24.240> get

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
players don't use enough of they'll get

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.700 
players don't use enough of they'll get
in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> game<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.840> they'll<00:01:25.140> start<00:01:25.350> creating

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
in the game and they'll start creating

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.999 
in the game and they'll start creating
these<00:01:25.860> crazy<00:01:26.220> zany<00:01:26.549> factories<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.360> like

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
these crazy zany factories and it's like

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.410 
these crazy zany factories and it's like
spaghetti<00:01:29.009> everywhere<00:01:29.939> there's<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.299> these

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
spaghetti everywhere there's like these

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.460 
spaghetti everywhere there's like these
little<00:01:30.570> bits<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.900> go<00:01:31.079> around<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.439> circles

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
little bits that go around in circles

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140 
little bits that go around in circles
and<00:01:31.860> around<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.310> circles<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.759> around<00:01:33.030> in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and around in circles and around in

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.590 
and around in circles and around in
circles<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:35.150> then<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> little

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
circles and it's like then the little

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
circles and it's like then the little
player<00:01:36.780> gets<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.590> oh<00:01:37.829> my

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
player gets on it and it's like oh my

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
player gets on it and it's like oh my
god<00:01:38.490> you're<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.790> making<00:01:39.360> things<00:01:39.509> hard<00:01:39.810> on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
god you're just making things hard on

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.499 
god you're just making things hard on
yourself<00:01:42.439> important<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.340> key<00:01:44.790> thing<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
yourself important in the key thing to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.300 
yourself important in the key thing to
remember<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:46.280> factorial<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.450> maps<00:01:48.780> are

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
remember about factorial the maps are

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.960 
remember about factorial the maps are
infinite<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.549> size<00:01:51.860> let<00:01:52.860> me<00:01:52.950> repeat<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
infinite in size let me repeat that the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.990 
infinite in size let me repeat that the
maps<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.780> infinite<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.619> size<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.759> keep

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
maps are infinite in size you can keep

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
maps are infinite in size you can keep
running<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:58.560> keep<00:01:58.740> running<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.310> way

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
running I could keep running this way

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.120 
running I could keep running this way
forever<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.570> had<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.170> computer<00:02:01.649> resources

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
forever if I had the computer resources

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
forever if I had the computer resources
for<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.509> game<00:02:03.869> would<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.320> keep

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
for it and the game would just keep

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.330 
for it and the game would just keep
generating<00:02:06.259> more<00:02:07.259> squares<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.799> me<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.220> know

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
generating more squares for me you know

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.680 
generating more squares for me you know
we<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.910> keep<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.300> you'll<00:02:09.420> notice

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
we would just keep going you'll notice

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.999 
we would just keep going you'll notice
that<00:02:09.810> my<00:02:09.989> map<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.530> kind<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.890> odd

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that my map is actually kind of odd

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.840 
that my map is actually kind of odd
looking<00:02:11.280> right<00:02:11.489> now

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
looking right now

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.550 
looking right now
I've<00:02:12.030> got<00:02:12.210> here<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.020> I've<00:02:13.110> got<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> little

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
I've got here and then I've got a little

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100 
I've got here and then I've got a little
dogleg<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:15.210> actually<00:02:15.600> kind<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.870> looks<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
dogleg and it actually kind of looks a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
dogleg and it actually kind of looks a
little<00:02:16.260> bit<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> shark<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.640> it's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
little bit like a shark I think it's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.560 
little bit like a shark I think it's
like<00:02:17.940> nah<00:02:18.150> anyway<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:20.120> important<00:02:21.120> thing<00:02:21.300> for

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
like nah anyway so important thing for

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.100 
like nah anyway so important thing for
new<00:02:21.720> players<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:23.490> your<00:02:23.940> expandable<00:02:24.780> factory

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
new players get your expandable factory

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.830 
new players get your expandable factory
design<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:27.060> let's<00:02:27.210> go<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.600> look<00:02:27.720> at

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
design on so let's go and have a look at

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.450 
design on so let's go and have a look at
a<00:02:27.870> few<00:02:28.080> different<00:02:28.440> things<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.920> talk<00:02:29.220> about<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
a few different things and talk about a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.500 
a few different things and talk about a
few<00:02:29.760> different<00:02:30.060> ideas

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
few different ideas

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.180 
few different ideas
let<00:02:31.080> me<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.320> deconstruct<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:31.920> first

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
let me just deconstruct this first

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.610 
let me just deconstruct this first
though<00:02:33.620> now<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:36.090> modular<00:02:36.840> design<00:02:37.020> now

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
though now this is a modular design now

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.230 
though now this is a modular design now
it<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> bit<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.400> brute-force<00:02:38.700> design

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
it is a bit of a brute-force design

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.030 
it is a bit of a brute-force design
you'll<00:02:39.690> notice<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.230> has<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.410> large<00:02:40.710> amount

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you'll notice that it has a large amount

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.920 
you'll notice that it has a large amount
of<00:02:41.100> capacity<00:02:42.000> however<00:02:42.210> if<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
of capacity however if I was to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.180 
of capacity however if I was to
blueprint<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.740> stick<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.040> down

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
blueprint this and stick it down

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.530 
blueprint this and stick it down
somewhere<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.790> could

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
somewhere I could

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.190 
somewhere I could
there's<00:02:46.290> my<00:02:46.530> design<00:02:47.810> very<00:02:48.810> very

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
there's my design very very

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.050 
there's my design very very
straightforward<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.520> took<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.790> little<00:02:50.940> bit

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
straightforward and it took a little bit

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.600 
straightforward and it took a little bit
to<00:02:51.270> build<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.320> modular<00:02:53.010> factory

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
to build but it is a modular factory

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.360 
to build but it is a modular factory
it's<00:02:54.150> based<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.630> certain<00:02:55.080> ratios<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.860> example

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
it's based on certain ratios for example

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.780 
it's based on certain ratios for example
this<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.790> all<00:02:56.940> balanced<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.750> works<00:02:57.990> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
this is all balanced so that it works a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.700 
this is all balanced so that it works a
flat<00:02:59.790> out<00:03:00.060> pace<00:03:00.540> provided<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.410> has<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
flat out pace provided it has the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.960 
flat out pace provided it has the
materials<00:03:02.250> same<00:03:03.000> with<00:03:03.180> these<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.970> entire

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
materials same with these the entire

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.930 
materials same with these the entire
thing<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:07.350> pretty<00:03:07.860> well<00:03:08.100> limited<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.790> know

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
thing is is pretty well limited you know

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.960 
thing is is pretty well limited you know
I<00:03:08.970> cannot<00:03:09.510> expand<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.560> without<00:03:11.550> much

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
I cannot expand this without much

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.700 
I cannot expand this without much
difficulty<00:03:12.600> I'd<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.290> plunk<00:03:13.590> down

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
difficulty I'd have to plunk down

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.980 
difficulty I'd have to plunk down
another<00:03:14.190> one<00:03:14.490> now<00:03:15.030> you'll<00:03:15.330> notice<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.780> down

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
another one now you'll notice that down

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.290 
another one now you'll notice that down
here<00:03:16.050> for<00:03:17.010> my<00:03:17.100> blue<00:03:17.340> science<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.060> an

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
here for my blue science I have an

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.500 
here for my blue science I have an
expandable<00:03:18.870> design<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.320> could<00:03:20.420> potentially<00:03:21.420> if

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
expandable design I could potentially if

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.790 
expandable design I could potentially if
there<00:03:21.660> wasn't<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:21.990> in<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> way<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.680> keep

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
there wasn't this in the way just keep

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.680 
there wasn't this in the way just keep
going<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.580> expand<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.150> out<00:03:24.240> this<00:03:24.450> way

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
going with it and expand it out this way

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.850 
going with it and expand it out this way
and<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:27.150> sometimes<00:03:27.540> do<00:03:27.960> depending<00:03:28.650> on

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
and that I I sometimes do depending on

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.940 
and that I I sometimes do depending on
my<00:03:29.190> build<00:03:29.460> you<00:03:29.640> notice<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.150> labs<00:03:30.420> again

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
my build you notice the labs again

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.260 
my build you notice the labs again
expandable<00:03:31.950> if<00:03:32.220> there<00:03:32.520> wasn't<00:03:32.820> things<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.180> the

expandable if there wasn't things in the

expandable if there wasn't things in the
way<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:34.200> expanded<00:03:34.740> them<00:03:34.860> out<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.220> these

way I have expanded them out to these
current<00:03:35.790> things<00:03:36.230> you'll<00:03:37.230> notice<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.680> these

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
current things you'll notice that these

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.340 
current things you'll notice that these
again<00:03:38.490> expandable<00:03:39.270> designs<00:03:39.630> where<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.960> can

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
again expandable designs where I can

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.950 
again expandable designs where I can
continue<00:03:40.800> if<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.430> want<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:42.300> build<00:03:42.510> them<00:03:42.690> in<00:03:42.780> this

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
continue if I want to build them in this

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.810 
continue if I want to build them in this
direction<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.740> one<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.160> same<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.430> could<00:03:44.640> add

another one here and another one here so

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.500 
another one here and another one here so
it's<00:03:47.340> important<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.910> leave<00:03:48.060> yourself<00:03:48.240> the

it's important to leave yourself the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.180 
it's important to leave yourself the
space<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.020> do<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.620> key<00:03:52.860> space

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190

one I reckon we're going to talk about

one I reckon we're going to talk about
efficiency<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.230> a<00:04:52.770> couple<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.220> different

I'm<00:05:00.330> sure<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:00.990> might<00:05:01.140> though<00:05:01.380> because<00:05:01.620> this

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
I'm sure you might though because this

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.560 
I'm sure you might though because this
