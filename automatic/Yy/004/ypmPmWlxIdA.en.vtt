 We do not have not a part of our 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.679
 soho cookies because natural 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.589

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.770

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.369
 cooking already sprinkle sugar 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.210

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.399
 I take one cup of flour all the same 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.680
 taken individually test we must 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.880
 be cool and whichever 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.390
 how much flour will depend on 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.909
 how much will you put there accordingly 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:39.939
 flour and so we begin to prepare our 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:45.060
 berry fruit feast and add here 1 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:50.159
 a teaspoon of incomplete soda or a bag 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 baking powder and accordingly we extinguish 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.520
 our soda i make it lemon juice 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:08.720
 the food is mixed further we add 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.720
 vegetable oil 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 what makes vegetable oil in our 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:22.010
 cookies well gives them the opportunity to be 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:31.700
 so that's sandy and add 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:34.800
 a little flour them pointing Krasin 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.220
 our berry which of course gives such 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:45.720
 I have a gray color there strawberries is it 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.989
 when you burn dough like on pancakes in 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.650
 In this case, we add just dry 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.650
 oatmeal flakes 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.300
 not involved in anything and 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.490
 raisins 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.490
 so it will be easier to understand how much 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.990
 further you need to add more flour 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:16.760
 like i said dough should be cool 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.760
 that is, we must knead by hand 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.230
 chicken due to the content of adding 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.100
 lots of raisins and our oatmeal 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.740
 the dough is quite loose but it 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.310
 only to the benefit because at the expense of 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.150
 this will be our cookie a little bit well 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:55.400
 as usual, the oatmeal is more loose further we 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:04:01.060
 in our dough forming circles that 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.060
 there are balls about the same shape 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.989
 no need to go crazy there 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.379
 smoothness because these are cookies 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:18.389
 just like galette not up to years on and 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.389
 even like oatmeal 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.800
 This cookie is perfect for those who 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:33.190
 fasting 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:39.240
 for those who are on a diet because it is 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:42.639
 such cookies she does not harm your figure 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.460
 I would say even gently cleans especially 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.460
 for breakfast is a cookie with tea itself 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.120
 made our form the same strong paper 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.479
 I do not lubricate it because our 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.960
 cookies from your composition so we have 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.840
 vegetable oil and dough enter 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:13.500
 well enough is not dirty hands 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:13.500
 take our circles and just not on the form 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:24.039
 then I put in a preheated oven to 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:31.000
 200 degrees and I will bake about 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:36.370
 half an hour I want to say that the super stores 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.870
 food honeycomb is now fashion stores such 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:45.099
 cookies aren't expensive enough 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.400
 many say that eating right on 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.380
 really very long 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:57.610
 nothing like the same can be 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:59.440
 make home it will be i think more 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.690
 more useful than some industrial 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.530
 products products industrial 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:14.860
 production especial will benefit 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:19.000

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.880
 put the cookies for half an hour in the heated and 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.849
