when they sell it as a pack or a pair
which<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.630> why<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.810> get<00:04:12.050> my<00:04:12.200> stuff<00:04:12.410> off<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.560> ebay

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
which is why I get my stuff off of ebay

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.810 
which is why I get my stuff off of ebay
because<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.760> mean<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:14.989> see<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:15.920> point<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.400> by

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
because I mean I see the point of by

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.090 
because I mean I see the point of by
like<00:04:17.180> selling<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.870> singles<00:04:18.650> or<00:04:18.799> selling

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.789 
like selling in singles or selling
separately<00:04:19.640> but<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.570> think<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:21.019> addition<00:04:21.440> they

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
separately but I think in addition they

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.800 
separately but I think in addition they
should<00:04:21.979> sell<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.220> as<00:04:22.400> well<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> did<00:04:23.479> sell<00:04:23.630> it<00:04:23.720> as

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
should sell it as well I did sell it as

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.469 
should sell it as well I did sell it as
a<00:04:23.840> pair<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:25.100> it's<00:04:25.490> more<00:04:25.669> expensive<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:26.150> just

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479
