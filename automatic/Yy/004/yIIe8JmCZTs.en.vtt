rotate you know how the screen twist the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.760 
rotate you know how the screen twist the
touchscreen<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.780> everywhere<00:01:19.320> though<00:01:19.500> how

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
touchscreen that's everywhere though how

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.429 
touchscreen that's everywhere though how
do<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> patent<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> that's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
do you patent that so and that's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
do you patent that so and that's
probably<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.979> much<00:01:23.189> better<00:01:23.369> question<00:01:23.939> whether

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
probably a much better question whether

or not they should have been patented is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
or not they should have been patented is
another<00:01:26.790> argument<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.479> were<00:01:27.750> patent

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
another argument but they were patent

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
another argument but they were patent
that<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.320> Apple<00:01:28.560> does<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> rights<00:01:29.310> form

the<00:01:35.670> big<00:01:35.880> case<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.960> Apple<00:01:37.320> versus<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the big case it was Apple versus the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.859 
the big case it was Apple versus the
Galaxy<00:01:38.040> Tab<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> actually<00:01:38.909> let<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.570> ask<00:01:39.750> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
Galaxy Tab and actually let me ask you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
Galaxy Tab and actually let me ask you
Tracy<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> think<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.860> an<00:01:40.950> iPad<00:01:41.310> or

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
Tracy do you think this is an iPad or

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.620 
Tracy do you think this is an iPad or
anything<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.030> Samsung<00:01:42.450> Galaxy<00:01:42.840> Tab<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
anything this is a Samsung Galaxy Tab I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.370 
anything this is a Samsung Galaxy Tab I
think<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.860> pad<00:01:47.899> probably<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.049> you'd<00:01:49.259> be

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
think it's a pad probably so you'd be

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.980 
think it's a pad probably so you'd be
wrong<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> Samsung<00:01:50.880> Galaxy<00:01:51.360> Tab<00:01:51.570> for

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
wrong this is a Samsung Galaxy Tab for

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.420 
wrong this is a Samsung Galaxy Tab for
that<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.259> took<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> look<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:52.680> these<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that so you took a look at these so you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.859 
that so you took a look at these so you
look<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.700> these<00:01:53.790> two<00:01:54.060> next<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> each<00:01:54.390> other<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
look at these two next to each other and

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.319 
look at these two next to each other and
iPad<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.500> Samsung<00:01:56.009> Galaxy<00:01:56.399> Tab<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.969> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
iPad here Samsung Galaxy Tab here you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.550 
iPad here Samsung Galaxy Tab here you
know<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.540> certainly<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:58.020> similarities

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
know there certainly are similarities

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
know there certainly are similarities
between<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.040> designs<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.390> whether<00:02:00.540> or

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
between the two designs so whether or

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.749 
between the two designs so whether or
not<00:02:00.750> Apple<00:02:01.140> has<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.890> legal<00:02:02.250> grounds<00:02:02.640> or

not Apple has you know legal grounds or

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
not Apple has you know legal grounds or
the<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.060> could<00:02:03.180> say<00:02:03.390> well<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.810> else<00:02:04.049> can
