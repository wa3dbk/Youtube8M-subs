00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
people I don't think so I think they had

people I don't think so I think they had
a<00:03:01.230> source<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.860> frustration<00:03:02.099> or<00:03:02.700> anger<00:03:02.879> maybe

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
a source of frustration or anger maybe

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.149 
a source of frustration or anger maybe
it<00:03:03.510> was<00:03:03.629> with<00:03:03.810> themselves<00:03:04.290> or<00:03:04.650> maybe<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.010> was

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
it was with themselves or maybe it was

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.009 
it was with themselves or maybe it was
with<00:03:05.340> their<00:03:05.519> wives<00:03:05.819> or<00:03:06.360> something<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.870> their

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
with their wives or something in their

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.979 
with their wives or something in their
life<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:07.950> were<00:03:08.129> not<00:03:08.720> directing<00:03:09.720> their

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
life that they were not directing their

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.020 
life that they were not directing their
frustration<00:03:10.650> towards<00:03:11.099> so<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.400> result<00:03:11.730> they

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
frustration towards so it result they

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.000 
frustration towards so it result they
came<00:03:12.330> out<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.720> slaves<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.319> almost<00:03:13.830> caused

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
came out on the slaves and almost caused

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.600 
came out on the slaves and almost caused

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
near death for these people and that's

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.399 
near death for these people and that's
another<00:03:17.970> point<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.900> when<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.170> start

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
another point of this is when you start

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.320 
another point of this is when you start
talking<00:03:19.560> behind<00:03:19.890> people's<00:03:20.069> backs<00:03:20.610> you're

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
talking behind people's backs you're

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.030 
talking behind people's backs you're
relieving<00:03:21.599> yourself<00:03:22.050> but<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> lot<00:03:22.379> of<00:03:22.409> times<00:03:22.650> it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
relieving yourself but a lot of times it

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.710 
relieving yourself but a lot of times it
gets<00:03:23.190> worse<00:03:23.430> than<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.700> sometimes<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.569> don't

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
gets worse than that sometimes you don't

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.869 
gets worse than that sometimes you don't
even<00:03:24.989> talk<00:03:25.140> about<00:03:25.470> maybe<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.549> hold<00:03:26.790> it

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
even talk about maybe you just hold it

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.970 
even talk about maybe you just hold it
all<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.780> hold<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.140> all<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.739> point

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
all in you hold it all in to the point

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.710 
all in you hold it all in to the point
where<00:03:29.129> you<00:03:29.340> can't<00:03:29.640> hold<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.450> can't

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
where you can't hold it on you can't

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.000 
where you can't hold it on you can't
hold<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.049> in<00:03:31.230> any<00:03:31.379> longer

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
hold it in any longer

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.580 
hold it in any longer
and<00:03:32.280> maybe<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.120> comes<00:03:33.360> out<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.780> I'm<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.080> huge

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and maybe it comes out so I'm just huge

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.440 
and maybe it comes out so I'm just huge
explosion<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.580> doesn't<00:03:35.879> make<00:03:36.000> any<00:03:36.150> sense

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
explosion and it doesn't make any sense
