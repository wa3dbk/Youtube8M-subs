no<00:01:13.260> there's<00:01:13.590> seven<00:01:13.920> weeks<00:01:14.070> outside<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.760> raise

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
no there's seven weeks outside we raise

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
no there's seven weeks outside we raise
them<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.300> ten<00:01:15.510> weeks<00:01:15.690> old<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> slower

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
them to ten weeks old this is a slower

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.400 
them to ten weeks old this is a slower
growing<00:01:16.890> breeze<00:01:17.810> instead<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> using<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
growing breeze instead of using the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.719

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
neutrons because they don't leave they

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.890 
neutrons because they don't leave they
don't<00:01:22.800> have<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.190> chicken<00:01:23.550> they've<00:01:24.300> really

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
don't have like chicken they've really

don't have like chicken they've really
been<00:01:26.600> bred<00:01:27.600> over<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.990> years<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.740> just

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
been bred over the years to really just

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.680 
been bred over the years to really just
produce<00:01:29.340> meat<00:01:29.610> fast<00:01:29.910> they'll<00:01:30.330> they'll

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690

one<00:02:34.879> thing<00:02:35.120> about<00:02:35.150> meat<00:02:35.750> birds<00:02:36.019> is<00:02:36.530> they<00:02:37.390> they

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
one thing about meat birds is they they

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.179 
one thing about meat birds is they they
their<00:02:39.230> home<00:02:39.409> great<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:39.829> they're<00:02:39.980> fast

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
their home great because they're fast

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.559 
their home great because they're fast
growing<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:40.730> they're<00:02:40.849> always<00:02:41.000> hungry<00:02:41.450> I

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
growing so they're always hungry I

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.619 
growing so they're always hungry I
actually<00:02:42.430> weigh<00:02:43.430> out<00:02:43.609> their<00:02:43.849> food<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.420> give

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
them a certain amount every day so they

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.849 
them a certain amount every day so they
don't<00:02:46.430> grow<00:02:47.299> too<00:02:47.359> fast<00:02:47.689> I<00:02:47.930> sort<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.260> purposely
