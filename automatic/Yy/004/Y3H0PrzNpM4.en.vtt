as I said and mine my gas tank in the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.639 
as I said and mine my gas tank in the
trunk<00:00:04.350> so<00:00:05.600> this<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.779> where<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.230> start<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.529> see

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
trunk so this is where you start to see

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.919 
trunk so this is where you start to see
some<00:00:07.830> differences<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.760> Sina<00:00:09.090> Citroen

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
some differences on the Sina Citroen

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.930 
some differences on the Sina Citroen
porters<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.469> North<00:00:10.830> America<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> CXA

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
porters of North America and the CXA

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.189 
porters of North America and the CXA
cars<00:00:12.889> cxa<00:00:13.889> had<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> custom<00:00:14.940> bumper<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:16.049> they

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
cars cxa had a custom bumper that they

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.700 
cars cxa had a custom bumper that they
created<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.920> they<00:00:17.670> strengthened<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:19.560> back

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
created and they strengthened the back

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.519 
created and they strengthened the back
of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> car<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> bumper<00:00:21.050> versus<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
of the car with the bumper versus the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.500 
of the car with the bumper versus the
process<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.369> seemed<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.910> use<00:00:24.060> which<00:00:24.300> was

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
process that seemed to use which was

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.660 
process that seemed to use which was
lopping<00:00:24.900> off<00:00:25.050> ten<00:00:25.830> gallons<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.250> gas<00:00:26.400> tank

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
lopping off ten gallons of the gas tank

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.589 
lopping off ten gallons of the gas tank
so<00:00:27.260> what<00:00:28.260> happened<00:00:28.730> because<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.269> Cena

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
so what happened because of that is Cena

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.450 
so what happened because of that is Cena
had<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.550> put<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.840> filler<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.170> cut<00:00:34.890> into<00:00:35.219> about

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
had to put a filler that cut into about

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.639 
had to put a filler that cut into about
here<00:00:36.559> yeah<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.890> could<00:00:38.040> fill<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> gas<00:00:38.550> tank

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
here yeah so you could fill the gas tank

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.700 
here yeah so you could fill the gas tank
not<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> best<00:00:41.010> approach<00:00:41.430> my<00:00:41.790> opinion<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
not the best approach my opinion but you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.270 
not the best approach my opinion but you
know<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.010> works<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.809> now<00:00:45.809> right<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> most

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
know it works so now right here on most

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
know it works so now right here on most
C<00:00:47.430> X's<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.539> solid<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.829> where<00:00:50.100> CX<00:00:51.059> a

C X's is solid and this is where CX a

cut<00:00:51.870> into<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> sheet<00:00:52.350> metal<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.899> get<00:00:54.899> some

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
cut into the sheet metal and get some

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
cut into the sheet metal and get some
rest<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.520> what<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.610> ended<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.850> doing

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
rest right here what they ended up doing

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
rest right here what they ended up doing
is<00:00:59.359> this<00:01:00.359> bracket<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.620> was

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
is this bracket right here there was

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.390 
is this bracket right here there was
some<00:01:01.949> pretty<00:01:02.940> thick<00:01:03.420> iron<00:01:04.100> they<00:01:05.100> built<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
some pretty thick iron they built a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
some pretty thick iron they built a
bumper<00:01:05.670> assembly<00:01:05.790> which<00:01:06.270> I'll<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:06.869> later

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
bumper assembly which I'll show later

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.790 
bumper assembly which I'll show later
and<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.300> special<00:01:09.630> mountings<00:01:10.050> they

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
and and some special mountings they

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.680 
and and some special mountings they
bolted<00:01:11.190> right<00:01:11.220> into<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> would

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
bolted right into here so that would

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.030 
bolted right into here so that would
help<00:01:12.810> sort<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.640> any<00:01:14.640> rear-end<00:01:15.090> crashes<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
help sort of any rear-end crashes so you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.520 
help sort of any rear-end crashes so you
can<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> 415<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.810> I've<00:01:18.900> applied<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.260> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
can see the 415 that I've applied to the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.530 
can see the 415 that I've applied to the
bottom<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:21.060> trunk

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
bottom of the trunk

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.530 
bottom of the trunk
and<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:23.040> makeshift<00:01:23.790> gas<00:01:24.000> tank<00:01:24.300> for

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and there's my makeshift gas tank for

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
and there's my makeshift gas tank for
the<00:01:24.710> time<00:01:25.710> being<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:28.880> looks<00:01:29.880> pretty<00:01:30.150> good<00:01:30.330> I'm

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the time being so looks pretty good I'm

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
the time being so looks pretty good I'm
gonna<00:01:30.570> put<00:01:30.660> another<00:01:30.750> coat<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.500> because<00:01:31.860> for

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
gonna put another coat on it because for

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969 
gonna put another coat on it because for
some<00:01:32.250> reason<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.729> black<00:01:32.940> 415<00:01:33.750> did<00:01:34.050> not<00:01:34.259> spread

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
some reason the black 415 did not spread

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.780 
some reason the black 415 did not spread
as<00:01:35.130> well<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> thought<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> would<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:37.790> I've

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
as well as I thought it would and I've

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.180 
as well as I thought it would and I've
been<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:39.900> happy<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> clear<00:01:40.590> pour<00:01:40.800> 15

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
been very happy with the clear pour 15

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.139 
been very happy with the clear pour 15
but<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.759> reason<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:43.800> black<00:01:44.369> version<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
but for some reason the black version I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.910 
but for some reason the black version I
don't<00:01:45.450> know

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
don't know

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.469 
don't know
and<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.840> smooth<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:50.580> spread<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> clear

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and not as smooth to spread as the clear

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.720 
and not as smooth to spread as the clear
version
