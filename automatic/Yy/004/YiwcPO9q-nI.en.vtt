00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 welcome you to our channel like me and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.019
 I promised to do a small such express 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.460
 review how to combine both 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.880
 jabba palace is combined 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.650
 and Larantier's logo is the only place where 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.590
 it is mentioned that their set 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 combined this on the box with the den 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.650
 rancor here we see these two 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.150
 set they are complementary and you can 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 put jabba palace taxed like this and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.340
 it was in the film the more they are for it not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.190
 I saw no instructions in the manual 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 whether it was in the catalog or not whole 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 this building looks like this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.450
 say as a gift would be put in excess of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.789
 rancor lair tower to from the palace she 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 clings and stand somewhere near then 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.260
 perhaps the only minus of all these 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 combinations that the tower is next to the data 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.820
 Palace looks but in general she does not 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.719
 looks himself looks ridiculous from everyone 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.719
 sides then it looks like this 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.600
 You can of course the tower on the pin and with 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 click back volcano u taku 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.610
 rises to the fun of the air can 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.600
 of course here and there you will do 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.600
 a little bit on our bottom of the set 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 at the same time the set is put very simply 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.570
 here but the same parts set tax rank 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:52.750
 raisa such bow 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:55.760
 Jabba's palace bevels have a hole 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.080
 which is directly on these bevels and placed with 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.180
 do not attach anything just 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.130
 put the very top and everything if you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.320
 lucky and you have both of these sets then 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.380
 Of course the number of possibilities for the game 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.850
 you increase because immediately 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.100
 it becomes clear why you hatch 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.230
 which opens when set palace 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.240
 jabba is standing on the table there for some 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.230
 surface open this hatch nothing 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.540
 the device is now played a scene from 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.470
 film you can put here like u 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.110
 it was a movie 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:37.370
 actually opens the hatch and she falls 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:42.770
 falls right into the prank den again 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.800
 falls and he comes it eats like 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.830
 I already said in the review with rancor to it 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.320
 no figures fit in with too much 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.650
 big hair and can be served food 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.560
 also fit well, just like films 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.400
 he didn't even have time to play the scene 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.530
 when hatch skywalker comes jabber 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.170
 tell him that he is not a pro 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.930
 should return plus when you two set 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.720
 you do both of these by telling them c 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.209
 so when Jabba removed Lockers 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.239
 somehow not both fell right into the lair 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.180
 crane tara further if he himself moved 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.260
 what to look at this whole thing and here already 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.310
 comes into play 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.680
 our monster is mad the door opens 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.200
 here it is further 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.480
 deal with them with all failing 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.889
 the sum of these two sets I want to say 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.139
 what 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.879
 combine it is great and palace 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.319
 Jabba same rancor lair does not look 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.389
 so sad 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.370
 minifigure with minifigure for building 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.819
 also good that looked interesting without 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.920
 the palace doesnâ€™t look like that 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.560
 now the palace itself makes sense 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.980
 and the palace when he stands on lo guarantee 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.329
 also looks different because 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.299
 same here opening hatch to 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.040
 all sorts of heroes fall down 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.540
 he already has some meaning because 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.329
 find stands on the surface from this 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.669
 there is no sense at all and in general 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.959
 it looks good i will like me 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:17.539
 I liked the only thing missing 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.530
 I'm thinking of 1000 heroes c-3po r22 landau 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.560
 Kolodishchi 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.320
 bread gold bikini all these heroes they 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.050
 there are other sets but there are also at sea 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.010
 with the ship of the toad, lando is a set 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.550
 desert skiff 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.729
 c3 sang r2 d2 is in the set of escape 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.949
 droids even java ships 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.499
 two also have brought together all these five set 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.210
 you get all the characters of all 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.740
 actors first sixth part 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.620
 star wars 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.169
 spears review finished you can see 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.729
 video review of a separate like palace 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.650
 jabba before the overs like spots on our 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.029
 channel subscribe to nothing 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.050
 we still have a lot to miss 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.330
 interesting 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.550
 as I said what to do show 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.770
