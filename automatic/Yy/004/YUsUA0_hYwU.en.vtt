00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.529
 the place of all the viewers got to me 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.179
 deepcool fan 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.900
 red with red backlight 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.690
 stand in jigging already familiar bubbles 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 air under the sticker as in the previous 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.630
 fans characteristics issues 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.099
 approximately 1300 turns at 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 12 volt airflow 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:44.700
 average of these materials screws 4 pieces 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:49.280
 matching connection by 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.399
 three pin connector or mallix a 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.760
 cable length is now trying on 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.760
 to cheat 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.409
 30 centimeters cable length is straight 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 let's say 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.530
 quite a bit behind a creepy look 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.000
 sticker note if you put on 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.009
 I had to blow the same paint 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.009
 otherwise they were noticeable on the dark body 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.830
 Well, let's finally look like 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830
 backlight looks 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.579
 in the light 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.990
 well and in dim lighting 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.090
 here is the price tag from which we are with everything 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.189
 it's impossible to get rid of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.950
 says the backlight responds to 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:32.640
 ultraviolet I have such here 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.640
 ultraviolet shoe dryers 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.879
 let's see if this is true 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.160
 not 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.600
 still no 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.329
 I don't know what was going to happen 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.329
 maybe nothing 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.120
 but something no reaction okay hope 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.569
 this video has been helpful to you 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.569
 good luck
