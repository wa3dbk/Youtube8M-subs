00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.540 
difference is normally press the seam
open<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:16.670> hem<00:01:16.909> allowance<00:01:17.149> will<00:01:17.509> be<00:01:17.590> 5/8<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.520> I

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
open the hem allowance will be 5/8 so I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.779 
open the hem allowance will be 5/8 so I
want<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.360> press<00:01:21.460> 5/8<00:01:22.460> all<00:01:23.060> around<00:01:24.670> for<00:01:25.670> the

want you to press 5/8 all around for the

want you to press 5/8 all around for the
hand<00:01:26.049> working<00:01:27.049> on<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.259> crease<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.860> going<00:01:28.069> to<00:01:28.130> be

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
hand working on a crease is going to be

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.660 
hand working on a crease is going to be
so<00:01:28.460> much<00:01:28.580> easier<00:01:29.030> than<00:01:29.179> just<00:01:29.539> holding<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.259> back

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
so much easier than just holding it back

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.539 
so much easier than just holding it back
all<00:01:31.670> right<00:01:32.170> then<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:33.500> want<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.069> work<00:01:34.250> with

all right then I want you to work with

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.419 
all right then I want you to work with
this<00:01:34.759> right<00:01:35.630> sides<00:01:36.289> out<00:01:37.780> looking<00:01:38.780> at<00:01:38.929> the

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
this right sides out looking at the

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.870 
this right sides out looking at the
outside<00:01:40.429> of<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.880> fabric<00:01:41.950> I'm<00:01:42.950> gonna<00:01:43.130> dig<00:01:43.490> zags

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
outside of the fabric I'm gonna dig zags

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.600 
outside of the fabric I'm gonna dig zags
and<00:01:44.780> it's<00:01:45.170> going<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.350> be<00:01:45.500> until<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.159> zig<00:01:46.369> zag

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
and it's going to be until the zig zag

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.270 
and it's going to be until the zig zag
on<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.299> fabric<00:01:47.690> off<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.200> fabric<00:01:48.619> on<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:49.100> fact

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
on the fabric off the fabric on the fact

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.950 
on the fabric off the fabric on the fact
just<00:01:49.430> like<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.579> surge<00:01:49.909> Commission<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.750> going<00:01:50.869> to

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
just like a surge Commission is going to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.469 
just like a surge Commission is going to
do<00:01:51.079> that<00:01:51.289> then<00:01:51.950> sets<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.579> stitch<00:01:52.850> lengths<00:01:53.210> at

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
do that then sets of stitch lengths at

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.469 
do that then sets of stitch lengths at
half<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.140> millimeter<00:01:54.850> stitch<00:01:55.850> width<00:01:56.240> of

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
half a millimeter stitch width of

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.020 
half a millimeter stitch width of
between<00:01:56.719> two<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.380> three<00:01:57.619> around<00:01:58.250> there<00:01:58.520> okay

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030

because I want this conference to still
slightly<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.310> back<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
slightly to the back so that's the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.710 
slightly to the back so that's the
bottom<00:02:18.470> tension<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.579> know<00:02:19.609> doesn't<00:02:20.120> show<00:02:20.510> in

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
the front when you're using matching

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.699 
the front when you're using matching
thread<00:02:22.760> it's<00:02:23.329> even<00:02:23.660> easier<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.200> work<00:02:24.320> with<00:02:24.380> but

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
thread it's even easier to work with but

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.789 
thread it's even easier to work with but
when<00:02:24.859> you're<00:02:25.010> working<00:02:25.459> with<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:27.260> contrast

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
when you're working with the contrast

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:28.700 
when you're working with the contrast
thread<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.370> an

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
thread like an

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.060 
thread like an
okay<00:02:28.830> here<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.370> want<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.150> top<00:02:30.360> thread<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.410> go

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
okay here you want the top thread to go

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.180 
okay here you want the top thread to go
around<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.420> back<00:02:33.630> thread<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.860> just

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
around and then the back thread to just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.460 
around and then the back thread to just
like<00:02:35.430> beating<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.880> show<00:02:36.230> okay<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.290> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
like beating out the show okay so you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.560 
like beating out the show okay so you
loosen<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.190> top<00:02:38.400> tension<00:02:38.730> when<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.210> do<00:02:39.360> this

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
loosen the top tension when you do this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.960 
loosen the top tension when you do this
you're<00:02:40.350> always<00:02:40.560> looking<00:02:41.070> at<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.490> correct

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
you're always looking at the correct

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.750 
you're always looking at the correct
side<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.050> fabric<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.190> it's<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> be

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
side of the fabric so it's going to be

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.820 
side of the fabric so it's going to be
always<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> pretty<00:02:45.450> size<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.590> make<00:02:46.710> it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
always a pretty size so you can make it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.190 
always a pretty size so you can make it
prettier<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.570> tell<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:49.020> I'm

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
prettier you know I can tell if I'm

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.840 
prettier you know I can tell if I'm
going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.470> use<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.040> wrong<00:02:50.220> side<00:02:50.490> because<00:02:50.580> it's

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
going to use the wrong side because it's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.800 
going to use the wrong side because it's
the<00:02:50.970> pretty<00:02:51.210> side<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:53.040> know<00:02:53.240> so<00:02:54.240> when

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the pretty side and you know so when

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.880 
the pretty side and you know so when
you're<00:02:54.930> looking<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.290> something<00:02:55.500> working

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
you're looking at something working

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.620 
you're looking at something working
really<00:02:56.070> well<00:02:56.220> you're<00:02:56.880> probably<00:02:57.000> working<00:02:57.360> on

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
really well you're probably working on

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.830 
really well you're probably working on
the<00:03:00.620> top<00:03:01.620> don't<00:03:02.610> loosen<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.120> top<00:03:03.270> tension<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the top don't loosen the top tension to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.520 
the top don't loosen the top tension to
the<00:03:03.930> point<00:03:04.200> where<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.860> lose<00:03:05.100> your<00:03:05.160> bottom
