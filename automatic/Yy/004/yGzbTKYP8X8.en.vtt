00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.380 
becomes much more amplified also
whenever<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.709> a<00:02:07.740> line<00:02:08.099> whenever<00:02:08.970> there's

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
whenever we have a line whenever there's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.999 
whenever we have a line whenever there's
an<00:02:09.509> undulation<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.379> becomes<00:02:10.799> more

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
an undulation and it becomes more

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.039 
an undulation and it becomes more
dramatic<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.670> tends<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> bend<00:02:12.329> and<00:02:12.569> bow<00:02:12.690> even

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
dramatic it tends to bend and bow even

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.780 
dramatic it tends to bend and bow even
over<00:02:13.260> delicate<00:02:13.680> curves<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.250> helps<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.670> lot

over delicate curves which helps a lot

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
over delicate curves which helps a lot

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
when we have a delicate bust we want to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.839 
when we have a delicate bust we want to
serve<00:02:57.419> it<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.690> one<00:02:58.049> uninterrupted<00:02:58.829> course<00:02:59.370> we

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
serve it in one uninterrupted course we

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.400 
serve it in one uninterrupted course we
can<00:03:00.030> take<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.329> collar<00:03:00.569> up<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:00.989> high<00:03:01.230> as<00:03:01.260> we

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
can take the collar up as high as we

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.009 
can take the collar up as high as we
want<00:03:01.700> because<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.269> doesn't<00:03:03.690> need<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.959> be

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
want because it doesn't need to be

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.289 
want because it doesn't need to be
broken<00:03:04.290> into<00:03:04.560> portions<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.340> entrees<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
broken into portions and entrees and

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.080 
broken into portions and entrees and
appetizers<00:03:06.419> it's<00:03:07.349> one<00:03:07.709> tiny<00:03:08.220> meal<00:03:08.549> all<00:03:08.819> in

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
appetizers it's one tiny meal all in

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.479 
appetizers it's one tiny meal all in
itself<00:03:09.450> we've<00:03:09.870> also<00:03:10.139> added<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.709> layer<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.220> top

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
itself we've also added a layer on top

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.039 
itself we've also added a layer on top
of<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.030> layering<00:03:12.299> is<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.660> really

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
of this and layering is a really

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.620 
of this and layering is a really
important<00:03:13.530> way<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.859> add<00:03:14.430> some<00:03:15.000> bulk<00:03:15.389> and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
important way to add some bulk and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.039 
important way to add some bulk and
presence<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.769> tiny<00:03:17.190> frame<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:18.049> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
presence to a tiny frame and the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.690 
presence to a tiny frame and the
important<00:03:19.470> thing<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.919> that<00:03:19.950> each<00:03:20.370> layer

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
important thing is is that each layer

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000 
important thing is is that each layer
fits<00:03:21.150> properly<00:03:21.480> when<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:22.380> do<00:03:22.530> clothes<00:03:22.829> that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
fits properly when we do clothes that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.830 
fits properly when we do clothes that
are<00:03:23.099> too<00:03:23.130> big<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.819> just<00:03:24.060> ends<00:03:24.269> up<00:03:24.359> looking<00:03:24.510> like

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
are too big it just ends up looking like

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.900 
are too big it just ends up looking like
you<00:03:25.049> got<00:03:25.230> shrunk<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.680> wash<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.549> we<00:03:26.639> want<00:03:26.819> to

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
you got shrunk in the wash so we want to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.069 
you got shrunk in the wash so we want to
make<00:03:27.030> sure<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.389> each<00:03:27.630> layer<00:03:27.930> is

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
make sure that each layer is

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.629 
make sure that each layer is
appropriately<00:03:28.620> fitted<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.190> then<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.489> adds

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
appropriately fitted and then it adds

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.699 
appropriately fitted and then it adds
some<00:03:29.880> nice<00:03:30.060> texture<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.750> interest<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.530> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
some nice texture and interest to the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.009 
some nice texture and interest to the
body<00:03:31.919> one<00:03:32.639> detail<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.209> you'll<00:03:33.450> notice<00:03:33.660> here

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
body one detail that you'll notice here

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.050 
body one detail that you'll notice here
is<00:03:34.079> we<00:03:34.230> have<00:03:34.260> added<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.769> belt<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.639> important

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
is we have added a belt the important

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.490 
is we have added a belt the important
thing<00:03:36.180> about<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.540> belt<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.319> in

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
thing about this belt is it's in

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.710 
thing about this belt is it's in
proportion<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.069> her<00:03:38.250> figures<00:03:38.579> she<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.150> tiny

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
proportion to her figures she is tiny

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.349 
proportion to her figures she is tiny
therefore<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.500> belt<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.919> tiny<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.489> we're

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
therefore the belt is tiny and we're

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.240 
therefore the belt is tiny and we're
also<00:03:42.510> creating<00:03:42.870> we're<00:03:43.379> drawing<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.829> waist<00:03:44.040> so

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
also creating we're drawing a waist so

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.969 
also creating we're drawing a waist so
automatically<00:03:44.940> we<00:03:45.599> say<00:03:45.840> well<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.590> course<00:03:46.859> she

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
automatically we say well of course she

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.830 
automatically we say well of course she
has<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> waist<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.639> can<00:03:47.910> see<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.299> it's<00:03:48.449> drawn

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
has a waist I can see it it's drawn

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.599 
has a waist I can see it it's drawn
right<00:03:49.139> there<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:49.709> me<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:50.009> makes<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.400> really

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
right there for me it makes it really

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.050 
right there for me it makes it really
easy

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
easy

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.970 
easy
