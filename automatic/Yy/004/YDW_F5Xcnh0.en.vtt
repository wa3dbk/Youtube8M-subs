00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.550
 brother worked from cloud one for 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.110
 some years when we lived in new 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.929
 york 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:14.579
 he disappeared and left some of his 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.820
 tapes back until that day I did not have 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:21.600
 courage to watch my mother 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 I would let her leave for work 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.700
 a few minutes after she left the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 idea to climb up to a large room 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.140
 abandoned my brother I'm mine 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 head 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.510
 I walked to the next flight of stairs that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.450
 They were in a dark hallway or to the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 end and stops facing the door 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.640
 nervous what could happen to open the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.800
 door that there was a military parade in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.840
 shock 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.690
 a pile of bodies of various animals 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.010
 Now a tape marked not 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.340
 watch 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.739
 I did not even see the tape down and put it on the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.690
 our video cassette 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.020
 When I saw the tape started with a 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.810
 episode like a sponge square pants 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.009
 main believers were normal 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.520
 except for music 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.490
 changing tones a few times when 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.369
 played on the ocean floor though a 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.740
 sponge do not leave your neighborhood xaxim 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.590
 throughout the sequence announced the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.119
 Strange I could not understand what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.190
 he said but it looked like 11 of the death was 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.570
 coming 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.340
 I do not have to say I was kind of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.440
 scared to have heard here Sunday 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.060
 Such an innocent drawing in the opening 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.560
 they are over and the title has appeared 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.100
 he would say the surprise visitor 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.049
 when the episode started there was a sound 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.850
 of static in the background a little bit 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.039
 distortion 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.289
 the episode usually began a 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.380
 normal and cheerful sponge 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.780
 the beginning shows which sponge to walk 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.189
 on a road a strange music of 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.670
 in the background the camera focuses on the 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.459
 a sponge in blood coming out of his 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.330
 eyes and holes in your teeth 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.860
 the camera comes closer and does not go down 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.180
 to the mouth 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.989
 bob says something but it's inaudible 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.989
 however highlights the fund after this 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.840
 scene is the sponge bob near the means 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.660
 according to the sign of thighs would not be 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.860
 cascudo is broken in half with 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.680
 Little blood things on the thigh 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.470
 soon we enter live a circle with all 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.080
 the inhabitants of the bikini crevice 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.150
 obs sits in the middle of the circle 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.870
 So, things start to get 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.670
 really disturbing sponge bob 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.900
 people in the circle began to study a 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.660
 strange poem that said I'm going to leave 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.970
 to clean the patio of spring 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.030
 I'll just stop to sweep the sheets. 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.110
 away and wait to turn water 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.130
 clear I may not have gone there 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.540
 So long if you come too. 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.650
 I'm going out to get the little one. 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.870
 calf standing with his mother 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.080
 he is so young he staggers 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.560
 controlling with the tongue should not have 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.660
 I read all the time you come too. 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.080
 all respect even with her more or 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.720
 least five months before overturning and 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.160
 possibly dead there are cameras there you 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.260
 it gets dark for a dirty street 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.360
 We have a strange disguise sitting with 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.720
 the knees on the head 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.470
 circulates around the rose pocket full of 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.160
 gray poetry to ashes 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.290
 we all fall into the shape of fado 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.410
 stand up and walk the road 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.220
 the animation is scary at this point is 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.810
 a very loud and strange sound playing 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.590
 while strange figure comes more 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.290
 near the camera, film your face 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.350
 of my mother almost completely 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.490
 decomposed 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.430
 the body said just wait until you get 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:26.940
 at that moment I was really 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.670
 frightened by my mother for me my 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.280
 mother was still out to work and 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.490
 I was at home 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.180
 the episode is over and I just tried it 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.610
 crying uncontrollably heard lock 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.180
 the door and then the strange voices 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.850
 planting from the region the poem I'm going to leave 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.250
 to clear the pace for spring 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.270
 I'll just stop to sweep the sheets. 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.870
 away and wait to see the water 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.760
 Clear I can I should not have gone 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.110
 So long you come too. 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.470
 I'm going out to get the little one. 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.340
 calf that is standing with his mother he is 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.210
 so young he staggers when the lambda 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.630
 with his tongue and should not have come 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.630
 so long 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.790
 this episode request of Sponge Bob is 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.120
 liked neither a favorite for 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.030
 help in spreading the channel video 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:39.350
 but stories have seen people 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.350
 wait, hold on to God in the nightmares
