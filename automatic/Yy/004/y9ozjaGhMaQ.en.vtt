00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.270
 But 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 That's 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.520
 I did this time 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.540
 The US Congress is a prefectural road that retires at the Board meeting on 14th 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.890

 We will consider in the notice of the piano concert 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.390
 However, performers introduce us because we can talk a few times 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.920
 Though I did it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.689
 Here are the kids who bought at &amp; 5 at the same store 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.060
 Mr. Goto, as it is for Father and Father's Day

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.430
 Something bargain 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 If one can legally enter into consideration 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.350

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.519
 I set up a place like this 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.079
 Still, the concessionaire is playing piano flute as it is 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.079
 For example you can 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.619
