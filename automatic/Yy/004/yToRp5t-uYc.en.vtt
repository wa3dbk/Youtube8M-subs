00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.450
 Series first part 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.900
 Shrug your shoulders showing how to create your own 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200
 over the console of Valve 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.610
 but it would have to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.350
 to be expected otherwise 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.320
 Turn on Credit Suisse 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.450
 so he does the following 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.940
 the console 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 There are two options once 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.900
 both are worried about the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900
 Zombies and super infection will 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.390
 judge 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990
 this year, there are more dimensions in that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.130
 CL 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 Count and yours 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 Gloor Shadow texture but Scottish previously entered 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.350
 I know where must be with percent before that 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.720
 SM it was 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 the Orscheler texture 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.209
 so we kick and will not believe them 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.259
 Spiegelberg in handguns 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.669
 so 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.669
 advertise 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.399
 all brought it to be shipped wrapped which is weapon 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.709
 So, for example, in Germany car works the send because of it 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.119
 Congo could do that too 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.029
 Percent a burlesque the sound 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.739
 right on top 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.849
 here 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.489
 Peter Nieß belonged 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.489
 seen the loans Stiebel 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.849
 or just individually 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 now turn squint Rambos 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.209
 why CLP Ocelot 6 2 0 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.290
 instead plays 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.429
 SM before that 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.199
 Example, if the bon mot do Burkart so synonymous 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.039
 SID St so prefers 1 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.789
 and further behind this 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.789
 c percent take the researchers there XTO 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.429
 minster-Wolbeck 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:26.309
 actually there was where k 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.309
 that's why they have the jockey 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.309
 what will become known by itself 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.169
 and there are controls 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.169
 the Smoke Robert Schauer through 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.279
 so 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.449
 Würzburg I should not post 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.769
 there what notes 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.109
 so you have to carry yourself 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.549
 where fall is solving I am so shit I wish to get ahead 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.049
 and so Moonwalk got involved 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.069
 Würzburg's a lot of fun 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.069
 otherwise 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.599
 as I always say so beautiful 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.309
 frequently 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:19.569
 is spoken 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.379
 and I'll say 4
