on a mala vida now this actually has a
little<00:01:17.659> bit<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:17.899> suspension<00:01:18.709> in<00:01:18.889> it<00:01:19.009> as<00:01:19.189> well

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
little bit of suspension in it as well

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.190 
little bit of suspension in it as well
you'll<00:01:19.819> see<00:01:19.999> like<00:01:20.179> the<00:01:20.329> green<00:01:20.600> bars<00:01:20.929> there

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200

you'll see like the green bars there
those<00:01:21.590> kind<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.829> act<00:01:22.069> as<00:01:22.329> suspension<00:01:23.329> or

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
those kind of act as suspension or

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.419 
those kind of act as suspension or
springs<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.079> this<00:01:24.590> acts<00:01:24.889> just<00:01:25.069> like<00:01:25.249> the

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
springs and this acts just like the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.699 
springs and this acts just like the
normal<00:01:25.639> hammock<00:01:26.329> so<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:26.569> you<00:01:27.079> have<00:01:27.289> like<00:01:27.529> a

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:27.709 
normal hammock so you you have like a

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.239 
normal hammock so you you have like a
groupie<00:01:28.310> feel<00:01:28.609> on<00:01:28.850> your<00:01:29.119> high<00:01:29.359> back<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.249> bit

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
of suspension as well to reduce the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.089 
of suspension as well to reduce the
amount<00:01:32.959> of<00:01:33.049> vibrations<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.679> get<00:01:33.859> when<00:01:34.009> you're

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
amount of vibrations you get when you're

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
drastically reduced in size and in way

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.510 
drastically reduced in size and in way
this<00:01:41.779> is<00:01:41.899> all<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.200> course<00:01:42.679> they<00:01:42.799> react<00:01:43.159> strap

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
this is all of course they react strap

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.389 
this is all of course they react strap
it's<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:43.819> super<00:01:44.060> thin<00:01:44.420> 3d<00:01:45.200> molded<00:01:45.469> strap<00:01:46.159> with
