fine as good as it gives an or near
enough<00:00:22.160> anyway<00:00:22.869> one<00:00:23.869> of<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.020> things<00:00:24.200> that

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
enough anyway one of the things that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.189 
enough anyway one of the things that
came<00:00:24.500> back<00:00:24.650> is<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:26.060> do<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.210> comparison<00:00:26.780> of<00:00:27.020> an

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
came back is to do a comparison of an

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.750 
came back is to do a comparison of an
Epiphone<00:00:27.500> burst<00:00:27.800> buckles<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.310> give<00:00:28.580> some<00:00:28.730> of

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
Epiphone burst buckles and give some of

Epiphone burst buckles and give some of
the<00:00:28.910> time<00:00:29.060> pickups<00:00:29.390> in<00:00:29.510> it<00:00:29.600> as<00:00:29.690> well

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
the time pickups in it as well

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.829 
the time pickups in it as well
so<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:30.590> is<00:00:30.710> what<00:00:30.830> done<00:00:31.010> fits<00:00:31.250> take<00:00:31.719> for<00:00:32.719> those

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:32.839 
so this is what done fits take for those

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.139 
so this is what done fits take for those
that<00:00:33.079> have<00:00:33.230> asked<00:00:33.679> these<00:00:33.949> are<00:00:34.280> burst<00:00:34.789> buckle

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
that have asked these are burst buckle

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.939 
that have asked these are burst buckle
one<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:35.539> two<00:00:35.780> in<00:00:36.019> bridge<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.710> neck

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
one and two in bridge and neck

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.329 
one and two in bridge and neck
respective<00:00:38.079> so<00:00:39.079> this<00:00:39.409> isn't<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.890> blind

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
respective so this isn't a blind

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.160 
respective so this isn't a blind
comparison<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.030> is<00:00:41.089> just<00:00:41.359> a<00:00:41.479> straight<00:00:41.749> up<00:00:41.780> a

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
comparison this is just a straight up a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.879 
comparison this is just a straight up a
be<00:00:42.729> so<00:00:43.729> have<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.149> watch<00:00:44.390> have<00:00:44.659> a<00:00:44.690> listen<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.199> see

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:45.889 
be so have a watch have a listen and see

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:47.590 
be so have a watch have a listen and see

pickups<00:00:47.989> out<00:00:48.109> and<00:00:49.010> make<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.429> Epiphone<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.179> more

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
pickups out and make the Epiphone a more

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:20.750 
pickups out and make the Epiphone a more
desirable<00:00:51.170> cheaper<00:00:51.829> option<00:00:52.159> thanks<00:00:53.089> much
