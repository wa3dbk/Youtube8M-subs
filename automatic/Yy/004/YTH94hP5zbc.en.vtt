00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.780

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.609

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.079

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:44.970

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.340

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.700
 that there was more powerful but good face 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:59.970

 choose for a career or really be 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.150

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.260
 car they were called then wagon tuned 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.780
