00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
actually to make sure and we worked with

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.639

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
what I was looking for is a new kitchen

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
what I was looking for is a new kitchen
that<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.960> clean<00:00:46.289> bright

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that had a a really sort of clean bright

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.639 
that had a a really sort of clean bright
feel<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> wanted<00:00:48.170> industrial<00:00:49.170> kit<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
feel so I wanted industrial kit but I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
feel so I wanted industrial kit but I
didn't<00:00:49.860> want<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> feel<00:00:51.199> industrial<00:00:52.199> if

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
didn't want it to feel industrial if

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.720 
didn't want it to feel industrial if
that<00:00:52.440> makes<00:00:52.860> any<00:00:53.010> sense

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that makes any sense

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.069 
that makes any sense
so<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> wanted<00:00:54.449> planches<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.980> wanted

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
so I wanted planches and I wanted

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
so I wanted planches and I wanted
induction<00:00:58.079> hobs<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.579> when<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
induction hobs and I you know when I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
induction hobs and I you know when I
have<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> relationship<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
have a relationship with a with a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
have a relationship with a with a
cookery<00:01:02.039> school<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.460> Sweden<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.420> know

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
cookery school in Sweden and you know

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
cookery school in Sweden and you know
I've<00:01:03.780> worked<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.309> last<00:01:05.519> sort<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
I've worked over there the last sort of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
I've worked over there the last sort of
10<00:01:06.090> 15<00:01:06.479> years<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> living<00:01:07.080> using<00:01:07.380> lunches<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
10 15 years and living using lunches and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520 
10 15 years and living using lunches and
I<00:01:08.490> wanted<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.880> sort<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> less<00:01:09.540> tonnes<00:01:09.960> which

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I wanted that sort of less tonnes which

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
I wanted that sort of less tonnes which
I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> lot<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> chefs<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.450> know

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
I think a lot of chefs do know you know

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
I think a lot of chefs do know you know
where<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.869> direct<00:01:13.470> cook<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.880> me

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
where you can direct cook and for me

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
where you can direct cook and for me
I'll<00:01:15.360> look<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.990> across<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> board<00:01:16.820> at

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I'll look to right across the board at

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.640 
I'll look to right across the board at
what<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.180> available<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.350> felt<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
what was available I just felt the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.800 
what was available I just felt the
Electrolux<00:01:20.130> kit<00:01:20.369> suited<00:01:20.939> me<00:01:21.180> best

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
Electrolux kit suited me best

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
Electrolux kit suited me best
I<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> cleanness<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.909> design<00:01:25.820> like

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I like the cleanness of the design like

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.539 
I like the cleanness of the design like
the<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.810> controls<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.590> very<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:29.040> simple

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the the controls are very very simple

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.359 
the the controls are very very simple
just<00:01:30.000> felt<00:01:30.299> right<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.770> induction<00:01:32.070> was

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
just felt right and the induction was

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.179 
just felt right and the induction was
really<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:32.790> good

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
really really good

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.050 
really really good
and<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:35.460> I've<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> working

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and because I've got that working

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.080 
and because I've got that working
relationship<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
relationship with them I think that that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
relationship with them I think that that
was<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.479> secret<00:01:40.200> component<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.040> maybe

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
was the secret component that maybe

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.030 
was the secret component that maybe
really<00:01:41.640> delve<00:01:42.000> into<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.810> say<00:01:43.259> yes<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
really delve into it and say yes you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
really delve into it and say yes you
know<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> new<00:01:44.399> thermal<00:01:44.850> line<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.360> for

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
know the new thermal line is the one for

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.940 
know the new thermal line is the one for
me<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.159> brand<00:01:47.460> itself<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
me you know that the brand itself is a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.030 
me you know that the brand itself is a
strong<00:01:50.310> brand<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.939> looked<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> combi<00:01:52.710> ovens

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
strong brand I looked at the combi ovens

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.399 
strong brand I looked at the combi ovens
which<00:01:53.310> again<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.960> big<00:01:55.829> big<00:01:56.399> factor<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.869> it

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
which again are a big big factor and it

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.920 
which again are a big big factor and it
was<00:01:58.560> Lisa<00:01:58.799> they're<00:01:59.130> actually<00:01:59.689> your<00:02:00.689> love

early she liked the cleaning side of the
Electrolux<00:02:05.159> combi<00:02:05.790> oven<00:02:06.090> compared<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
Electrolux combi oven compared to the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
we also like the the fact we when we're

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.030 
we also like the the fact we when we're
designing<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.959> pastry<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.680> could<00:02:16.920> have

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
designing the pastry that we could have

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.820 
designing the pastry that we could have
the<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:18.239> small<00:02:18.510> combi<00:02:18.900> oven<00:02:19.110> with<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.290> blast

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.350 
the the small combi oven with the blast
chiller<00:02:20.040> underneath<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.819> real<00:02:21.090> bleak

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
chiller underneath that was a real bleak

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.850 
chiller underneath that was a real bleak
possible<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.050> can't<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.620> anywhere

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
possible as you can't get that anywhere

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.550 
possible as you can't get that anywhere
else<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.730> comes<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> unit<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.410> was

else so that comes as a unit so that was

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.369 
else so that comes as a unit so that was
a<00:02:25.590> big<00:02:25.800> loss<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.489> we<00:02:26.760> also<00:02:26.940> were<00:02:27.690> using<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
a big loss and we also were using the

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.410 
a big loss and we also were using the

till<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:30.750> got<00:02:31.230> those<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:31.709> could<00:02:31.890> move<00:02:32.010> them

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
till we got those so we could move them

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.020 
till we got those so we could move them
around<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.549> kitchen<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:35.040> wanted<00:02:35.760> things

around the kitchen and I wanted things

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.289 
around the kitchen and I wanted things

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
one side chores and the central stove I

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.420 
one side chores and the central stove I
wanted<00:02:39.629> things<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.959> link<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> bit<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.069> I

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
wanted things to link in a bit and I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.080 
wanted things to link in a bit and I
want<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.819> was<00:02:41.970> also<00:02:42.360> looking<00:02:42.629> at<00:02:44.090> because

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
want and I was also looking at because

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.110 
want and I was also looking at because
the<00:02:45.810> obvious<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.620> things<00:02:46.920> go<00:02:47.250> wrong<00:02:47.579> what

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the obvious is if things go wrong what

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.800 
the obvious is if things go wrong what
happened

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
happened

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.710

Nigel so I looked at that in great

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.059 
Nigel so I looked at that in great
detail<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.599> spoke<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.290> Electrolux

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.270 
detail and I and I spoke to Electrolux
at<00:02:56.190> great<00:02:56.459> length<00:02:57.060> about<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.349> we<00:02:58.980> have

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
at great length about that so we have

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.930 
at great length about that so we have
our<00:02:59.840> of<00:03:00.840> maintenance<00:03:01.379> guys<00:03:01.799> or<00:03:02.129> our<00:03:02.340> trained

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
our of maintenance guys or our trained

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.720 
our of maintenance guys or our trained
on<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.510> Electrolux<00:03:03.870> kit<00:03:04.349> so<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.549> do

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
on the Electrolux kit so that if we do

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.479 
on the Electrolux kit so that if we do
have<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.060> glitch<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.720> there<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.950> we<00:03:08.099> can<00:03:08.250> sort

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
have a glitch that there and we can sort

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.490 
have a glitch that there and we can sort
that<00:03:08.670> out<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:08.879> that<00:03:09.150> was<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.599> think<00:03:09.930> one<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.379> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
that out and that was I think one of the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.410 
that out and that was I think one of the
telling<00:03:10.799> factors<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.340> me<00:03:11.519> making<00:03:11.940> that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
telling factors in me making that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.350 
telling factors in me making that
absolutely<00:03:13.110> sizzle<00:03:13.440> I've<00:03:14.340> got<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.760> say<00:03:14.970> I'd
