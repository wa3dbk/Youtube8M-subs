00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.990
 Berlin basketball him and be whole 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.070
 Welcome here on Saturday at 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.300
 weekend 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.660
 I wish you a really right 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.980
 great weekend and you wanted something 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.320
 know that has to appeal again 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.200
 You wanted to know something that was 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.150
 actually already existed and there were 50 likes 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.190
 on this comment and I have yes 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.079
 I'll do that again 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.829
 repeat something that already existed 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.149
 or 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.789
 can perhaps something different with 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.680
 but actually I would 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.070
 ask if you if you have more 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.899
 somehow I want to know about myself 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.449
 say that it already existed or sekt 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.249
 please just play in the playlist 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.170
 somehow, look through it 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.239
 older videos because the older ones are yes 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.640
 still really up to date because I do 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.620
 yes, I make room three times a week 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.559
 two minutes and that means hunting already 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.899
 three facts about me almost every week 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.360
 and that means in one month 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.159
 already 12 facts and therefore looks 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
 just please in the older 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.420
 videos purely in this playlist looks 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.530
 look at everything and join us 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.120
 Safety is also really correct 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 interesting things about me though 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.490
 this time it is called which champion would 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.040
 paul potts play when he is all his 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.840
 live only one champion 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.390
 I should start playing the timer and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.110
 if you look back in the videos 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.970
 or 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.210
 the video I've done before 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.540
 then it was chase jason campell calm 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.820
 but said that is so ultra 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.590
 versatile james acer has the 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.110
 Rangers and he has that awesome shape that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.130
 means you have an extreme 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.050
 varied champ and thus 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.660
 would you people with a single 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.820
 champion will not get bored so 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.740
 each for example you could on him 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.170
 top play here could play the top 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.590
 on hd you can was the headache day 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 even max11 has scaling and otherwise 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.420
 in the middle he was played in jungle 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.460
 newer maybe from time to time you can do it 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.630
 In any case and you could him too 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.420
 so ali c play everything with jazz 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.370
 is possible and I have to say 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.870
 In the end it has to be a bit mine 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.380
 to be favorite james 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.450
 So my favorite camp would be the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.240
 I play all the time, so to speak 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.180
 wanted and at the moment also because of the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.320
 new skins, I think I'm really sorry 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.660
 to decrease 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.740
 I think the guest so awesome jungle 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.300
 is really fun 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.550
 johnny is for me so if you are one 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.380
 little peace needs if you 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.510
 just relaxed by the camps 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.550
 out his flame farrell bit high 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.050
 and then look where you where 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.440
 keep money where you can get in the cellar 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.560
 can 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.920
 and otherwise or to potato ins 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.890
 game 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.900
 and I just love to double these 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.910
 direct duel situation 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.370
 That's why I think the topline is part of it too 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.220
 the most exciting lane because you just 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.670
 because it simply as a brother so only times 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.840
 ever to rs ever be cs too 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.180
 get and in these situations 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.730
 the tension always rises and then comes 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.470
 it's also quite often random and straight 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.810
 this hard disk I think so too 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.730
 Rake Wehr first blood gets so 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.930
 if rainer forester has got then 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.640
 Do you think that I already do 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.650
 through everything the opponent can 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.310
 wonderful just because of its passive 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.690
 just because of his dear so it was 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.880
 probably it would be longer now 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.010
 luck I have to decide to write 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.640
 in the comments what your opinion 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.940
 would 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.280
 and please look in the playlist i hear 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.730
 nice word in the people until the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.730
 next time
