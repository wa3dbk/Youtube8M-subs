is why a full scope of protein powder is

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
is why a full scope of protein powder is
actually<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.689> beneficial<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.350> we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
actually not as beneficial as we

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
actually not as beneficial as we
sometimes<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.670> right<00:01:20.790> let's<00:01:21.150> say<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
sometimes think all right let's say this

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.039 
sometimes think all right let's say this
is<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.500> normal<00:01:22.890> scooper<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:24.659> now

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
is your normal scooper right here now

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.990 
is your normal scooper right here now
within<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.439> scooper<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.549> protein

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
within your scooper you have protein

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840 
within your scooper you have protein
powder<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.140> level<00:01:28.350> usually<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
powder up to this level usually what we

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
powder up to this level usually what we
don't<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.750> what<00:01:31.439> we're<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.680> really

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
don't really know what we're not really

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.149 
don't really know what we're not really
educated<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.659> fact<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.990> only<00:01:34.290> this

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159

helps<00:02:07.259> protect<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.649> bodies<00:02:08.099> from<00:02:08.399> infections

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
helps protect the bodies from infections

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.790 
helps protect the bodies from infections
and<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:11.750> gf1

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and then we have I gf1

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.880 
and then we have I gf1
which<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.670> insulin-like<00:02:15.390> growth<00:02:15.840> factors<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.210 

that<00:02:19.890> being<00:02:20.160> said<00:02:20.490> if<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.990> take<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.770> powder

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
that being said if you take this powder

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.870 
that being said if you take this powder
here<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:25.110> put<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.950> powder<00:02:26.280> into<00:02:26.610> a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
here and you put all this powder into a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.040 
here and you put all this powder into a
scoop<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:29.400> would<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.970> pretty<00:02:30.330> optimal

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
scoop you would have a pretty optimal

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.640 
scoop you would have a pretty optimal
protein<00:02:31.530> now<00:02:31.710> wouldn't<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.190> right<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
protein now wouldn't you right here and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.070 
protein now wouldn't you right here and
that<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.890> what<00:02:35.490> P<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.820> 3<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.710> P<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.130> 3

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
that is what P of 3 is you have P of 3

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.350 
that is what P of 3 is you have P of 3
which<00:02:40.080> contains<00:02:42.950> 75%<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:45.530> functional<00:02:46.530> protein

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
which contains 75% a functional protein

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.420 
which contains 75% a functional protein
the<00:02:48.360> rest<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.990> course<00:02:49.290> we<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.650> flavoring<00:02:50.250> in

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the rest of course we have flavoring in

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the rest of course we have flavoring in
there<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.150> forth<00:02:51.770> however<00:02:52.770> having<00:02:53.450> 75%

regular 3% you would see the big
benefits<00:03:00.120> now<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.170> didn't<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.490> do

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
benefits now I didn't really have to do

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.940 
benefits now I didn't really have to do
all<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.870> scientific<00:03:03.870> mumbo-jumbo<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.830> know

all that scientific mumbo-jumbo you know

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.320 
all that scientific mumbo-jumbo you know
I<00:03:04.980> don't<00:03:05.100> necessarily<00:03:05.400> do<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> lot<00:03:06.300> of

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
I don't necessarily do it with a lot of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.480 
I don't necessarily do it with a lot of
my<00:03:06.540> reviews<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.380> feel<00:03:07.830> like<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.100> product

looked at it it just didn't really sound

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.910 
looked at it it just didn't really sound
like<00:03:14.720> believable<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.960> wanted<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.440> know<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
was on a caloric deficit and i was

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.050 
was on a caloric deficit and i was
training<00:03:33.480> often<00:03:34.290> my<00:03:34.950> recovery<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.640> still

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
training often my recovery was still

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.080 
training often my recovery was still
pretty<00:03:36.720> damn<00:03:37.020> good<00:03:37.290> my<00:03:37.950> recovery<00:03:38.430> was<00:03:38.580> just<00:03:38.970> as

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
pretty damn good my recovery was just as

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.510 
pretty damn good my recovery was just as
fast<00:03:39.360> as<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> would<00:03:39.930> be<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.620> i<00:03:40.800> was<00:03:40.980> bulking<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
fast as it would be if i was bulking and

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.760 
fast as it would be if i was bulking and
if<00:03:41.640> i<00:03:41.730> was<00:03:41.880> eating<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> ton<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.570> food<00:03:42.989> tuck<00:03:43.560> she

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
if i was eating a ton of food tuck she

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.090 
if i was eating a ton of food tuck she
recover<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.450> being<00:03:45.690> said<00:03:45.780> i<00:03:46.290> really<00:03:46.830> do

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
recover so that being said i really do

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.729 
recover so that being said i really do
give<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.550> product<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:48.150> lot<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.540> props<00:03:48.840> i<00:03:49.170> think

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
give this product a lot of props i think

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.160 
give this product a lot of props i think
it<00:03:49.860> works<00:03:50.040> very<00:03:50.130> well<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.790> i<00:03:51.150> think<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.870> if

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
it works very well and i think that if

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.830 
it works very well and i think that if
you<00:03:52.709> did<00:03:53.310> use<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:54.030> would<00:03:54.239> work<00:03:54.420> very<00:03:54.480> well

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
you did use it it would work very well

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.510 
you did use it it would work very well
as<00:03:55.140> well<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.739> being<00:03:55.950> said<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.250> type<00:03:56.489> of

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
as well that being said this type of

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.940 
as well that being said this type of
protein<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.120> actually<00:03:57.450> 50<00:03:57.630> bucks<00:03:58.050> now<00:03:58.890> you

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
protein is actually 50 bucks now you

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.330 
protein is actually 50 bucks now you
think<00:03:59.250> small<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.120> tub<00:04:00.420> it's<00:04:00.720> 50<00:04:01.050> bucks<00:04:01.350> it's

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
think small of a tub it's 50 bucks it's

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.820 
think small of a tub it's 50 bucks it's
pretty<00:04:02.730> much<00:04:02.850> identical<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.959> having<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.650> big

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
pretty much identical to having a big

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.130 
pretty much identical to having a big
tub<00:04:05.040> approaching<00:04:05.550> isolate<00:04:05.970> beside<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.540> which

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
tub approaching isolate beside you which

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.500 
tub approaching isolate beside you which
costs<00:04:07.560> fifty<00:04:08.070> bucks<00:04:08.220> as<00:04:08.400> well<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.880> sometimes

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
costs fifty bucks as well and sometimes

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.060 
costs fifty bucks as well and sometimes
you<00:04:09.810> don't<00:04:09.930> even<00:04:10.050> get<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.380> many<00:04:10.530> serving<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
you don't even get as many serving and

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.410 
you don't even get as many serving and
that's<00:04:11.250> why<00:04:11.550> i<00:04:11.580> went<00:04:11.970> over<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.269> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
that's why i went over all the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.840 
that's why i went over all the
scientific<00:04:12.810> mumbo<00:04:13.140> jumbo<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.830> we<00:04:14.640> can

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
scientific mumbo jumbo so that we can

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.360 
scientific mumbo jumbo so that we can
see<00:04:15.060> why<00:04:15.420> size<00:04:16.230> doesn't<00:04:16.590> necessarily<00:04:17.130> matter

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
see why size doesn't necessarily matter
