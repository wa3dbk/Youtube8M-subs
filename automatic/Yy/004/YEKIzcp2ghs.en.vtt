00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
working out let's just say that it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.709 
working out let's just say that it
wasn't<00:00:30.750> working<00:00:30.960> out<00:00:31.080> very<00:00:31.289> much<00:00:31.349> at<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:31.679> so

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
going for here guys so what would that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.679 
going for here guys so what would that
be<00:01:04.680> called<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.189> speedrun<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.119> guess<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
be called a speedrun I guess we can do a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
be called a speedrun I guess we can do a
speedrun<00:01:06.990> radio<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> speedrun<00:01:08.340> MSAs<00:01:08.760> for

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
speedrun radio for a speedrun MSAs for

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
speedrun radio for a speedrun MSAs for
zombie<00:01:09.180> salt<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> only<00:01:09.900> real<00:01:10.080> problem<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
zombie salt now the only real problem is

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.770 
zombie salt now the only real problem is
I<00:01:10.650> guess<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> main<00:01:11.460> problem<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> would

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
I guess the main problem that I would

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.399 
I guess the main problem that I would
say<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:15.119> timer<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.229> here

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
say is that you have a timer up here

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
say is that you have a timer up here
three<00:01:16.799> minutes<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.369> 40<00:01:17.790> seconds<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.600> does

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
three minutes and 40 seconds what does

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.060 
three minutes and 40 seconds what does
that<00:01:18.720> mean<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.380> means<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.830> cannot

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that mean that means that we cannot

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.530 
that mean that means that we cannot
actually<00:01:20.310> beat<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.820> game<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.330> three

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
actually beat this game for three

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.760 
actually beat this game for three
minutes<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> 40<00:01:22.259> seconds<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
minutes and 40 seconds you have to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
minutes and 40 seconds you have to
defend<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.400> lawn<00:01:23.670> which<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> sad

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.830 
defend this lawn which is kind of sad
because<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
because it's like I want to do a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.069 
because it's like I want to do a
speedrun<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.710> has<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> timer<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.960> it's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
speedrun that has a timer on it so it's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.120 
speedrun that has a timer on it so it's
really<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.409> work<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.890> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
really not gonna work that well on this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.260 
really not gonna work that well on this
level<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.579> there's<00:01:32.909> not<00:01:33.090> really

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
level but I think there's not really

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.370 
level but I think there's not really
that<00:01:33.360> many<00:01:33.600> other<00:01:33.810> levels<00:01:34.140> where<00:01:34.290> it's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that many other levels where it's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.160 
that many other levels where it's
actually<00:01:34.439> gonna<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> problem<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:36.170> at

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
actually gonna be a problem for that at

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.210 
actually gonna be a problem for that at
least<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:37.439> hoping<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.130> be

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
least I'm hoping that that's gonna be

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.770 
least I'm hoping that that's gonna be
the<00:01:38.340> case<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.270> tell<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.479> losing

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the case I know you can tell I'm losing

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.940 
the case I know you can tell I'm losing
most<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> pistol<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
most of the pistol right now just to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
most of the pistol right now just to
keep<00:01:41.070> my<00:01:41.220> movement<00:01:41.820> speed<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.240> could<00:01:42.390> also

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
keep my movement speed up I could also

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.179 
keep my movement speed up I could also
switch<00:01:42.689> over<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.350> assault<00:01:43.740> rifle<00:01:44.070> as

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
switch over to that assault rifle as

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.130 
switch over to that assault rifle as
well<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.820> could<00:01:44.909> make<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.210> work<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.630> us<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
well we could make that work for us but

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
well we could make that work for us but
I<00:01:46.409> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> pistol<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.610> plus

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
I kind of like the pistol right now plus

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.550 
I kind of like the pistol right now plus
it's<00:01:48.420> kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> free<00:01:48.840> ammo<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> guess<00:01:49.409> really

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
it's kind of free ammo I guess really

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.719 
it's kind of free ammo I guess really
doesn't<00:01:49.770> matter<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.950> much<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.610> saving

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
doesn't matter that much now just saving

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.130 
doesn't matter that much now just saving
up<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:50.939> money's<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> tiny<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.630> might<00:01:51.840> help<00:01:51.990> out

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
up my money's a tiny bit might help out

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
up my money's a tiny bit might help out
just<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> tiny<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.829> well<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.460> once<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.759> get

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
just a tiny bit as well but once we get

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.550 
just a tiny bit as well but once we get
to<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.030> harder<00:01:54.420> rounds<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> harder<00:01:55.290> levels

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
to that harder rounds the harder levels

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.660 
to that harder rounds the harder levels
we<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.799> actually<00:01:55.890> start<00:01:56.159> making<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.490> matter

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
we can actually start making that matter

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.380 
we can actually start making that matter
a<00:01:56.969> little<00:01:57.060> bit<00:01:57.180> more<00:01:57.479> also<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.799> all

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
a little bit more also if I can at all

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.480 
a little bit more also if I can at all
keep<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.899> entire<00:02:01.290> place<00:02:01.710> safe<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.369> would

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
keep this entire place safe that would

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.010 
keep this entire place safe that would
be<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.820> plain<00:02:02.909> fantastic<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
be just plain fantastic because then I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.130 
be just plain fantastic because then I
can<00:02:04.399> fight<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.579> boss<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.079> do

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
can fight the boss with like that but do

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.059 
can fight the boss with like that but do
you<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.619> let's<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:07.920> this

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you actually know what let's get this

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.920 
you actually know what let's get this

nice majority this assault rifle here it

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.040 
nice majority this assault rifle here it
is<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.340> plain<00:02:14.520> beast<00:02:15.390> over<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:15.960> it's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
is just a plain beast over here it's

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.040 
is just a plain beast over here it's
beastly<00:02:16.470> only<00:02:17.100> problem<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.330> am<00:02:18.540> there

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
beastly only problem is is the am there

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.870 
beastly only problem is is the am there
is<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.380> reload<00:02:19.980> time<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.550> little<00:02:20.790> bit

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
is the reload time it's a little bit

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.220 
is the reload time it's a little bit
high<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.300> must<00:02:21.510> say<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.020> rock

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
high I must say but it's just a rock

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990 
high I must say but it's just a rock
star<00:02:25.530> rock<00:02:26.190> star<00:02:26.250> action<00:02:26.670> here<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.850> now<00:02:26.970> that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
star rock star action here and now that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.790 
star rock star action here and now that
I<00:02:27.180> know<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.510> game<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> little<00:02:27.900> bit<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.260> feel<00:02:28.620> like

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
I know the game a little bit I feel like

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.290 
I know the game a little bit I feel like
starting<00:02:29.160> off<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> new<00:02:29.490> would<00:02:29.880> actually<00:02:30.180> be

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
starting off a new would actually be

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.840 
starting off a new would actually be
kind<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.750> easy<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:32.040> think<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.550> gonna<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.820> a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
kind of easy I think it's gonna be a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.520 
kind of easy I think it's gonna be a
little<00:02:33.030> bit<00:02:33.120> easier<00:02:33.240> I'll<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:34.020> rain<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.350> some

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
little bit easier I'll just rain on some

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.020 
little bit easier I'll just rain on some
of<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.740> acid<00:02:35.250> stuff<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.580> don't<00:02:35.670> want<00:02:35.760> that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
of that acid stuff you don't want that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.330 
of that acid stuff you don't want that
to<00:02:36.180> happen

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
to happen

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.410 
to happen
those<00:02:38.340> spitters<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.880> be<00:02:38.940> very<00:02:39.180> deadly

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
those spitters can be very deadly

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.370 
those spitters can be very deadly
especially<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.940> late<00:02:41.940> late<00:02:42.810> game<00:02:43.080> over

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
especially in the late late game over

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.300 
especially in the late late game over
there<00:02:43.500> when<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.710> get<00:02:43.800> those<00:02:43.950> really<00:02:44.250> strong

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
there when you get those really strong

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.400 
there when you get those really strong
spitters<00:02:45.000> or<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.330> acid<00:02:45.720> blood<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> acid

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
spitters or the acid blood the acid

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.700 
spitters or the acid blood the acid
bloods<00:02:46.590> probably<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.040> worst<00:02:47.190> part<00:02:47.460> about<00:02:47.520> it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
bloods probably the worst part about it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.740 
bloods probably the worst part about it
acid<00:02:49.710> blood<00:02:49.860> hurts<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.460> bad<00:02:51.270> once<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.570> get

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
acid blood hurts you so bad once you get

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.480 
acid blood hurts you so bad once you get
