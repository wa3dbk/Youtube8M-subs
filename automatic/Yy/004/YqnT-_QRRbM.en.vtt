00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
of those where the fold reaches the edge

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.010 
of those where the fold reaches the edge
needs<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.880> marked<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.750> point

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
needs to be marked with a little point

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.679 
needs to be marked with a little point
because<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> gives<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> center<00:01:08.689> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
because that gives you the center of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.940 
because that gives you the center of
each<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.049> those<00:01:10.170> lines

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
those lines and then take your square

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
those lines and then take your square
and<00:01:20.939> put<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.170> each<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.220> those<00:01:23.400> dots<00:01:24.439> try<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and put it on each of those dots try to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
and put it on each of those dots try to
make<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> run<00:01:26.100> straight<00:01:26.700> through<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
make it run straight through so there it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.190 
make it run straight through so there it
goes<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.500> first<00:01:28.740> dot<00:01:29.130> mark<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
goes on the first dot mark that on the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
goes on the first dot mark that on the
next<00:01:31.530> dot<00:01:31.740> mark<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> next<00:01:34.439> dot<00:01:34.790> that

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
flaps cut round each flap as you go

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.040 
flaps cut round each flap as you go
along<00:02:33.790> straight<00:02:34.790> along<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.150> edges<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:38.050> round

whoops have not cooked quite on the flat

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.100 
whoops have not cooked quite on the flat
doesn't<00:02:43.160> matter<00:02:43.430> too<00:02:43.640> much<00:02:43.850> about<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.270> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
doesn't matter too much about that to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.370 
doesn't matter too much about that to
the<00:02:45.200> point<00:02:45.820> back<00:02:46.820> on<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> other<00:02:47.240> side<00:02:47.380> along

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
the edges out round the flat and then

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.600 
the edges out round the flat and then
again<00:02:52.000> that's<00:02:53.000> another<00:02:53.330> top<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.750> pyramid

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
again that's another top of the pyramid

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.010 
again that's another top of the pyramid
straight<00:02:55.610> down<00:02:56.080> out<00:02:57.080> along<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.040> flap<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.020> out

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
straight down out along the flap and out

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.340 
straight down out along the flap and out
we<00:03:00.200> go<00:03:00.350> again<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.580> point<00:03:01.900> now<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.140> some

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
we go again to the point now then some

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.090 
we go again to the point now then some
careful<00:03:03.590> folding<00:03:04.250> along<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.720> lines<00:03:05.990> that<00:03:06.890> are

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
careful folding along the lines that are

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.560 
careful folding along the lines that are
the<00:03:07.250> sides<00:03:07.460> of<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:07.700> crease<00:03:07.880> will<00:03:08.090> fold<00:03:08.300> back

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
the sides of this crease will fold back

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.940 
the sides of this crease will fold back
one<00:03:08.780> up<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:10.370> back<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:11.360> one<00:03:11.600> goes<00:03:11.780> down<00:03:12.080> and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
one up and back that one goes down and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.440 
one up and back that one goes down and
back<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.180> goes<00:03:14.360> down<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.770> back<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.820> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
back that one goes down and back and the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.710 
back that one goes down and back and the
last<00:03:17.660> one<00:03:19.180> that's<00:03:20.180> it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
last one that's it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.190 
last one that's it
and<00:03:20.810> now<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.260> flaps<00:03:21.650> need<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.100> fold<00:03:22.360> along<00:03:23.360> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
and now the flaps need to fold along the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.910 
and now the flaps need to fold along the
corners<00:03:25.130> of<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.370> pyramid<00:03:25.520> along<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> edges

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
corners of the pyramid along the edges

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.210 
corners of the pyramid along the edges
that's<00:03:27.920> another<00:03:28.310> flap<00:03:28.550> going<00:03:29.060> down<00:03:30.220> and

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
that's another flap going down and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.270 
that's another flap going down and
another<00:03:31.580> one<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.450> another<00:03:33.260> one<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.070> that's

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
another one and another one so that's

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.620 
another one and another one so that's
where<00:03:34.610> we're<00:03:34.760> going<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:34.970> put<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.240> glue<00:03:35.360> but

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
where we're going to put the glue but

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.820 
where we're going to put the glue but
before<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:35.990> put<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.230> glue<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.680> make

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
before you put the glue on just make

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.620 
before you put the glue on just make
sure<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.100> all<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.610> corners<00:03:37.790> match<00:03:38.330> up

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
sure that all the corners match up

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.530 
sure that all the corners match up
beautifully<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.790> that's<00:03:40.790> how<00:03:41.030> we<00:03:41.090> make<00:03:41.360> a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
beautifully and that's how we make a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.110 
beautifully and that's how we make a
pyramid<00:03:41.810> all<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:42.650> need<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.010> do<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.700> put<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:43.970> bit

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
pyramid all you need to do is put a bit

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.210 
pyramid all you need to do is put a bit
of<00:03:44.180> glue<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.720> flaps<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.230> turn<00:03:45.709> each<00:03:45.920> one

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
of glue on the flaps and turn each one

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.880 
of glue on the flaps and turn each one
in<00:03:46.810> before<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.930> do<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.440> might<00:03:48.620> like<00:03:48.860> to

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
in before you do that you might like to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.340 
in before you do that you might like to
turn<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.400> over<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:50.120> think<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.110> bit<00:03:51.230> of

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
turn it over and think of a bit of

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.470 
turn it over and think of a bit of
decoration<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:52.160> go<00:03:52.280> on<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.520> outside<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.300> I

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
decoration to go on the outside of it I

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.890 
decoration to go on the outside of it I
think<00:03:54.230> I'll<00:03:54.620> draw<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.910> some<00:03:56.420> butterflies

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
think I'll draw and some butterflies

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.770 
think I'll draw and some butterflies
today<00:03:57.230> but<00:03:58.220> your<00:03:58.370> eyes<00:03:58.490> would<00:03:58.730> be<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:58.910> nice

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
today but your eyes would be a nice

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.949 
today but your eyes would be a nice
pattern<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.320> have<00:04:00.440> on<00:04:00.560> my<00:04:00.740> pyramid<00:04:01.630> dot<00:04:02.630> dot

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
pattern to have on my pyramid dot dot

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.260 
pattern to have on my pyramid dot dot
dot<00:04:03.200> dot<00:04:03.230> dot<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:04.100> think<00:04:04.340> this<00:04:04.520> side<00:04:04.730> could<00:04:05.000> have

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
dot dot dot I think this side could have

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.650 
dot dot dot I think this side could have
a<00:04:05.690> bird<00:04:06.370> or<00:04:07.370> do<00:04:07.520> a<00:04:07.550> funny<00:04:07.910> little<00:04:08.030> bird<00:04:08.300> flying

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
a bird or do a funny little bird flying

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.280 
a bird or do a funny little bird flying
along<00:04:09.459> Egyptians<00:04:10.459> built<00:04:11.209> pyramids<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:12.170> they

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
along Egyptians built pyramids and they

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.140 
along Egyptians built pyramids and they
liked<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.800> decorate<00:04:13.280> them<00:04:13.459> with<00:04:13.489> all<00:04:13.670> sorts<00:04:14.090> of

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
liked to decorate them with all sorts of

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.760 
liked to decorate them with all sorts of
creatures<00:04:14.600> on<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.840> pyramids<00:04:15.230> as<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.500> bird

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
creatures on the pyramids as a bird

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.810 
creatures on the pyramids as a bird
flying<00:04:16.100> along<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:16.910> when<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.450> fold<00:04:17.810> all<00:04:18.080> the

sides<00:04:19.820> up<00:04:20.210> to<00:04:20.870> meet<00:04:22.540> creatures<00:04:23.540> will<00:04:23.930> be<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
sides up to meet creatures will be the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.879 
sides up to meet creatures will be the
right<00:04:24.350> way

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
right way

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.489
