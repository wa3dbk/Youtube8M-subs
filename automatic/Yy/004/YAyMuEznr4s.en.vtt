00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.900
 it's up to him everybody today 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.730
 finds himself for a new riblet this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 times at v4 30 02 m 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 if I'm not mistaken about a tank we see 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.450
 not often finally we are on the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.740
 cliff map with dandys flo which has 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.610
 posted a lot of replay elsewhere on 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.710
 the cold so it was an institute of 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.500
 to leave if on the third is a case 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 of study four questions stop good bah 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.400
 it's a lotter so it's normal 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 almost as red and orange 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.670
 some yellow him he is blue blue 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.390
 clear and there is a small stock 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.550
 I turn to that so I think he 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.470
 give more his team 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.720
 good i think he'll go to 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.900
 middle of the map 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.960
 it makes more sense to them on the flank 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.960
 Where is 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.880
 it does not look like a very 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.760
 very fast despite I believe if I 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.350
 am sick so sailing is a little 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.829
 she's a little low him because 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.829
 usually by the way 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.320
 ritual that's where they would have as well 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.340
 that a spot the cha girl severine this 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.719
 little family bonus the sadness 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.420
 besides, if there are any who support 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.340
 not to rent from the sixth sense it is raining less 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.420
 one day I would change but it's just 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.909
 that it's ultra practical yet 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.259
 uncertain while they cultivate hours 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.549
 who bug to death sorry to identify 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.579
 month is if that really annoys you had to 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.719
 luck but I advise you to 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.520
 install it anyway where 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.560
 and if he got used to you had on the mc's 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.750
 easter and his voice makes it really 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 know when there is aed small defense 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.640
 bulbs it is usually very small 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.989
 and we are not focused on 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.700
 good for the moment acquired and the a13 are 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:11.739
 good guys nothing good folichon of 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.239
 wolves actually what poses rather 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.150
 quiet there is nobody in the middle must 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.829
 to believe him is rather calm 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:26.049
 we will still notice a small part 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:34.350
 in front 1h40 damage that had 85 kg 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:34.350
 behind the letter or bushes 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:53.709
 a little coffee 85 to jam the little one 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.819
 tip right now there is a tea 34 to 43 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.599
 million this crisis n us fr dont for 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.569
 the moment they do not seem to be doing 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.569
 it goes much further we must say 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:25.860
 the inventor co with the risks that 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:28.230
 can still boom 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.720
 there is smarter there is a but 43 who is going 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.360
 good shit I think will try to 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.120
 do I take more there he is more 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.530
 that a poor cellar and in the middle so that 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.530
 shake not be too embarrassing 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.290
 I have a little interface it's 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.640
 a little less embarrassing for have 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.440
 almost 2000 damage three 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.910
 bowling pins and there that 1500w n 8 have 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.910
 started to leave 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:11.450
 Sasha and he looks really nice in 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.360
 plus the barrel of practically 25 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.949
 it's normal there are more than 34 now 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:28.740
 maybe 43 years ago will try to ba 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:31.830
 to boom and in addition there was 43 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.460
 bad luck I think they 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.100
 were stocks assures is sorry 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.240
 frankly for the practice that serve 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.810
 at our expense their label or body that 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.190
 does anything but it is 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.940
 checked that they have to go worry 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.940
 the warrior 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:07.550
 safer is a bit big and I think 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.280
 that he can attempt a shoot there there is 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:16.910
 not six years ago pv that's not it that's going 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:19.840
 of bones on the precious artisien and the 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.840
 station is already that's cool 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.950
 the goums 7 which is almost 3000 of 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.740
 damage so here's a part anyway 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.020
 nice enough I roll you pretty well in 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.160
 did you see what kind of 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.330
 looked like this tank we do not see 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.380
 often but what time not even 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.440
 wrong with a canvas with 36 points 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.590
 so frankly a good little tank I 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.110
 think I can I will pass it am 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.490
 well there not bad so here I am you 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.490
