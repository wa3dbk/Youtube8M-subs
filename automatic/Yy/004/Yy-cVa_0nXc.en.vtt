00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.720 
day this isn't that the overwhelming
problem<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:52.950> Chromebooks<00:02:53.100> right<00:02:53.430> now<00:02:53.580> is

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
problem for Chromebooks right now is

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.310 
problem for Chromebooks right now is
that<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.030> still<00:02:54.300> hard<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.660> justify<00:02:55.140> their

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
that it's still hard to justify their

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.200 
that it's still hard to justify their
existence<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:56.250> why<00:02:56.430> they're<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:56.700> cheap<00:02:56.730> at

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
existence that's why they're so cheap at

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.030 
existence that's why they're so cheap at
prices<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.960> Chromebook<00:02:58.260> 11<00:02:58.320> it's<00:02:58.830> not

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
prices like the Chromebook 11 it's not

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.470 
prices like the Chromebook 11 it's not
that<00:02:59.250> hard<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.550> make<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.700> case<00:02:59.970> for<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.240> device

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
that hard to make a case for a device

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.940 
that hard to make a case for a device
that's<00:03:00.750> best<00:03:00.990> for<00:03:01.080> email<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.560> web<00:03:01.680> browsing

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that's best for email and web browsing

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.860 
that's best for email and web browsing
and<00:03:02.220> not<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.610> great<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.910> everything<00:03:03.150> else<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
certainly an upgrade over last year's

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.820 
certainly an upgrade over last year's
Chromebook<00:03:15.840> with<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:15.990> better<00:03:16.200> display<00:03:16.500> better

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.320 
keyboard and a much improved design for
$279<00:03:20.130> that's<00:03:20.340> not<00:03:20.490> really<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.790> bad<00:03:20.970> proposition

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
$279 that's not really a bad proposition

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.850 
$279 that's not really a bad proposition
just<00:03:22.020> make<00:03:22.140> sure<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.590> what<00:03:22.740> you're

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
just make sure you know what you're

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.390 
just make sure you know what you're
getting<00:03:23.070> into

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
getting into

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.570 
getting into
even<00:03:24.210> a<00:03:24.270> $279<00:03:25.260> Windows<00:03:25.620> laptop<00:03:26.010> will<00:03:26.220> do<00:03:26.400> more

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
even a $279 Windows laptop will do more

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.860 
even a $279 Windows laptop will do more
and<00:03:26.850> run<00:03:27.000> better<00:03:27.150> than<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.510> Chromebook<00:03:27.810> 11

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and run better than the Chromebook 11

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.360 
and run better than the Chromebook 11
though<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.500> certainly<00:03:28.740> won't<00:03:28.890> look<00:03:29.070> as<00:03:29.220> good

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
though it certainly won't look as good

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.860 
though it certainly won't look as good
doing<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.790> I'm<00:03:29.940> still<00:03:30.330> holding<00:03:30.600> out<00:03:30.660> hope<00:03:30.720> for

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
doing it I'm still holding out hope for

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.720 
doing it I'm still holding out hope for
a<00:03:31.080> slightly<00:03:31.440> more<00:03:31.590> powerful<00:03:31.920> slightly<00:03:32.580> more

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
a slightly more powerful slightly more

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.250 
a slightly more powerful slightly more
expensive<00:03:32.820> Chromebook<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.690> might<00:03:33.870> do<00:03:33.990> less

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
expensive Chromebook that might do less

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.020 
expensive Chromebook that might do less
than<00:03:34.470> my<00:03:34.560> laptop<00:03:34.740> but<00:03:35.220> does<00:03:35.400> what<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.670> can<00:03:35.850> do

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
than my laptop but does what it can do

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.850 
than my laptop but does what it can do
just<00:03:36.060> as<00:03:36.510> well<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.930> we're<00:03:37.200> not<00:03:37.290> quite<00:03:37.620> there

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
just as well and we're not quite there

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.920 
just as well and we're not quite there
yet
