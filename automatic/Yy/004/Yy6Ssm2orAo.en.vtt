00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
thought this gameplay was pretty good

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.020 
thought this gameplay was pretty good
and<00:03:54.989> his<00:03:55.049> secondaries<00:03:55.920> aren't<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.370> fmg

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
and his secondaries aren't the fmg

and his secondaries aren't the fmg
akimbo<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.569> like<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.780> see<00:03:57.959> most<00:03:58.139> shotgun<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
akimbo is like you see most shotgun the

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.069 
akimbo is like you see most shotgun the
labs<00:03:58.980> people<00:03:59.340> will<00:03:59.489> use<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.780> secondary<00:04:00.780> and

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
labs people will use that secondary and

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.990 
labs people will use that secondary and
he<00:04:01.769> actually<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:02.370> know<00:04:02.459> he<00:04:02.579> gets<00:04:02.609> a<00:04:02.850> couple

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000

kills<00:04:03.269> for<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.510> secondary<00:04:03.930> which<00:04:04.139> is<00:04:04.290> fine

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
kills for the secondary which is fine

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.440 
kills for the secondary which is fine
because<00:04:04.769> he's<00:04:05.220> using<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.489> akimbo<00:04:05.730> scorpions
