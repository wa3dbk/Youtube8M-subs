Capcom<00:02:18.630> have<00:02:18.750> basically<00:02:19.170> stayed<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.250> reason

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
Capcom have basically stayed the reason

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.320 
Capcom have basically stayed the reason
for<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:21.260> they<00:02:22.260> found<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> hard<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.330> gain

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
for that is they found it hard to gain

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.690 
for that is they found it hard to gain
really<00:02:24.990> good<00:02:25.140> sales<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.430> they're

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
really good sales on it so they're

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.550 
really good sales on it so they're
worried<00:02:27.120> about<00:02:27.180> bringing<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.200> retail

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
worried about bringing it out in retail

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.280 
worried about bringing it out in retail
format<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.210> extra<00:02:30.570> production<00:02:31.020> costs

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
format to to the extra production costs

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.950 
format to to the extra production costs
etc<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.760> even<00:02:33.180> though<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.420> 3d<00:02:33.690> s<00:02:33.780> is

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
etc and even though the 3d s is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.110 
etc and even though the 3d s is
obviously<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.680> lot<00:02:35.190> more<00:02:35.280> popular<00:02:35.700> than<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.940> was

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
obviously a lot more popular than it was

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.150 
obviously a lot more popular than it was
originally<00:02:36.390> when<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.870> came<00:02:37.020> out<00:02:37.170> they<00:02:37.860> are

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
originally when it came out they are

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.460 
originally when it came out they are
because<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.090> reason<00:02:39.260> because<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
because of that reason because of the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.320 
because of that reason because of the
sort<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.770> lack<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.310> sales<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> previous

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
sort of lack of sales in the previous

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.790 
sort of lack of sales in the previous
series<00:02:42.570> which<00:02:42.810> does<00:02:43.050> surprise<00:02:43.380> me<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.680> be

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
series which does surprise me to be

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.130 
series which does surprise me to be
honest<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.340> pretty<00:02:44.550> popular<00:02:44.850> still<00:02:45.330> but

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
honest is pretty popular still but

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.330 
honest is pretty popular still but
because<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.560> reason<00:02:46.590> they're<00:02:47.100> only

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
because of that reason they're only

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.900 
because of that reason they're only
going<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.700> bring<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.410> onto<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.250> Nintendo
