you<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:56.999> microphone<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.749> had<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you see one microphone so you had a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.440 
you see one microphone so you had a
difference<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.710> quality<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:02:00.179> going<00:02:00.389> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
difference in quality and I'm going to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.910 
difference in quality and I'm going to
use<00:02:00.569> the<00:02:00.689> pop<00:02:00.899> filter<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.439> you're<00:02:01.560> gonna<00:02:01.649> see

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
use the pop filter and you're gonna see

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.559 
use the pop filter and you're gonna see
why<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.429> audio<00:02:02.789> technica<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.389> better

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
why that audio technica is a better

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.980 
why that audio technica is a better

get as much dirt off the vocal as
possible<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.170> most<00:02:43.740> people<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> way<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:44.430> do

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
possible and most people the way they do

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.030 
possible and most people the way they do
that<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> preamp<00:02:45.990> they<00:02:46.770> really

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
that is to have a preamp they really

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.449 
that is to have a preamp they really
boost<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.970> level<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.950> they<00:02:49.950> try<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.190> get<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
boost the level and they try and get the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.220 
boost the level and they try and get the
loudest<00:02:50.670> vocal<00:02:51.120> possible<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> least

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
loudest vocal possible with the least

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.830 
loudest vocal possible with the least
amount<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.800> background<00:02:53.489> noise<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
amount of background noise so the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.300 
amount of background noise so the
different<00:02:55.140> ways<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.560> record<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.160> with

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
different ways you can record but with

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.650 
different ways you can record but with
the<00:02:56.370> audio<00:02:56.640> technica<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.270> really<00:02:57.450> don't<00:02:57.600> have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the audio technica you really don't have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.449 
the audio technica you really don't have
to<00:02:57.720> do<00:02:57.900> too<00:02:58.080> much<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.440> everything<00:02:59.250> is

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
to do too much of that everything is

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.650 
to do too much of that everything is
clean<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.600> I'm<00:03:00.690> gonna<00:03:01.850> do<00:03:02.850> another<00:03:03.060> sound<00:03:03.420> test

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
clean so I'm gonna do another sound test
