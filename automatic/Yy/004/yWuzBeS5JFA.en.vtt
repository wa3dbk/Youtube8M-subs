00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
now it does but I actually think that

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.320 
now it does but I actually think that
the<00:02:08.110> van<00:02:08.500> for<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.009> spotting<00:02:09.459> laps<00:02:09.700> may<00:02:10.119> do<00:02:10.300> a

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
the van for the spotting laps may do a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.880 
the van for the spotting laps may do a
better<00:02:10.569> job<00:02:10.660> than<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.200> course<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:11.739> not
