00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
that the pictures are the in the best

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.480 
that the pictures are the in the best
way<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> communicate<00:02:08.790> with<00:02:09.720> her<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.490> connect

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.450 
are amazing so if you have a chance to
take<00:04:48.510> a<00:04:48.540> bullet<00:04:48.900> train<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.680> have<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.070> try<00:04:50.400> it

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
take a bullet train you have to try it

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.980 
take a bullet train you have to try it
out<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:53.070> lasts<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:53.820> two<00:04:54.270> weeks<00:04:54.600> so

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
out but it just lasts for two weeks so

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.560 
out but it just lasts for two weeks so
it<00:04:55.200> is<00:04:55.320> hard<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.919> get<00:04:56.190> as<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> souvenir<00:04:56.760> or<00:04:57.180> ship

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
it is hard to get as a souvenir or ship

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:14.200 
it is hard to get as a souvenir or ship
up<00:04:57.750> over<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.500> recommend<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.550> try<00:04:59.790> it<00:04:59.940> out
