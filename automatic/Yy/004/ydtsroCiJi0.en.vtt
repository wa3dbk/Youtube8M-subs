00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.650
 Hello and 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.530
 come to the windows 8 presentation of 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.540
 csl computer in this video i will 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.260
 them the search function of windows 8 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.940
 imagine 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.680
 you will have a little insight 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.020
 get how to find the new search 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.020
 is and how to use it effectively 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.980
 to make working with windows 8 easier 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.930
 It offers a perfect 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.870
 revised and innovative 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.120
 For example, I am here for search functions 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.149
 I just write on the homepage 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.340
 Let's go if I want to find something 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.410
 if I search for example the internet explorer 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.470
 I just write the name on the 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.270
 keyboard and immediately opens the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.989
 I'm looking for the same result 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.670
 I can show you the search function 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.540
 also at any time about the charms couple 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.399
 fade in 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.559
 this is especially handy from the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.989
 desktop or an app from something too 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.309
 Find 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.009
 I open the charms couple of times 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.110
 desktop and find it first 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.909
 in the list the search button over the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.909
 I open the search in one click 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.929
 now we see her in this complete 

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:17.600
 view is the structure of the search function 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.819
 quite simply what you see here is that 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.139
 menu all apps that we have in the first video 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.679
 have already met 

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:26.719
 right here is the search bar which I 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.200
 just hide it when i'm in any apps 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.579
 menu on a free space click now 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.549
 I can scroll through the menu and 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.740
 I want to use the apps and programs 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.310
 I try to show it again 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.560
 just look over the charms bar 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.329
 Let's take a closer look at the search bar 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.649
 you can see that they are different 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.369
 ranges is divided 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.899
 At the top is the input field and here 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.979
 Can I decide if I have apps 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.630
 want to find settings or files 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.399
 in the bottom list we will as well 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.340
 Still the apps I display 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.049
 can search 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.939
 let's go through the individual points 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.569
 For example, I want the news app 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.639
 Find 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.110
 So I'm going to apps here and start 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:13.130
 my search term in the field too 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.110
 Writing as you can see is enough 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.510
 Letter out to left results 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.920
 to get displayed 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.280
 here on the right is still like 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.910
 many hits in the andes 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.069
 I have clicked 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.660
 example settings will be me 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.350
 all matching results in the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.060
 the more settings I see 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.530
 now in the field write all the smaller 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.840
 will also be the number of each 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.100
 hits because the results always 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.690
 to be filtered more specifically and with 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.620
 files, of course, the whole thing works 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.300
 just like the search in windows 8 is like that 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.310
 especially fast because I use them anytime 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.440
 can call on the charms at 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.120
 moreover, it is usually enough if 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.580
 I enter only a short catchword 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.640
 to display the correct result 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.640
 to get 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.910
 but now back to the apps 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 because I still want the news 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.780
 I'll click on the app again 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.730
 apps and here she will me too 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.569
 already displayed with a left click 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.569
 I open it 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.319
 We see the news app which I immediately 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.280
 current news from around the world to 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.930
 I want to show now reports to one 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.850
 I will open a specific topic 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.670
 Just search for the charms bar around 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.810
 to search the app 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.610
 I write a catchword here 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.180
 I take purely for example the word 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.620
 weather as you see me is already after 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.340
 a few letters a hit list 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.690
 displayed from the I can select 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.030
 If I'm on the weather now 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.130
 Clique I immediately find the latest 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.840
 report on this topic if I want 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.850
 I can from here but again 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.090
 in these three areas or the apps 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.739
 I want to search in this list 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.510
 example on the internet something to a 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.269
 search term I click on the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.799
 internet explorer off and on 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.630
 We about bingen matching results 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.220
 so you can see fast and 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.220
 just search the whole internet 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.290
 apps can too 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.000
 search be excluded that goes in 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.850
 the pc settings i have about 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.500
 charms election calls here in fourth 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.320

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.760
 which I can open with a click here 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.770
 I settings for the search history 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.350
 make and at this point 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.760
 Finally apps with a click of them 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.120
 will then no longer search in the app 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.120
 appropriate 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.440
 also on the desktop there is one 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.139
