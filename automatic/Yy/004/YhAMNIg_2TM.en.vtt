 rallies and I hope you are well 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.780
 and it's unreal that I introduce myself 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.700
 in front of you for two ads 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.070
 the first is the video of the seals 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 thousand subscribers you are as much as that to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.480
 soon follow me there is not yet 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.130
 and this will be the opportunity for me to do 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.070
 a special video and I looked for a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.240
 nice concept to make a concept 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.860
 very cool 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 a concept that has not been done yet 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.000
 in any case that I have never seen 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.190
 elsewhere on youtube is actually I dream 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
 needed your help really 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.940
 a lot of your help because that's 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.120
 you who are going to make this video with 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.510
 me ie you can send me 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.850
 a five-second video at the address 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.249
 rape at the workshops point ch and that's 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.409
 all your videos that I will receive that I 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.179
 would endabout with a little speech 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.429
 from beginnings to peace at the end of my part 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.440
 obviously these videos there that 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.969
 will constitute the video of the thousand seals 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.469
 subscribers why am I doing this because 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.839
 than a hundred thousand subscribers when we talk about 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.479
 100 miles talking about you we talk about 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.890
 everything that looks at my videos of course 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.330
 not everyone watch these videos there 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.970
 on the hundred thousand but the numbers varies 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.590
 at each video but there was a hundred thousand 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 people who were interested in my 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.280
 chain and I find it absolutely huge 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.930
 she's 100 miles it's a talk of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.970
 you it's not about me it's 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.040
 you who make up the 100000 is so 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.470
 this video there is done I wanted 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.690
 to be able to have all the diversity of my 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.160
 public in a video so that's why 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.960
 that I would ask you if you do 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.180
 spiders if you make videos 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.160
 also skits and so on 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.260
 do not hesitate to find something 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.940
 good idea of ​​five seconds to send me 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.130
 there will be some small conditions 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.500
 to avoid an audiovisual fair is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.260
 this not the first lady condition already 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.940
 many times it's five seconds 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.790
 maximum no more why five seconds 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.960
 it's very short simply because 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 that otherwise we will end up with 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.950
 videos that will make hours finally 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.930
 my video will be hours because your 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.090
 video will I not ten fifteen minutes 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.950
 five minutes 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.079
 ten seconds once will make it there so 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.939
 that's why it's five seconds 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.439
 maximum please follow this instruction 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.100
 of the second is that it must be 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.860
 for all 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.660

 forbidden at least 18 years old is not 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.019

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.430
 below the belt etc 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.660

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.610
 look i'm counting on you to remember 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.590
 also this rule there another video a 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.620
 another condition for forgiveness is that it must 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.269
 concern minecraft minecraft my channel 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.270
 etc. 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.000
 no tricks about 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.640
 of lol or web I do not know what or 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.390
 counter strike and it's concerned 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.100
 minecraft or the chain in general it's 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.040
 already a big is already very widely 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.470
 Kraft can do extremely well 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.610
 there is a pole this is the absolute 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.380
 absolutely huge I think you in 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.440
 know something last 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.940
 condition it's not background music 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.260
 because for the rights and tightening 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.030
 produced between being bothered with 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.880
 youtube so that's just for 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.670
 able to throw to sea after on the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.590
 chain thank you very much for holding these 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.750
 four rules there is not huge 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.180
 you still have the frame is good 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.120

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.390
 any audience no background music is 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.650

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.570

 think it's feasible 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.520
 I do not put myself too much time because 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.050
 that already we will have exceeded the hundred thousand 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.520
 very very certainly 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.840
 and 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.920
 and then to ag for a suite me 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.510

 second ad the second ad 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.890
 concerns the 100,000 subscribers project 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.570
 I have a small project that I put in 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.640
 place for already a little while and 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.320
 then apparently it coincides safe but 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.660
 on this step there for me for the 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.640

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.260

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.100
 come when we can open and that's 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.720
 when we believe we can open this 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.030
