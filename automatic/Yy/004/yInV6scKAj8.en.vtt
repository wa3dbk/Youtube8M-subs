00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910 
then you can Jack the car up anywhere
that<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> metals<00:02:01.380> doubled<00:02:01.770> up

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that you see that the metals doubled up

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.399 
that you see that the metals doubled up
you<00:02:02.549> would<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.969> want<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.360> jack<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.899> here

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you would not want to jack it up here

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.540 
you would not want to jack it up here
because<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.280> only<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.610> single<00:02:07.160> thickness<00:02:08.160> but

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
because it's only a single thickness but

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
because it's only a single thickness but
where<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.940> doubled<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.840> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
where it's doubled up like that that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.030 
where it's doubled up like that that
would<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> good<00:02:10.530> place<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.770> put<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.129> jack

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
would be a good place to put a jack

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.229 
would be a good place to put a jack
anywhere<00:02:14.040> where<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> have<00:02:14.370> suspension<00:02:15.030> stuff

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
anywhere where you have suspension stuff

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.570 
anywhere where you have suspension stuff
like<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.709> see<00:02:16.890> how<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.220> double

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
like this and you see how it's double

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.789 
like this and you see how it's double
thick<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.180> backside<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.650> be

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
thick the backside of that that can be

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.259 
thick the backside of that that can be
jacked<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.459> see<00:02:20.580> where<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.030> jack

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
jacked you can see where I have the jack

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.660 
jacked you can see where I have the jack
stand<00:02:21.599> here<00:02:21.870> where<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.140> doubled<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.519> do

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
stand here where it's doubled up you do

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.710 
stand here where it's doubled up you do
not<00:02:24.030> want<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.930> jack<00:02:25.230> by<00:02:26.159> control<00:02:27.150> arms<00:02:27.540> like

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
not want a jack by control arms like

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.640 
not want a jack by control arms like
these<00:02:27.930> right<00:02:28.170> here

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
these right here

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.460 
these right here
they'll<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.190> collapse<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.180> Bend<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.780> then

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
they'll just collapse and Bend and then

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.020 
they'll just collapse and Bend and then
you'll<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.920> replace<00:02:32.250> them<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:32.849> get

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
you'll have to replace them and then get

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.940 
you'll have to replace them and then get
an<00:02:33.150> alignment<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:33.989> not<00:02:34.200> want<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> jack<00:02:34.739> on

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
an alignment you do not want to jack on

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.160 
an alignment you do not want to jack on
them<00:02:35.159> they're<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.549> wimpy<00:02:35.909> they<00:02:36.900> can't

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
any way you look at it starts to fall

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.110 
any way you look at it starts to fall
over<00:06:34.240> it'll<00:06:34.950> screw<00:06:35.950> up<00:06:36.070> the<00:06:36.280> Jack<00:06:36.550> the<00:06:36.850> Carl

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
over it'll screw up the Jack the Carl

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.850 
over it'll screw up the Jack the Carl
fall<00:06:37.480> and<00:06:37.810> it's<00:06:37.930> really<00:06:38.140> hard<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.410> get<00:06:38.530> a<00:06:38.590> car

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.890 
fall and it's really hard to get a car
up<00:06:39.040> off<00:06:39.220> of<00:06:39.250> the<00:06:39.610> ground<00:06:39.640> you<00:06:40.240> know<00:06:40.510> when<00:06:40.720> it's

up off of the ground you know when it's

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.050 
up off of the ground you know when it's
on<00:06:41.020> the<00:06:41.080> dirt<00:06:41.380> a<00:06:41.710> lot<00:06:42.130> easier<00:06:42.490> on<00:06:42.550> concrete

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
on the dirt a lot easier on concrete

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.280 
on the dirt a lot easier on concrete
because<00:06:43.360> you<00:06:43.480> can<00:06:43.630> use<00:06:43.780> wood<00:06:44.020> and<00:06:44.170> other

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
because you can use wood and other

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.370 
because you can use wood and other
things<00:06:44.560> as<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.800> lever<00:06:45.660> hope<00:06:46.660> this<00:06:46.900> is<00:06:47.080> helpful
