it's<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.909> tucked<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:40.530> take<00:01:40.979> some

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it's going to get tucked in I take some

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.429 
it's going to get tucked in I take some
castor<00:01:41.579> oil<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> drop<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
castor oil and I will do just a drop of

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.490 
castor oil and I will do just a drop of
or<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.240> rub<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.960> together<00:01:46.259> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
or so of that and I rub this together in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.969 
or so of that and I rub this together in
my<00:01:46.560> hands<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.950> put<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.899> on<00:01:48.899> my<00:01:49.350> hair<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
my hands and I put it on on my hair so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.429 
my hands and I put it on on my hair so
that<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.220> catches<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.909> flyaways<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that it catches the flyaways just so it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.050 
that it catches the flyaways just so it
my<00:01:52.619> hair<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.250> more<00:01:53.399> smooth<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
my hair is a little bit more smooth and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.959 
my hair is a little bit more smooth and
then<00:01:55.020> I'll<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.640> sometimes<00:01:56.640> I'll<00:01:56.790> brush

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
then I'll you know sometimes I'll brush

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.240 
then I'll you know sometimes I'll brush
it<00:01:57.000> down<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.479> bit<00:01:57.659> sometimes<00:01:58.259> doesn't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it down a little bit sometimes doesn't

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.249 
it down a little bit sometimes doesn't
really<00:01:59.369> matter<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.119> not<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:00.899> big<00:02:01.110> deal

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
really matter so not really big deal

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
really matter so not really big deal
then<00:02:02.009> I'll<00:02:02.219> take<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.610> hair<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.060> I'll<00:02:03.630> start<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
then I'll take my hair and I'll start to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.469 
then I'll take my hair and I'll start to
roll<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.560> towards<00:02:05.070> itself<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> center<00:02:06.329> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
roll it towards itself in the center to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.760 
roll it towards itself in the center to
kind<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.689> towards<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> center<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.590> I'll

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
kind of towards the center and then I'll

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.200 
kind of towards the center and then I'll
start<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.099> roll<00:02:08.250> up

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
start to roll up

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.580 
start to roll up
and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.830> pin<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.250> place<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:12.590> use

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and then I just pin that in place I use

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530 
and then I just pin that in place I use
the<00:02:13.740> jumbo<00:02:14.070> bobby<00:02:14.310> pins<00:02:14.550> written<00:02:14.940> normally

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the jumbo bobby pins written normally

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.620 
the jumbo bobby pins written normally
I'll<00:02:15.690> use<00:02:16.020> about<00:02:16.400> six<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.420> i'm

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
I'll use about six I think I think i'm

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.390 
I'll use about six I think I think i'm
going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.960> probably<00:02:19.320> use<00:02:19.620> six<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.130> video

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
going to probably use six in this video

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.190 
going to probably use six in this video
that<00:02:20.640> i<00:02:20.670> didn't<00:02:20.910> count<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.360> nine<00:02:21.930> hundred

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
that i didn't count so nine hundred

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.460 
that i didn't count so nine hundred
percent<00:02:22.440> math<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.000> if<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.630> pin<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.440> in

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
percent math but if you pin that in

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.380 
percent math but if you pin that in
place<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:27.150> should<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.660> pretty<00:02:28.380> secure<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
place it should be pretty secure and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.830 
place it should be pretty secure and
then<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.980> I'll<00:02:32.100> do<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.790> I'm<00:02:33.300> still<00:02:33.600> pinning

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
then what I'll do is I'm still pinning

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.150 
then what I'll do is I'm still pinning
here<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.320> what<00:02:34.440> I'm<00:02:34.530> going<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.680> do<00:02:34.800> next<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
here but what I'm going to do next is
