00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
see that possible lead might be Ferris

see that possible lead might be Ferris
eat<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.520> biggest<00:00:17.940> threat<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
eat here and that the biggest threat to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380 
eat here and that the biggest threat to
my<00:00:18.779> team<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.439> probably<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.609> scraggy

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
my team is probably going to be scraggy

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.080 
my team is probably going to be scraggy
which<00:00:22.350> means<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.980> i<00:00:23.160> basically<00:00:23.609> need<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
which means that i basically need to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.720 
which means that i basically need to
keep<00:00:24.330> around<00:00:24.510> my<00:00:24.900> Croagunk<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.010> me<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.460> foo

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
keep around my Croagunk and me and foo

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.419 
keep around my Croagunk and me and foo
as<00:00:27.029> long<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.689> possible<00:00:27.750> otherwise<00:00:28.439> late<00:00:29.099> game

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
as long as possible otherwise late game

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.609 
as long as possible otherwise late game
that<00:00:29.760> has<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.300> potential<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.929> sweep<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.439> whole

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that has the potential to sweep my whole

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.700 
that has the potential to sweep my whole
team<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.000> figure<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> best<00:00:33.899> lead<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.590> this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
team so I figure the best lead in this

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
team so I figure the best lead in this
case<00:00:35.010> would<00:00:35.190> either<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.520> lead<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.450> me<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
case would either be lead with me and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
case would either be lead with me and
foo<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.469> turn<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.100> case<00:00:38.309> he<00:00:38.520> leads

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
foo and you turn out in case he leads

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
foo and you turn out in case he leads
with<00:00:38.879> Pharaoh<00:00:39.210> seed<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.350> lead<00:00:40.620> with

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
with Pharaoh seed or just lead with

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.400 
with Pharaoh seed or just lead with
bronzer<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:42.149> you'll<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.260> up

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
bronzer and that way you'll just get up

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.520 
bronzer and that way you'll just get up
both<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.649> entry<00:00:44.100> hazards<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.850> chose<00:00:45.840> bronzer

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
both your entry hazards I chose bronzer

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.139 
both your entry hazards I chose bronzer
and<00:00:47.960> unfortunately<00:00:48.960> he<00:00:49.289> led<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:50.039> Taillow<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and unfortunately he led with Taillow I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.229 
and unfortunately he led with Taillow I
guess<00:00:51.360> which<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.690> kind<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.079> weird<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:53.730> saw

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
guess which is kind of weird but I saw

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
guess which is kind of weird but I saw
the<00:00:54.300> u-turn<00:00:54.780> coming<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.680> he<00:00:55.739> can't

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the u-turn coming because he can't

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
the u-turn coming because he can't
really<00:00:56.340> attack<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.690> any<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.109> movie

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
really attack me with any other movie

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
really weird because why would you make

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.330 
really weird because why would you make
such<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.750> prediction<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.470> early<00:02:19.980> especially

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
such a prediction this early especially

I<00:03:26.549> don't<00:03:26.700> know<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.120> expect<00:03:27.269> because

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
I don't know what to expect because

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.020 
I don't know what to expect because
these<00:03:27.930> can<00:03:28.320> be<00:03:28.590> mixed<00:03:28.890> they<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.519> physical

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
these can be mixed they can be physical

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.449 
these can be mixed they can be physical
they<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.329> be<00:03:30.420> special<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.709> was<00:03:32.069> thinking<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
they can be special I was thinking it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.069 
they can be special I was thinking it
might<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.640> physical<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.209> which<00:03:33.480> case<00:03:33.750> my

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
might be physical in which case my

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.349 
might be physical in which case my
bronzer<00:03:34.650> would<00:03:34.859> have<00:03:34.980> taken<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.359> perfectly

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
bronzer would have taken that perfectly

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.410 
bronzer would have taken that perfectly
fine<00:03:36.920> unfortunately<00:03:37.920> he's<00:03:38.130> special<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:39.120> I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
fine unfortunately he's special and I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.150 
fine unfortunately he's special and I
guess<00:03:39.870> here<00:03:40.200> he<00:03:40.350> was<00:03:40.440> predicting<00:03:40.950> me<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
guess here he was predicting me to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.530 
guess here he was predicting me to
switch<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.840> why<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.650> cross<00:03:43.920> chop

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
switch but this is why the cross chop

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.759 
switch but this is why the cross chop
didn't<00:03:45.540> take<00:03:45.780> me<00:03:45.989> out<00:03:46.109> because<00:03:46.290> I'm<00:03:46.470> mostly

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
didn't take me out because I'm mostly

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.680 
didn't take me out because I'm mostly
physical<00:03:47.010> as<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> post<00:03:47.639> special<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.389> I'm<00:03:48.540> able

really have any reliable pokemon that I
could<00:04:10.139> switch<00:04:10.380> into<00:04:10.799> because<00:04:11.220> now<00:04:11.790> drover

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
could switch into because now drover

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.770

have<00:04:18.090> won't<00:04:18.450> kill<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.560> decided<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.250> just

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
have won't kill it so I decided to just

have won't kill it so I decided to just
you<00:04:20.639> turn<00:04:20.910> out<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.269> get<00:04:21.419> whatever<00:04:21.630> damage<00:04:22.169> on

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
it he predicted that and went into his

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:24.870 
it he predicted that and went into his
tail

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880

my best bet right right now what's

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.860 
my best bet right right now what's
gibble<00:05:09.340> this<00:05:09.940> is<00:05:10.120> why<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.360> would<00:05:10.660> have<00:05:10.780> been

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
gibble this is why it would have been

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.050 
gibble this is why it would have been
better<00:05:10.930> off<00:05:11.230> if<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.710> still<00:05:11.980> save<00:05:12.220> my<00:05:12.490> bronzer

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
go into his gray or espero seed so my

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.420 
go into his gray or espero seed so my
best<00:05:22.780> bet<00:05:22.930> right<00:05:23.050> here<00:05:23.530> it's<00:05:23.680> Mienfoo<00:05:23.980> and
