00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 we noticed that the sport to talk about 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.500
 corinthians corinthians won the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.819
 3 to 0 was the best result 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.290
 of corinthians in the year but not 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.300
 I really liked the game, huh? 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.309
 but he must have liked a surprise in the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.280
 if the year came out be very good at 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 corinthians does not see much praise since 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.199
 which premiered this time jackson did not 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.820
 managed to control the midfield 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.710
 top scorer of the season romarinho beyond 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.800
 of a good start of the second half 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.930
 also had no inspired night 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.949
 the bad phase of a warrior who has lost 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.290
 many goals the last or even made him worse 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.620
 left twist with suspicion in the field 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.230
 knee and at risk of having to operate the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.899
 Peruvian went home very worried 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.210
 now I'm with action is pain tomorrow I will 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.700
 know more about the time at the post 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.360
 unfortunately undergoing surgery 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.489
 then I hope it is not in the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.250
 referred to as commercial in turn 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.199
 did not take advantage of the little inspiration 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.940
 most of the time and in the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.840
 final minutes still ended up being 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.579
 thrashing 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 victory gives three points 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.240
 important for the Corinthians but 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.340
 So it was the game. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.430
 soon it will be forgotten by the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.909
 but on the other hand the night was 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 unforgettable for two players 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.770
 Corinthians 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.259
 to get out injured in the first 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 warrior time was replaced by 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.150
 luciano who recently came from avaí 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.310
 for the attacker was practically a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.780
 debut and even came on the pitch 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 against the clear river 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.720
 but at the last minute and neither touched the ball 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.009
 I entered the ball today or went back there. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.960
 at the front it's over but I did not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.600
 ball but she left very frustrated 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 that day was only debut put no no 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.079
 teacher is there he knows what he is 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.790
 doing and thank God today I could 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.310
 to be able to help the team make two 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.439
 goals so that this time everything different 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.720
 a minute and a half in the field the first 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.330
 touch the ball the goal 1 to 0 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.640
 the goal 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.850
 It's a place, I'm a warrior. 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.890
 brand came out excited celebrating is that 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.490
 realized the move was positioned as it is 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.620
 what is it 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.510
 I've been working there then on time. 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.160
 that the ball came in the inter I knew that 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.750
 he was going to hit the cross and I was happy in 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.790
 the goal he had been working for was only 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.130
 a half minutes of the day to work 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.840
 so much noise feel had not worked 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.460
 so when I painted the opportunity I 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.010
 knew how to do and guaranteed his 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.230
 work had the defense of the commercial 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.010
 when you tried to avoid the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.270
 the 44th time of the second half with 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.960
 precision style in the corner 2 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.320
 0 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:41.230
 the cell of Mosciano trails at night 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.810
 landmarks second logo with 21 seconds and 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.980
 he had never played in the team so 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.600
 great as the corinthians 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.600
 and thanks to god final with two goals 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.160
 so it was exciting but now it's ball 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.500
 Wednesday night is the night. 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.180
 it would only be a snapshot if minutes later 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.090
 corinthians did not get the third goal 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.300
 with the gil defender 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.580
 I love them it was who hit the corner 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.320
 gil will build to score the third 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:11.620
 The important thing here was the author gil 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.700
 1º 2 79 defender games by 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.550
 corinthians 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.920
 one ran away even played with roberta and no o 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.850
 Our road map helps us there that would 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.980
 make three 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.480
 So the first one I did now is now 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.430
 have peace of mind and enjoy the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.130
 rest but the ball will nod 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.510
 by daniel gil had not entered 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.690
 if I think the ball had already entered 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.190
 I'm just crazy, otherwise I would be 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:40.210
 complicated is needing this little gol 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:44.590
 It's just the biggest one, but I betrayed it and it 's a 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.780
 neighborhood where to go she who stars luciano 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.430
 and until we checked he is single 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.620
 has a barbarian evans in his life 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.010
 maybe that's why if it's even the most 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.930
 light will you think she is is 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.730
 cool first for the moment victory 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.100
 of corinthians who have three 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.380
 successes and more confidence and makes 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.850
 the peace with the fans is cool by the gil 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.080
 who makes the first goal is a player who 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.660
 last year had a fantastic year 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.640
 despite the poor team momentum 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.350
 It's really cool of you to discover a player. 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.390
 What is coming up with the game? 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.400
 different from the incoming warrior 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.530
 feels the weight of the shirt makes a first 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.450
 group that makes the right move in the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.400
 first stick following the play and makes 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.290
 a second of quality and then you see that 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.660
 he cleared the bid and threatens to do 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.950
 touch and just take the goalkeeper is still early 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.950
 but he looks like a good player
