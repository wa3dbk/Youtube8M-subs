00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
leveling through Alvin forest you see

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.910 
leveling through Alvin forest you see
these<00:00:35.309> ridges<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.149> across<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> zone<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.680> see

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
these ridges all across the zone you see

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560 
these ridges all across the zone you see
the<00:00:38.040> cursors<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.760> over<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.090> those<00:00:39.239> ridges

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the cursors going over all those ridges

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
the cursors going over all those ridges
I<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> travel<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.250> those<00:00:41.430> ridges<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.850> lot

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I like to travel on those ridges a lot

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.580 
I like to travel on those ridges a lot
because<00:00:42.270> often<00:00:42.719> you'll<00:00:42.840> find<00:00:43.190> off<00:00:44.450> into<00:00:45.590> off

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
because often you'll find off into off

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.340 
because often you'll find off into off
the<00:00:46.950> ridges<00:00:47.309> you'll<00:00:47.760> find<00:00:47.940> herbs<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.570> you'll

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the ridges you'll find herbs and you'll

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.600 
the ridges you'll find herbs and you'll
also<00:00:49.530> find<00:00:49.920> lots<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:51.949> copper<00:00:52.949> veins<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.430> mine

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
also find lots of copper veins to mine

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.750 
also find lots of copper veins to mine
so<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:54.960> doing<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.430> after<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:56.610> my

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
really advanced features in this add-on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.899 
really advanced features in this add-on
um<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.040> doing<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:17.790> just

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
um so what I was doing was I was just

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
um so what I was doing was I was just
checking<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.479> copper<00:01:19.049> bars<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.979> price

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
checking out the copper bars the price

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
checking out the copper bars the price
of<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> copper<00:01:20.640> bars<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.180> copper<00:01:21.479> ores<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of the copper bars the copper ores and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
of the copper bars the copper ores and
found<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> huge<00:01:22.799> difference<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
found that it was a huge difference so I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.289 
found that it was a huge difference so I
went<00:01:24.930> bought<00:01:25.200> tons<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.830> copper<00:01:26.130> copper<00:01:26.640> ores

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
went bought tons of copper copper ores
