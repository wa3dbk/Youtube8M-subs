of<00:01:11.070> those<00:01:11.250> things<00:01:11.490> together<00:01:11.640> were<00:01:12.060> brilliant

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of those things together were brilliant

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:25.820 
of those things together were brilliant

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so John just did playing a beat making

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.959 
so John just did playing a beat making
it<00:01:25.979> feel<00:01:26.250> good<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:28.189> simple<00:01:29.189> beat<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
it feel good a simple beat that is and

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.760 
it feel good a simple beat that is and
making<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.329> feel<00:01:30.600> good<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.469> applies<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
making it feel good but it applies to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.349 
making it feel good but it applies to
any<00:01:32.070> beat<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:32.460> playing<00:01:32.729> any<00:01:32.880> style<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
any beat you're playing any style of

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.730 
any beat you're playing any style of
music

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
music

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.819 
music
picking<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.859> right<00:01:35.039> beat<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> song

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829

keeping time making it feel amazing and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.789 
keeping time making it feel amazing and
then<00:01:41.789> you<00:01:41.969> add<00:01:42.210> creative<00:01:42.990> things<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
then you add creative things to that and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.219 
then you add creative things to that and
that's<00:01:43.920> been<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.700> philosophy<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:45.479> 30<00:01:45.899> years

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that's been my philosophy for 30 years

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.980 
that's been my philosophy for 30 years
the<00:01:47.009> four<00:01:47.249> things<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:47.700> beat<00:01:47.939> time<00:01:48.270> groove<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the four things are beat time groove and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.830 
the four things are beat time groove and
creativity<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.249> take<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> beat<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.179> you<00:01:51.630> play

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
creativity you take a beat and you play

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
creativity you take a beat and you play
the<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.170> beat<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> song<00:01:53.270> keep<00:01:54.270> time

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the right beat for the song keep time

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.709 
the right beat for the song keep time
your<00:01:55.109> first<00:01:55.319> two<00:01:55.590> beats<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> play<00:01:56.310> is

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
your first two beats that you play is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.719 
your first two beats that you play is
defining<00:01:57.719> tempo

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
defining tempo

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
defining tempo
once<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.090> you've<00:02:00.479> defined<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
once you do that you've defined a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.959 
once you do that you've defined a
measurement<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.799> time<00:02:02.039> you<00:02:02.249> would<00:02:02.369> reproduce

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
measurement of time you would reproduce

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.819 
measurement of time you would reproduce
that<00:02:03.359> you<00:02:03.569> repeat<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.229> over<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.560> over<00:02:04.649> again

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that you repeat it over and over again

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.800 
that you repeat it over and over again
then<00:02:05.039> you've<00:02:05.159> got<00:02:05.340> steady<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> next

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
then you've got steady time but the next

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.160 
then you've got steady time but the next
thing<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> feel<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.240> then<00:02:09.240> feel<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.840> your

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
thing is feel and then feel is your

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.900 
thing is feel and then feel is your
personality<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:10.950> what<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.160> put<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
personality and what you put into it and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.970 
personality and what you put into it and
that's<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.180> made<00:02:12.900> John<00:02:13.230> Bonham<00:02:13.710> sound

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
that's what made John Bonham sound

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.660 
that's what made John Bonham sound
amazing<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:15.510> there's<00:02:15.690> no<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.960> could<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.470> know

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
amazing and there's no I could you know

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.890 
amazing and there's no I could you know
infinite<00:02:17.670> enough<00:02:17.850> every<00:02:18.180> drummer<00:02:18.450> sounds

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
infinite enough every drummer sounds

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.809 
infinite enough every drummer sounds
unique<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> that's<00:02:20.160> what<00:02:20.370> makes<00:02:20.550> every

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
unique and that's what makes every

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.850 
unique and that's what makes every
drummer<00:02:21.090> special<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.680> add

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
drummer special and then you add

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.420 
drummer special and then you add
creative<00:02:23.400> ideas<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:25.430> how

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
creative ideas to that and that's how

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.360 
creative ideas to that and that's how
you<00:02:26.490> can<00:02:26.819> make<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.270> simplest<00:02:27.780> beat<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:29.160> so

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you can make the simplest beat have so

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.230 
you can make the simplest beat have so
much<00:02:29.490> value

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240
