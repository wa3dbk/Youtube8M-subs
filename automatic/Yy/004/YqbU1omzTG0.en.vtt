00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.700
 a power supply is almost too big is there 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.080
 So pack that fast and then 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.150
 desk then i had at least 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.460
 Lay down on the floor and we want 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 in the end only this little one 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.240
 connection cable up here it will be to the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.289
 Even then we'll watch it 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.269
 The same looks much better 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.380
 out as the black block we 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.180
 had just in hand 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.510
 I take the tomb and show you 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.070
 behind the connections first from the left 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.660
 I have an ethernet here 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 connection then I have firewire 800 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.559
 then I have twice soon found there must 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.879
 you know one of them will be the friend 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.469
 connection from the mac needed so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.969
 one remains or I can not 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 should still attach with five more 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.140
 equipment then I have a higher one here 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.809
 output like the jack microphone input 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 miniklinke three times usb and just that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.410
 Connection for the power supply is straight 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.210
 have seen here to the usb connection 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.530
 you also have to know that you only with 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.940
 be supplied with power then mac 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.039
 dranhängen that is if you an iphone 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.140
 Running to load it only then 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.609
 charge current am the thunderbolt pressure too 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.650
 connected to the mac 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.090
 that's such a car power of modeste 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.400
 some probably save energy 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.900
 It is also very practical to be there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.520
 it must know if you have an iphone 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.560
 just wants to load gets only then electricity 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.900
 am also a way to the dock dranhängt 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 down here the groove I explain to you 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.619
 the same, so I thought at the beginning 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.299
 this is the offer cable 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.619
 plugged in on the product photos looks 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.130
 it always does, but it is not 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.020
 case 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.540
 you pull the offer cable down here 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.369
 through the back and could then 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.409
 that is nice enough 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.540
 We pull out so much cable in the front 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.280
 So that's what you need on the desk 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.290
 is for me the biggest and best effect 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.490
 from the whole thing that I did this 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.619
 I mess with myself on the desk 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.270
 that everything is once nicely installed 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.770
 once it is cleared away and me 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.659
 after that live a cable with 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.920
 I connect and have my macbook 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.860
 behind the scanner has a turn 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.390
 printer's turn has network on it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 whatever I have still a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 panda bolt cable from belkin look 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.329
 Of course it does not have to fit like that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.829
 from the balcony of his is a standard me 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.180
 have the cable organic at the on the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.710
 website found that have with 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.060
 will be sent soon in the trade 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.619
 be available accounts of apple 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.600
 buy apple once with a half 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.099
 meter 1 with two meters just looks 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.470
 how much your desk needs 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.960
 that's why it comes in there and not 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.580
 Let's pull that down here 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.020
 nice in the one he wants one once 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.560
 is a gumming in there that's yours 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.360
 car stops in there and if it is in there 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.460
 then it can be that way up here 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.570
 pull out 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.670
 The front here then just so much 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.650
 cable out as you need around one 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.870
 macbook and then have 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.370
 behind your complete cable set up 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.630
 this beautiful on the table somewhere 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.310
 can pack or right behind 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.470
 can enclose under the table edge 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.020
 but as I said so for me this was 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.400
 this order that the largest of 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.200
 the pressure, of course, I can do anything 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.940
 others with other hubs and distributors 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.260
 make but I have a interest 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.850
 cable we were so I come with 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.290
 notebook and desktops puts it 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.860
 a thing maybe the charging cable 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.620
 ran 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.160
 and it does not work very cheap 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.410
 but super comfortable and comfortable and 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.430
 actually quite chic sander 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.430
 bulldog by belkin
