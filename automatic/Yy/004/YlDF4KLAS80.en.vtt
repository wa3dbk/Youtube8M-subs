00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.940 
feel like it's extra reinforced when you
can<00:03:11.120> snap<00:03:11.389> on<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.780> front<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.349> just<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.709> just

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
can snap on the front and it just I just

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.470 
can snap on the front and it just I just
feel<00:03:13.129> like<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.519> back<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.120> much<00:03:14.299> more

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
feel like the back is so much more

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.030 
feel like the back is so much more
secure<00:03:14.840> when<00:03:15.049> there's<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.290> front<00:03:15.530> piece

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
secure when there's a front piece

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.409 
secure when there's a front piece
holding<00:03:16.609> it<00:03:16.700> on<00:03:16.879> and<00:03:17.859> it<00:03:18.859> is<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.069> pretty<00:03:19.699> like<00:03:20.150> it

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
holding it on and it is a pretty like it
