that<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.620> full<00:00:37.950> fullness<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> things<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that the full fullness of things like a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.720 
that the full fullness of things like a
nice<00:00:39.480> glass<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.870> wine<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.340> doesn't<00:00:41.610> have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
nice glass of wine if it doesn't have

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.170 
nice glass of wine if it doesn't have
fullness<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.420> richness<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.110> blah<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
fullness and richness it's blah but that

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299 
fullness and richness it's blah but that
has<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.390> nice<00:00:45.809> ring<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.070> beer

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
has that nice ring here you get beer

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
has that nice ring here you get beer
there's<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.640> nice<00:00:47.820> sound<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.140> up

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
there's a nice sound up there and up

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
there's a nice sound up there and up
here<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.980> getting<00:00:50.430> too<00:00:50.640> close<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.270> piece

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
here I'm getting too close to this piece

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
here I'm getting too close to this piece
here<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> go<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.890> dead

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
here so it's going to go a little dead

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
here so it's going to go a little dead
because<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.579> compressed<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.960> I'm

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
because it's compressed there now I'm

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.600 
because it's compressed there now I'm
going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> same<00:00:56.160> thing<00:00:56.430> with

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
going to do the same thing with

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
going to do the same thing with
compression<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.809> actually<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> hold

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
compression I'm actually going to hold

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
compression I'm actually going to hold
the<00:00:59.250> neck<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.940> white<00:01:00.180> white<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.020> hand

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the neck with white white with one hand

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
the neck with white white with one hand
I<00:01:01.500> put<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.129> about<00:01:02.190> 30<00:01:02.579> 40<00:01:02.969> pounds<00:01:03.329> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I put up what about 30 40 pounds of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.140 
I put up what about 30 40 pounds of
pressure<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.710> here's<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.939> can

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
pressure on it but here's it if you can

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.929 
pressure on it but here's it if you can
simulate<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.900> slight<00:01:07.439> truss<00:01:08.280> rod<00:01:08.549> sound

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
simulate it just slight truss rod sound

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.539 
simulate it just slight truss rod sound
on<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.530> they're<00:01:10.530> down<00:01:10.830> where<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.189> were<00:01:11.340> before

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
on it they're down where we were before

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.020 
on it they're down where we were before
and<00:01:12.590> I'll<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.909> I'll

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and I'll do this one more time and I'll

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.240 
and I'll do this one more time and I'll
do<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.450> each<00:01:15.600> fret<00:01:15.990> wit<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.920> now

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
do it at each fret wit and with that now

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
do it at each fret wit and with that now
there's<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.970> above<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:19.170> press

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
there's up above I can actually press

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
there's up above I can actually press
harder<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:20.880> make<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.270> away<00:01:21.299> more

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
harder and actually make it go away more

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.749 
harder and actually make it go away more
but<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> said<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.830> can't<00:01:23.159> push<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> are

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
but like I said I can't push that are

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.539 
but like I said I can't push that are
maybe<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.509> weak<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.140> old<00:01:25.320> age<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.400> as

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
maybe and weak in my old age here but as

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
maybe and weak in my old age here but as
you<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> neck<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.170> notice<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.710> there

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you go up the neck you notice that there

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.160 
you go up the neck you notice that there
isn't<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.430> ring<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.909> heard<00:01:30.119> before<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
isn't that ring we heard before you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.990 
isn't that ring we heard before you
don't<00:01:31.350> hear<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.560> nice<00:01:31.920> rich<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.640> sound

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
don't hear that nice rich would sound

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
don't hear that nice rich would sound
that<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.329> were<00:01:33.509> hearing<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:34.380> listen<00:01:34.799> when<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that we were hearing now listen when I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
that we were hearing now listen when I
take<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.400> hand<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.329> from

take my hand off I'm going to go from
down<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> net<00:01:37.259> well<00:01:37.439> I'll<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
down the net well I'll go back up the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.539 
down the net well I'll go back up the
net<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.310> neck
