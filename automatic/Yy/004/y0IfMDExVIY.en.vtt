00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.420
 I started dancing when I was 15 years old. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:15.210
 so it sort of happened and I ended up 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.180
 I really liked it, I never stopped and I 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.720
 I did not think it could be my 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 profession is daily is very difficult 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.330
 because it is is that is a daily fight 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.700
 even with your body that nobody 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.660
 born, it was done, we try to 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.670
 put a technique that is difficult and does not 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.030
 you can stop 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.110
 and for me without my family without 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.329
 my friends 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:53.000
 the teachers who have supported me so far 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.000
 none of this would have become a love 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:02.399
 I took the class and I passed 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.460
 hence our really was a fan too 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.670
 I do not sleep, waiting for the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.760
 result that until ten in the morning with 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.900
 this new one since they come back before 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.869
 there was so everyday thinking here 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.740
 today was singing it and making it 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.670
 evolve both technically and 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.100
 spiritually well balanced for 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.070
 do things another question 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.480
 Our job is cool and for me now. 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:41.110
 Ballerina is taking a picture of me with 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.980
 record or write anything that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.780
 I wrote about dancing over a 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:54.280
 lesson now formulated by bolshoi 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.310
 I go, I go to beautiful horizon to do 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.080
 classes there is a wonderful place I 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.520
 Did not know that I wanted to get there. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.700
 here then it is as if every day the sun it 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.950
 Changing like this today I know that I 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.980
 I feel complete and the art comes 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.459

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.470

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:26.350

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.740

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.230
 things and influence others
