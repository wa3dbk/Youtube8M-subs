flux<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:34.890> obviously<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> have

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
flux so you are obviously going to have

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.069 
flux so you are obviously going to have
your<00:00:35.820> hand<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.630> wherever<00:00:36.809> you

place your hand anywhere else on the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.209 
place your hand anywhere else on the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
stick it's going it's start the cake

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.180 
stick it's going it's start the cake
point<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.059> part<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
point at that part just just like that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.540 
point at that part just just like that
it<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> 260<00:00:45.629> flex<00:00:45.930> stick<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.489> be

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it is a 260 flex stick but don't be

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
it is a 260 flex stick but don't be
fooled<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.390> Pro<00:00:48.600> Stock<00:00:48.660> flux<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.620> than

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
fooled the Pro Stock flux is very than

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.680 
fooled the Pro Stock flux is very than
the<00:00:49.980> regular<00:00:50.190> flexes<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:52.520> guess<00:00:53.520> 260<00:00:54.270> flux<00:00:54.539> will

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the regular flexes I guess 260 flux will

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.590 
the regular flexes I guess 260 flux will
be<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> 95<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.460> higher<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.940> higher

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
be about a 95 so the higher the higher

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
be about a 95 so the higher the higher
the<00:00:57.870> Flex<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.379> lesser<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the Flex the lesser it's going to be the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
the Flex the lesser it's going to be the
lower<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.940> height<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> harder<00:01:01.109> stronger

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
lower the height the harder stronger

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.320 
lower the height the harder stronger
flexed<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:04.549> it<00:01:05.549> takes<00:01:05.610> tapered

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
flexed is going to be it takes tapered

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
flexed is going to be it takes tapered
