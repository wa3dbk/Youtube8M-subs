well to make sure that make sure that it
actually<00:01:51.590> installs<00:01:52.250> onto<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.700> because<00:01:52.789> you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
actually installs onto it because you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.179 
actually installs onto it because you
talk<00:01:53.149> about<00:01:53.239> memory<00:01:53.689> just<00:01:53.810> won't<00:01:54.049> work<00:01:54.229> I'd

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
talk about memory just won't work I'd

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.130 
talk about memory just won't work I'd
advise<00:01:55.489> doing<00:01:55.880> this<00:01:55.969> with<00:01:56.179> some<00:01:56.719> other<00:01:56.869> games

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
advise doing this with some other games

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.839 
advise doing this with some other games
older<00:01:57.649> games<00:01:57.860> maybe<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.489> have<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.759> you

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
older games maybe that you have that you

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.380 
older games maybe that you have that you
still<00:01:59.060> play<00:01:59.299> like<00:01:59.569> maybe<00:01:59.780> modern<00:02:00.049> warfare<00:02:00.289> 2

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
still play like maybe modern warfare 2

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.669 
still play like maybe modern warfare 2
which<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.509> about<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.020> break<00:02:03.200> ground<00:02:03.409> thing

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
which is about to break ground thing

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.819 
which is about to break ground thing
like<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:04.689> which<00:02:05.689> it's<00:02:06.229> well<00:02:06.469> worth<00:02:06.709> it

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
like that which it's well worth it

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:07.869 
like that which it's well worth it
