00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:17.533
 We were preparing for this match 3 weeks. 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.742
 we know this team and we know their strengths 

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:28.249
 sensationally we played the first 20 minutes 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:35.498
 we ran 7 goals, we got everything and we did not let them counterattack. 

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:42.944
 this is a good team and that's why at some point they caught their rhythm 

00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:47.871
 they showed their strong defense and counterattacks and they really lived through it throughout the match. 

00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:50.830
 yes, definitely a good meeting. The Bundesliga team, the second place in the table 

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:55.557
 they gave us difficult conditions. We were better than 4 goals from which we are happy 

00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:58.806
 now we have to think about the Monday match. 

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:06.693
 We started this match very well. We've already run 7 goals 

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:11.366
 defense worked very well like an attack 

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:11.366
 defense worked very well like an attack 

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:21.020
 RNL later played a little better in defense and scored important goals from contra 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:30.344
 12 goals from a counter-attack is definitely too much and we have to get back to defense in the next match. 

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:46.000
 we won 4 goals and it is a good result. We're going to Mannheim now and we have to think to win. 

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:51.380
 the result +4 is an advance payment. We must go to Rhein Neckar after winning. 

00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:58.140
 our assumption is this - win the second game. We know that it is very difficult to do 

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:02.730
 we can see what this team can do, but it seems to me that we can afford to fight. 

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:05.830
 Of course I believe that. We are going there for victory.
