00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.759 
mastered the art of leveling up in this
game<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.019> figured<00:00:13.320> i<00:00:13.380> would<00:00:13.500> show<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.620> guys

and<00:00:23.789> quick<00:00:23.939> draw<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.359> know<00:00:24.930> some<00:00:25.170> players<00:00:25.350> use

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and quick draw I know some players use

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.109 
and quick draw I know some players use
them<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.949> they're<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.310> can't<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:26.910> get

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
them and they're like I can't really get

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.540 
them and they're like I can't really get
the<00:00:27.180> hang<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.289> maybe<00:00:28.470> maybe<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.310> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the hang of it so maybe maybe not but in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.189 
the hang of it so maybe maybe not but in
my<00:00:29.699> opinion<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.449> move<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> map<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
my opinion like you can move the map the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
my opinion like you can move the map the
fastest<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.099> um<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> really

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
fastest with that um this is a really

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.819 
fastest with that um this is a really
fast-paced<00:00:33.660> game<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.079> being<00:00:34.530> able<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> move

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
fast-paced game so being able to move

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
fast-paced game so being able to move
fast<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.370> definitely<00:00:35.760> an<00:00:35.850> advantage<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:37.200> best

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
fast is definitely an advantage the best

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.750 
fast is definitely an advantage the best
game<00:00:37.530> mode<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> level<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> hard<00:00:38.550> point

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
game mode to level up in is hard point

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
game mode to level up in is hard point
so<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.570> rock<00:00:39.840> flak<00:00:40.110> jacket<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.559> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so I do rock flak jacket for that you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.930 
so I do rock flak jacket for that you
can<00:00:41.129> level<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> faster<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
can level up the faster you know you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.069 
can level up the faster you know you
could<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> hill<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.809> take

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
could be in the hill you can take

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
could be in the hill you can take
grenades<00:00:43.379> take<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:43.770> left<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.190> am<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
grenades take them left and right am I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.010 
grenades take them left and right am I
used<00:00:44.879> blind<00:00:45.090> eye<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.629> no

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
used blind eye because there's really no

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
used blind eye because there's really no
other<00:00:46.200> perk<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.129> necessary<00:00:47.280> my

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
other perk to that's really necessary my

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.069 
other perk to that's really necessary my
opinion<00:00:48.000> i<00:00:48.059> use<00:00:48.210> toughness<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.989> know

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
opinion i use toughness because you know

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.410 
opinion i use toughness because you know
you<00:00:49.140> gotta<00:00:49.289> win<00:00:49.410> gunfights<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> i<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.090> blast

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you gotta win gunfights and i use blast

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
you gotta win gunfights and i use blast
suppressor<00:00:51.510> blast<00:00:51.960> pressure<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.410> probably

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
suppressor blast pressure is probably

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.260 
suppressor blast pressure is probably
the<00:00:53.160> best<00:00:53.340> perk<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> game<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.149> just

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the best perk in the game you can just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.549 
the best perk in the game you can just
hop<00:00:54.390> around<00:00:54.660> nobody<00:00:54.930> knows<00:00:55.170> where<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:55.440> at

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
hop around nobody knows where you're at

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.200 
hop around nobody knows where you're at
it<00:00:55.800> silences<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> noise<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.940> jetpack

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it silences the noise of your jetpack

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170 
it silences the noise of your jetpack
stuff<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> XO<00:00:59.760> ability

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
stuff like that and then the XO ability

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.830 
stuff like that and then the XO ability
you<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.840> use<00:01:00.989> XO<00:01:02.210> overclock<00:01:03.210> XO

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you have to use XO overclock XO

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.000 
you have to use XO overclock XO
overclock<00:01:04.199> makes<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.619> able<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> run

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
overclock makes you be able to run

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.530 
overclock makes you be able to run
faster<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.460> kind<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.700> marathon<00:01:06.150> really

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
faster it's kind of like marathon really

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810 
faster it's kind of like marathon really
really<00:01:06.689> solid<00:01:06.960> perk<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
really solid perk and then I use for the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.380 
really solid perk and then I use for the
streaks<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.479> use<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.200> UAV<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.460> support<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.150> when

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
streaks I use a UAV with support so when

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.370 
streaks I use a UAV with support so when
you<00:01:12.450> die<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> still<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you die you know you still get that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.670 
you die you know you still get that
streak<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.890> spawn<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.180> use

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
streak when you spawn up and then I use

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.510 
streak when you spawn up and then I use
extra<00:01:16.680> assists<00:01:16.920> points<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.250> instead<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
extra assists points so instead of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.859 
extra assists points so instead of
getting<00:01:17.640> 10<00:01:17.939> points<00:01:18.270> every<00:01:18.420> time<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.810> an

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
getting 10 points every time I get an

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
getting 10 points every time I get an
assist<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.229> UAV<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.740> 15<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
assist with my UAV I get 15 and then the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.749 
assist with my UAV I get 15 and then the
other<00:01:21.000> sugar<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.360> use<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.799> system<00:01:22.799> hack<00:01:22.979> system

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
other sugar I use is system hack system

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.429 
other sugar I use is system hack system
hack<00:01:23.880> basically<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.229> it's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hack basically is like a it's like it's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.840 
hack basically is like a it's like it's
kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.860> EMP<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.729> bit

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
kind of like an EMP it's a little bit

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.520 
kind of like an EMP it's a little bit
more<00:01:26.970> opie<00:01:27.330> than<00:01:27.509> an<00:01:27.600> EMP<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.080> opinion<00:01:28.259> puts

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
more opie than an EMP in my opinion puts

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.600 
more opie than an EMP in my opinion puts
a<00:01:28.590> big<00:01:28.710> black<00:01:28.950> thing<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> middle<00:01:29.400> their

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
a big black thing in the middle their

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.399 
a big black thing in the middle their
screen<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:29.909> can't<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.270> anything<00:01:30.450> it's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
screen they can't see anything it's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.899 
screen they can't see anything it's
really<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.070> aids<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.579> called<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.850> on

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
really really aids to get called in on

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.670 
really really aids to get called in on
you<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.930> assist<00:01:34.200> points<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.560> as

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you but I use assist points on that as

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.929 
you but I use assist points on that as
well<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.040> getting<00:01:35.220> 15<00:01:35.520> points<00:01:35.759> every<00:01:35.909> time

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
well so I'm getting 15 points every time

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.670 
well so I'm getting 15 points every time
my<00:01:36.150> enemy<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.840> teammate<00:01:37.320> kill<00:01:37.500> somebody

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
my enemy or my teammate kill somebody

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
my enemy or my teammate kill somebody
with<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.430> 15<00:01:38.759> points<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.090> UAV<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
with that up and 15 points to my UAV so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.569 
with that up and 15 points to my UAV so
that<00:01:40.110> points<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.619> know<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:40.890> add<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.220> really

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that points you know they add up really

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.030 
that points you know they add up really
really<00:01:41.729> quickly<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
really quickly when it's going like that

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.200 
really quickly when it's going like that
but<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.159> bit<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> basically<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.060> class

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
but that bit that basically is a class

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
but that bit that basically is a class
setup<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> use<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.950> solid

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
setup that I use really really solid

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.730 
setup that I use really really solid
