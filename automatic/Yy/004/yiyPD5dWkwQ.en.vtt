headset<00:00:18.680> I've<00:00:18.860> seen<00:00:19.280> the<00:00:19.730> headset<00:00:20.060> is<00:00:20.150> quite

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
headset I've seen the headset is quite

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.080 
headset I've seen the headset is quite
large<00:00:20.780> and<00:00:21.020> comes<00:00:21.170> in<00:00:21.320> at<00:00:21.410> 320<00:00:22.250> grams<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:22.880> yet

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
large and comes in at 320 grams and yet

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.240 
large and comes in at 320 grams and yet
despite<00:00:23.240> weighing<00:00:23.840> this<00:00:24.110> much<00:00:24.410> they<00:00:24.890> are<00:00:24.920> very

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
despite weighing this much they are very

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.370 
despite weighing this much they are very
comfortable<00:00:25.700> to<00:00:25.910> wear<00:00:26.120> for<00:00:26.600> long<00:00:26.930> periods<00:00:27.320> of

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
comfortable to wear for long periods of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.770 
comfortable to wear for long periods of
time<00:00:27.490> this<00:00:28.490> is<00:00:28.670> partly<00:00:29.030> due<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:29.510> really

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
time this is partly due to the really

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.750 
time this is partly due to the really
soft<00:00:30.020> padding<00:00:30.410> that<00:00:30.530> is<00:00:30.590> on<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.130> headset<00:00:31.580> and

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
soft padding that is on the headset and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.270 
soft padding that is on the headset and
the<00:00:32.660> part<00:00:33.020> of<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.199> headset<00:00:33.530> that<00:00:33.710> rests<00:00:34.100> on

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the part of the headset that rests on

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.340 
the part of the headset that rests on
your<00:00:34.460> heads<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:35.000> not<00:00:35.210> actually<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.630> mainframe

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
your heads is not actually the mainframe

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.610 
your heads is not actually the mainframe
this<00:00:36.920> helps<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.430> for<00:00:37.880> your<00:00:38.030> weightless<00:00:38.930> the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
this helps it for your weightless the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.410 
this helps it for your weightless the
ear<00:00:39.800> cups<00:00:40.070> are<00:00:40.220> also<00:00:40.370> extremely<00:00:40.910> comfortable

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
ear cups are also extremely comfortable

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.240 
ear cups are also extremely comfortable
and<00:00:41.720> I<00:00:42.050> think<00:00:42.230> Asus<00:00:42.560> have<00:00:42.710> done<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.890> great<00:00:43.130> job

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
and I think Asus have done a great job

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.580 
and I think Asus have done a great job
on<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.730> padding<00:00:44.030> on<00:00:44.149> this<00:00:44.300> headset<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:45.020> also

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
on the padding on this headset it also

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.620 
on the padding on this headset it also
helps<00:00:45.920> that<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.310> is<00:00:46.460> an<00:00:46.579> ovary<00:00:46.970> a<00:00:47.120> headset

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
helps that this is an ovary a headset

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.910 
helps that this is an ovary a headset
which<00:00:47.780> means<00:00:48.020> that<00:00:48.200> your<00:00:48.380> ears<00:00:48.559> won't<00:00:48.739> be

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
which means that your ears won't be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.319 
which means that your ears won't be
hurting<00:00:49.130> from<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.520> headset<00:00:49.850> were<00:00:49.940> resting<00:00:50.210> on

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
hurting from the headset were resting on

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.440 
hurting from the headset were resting on
your<00:00:50.480> ears<00:00:50.690> felt<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.230> long<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.970> also<00:00:52.970> this

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
your ears felt so long and also this

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.880 
your ears felt so long and also this
helps<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.750> become<00:00:53.840> immersed<00:00:54.200> in<00:00:54.500> your<00:00:54.530> game

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
helps you become immersed in your game

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.520 
helps you become immersed in your game
or<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.430> music<00:00:55.700> that<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:55.969> are<00:00:56.059> listening<00:00:56.390> to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
or the music that you are listening to

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.900 
or the music that you are listening to
another<00:00:57.530> great<00:00:57.860> design<00:00:58.160> feature<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.730> that

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
another great design feature is that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.180 
another great design feature is that
this<00:00:59.090> headset<00:00:59.480> has<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.630> braided<00:00:59.989> cable<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:01.070> may

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
this headset has a braided cable it may

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.920 
this headset has a braided cable it may
not<00:01:01.340> seem<00:01:01.520> like<00:01:01.730> much<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:01.969> I<00:01:02.300> think<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.690> braided

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
not seem like much but I think a braided

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.929 
not seem like much but I think a braided
cable<00:01:03.050> is<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:03.440> lot<00:01:03.710> nicer<00:01:03.950> than<00:01:04.189> a<00:01:04.460> plastic<00:01:04.850> or

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
cable is a lot nicer than a plastic or

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.029 
cable is a lot nicer than a plastic or
rubber<00:01:05.239> one<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.200> fact<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.799> cable

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
rubber one and the fact that the cable

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.010 
rubber one and the fact that the cable
is<00:01:07.069> braided<00:01:07.609> helps<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.329> become<00:01:08.630> tangled

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
is braided helps it to become tangled

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.319 
is braided helps it to become tangled
less<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:10.159> longest<00:01:10.520> cable<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.969> will<00:01:11.090> find

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
less and the longest cable you will find

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.059 
less and the longest cable you will find
