00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 no no 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.130
 my name is paola ricaurte I am 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.930
 research professor of the department 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.960
 cultural studies tec 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.960
 monterrey 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:20.789
 and sometimes we're trying to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.039
 use social networks for purposes 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.380
 beyond entertainment or what 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.230
 Social 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.289
 we can have some tools that 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.029
 they help us build a profile 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.250
 professional and systematize the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.470
 information about us in the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.140
 network in such a way that when someone 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.030
 want to know things about us no longer 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.690
 both on a personal level but rather 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.340
 Professional can easily find it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.650
 one of those networks for example can be 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.900
 linkedin there are other types of networks 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.850
 specialized according to the area in 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.120
 that everyone is for example for the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.120
 academics from this point edu academy 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.870
 but if we talk about a profession 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.480
 anyone 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.570
 linkedin can be a good space for 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.090
 that one builds a personal identity 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.729
 in more formal terms and that you can 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.590
 put everything we want in the network 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.800
 others know about us in terms 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.830
 of what our achievements have been 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.909
 our what are our skills 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.490
 how can we 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.210
 connect direct evidence of our 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.929
 work or previous experiences of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.880
 other places where there may be also 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.420
 traces of our work in such a way 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.659
 that the people at the time of 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.149
 do a search have in a single 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.679
 Space all the information at hand and 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.030
 from there they can also obviously go 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.549
 to other places to look for more 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.250
 information then it is important to 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.810
 Sometimes we do not see it much but it is 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.239
 important to build the information of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.020
 so that it is simple 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:01.610
 that defines our strengths 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.050
 basically and that of the place also to 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.240
 that other people can see that profile 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.270
 and on the other hand we take advantage of 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.610
 connections that we have for 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.960
 get to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.250
 known resources for example if you 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.210
 you know how to program the searches you can 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.470
 have a weekly report let's say 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.240
 work in your specific area and that you 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.340
 can also help against work and 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.520
 see how your network is connected 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.940
 to get the job more easily 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.340
 So the idea is that using the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.110
 existing platforms can be this or 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.680
 can be others we go 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:55.480
 building a professional profile a 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.400
 digital identity that allows the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.100
 information that is in the network be the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.020
 information that we want 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.650
 appears that is when someone performs 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.980
 a search for us have greater 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.080
 possibilities of what 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.920
 what he finds is what we 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.920
 we want you to find
