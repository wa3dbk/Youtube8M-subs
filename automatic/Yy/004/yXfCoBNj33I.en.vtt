us through a family member interpreter

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.859 
us through a family member interpreter
that<00:01:26.729> she<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.060> fact<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.479> had<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> same

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
problem about six months earlier was

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840 
problem about six months earlier was
seen<00:01:30.810> us<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.049> her<00:01:31.110> Hospital<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.430> fact<00:01:32.670> had

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
seen us at her Hospital and in fact had

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
seen us at her Hospital and in fact had
undergone<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> cardiac<00:01:33.810> catheterization<00:01:34.110> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
undergone a cardiac catheterization I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
undergone a cardiac catheterization I
had<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> facility<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:37.049> were<00:01:37.590> able<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
had that facility so we were able to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.830 
had that facility so we were able to
actually<00:01:38.369> obtain<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.119> results<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
actually obtain the results of that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.880 
actually obtain the results of that
cardiac<00:01:40.320> cath<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.950> report<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.500> found<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
cardiac cath a report and found that

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
cardiac cath a report and found that
interesting<00:01:44.159> enough<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.640> patient<00:01:45.240> had

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
interesting enough the patient had

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.710 
interesting enough the patient had
indeed<00:01:46.259> had<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> same<00:01:46.890> problem<00:01:47.340> there<00:01:47.720> had

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
indeed had the same problem there had

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
indeed had the same problem there had
this<00:01:48.899> test<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.590> fact<00:01:49.829> was<00:01:50.070> found<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this test and in fact was found not to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
this test and in fact was found not to
have<00:01:51.170> significant<00:01:52.170> coronary<00:01:52.619> heart<00:01:52.770> disease

have significant coronary heart disease

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.510 
have significant coronary heart disease
and<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.649> based<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> results<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.340> our
