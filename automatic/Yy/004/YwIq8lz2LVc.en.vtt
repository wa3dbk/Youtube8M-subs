 passion 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.830
 the new princeton rs 10 is a tire 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.689
 with moto gp technology created for 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.550
 Enjoy on the most winding roads 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.550
 and occasionally on circuit 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.170
 his level of grip is excellent even 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.269
 in maximum inclination and acceleration 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.250
 Thanks to its innovative design 3d a 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.440
 more rigid casings and a new 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.480
 compound of the rear tire the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.290
 precision and confidence in every curve that 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.290
 we take 3 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.630
 in situations of less grip your 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.790
 performance is also perfect thank you 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.320
 to the speed it offers to reach its 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.320
 optimal work temperature 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 the circuit also the new rs 10 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.100
 offers great braking stability 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.679
 maximum tilt angle as well as the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.420
 exit from the curves its agility and 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.880
 response in address changes is 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.459
 fantastic making the piloting 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.459
 easy very fun and much safer 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.550

 in circuit the stoner brightness of that 10 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.970
 It is without a doubt the best available option 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.479
 in the market in its category that 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.479
 you wait to try it
