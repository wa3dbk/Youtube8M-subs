00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:03.710
 meal 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.290
 today I have turned off none percent 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.210
 on the one hand 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.210
 Cars z Andrack handmade knives 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.919
 and Euro the top Mentschow surprised by a Messerschmid and 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.159
 from my girlfriend and that 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.159
 I got a package 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.159
 with the knives poem wanted to do more of them 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.749
 and not in the evening with the first run 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.749
 that looked like this 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.200
 big car show you have imagined 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.429
 you see I have 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.130
 So what he says dato has made my mouth draw more of their take away 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.250
 should or should 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.520
 so that the problem is no longer% occurs that the cutting edge 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 too thin and thus would have bent or breaks away 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.550
 so far so good 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.650
 and then Choge Stocher continues into the bag at eight 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.120
 the good kind of gate 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 He gave me a second knife GEMA 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.660
 completely new 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.790
 to test 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.680
 and although he has here percent his own ideas a bit more pure 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.090
 percent where he thinks percent 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.890
 the percent 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 the knife will improve a lot 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.870
 first is 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.070
 a lot bigger than water 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.530
 what i am going to have since 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.530
 if you look so beautiful 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.910
 Furthermore 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.890
 it is a bit wider 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.070
 so they can 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.660
 from Austria old 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.380
 and also 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.729
 I knew cutting edge 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.400
 There is more like an ax now 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.190
 he tried it himself 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.250
 and percent 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160
 Andy Kapp and co 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.630
 nobody sees that did not spare 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.080
 and the knife has nothing left 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.030
 Clean is still impeccable 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 under 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880
 also very sharp 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 You can not shave well for that is not even thought 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:11.299
 but I am already 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.299
 pretty excited 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.059
 that they are more of themselves percent 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.170
 Once again the knife had been forged around Ben 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.909
 because he just in the hall that the us duo not all 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 quite my expectations and Caspar corresponded 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.469
 it already got through the first decision 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.599
 maybe you can outline more 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.559
 Let Manchester's new knives get done 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.299
 or keep my old one 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.489
 Questions about questions 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.959
 Cielo Filho songs a Bieler hand over tables with hoe 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.989
 Round yes 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.589
 if German bottles pleased 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.199
 I'm definitely looking forward to it 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.089
 to try the Moorish 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.559
 that's not all 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.429
 We know but Scheer is currently percent 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.369
 this fine piece 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.139
 as a percent 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.039
 Test with me 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.209
 I have already tested as Tommy Jürgen Ulrich Nies on average 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.539
 determine 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:14.049
 I'll leave a little time to pressure myself though 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.049
 Whenever I'm on the road I have to stay that way 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.399
 and then there was a packet 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.909
 and that's how it should look like 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.579
 after he has Roche push 1% 12 o'clock 74 euros 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
 101 will be soon 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.189
 highest quality on spring steel 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.089
 Biermann doctors 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.749
 Steel book reprint 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.499
 that's steel 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:48.450
 with the no are made in pipes so how do they like this track 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.940
 often they feathers 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.209
 for percent 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.809
 quality 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:55.199
 analogue rest 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.909
 when us team made a star 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.909
 that means in German this steel 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.719
 Iz unbelievable 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.479
 fine-grain 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.479
 and makes a very fine edge 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.599
 I had the percent now 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.779
 to get jesters 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.430
 Under the year I tried the spice on Drach Mali and it worked so 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.430
 manages that Anderlecht in the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.590
 Harrer picks up so ENSI Pocono way so 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.590
 right now, new tus-trainer Kay Rauber can be on it 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.330
 otherwise it is my next difficult decision 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.120
 a year 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.449
 the second renewal is over 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.719
 The Steel 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.719
 because the widest comparison 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.180
 not open tenths of a millimeter 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.180
 the grip is a little different 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.180
 a little quieter 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.479
 Then we have 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.889
 slightly different in front 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.779
 I've recorded the beveled 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.779
 and here sacred 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.509
 that has the advantage if I have a stone now 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.370
 and loop the knife behind 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.189
 I can with these 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.240
 just stay 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.939
 when this I do not have a clue 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:23.710
 Create shreks 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.099
 which one is now only in the year is not so bad because problems clean 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.509
 with the years so last forever but OK dat is just like that 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.419
 I'd rather erase that from you 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.429
 And so the tailor was always getting smaller around the Dinka 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.309
 Click yes 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.319
 I was not really bothered I found also look nice 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.610
 but the Finnish table is also very class 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.749
 that my second decision maker 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.749
 which ones take such 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.710
 either the couple from the same Stades percent him a big one from 10 m 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.650
 Wu Wei 5 and 25 19 logically 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.139
 I'm not sure 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.499
 Köppen contactor beat 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.210
 or stop 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.210
 this train Baroque value Chur 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.520
 her contact what to write what she would take 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.860
 that's the difference is a shingle 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.520
 Fine graininess and snowing performance 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.779
 that means they tore these gentlemen 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.379
 very very fine-grained 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:31.610
 So it gets razor-sharp 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.029
 and the tailor keeps the sharpness for a very long time 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.619
 These tore until here, Gruhl narrowly overlooked when I fresh 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:43.919
 honed HP open milder percent has deducted then he only shaves 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.729
 stop around even TuS paper cut hosts as very fast stump again 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.779
 if you work on it now for a short time you will remember 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.240
 but 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.289
 for the IG Freak I'll say how I am one 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.529
 it must be pretty sharp enough 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:02.719
 that was my surprise Mestan percent 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.719
 Bush soon did not expect it from the clouds of the vanity 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:08.089
 that I am here now Euro 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.039
 under 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.219
 be put under pressure on the photo of choice which knives fast 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.219
 and I have been happy about it myself 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.110
 all of that is completely off Red we'll see if then again 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.330
 and Porsche envy 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
 Hard pending videos in the near future 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.069
 see you later
