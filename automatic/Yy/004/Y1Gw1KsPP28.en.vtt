 rainfall can also lead to patronage 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.640
 especially in faults 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.280
 the intensity of the first to lose pasture influence 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.000
 the return of rainy days mainly at this time of year throughout the northeast 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.019
 increase accident numbers 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.689
 mainly because of wet and slippery slopes experts say that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.749
 this number is mainly sought in back collisions to the same rainfall 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.599
 event can also cause loss of car contact with sound 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.040
 to call the popularity the risk is greater in case of asphalt with much 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.500
 irregularity or garbage on this type of surface with the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.579
 not stop there is an accumulation of water consequently causing the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.370
 aquaplaning the danger is greater on the highways because of the speed at 100 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.960
 kilometers per hour the friction between the shank and the surface falls in half 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.129
 and the vehicle needs more distance to stop the lack of maintenance 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.260
 also increases the chances of the car losing contact with the ground 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.230
 the formation of long the pocket of water is not normal and the pavement well done 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.120
 warns engineers not even when heavy rain on the highways is a species 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.620
 of cover on the asphalt and tends to quickly throw out the accumulated water 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.820
 the climate of each region required adaptation of the highway project or 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.479
 streets 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.460
 where it rains more the pavement hard this one it needs much stronger structure 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.940
 generally on rainy days, drivers are more careful in 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.190
 In addition, there are others who prefer not to take such risks. 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.000
 conditions 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.630
 during the rainy season, double care is needed because 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.910
 security as to the physical integrity of its members. 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.520
 occupants with taking some precautions the situation may be less 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.710
 stressful and safer 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.750
 visibility on rainy days is compromised, so we should 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.420
 worrying instead of being seen turn on the low headlights independent of the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.980
 external lighting attention to the puddles of water they hide easily 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.890
 holes that can cause wheel breakage tire curtains suspension damage 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.709
 and loss of control of the vehicle phineas bald the consumption the low favors 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.910
 aquaplaning check the condition of the paraiba and the windshield wiper that

 The rear defroster is good visibility when it comes to 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.109
 make quick decisions 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.519
 at noon distance from the vehicle in front of you 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.340
 because of a sudden stop the time that your car takes to stop 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.539
 increases due to wet assault 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.559
 if you only have the option of crossing the flooded site only do so with full

 security remember that there is no depth of security but most 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.219
 of cases can go through floods as long as water does not
