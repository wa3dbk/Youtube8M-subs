those fancy heads and rainbows but
what's<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.879> cool<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> chair<00:00:49.649> over

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
what's really cool is on this chair over

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590 
what's really cool is on this chair over
here<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> tiny<00:00:50.610> pistol<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> does

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
here we have a tiny pistol but it does

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
here we have a tiny pistol but it does
not<00:00:51.719> swap<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.739> pistols<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.489> takes

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
not swap out with your pistols it takes

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
not swap out with your pistols it takes
a<00:00:54.090> slot<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.539> RPG<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.860> called<00:00:56.100> aloud

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
a slot of the RPG it's called aloud

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
a slot of the RPG it's called aloud
locust<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.449> believe<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> might<00:00:58.199> be

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
locust and I believe it might be

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.119 
locust and I believe it might be
inspired<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:59.180> my<00:01:00.180> own<00:01:00.359> yes<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.350> doesn't<00:01:01.530> blow

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
inspired by my own yes it doesn't blow

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.820 
inspired by my own yes it doesn't blow
these<00:01:02.340> things<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:03.170> but<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.229> believe<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.680> might

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
these things up but I believe it might

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.200 
these things up but I believe it might
be<00:01:04.979> inspired<00:01:05.339> by<00:01:05.489> men<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.790> blacks<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.180> little

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
be inspired by men and blacks a little

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
be inspired by men and blacks a little
pistol<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.960> incredibly<00:01:07.650> powerful

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
pistol that is incredibly powerful

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
pistol that is incredibly powerful

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
called the notice of treatment now you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
called the notice of treatment now you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
can shoot this guy over here I believe

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:21.070 
can shoot this guy over here I believe
that<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.689> Jim<00:01:13.320> boom<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.760> nothing

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.760 

I<00:01:21.140> was<00:01:21.830> expecting<00:01:22.460> some<00:01:22.700> sort<00:01:22.940> of

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
I was expecting some sort of

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.410 
I was expecting some sort of
to<00:01:24.100> appear<00:01:24.430> after

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.310 

or<00:01:28.410> perhaps<00:01:28.830> there<00:01:29.370> is<00:01:29.550> something<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
or perhaps there is something more to it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.210 
or perhaps there is something more to it
we'll<00:01:32.160> see<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:33.090> find

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
we'll see if I find

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.460 
we'll see if I find
but<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.120> don't<00:01:36.540> want<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.840> end<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.260> without

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
but I don't want to end this without

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.190 
but I don't want to end this without
showing<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.910> this<00:01:39.120> little<00:01:39.510> pistol<00:01:39.960> works

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
showing you how this little pistol works

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.630 
showing you how this little pistol works
so<00:01:40.410> let's<00:01:40.530> cut<00:01:40.890> outside<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.020> bring<00:01:43.020> out<00:01:43.230> that

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
so let's cut outside and bring out that

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.600 
so let's cut outside and bring out that
is<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.850> good<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:46.620> knocks<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.160> back<00:01:47.190> no

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
is that good it knocks you back no

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.130 
is that good it knocks you back no
matter<00:01:47.730> how<00:01:48.000> far<00:01:48.270> away<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.720> shots<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
matter how far away the shots that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.400 
matter how far away the shots that
you're<00:01:49.350> taking<00:01:49.760> are<00:01:50.760> but<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.050> it's

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
you're taking are but it's it's

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.540 
you're taking are but it's it's
incredibly<00:01:52.980> powerful

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
incredibly powerful

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.520 
incredibly powerful
just<00:01:54.240> seems<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.720> destroy<00:01:55.200> everything<00:01:55.590> that's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
just seems to destroy everything that's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
just seems to destroy everything that's
my<00:01:58.530> only<00:01:58.740> beef<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> weapon<00:01:59.790> at<00:01:59.910> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
my only beef with the weapon at this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
my only beef with the weapon at this
point<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:00.990> only<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.440> couple

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
point is that you only get a couple

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.340 
point is that you only get a couple
shots<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.200> wait

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
