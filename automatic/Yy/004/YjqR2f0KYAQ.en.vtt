00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
Tag Team Championships I think it should

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.969 
Tag Team Championships I think it should
be<00:01:40.490> rhodes<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.909> goldust<00:01:42.259> vs.<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> Big<00:01:43.709> Show

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
be rhodes and goldust vs. the Big Show

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.580 
be rhodes and goldust vs. the Big Show
and<00:01:44.249> Rey<00:01:45.060> Mysterio<00:01:45.539> as<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:45.959> a<00:01:45.990> great<00:01:46.409> much

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and Rey Mysterio as it was a great much

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.429 
and Rey Mysterio as it was a great much
I<00:01:46.770> thought<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.609> match<00:01:47.789> of<00:01:48.029> the<00:01:48.149> night<00:01:48.179> for<00:01:48.749> TLC

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I thought the match of the night for TLC

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.160 
I thought the match of the night for TLC
was<00:01:50.069> actually<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.700> match<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.179> fatal<00:01:51.779> 4-way

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
was actually that match the fatal 4-way

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.120 
was actually that match the fatal 4-way
a<00:01:52.639> canteen<00:01:53.639> match<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:55.259> fatal<00:01:55.590> 4-way<00:01:55.889> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
a canteen match the fatal 4-way and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.959 
a canteen match the fatal 4-way and
character<00:01:56.849> match<00:01:57.950> between<00:01:58.950> roads<00:01:59.459> and<00:01:59.849> all

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
character match between roads and all

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.609 
character match between roads and all
those<00:02:00.119> other<00:02:00.359> people<00:02:00.719> including<00:02:00.840> mysterion

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
those other people including mysterion

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.219 
those other people including mysterion
big<00:02:01.829> show<00:02:02.179> so<00:02:03.179> yeah<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.659> end<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> match

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
big show so yeah the end of the match

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.779 
big show so yeah the end of the match
was<00:02:04.439> brilliant<00:02:04.859> and<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.310> i<00:02:05.340> want<00:02:05.639> for

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
was brilliant and that's what i want for

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.190 
was brilliant and that's what i want for
Royal<00:02:06.029> Rumble<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.779> a<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.049> good

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
Royal Rumble to make it a really good

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.440 
Royal Rumble to make it a really good
match<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.220> yeah<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> think<00:02:08.970> however

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
match so yeah but I think however

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.470 
match so yeah but I think however
however<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> however<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> there

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
however there is a however in it there

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.870 
however there is a however in it there
is<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> buck<00:02:12.990> in<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.770> think<00:02:14.610> at<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.849> end

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
is a buck in it I think at the end

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.270 
is a buck in it I think at the end
probably<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.480> think<00:02:15.540> big<00:02:16.080> show<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.650> Mysterio

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
probably I think big show and Mysterio

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.720 
probably I think big show and Mysterio

for the WWE World Heavyweight
Championship<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.520> thought<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.060> had<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> feeling

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
Championship I thought I had a feeling

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.470 
Championship I thought I had a feeling
it<00:02:49.319> should<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.770> Orton<00:02:50.010> versus<00:02:50.580> Brock<00:02:50.910> Lesnar

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
it should be Orton versus Brock Lesnar

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.199 
it should be Orton versus Brock Lesnar
but<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.739> think<00:02:53.340> probably<00:02:53.459> at<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.850> end<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
but I think probably at the end of

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.320 
but I think probably at the end of
wausau<00:02:54.840> run<00:02:55.440> you'll<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.950> I'll<00:02:56.100> care<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.640> not

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
wausau run you'll do it I'll care on not

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.020 
wausau run you'll do it I'll care on not
only<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.720> put<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.170> not<00:02:58.440> only<00:02:58.739> Brian<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.820> also

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
only to put but not only Brian but also

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.470 
only to put but not only Brian but also
on<00:03:00.540> John<00:03:01.530> Cena<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.940> should<00:03:03.090> make<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.269> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
on John Cena so this should make it a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.910 
on John Cena so this should make it a
triple<00:03:03.840> threat<00:03:04.019> match<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.500> should<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.800> good

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
triple threat match it should be a good

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.130 
triple threat match it should be a good
match<00:03:05.160> because<00:03:05.370> Horton<00:03:05.940> should<00:03:06.120> be<00:03:06.269> retaining

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
match because Horton should be retaining

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.080 
match because Horton should be retaining
that<00:03:07.290> Matt<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.830> championship<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.880> John

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
that Matt the championship if it's John

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.750 
that Matt the championship if it's John
Cena<00:03:09.330> retaining<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.170> will<00:03:10.800> actually<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.310> so

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
Cena retaining it I will actually be so

annoyed I will be really really annoyed

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.670 
annoyed I will be really really annoyed
really<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:15.480> blind<00:03:15.780> I'll<00:03:16.140> be<00:03:16.290> happy<00:03:18.680> and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
really in this blind I'll be happy and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.370 
really in this blind I'll be happy and
then<00:03:20.010> last<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:21.420> least<00:03:21.480> actually<00:03:22.230> it's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
then last but not least actually it's

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.500 
then last but not least actually it's
not<00:03:22.530> last<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:22.890> not<00:03:23.010> least<00:03:23.069> i<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:23.459> there<00:03:24.300> was

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
not last but not least i think there was

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.780 
not last but not least i think there was
I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:25.010> every<00:03:26.010> year<00:03:26.250> there<00:03:26.459> should<00:03:26.640> be

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
I think every year there should be

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.690 
I think every year there should be
surprised<00:03:27.269> entries<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.560> WB<00:03:29.010> Royal<00:03:29.340> Rumble

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
2004 2014 match and for this year is

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.550 
2004 2014 match and for this year is
what<00:03:35.489> should<00:03:35.640> happen<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.060> same<00:03:36.269> now<00:03:37.049> starting

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
what should happen the same now starting

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.160 
what should happen the same now starting
off<00:03:37.709> at<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.950> back<00:03:38.329> Action<00:03:39.329> List<00:03:39.420> off<00:03:39.630> with<00:03:40.079> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
off at the back Action List off with the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.949 
off at the back Action List off with the
front<00:03:40.470> Chris<00:03:41.459> Jericho<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.090> think<00:03:42.390> every<00:03:42.720> month

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
front Chris Jericho I think every month

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.610 
front Chris Jericho I think every month
we<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.410> Chris<00:03:43.680> Jericho<00:03:44.130> just<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.730> know<00:03:45.620> go

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
we see Chris Jericho just you know go

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.190 
we see Chris Jericho just you know go
and<00:03:47.040> come<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.910> come<00:03:48.209> turn<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.810> his<00:03:48.900> leaves

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
and come go and come turn in his leaves

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.810 
and come go and come turn in his leaves
I<00:03:49.410> think<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:49.890> is<00:03:50.130> what's<00:03:50.340> going<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.579> happen

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
I think this is what's going to happen

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.539 
I think this is what's going to happen
with<00:03:50.970> him<00:03:51.209> puli<00:03:51.780> be<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.260> surprise<00:03:52.650> entry<00:03:53.130> and

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
with him puli be a surprise entry and

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.420 
with him puli be a surprise entry and
then<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.940> again<00:03:54.500> number<00:03:55.500> two<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.799> probably

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
then go again number two is probably

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.550 
then go again number two is probably
highly<00:03:56.820> not<00:03:57.120> likely<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:57.780> who<00:03:58.019> knows<00:03:58.230> what's

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
highly not likely but who knows what's

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.380 
highly not likely but who knows what's
going<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.769> happen<00:03:59.070> Evan<00:03:59.370> Bourne<00:03:59.579> poor<00:04:00.150> could

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
going to happen Evan Bourne poor could

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.860 
going to happen Evan Bourne poor could
probably<00:04:00.600> return<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:02.329> yeah<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.359> haven't<00:04:03.750> seen

match<00:04:21.660> but<00:04:21.959> if<00:04:22.200> he<00:04:22.380> does<00:04:22.590> I'll<00:04:22.890> be<00:04:23.010> happy<00:04:23.160> I'll

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669

be<00:04:24.210> happy<00:04:24.360> at<00:04:24.570> least<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.470> think<00:04:25.740> Sheamus

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
be happy at least but I think Sheamus

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.730 
be happy at least but I think Sheamus
will<00:04:26.340> return<00:04:26.669> at<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:26.970> Royal<00:04:27.419> Rumble<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.900> take

Brogue Kick to defend himself number
four<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.250> think<00:04:35.700> probably<00:04:36.000> Kane<00:04:36.539> should

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
four I think probably Kane should

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.830 
four I think probably Kane should
come<00:04:37.330> back<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.919> mean<00:04:38.919> he<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.400> here<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:40.150> I<00:04:40.389> think

come back I mean he is here but I think
he's<00:04:40.990> yeah<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.289> think<00:04:41.470> he<00:04:41.620> should<00:04:41.800> come<00:04:41.949> back

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
he's yeah I think he should come back

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
wrestling and you know because he's

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.620 
wrestling and you know because he's
really<00:04:44.740> boring<00:04:45.160> he<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.610> really<00:04:45.820> boring<00:04:46.120> you

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
really boring he is really boring you

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.689 
really boring he is really boring you
know<00:04:46.780> he's<00:04:47.440> not<00:04:47.470> really<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.039> big<00:04:48.280> red<00:04:48.490> monster

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
know he's not really the big red monster

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.860 
know he's not really the big red monster
anymore<00:04:49.150> except<00:04:49.570> for<00:04:49.720> his<00:04:49.870> time<00:04:51.090> yeah<00:04:52.090> number

anymore except for his time yeah number
five<00:04:53.139> I<00:04:53.169> think<00:04:53.380> this<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.830> probably<00:04:53.949> unlikely

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
five I think this is probably unlikely

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.540 
five I think this is probably unlikely
as<00:04:55.150> well<00:04:55.389> I<00:04:55.630> think<00:04:55.900> Goldberg<00:04:56.860> should<00:04:57.220> return

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
as well I think Goldberg should return

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.370 
as well I think Goldberg should return
and<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:59.590> know<00:05:00.000> start<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.180> feud<00:05:01.509> with<00:05:01.539> Ryback<00:05:02.110> if

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
and you know start a feud with Ryback if

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.320 
and you know start a feud with Ryback if
my<00:05:02.590> back<00:05:02.800> is<00:05:03.039> in<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.400> Rumble<00:05:03.850> match<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.270> think

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
my back is in the Rumble match I think

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.930 
my back is in the Rumble match I think
Goldberg<00:05:04.900> should<00:05:05.110> return<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:06.520> know<00:05:06.639> they

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
Goldberg should return and you know they

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.760 
Goldberg should return and you know they
should<00:05:07.090> have<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.240> faceoff<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:08.139> tease<00:05:08.410> if

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
should have a faceoff to tease if

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.400 
should have a faceoff to tease if
there's<00:05:09.009> going<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.220> be<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.340> match<00:05:09.580> but<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:10.180> also

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
there's going to be a match but to also

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.529 
there's going to be a match but to also
announce<00:05:11.410> that<00:05:12.009> Goldberg<00:05:12.310> has<00:05:12.729> signed<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.270> deal

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
the match Brock Lesnar another person

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.950 
the match Brock Lesnar another person
who<00:07:00.580> should<00:07:00.640> be<00:07:00.820> returning<00:07:01.390> at<00:07:01.510> the<00:07:01.630> world<00:07:01.810> one

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
who should be returning at the world one

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.490 
who should be returning at the world one
blue<00:07:02.080> as<00:07:02.200> well<00:07:02.230> John<00:07:03.010> Cena<00:07:03.900> Chris<00:07:04.900> Jericho<00:07:05.320> as

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
blue as well John Cena Chris Jericho as

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.400 
blue as well John Cena Chris Jericho as
I<00:07:05.650> mentioned<00:07:06.190> already<00:07:06.450> Daniel<00:07:07.450> Bryan<00:07:07.690> because

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
I mentioned already Daniel Bryan because

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.020 
I mentioned already Daniel Bryan because
them<00:07:08.680> i<00:07:08.710> think<00:07:08.920> probably<00:07:09.250> if<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.820> match

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
them i think probably if the match

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.340 
them i think probably if the match
happens<00:07:10.480> with<00:07:10.660> the<00:07:10.840> championship<00:07:11.320> match

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
happens with the championship match

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.740 
happens with the championship match
between<00:07:11.560> Orton<00:07:12.280> and<00:07:12.490> Cena<00:07:13.060> I<00:07:13.210> think<00:07:13.450> Orton

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
between Orton and Cena I think Orton

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.180 
between Orton and Cena I think Orton
should<00:07:13.900> win<00:07:14.080> Cena<00:07:14.920> and<00:07:15.130> Bryan<00:07:15.190> should<00:07:17.130> be<00:07:18.130> in

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
should win Cena and Bryan should be in

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.210 
should win Cena and Bryan should be in
the<00:07:18.430> rubber<00:07:18.730> match<00:07:18.970> if<00:07:19.270> they<00:07:19.540> lose<00:07:20.010> Rob<00:07:21.010> Van

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
the rubber match if they lose Rob Van

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.690 
the rubber match if they lose Rob Van
Dam<00:07:21.580> should<00:07:21.850> return<00:07:22.150> as<00:07:22.360> well<00:07:23.190> Sheamus<00:07:24.190> as<00:07:24.580> I

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:24.700 
Dam should return as well Sheamus as I

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.820 
Dam should return as well Sheamus as I
mentioned<00:07:25.120> earlier<00:07:25.270> a<00:07:25.540> big<00:07:25.930> show<00:07:26.230> as<00:07:26.530> well

probably<00:07:27.670> Mysterio<00:07:28.240> but<00:07:28.510> I<00:07:28.540> think<00:07:28.900> these<00:07:29.260> are

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
probably Mysterio but I think these are

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.860 
probably Mysterio but I think these are
the<00:07:29.620> last<00:07:29.860> top<00:07:30.610> superstars<00:07:31.060> that<00:07:31.390> I<00:07:31.450> want<00:07:31.720> at

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:33.730 
the end of the match and last but not

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.450 
the end of the match and last but not
least<00:07:33.790> the<00:07:34.600> best<00:07:34.870> in<00:07:35.080> the<00:07:35.110> world<00:07:35.200> CM<00:07:35.980> Punk<00:07:36.220> I
