00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:14.669
 Hello and welcome to a widened little video with the clock on 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.159
 in the rafters I am very happy that they turned off again 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.569
 and this time I would not share any APA to you a hardware component 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.569
 do not present a smartphone but a small one 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.919
 The clique percent by accident wanted to have found in the App Store but I did 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.820
 think about meddling makes a very very solid impression 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150
 and never personally lead 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.790
 very much like 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.090
 I do not know if one or the other of you already Selb Rehm 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.400
 i had that nation facebook app 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.990
 the percent Facebook provides us directly for the iPad 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 actually not to use face also shows why 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.930
 around she simply has these iPhone dimensions 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.640
 what means percent 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.420
 it will simply render this series of screen virtual 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.310
 and the 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.910
 the facebook app projects on it 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.940
 Percent is not very suitable 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.289
 Of course, it can be scaled up but a lot of fun 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.760
 not the whole thing either 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.460
 then I'm on the search 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.650
 in the App Store another alternative 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 and where to find it at the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 My pet 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.180
 and I have to say 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.220
 and so it should be so should a Facebook look the app is free 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.660
 available 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.560
 but then proceeds with percent advertising so financed by advertising who 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.080
 that would not want to spend nine and ten now even if the drop 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.760
 amount 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.410
 and then the app is already ad-free as I said Mike Kurt can 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.280
 Betzdorf can be downloaded for free 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 and I'll tell you why you all like it quite a bit 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.240
 around 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.440
 I already have it 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.000
 the app linked my facebook profile so that too 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.190
 at the same time the UPS starts in my friends 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.520
 "There my profile sets that she could look around 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.240
 you want the covenant on the tape 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 and we already Bättig 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.979
 Gelsenkirchen ots the app the complete screen 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.620
 Alek Wek with 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.089
 Screen of the iPad is not required by Facebook defacto 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:09.719
 shown on the iPad 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.779
 to the news feed 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.599
 two ten and so 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.999
 to the beast the simply there these news status updates of your friends 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.450

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.419
 because of course 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.029
 Likes Colmar is 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:23.910
 more than 1000 on understanding 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.559
 in the upper and bent 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:26.949
 Goal and then around 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.239
 Thus, there is news or friends work 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.980
 Kohlkönig also that you just here tip for example on the picture now from

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.949
 to be around 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.949
 Kick what was used for the toilet added 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.559
 because year thing is also that the picture does not appear detached nowhere

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.349
 Double click on it 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.349
 and it is a very big job or even as a full screen 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.879
 really not a bad thing 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.769
 The latter offers to close again 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:10.820

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.479
 the whole Facebook is just yes and as I said I'm not so easy 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.120
 facebook app but the app percent 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.449
 as disparaged compared to the other none at all 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.419
 no comparison zoom chat function which of course also here 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.430

 otherwise you do not have to say 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.309
 Nibelungen as Facebook unanimously told them to provide 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:24.789
 should 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:31.039
 Advertising 9 9 cents without advertising only 9 cents with advertising for free as well as the bite in 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.830
 the commercials can press percent 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.520
