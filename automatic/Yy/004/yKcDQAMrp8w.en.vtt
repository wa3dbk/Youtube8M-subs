 inside there is back and crack 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.900
 the config of the game that I invite you to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.460
 look before downloading the game is 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.870
 of course the torrent file for 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 those who would not have access to the 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.140
 hacker bay once here you have 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:14.010
 downloaded the game you go all 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.930
 so just go to the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.180
 folder that is named in my project because 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.400
 drains odette so we'll open it 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.540
 you double click on modes all 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.030
 this and here you are chosen 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.920
 this is the default program a you 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.859
 here if it's not for nothing by default 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.239
 so either you double click on it and 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.340
 at that moment a virtual drive 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.569
 device you click on it so you 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.299
 have these tables it is exactly 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.859
 the same thing and the back and crack 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.450
 me my method to which where I'm doing 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.329
 it's just I 'm doing a double 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.379
 click on the iso file and those are 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.349
 automatically launches 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.709
 I'm not going to do it simply 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:53.540
 because I have already installed simply 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.780
 so once you have installed I 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.650
 you have a folder that is named then 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.530
 you simply have in your 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.730
 hard disk c program files and you have 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.470
 a file called project 15 here 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.319
 you double click on it and you 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.659
 just put the cra that is 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.700
 here or so in your set up be you 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:20.099
 take in the numbers art for those who 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.959
 do not have it or so in in the 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:27.510
 folder of the game it's all simple 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:30.440
 here in the set up via the crac you 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.810
 simply slide this in 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.299
 copy replace kopierre year gone 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.909
 once it's done you have the game 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.049
 so unfortunately there is no 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.250
 patch and do for this game but a 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.099
 house he has french people I 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.629
 I'm not sure so you'll see for yourself 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.069
 even if you need a past 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.019
 do I will try to find some in 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.069
 find 1 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.440
 but for the moment I have not found 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.690
 to patch do it so now 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.280
 you can play with confidence at this 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.449
 game it works perfectly me 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.829
 I can rotate it on my pc 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:04.229
 so I think for most of them 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.489
 you will succeed in making it turn if 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.069
