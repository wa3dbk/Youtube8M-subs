00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.780 

maybe<00:00:02.669> outlet<00:00:03.270> towards<00:00:03.629> daylight

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.100 

the<00:00:07.790> wait<00:00:07.970> for<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:08.210> Summer<00:00:08.420> Sun<00:00:08.719> comes<00:00:08.960> out

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
the wait for the Summer Sun comes out

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.910 
the wait for the Summer Sun comes out
come<00:00:09.980> out

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.040 

so<00:00:13.730> this<00:00:14.000> one<00:00:14.180> is<00:00:14.450> normal<00:00:14.750> LCD<00:00:15.560> TFT<00:00:16.930> what<00:00:17.930> when

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
so this one is normal LCD TFT what when

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.760 
so this one is normal LCD TFT what when
it<00:00:18.140> gets<00:00:18.290> really<00:00:18.500> sunny<00:00:18.830> if<00:00:19.040> this<00:00:19.220> disappears

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
it gets really sunny if this disappears

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.170 
it gets really sunny if this disappears
and<00:00:21.770> this<00:00:21.890> is<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.630> e7<00:00:23.630> clear<00:00:23.960> black

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
and this is the e7 clear black

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.940 
and this is the e7 clear black
it's<00:00:26.180> absolutely<00:00:27.170> visible<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:27.710> something

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
it's absolutely visible and something

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.409 
it's absolutely visible and something
like<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.460> only<00:00:28.580> thing<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:28.880> prevents<00:00:29.180> it<00:00:29.270> is

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
like the only thing that prevents it is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.659 
like the only thing that prevents it is
the<00:00:29.710> kind<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:30.770> reflection<00:00:31.130> on<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.430> screen

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
the kind of reflection on the screen

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.900 
the kind of reflection on the screen
otherwise<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.900> know<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.040> screens<00:00:34.760> actually

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
otherwise I know the screens actually

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.290 
otherwise I know the screens actually
gone<00:00:35.180> off<00:00:35.300> that's<00:00:35.750> why<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.940> is<00:00:41.120> the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
gone off that's why this is the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.920 
gone off that's why this is the
visibility

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
visibility

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.900

outdoors<00:00:45.010> they<00:00:46.010> write<00:00:46.930> favorite<00:00:48.910> some

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910

Clarence

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.580 

there<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.140> go<00:01:09.260> there<00:01:09.590> we<00:01:09.650> go

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
there you go there we go

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.570 
there you go there we go
probably<00:01:12.590> can't<00:01:12.740> see<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:13.040> much<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.490> the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
probably can't see it so much in the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.240 
probably can't see it so much in the
camera<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:13.970> as<00:01:14.540> I'm<00:01:15.200> looking<00:01:15.350> at<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:16.010> I

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
camera but as I'm looking at it this I

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.780 
camera but as I'm looking at it this I
can<00:01:16.430> see<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.820> screen<00:01:16.970> doesn't<00:01:17.510> disappear<00:01:18.790> if

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
can see the screen doesn't disappear if

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.480 
can see the screen doesn't disappear if
I<00:01:19.909> look<00:01:20.119> back<00:01:20.300> at<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.570> Year<00:01:20.659> 900<00:01:21.250> TSU<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.400> is

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
I look back at the Year 900 TSU this is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.780 
I look back at the Year 900 TSU this is
generally<00:01:22.790> better<00:01:23.030> than<00:01:23.270> standard<00:01:23.900> ordered

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
generally better than standard ordered

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.499 
generally better than standard ordered
kind<00:01:25.790> of<00:01:25.850> kind<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.270> washes<00:01:26.600> out<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:28.509> colors

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
kind of kind of washes out the colors

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.210 
kind of kind of washes out the colors
wash<00:01:29.690> out<00:01:29.960> because<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.710> backlights<00:01:31.070> not

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
wash out because the backlights not

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.510 
wash out because the backlights not
strong<00:01:31.460> enough<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.670> would<00:01:31.970> be<00:01:32.119> said<00:01:32.690> and

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
strong enough that would be said and

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.290 
strong enough that would be said and
I'll<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:34.670> try<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.880> go<00:01:35.000> through<00:01:35.119> some

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
I'll just try to go through some

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:53.380 
I'll just try to go through some
pictures<00:01:35.420> yeah

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.170 

so<00:01:53.960> these<00:01:54.110> shot<00:01:54.470> from<00:01:54.770> pieces<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:58.000> how<00:01:59.000> will

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
so these shot from pieces so how will

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.210 
so these shot from pieces so how will
you<00:01:59.240> tell<00:01:59.480> from<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.870> camera<00:02:00.230> possibly

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
you tell from the camera possibly

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.490 
you tell from the camera possibly
because<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.810> camera<00:02:03.080> I'm<00:02:03.140> shooting<00:02:03.410> this

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
because the camera I'm shooting this

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.370 
because the camera I'm shooting this
from<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:04.030> screen<00:02:05.030> on<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.300> just<00:02:05.540> disappears<00:02:06.140> in

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
from the screen on it just disappears in

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.150 
from the screen on it just disappears in
the<00:02:06.410> Sun<00:02:06.680> but<00:02:07.430> this<00:02:07.820> e<00:02:08.119> seven<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:09.050> can<00:02:09.830> still<00:02:09.979> see

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the Sun but this e seven I can still see

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.860 
the Sun but this e seven I can still see
it<00:02:11.020> absolutely<00:02:12.020> beautiful
