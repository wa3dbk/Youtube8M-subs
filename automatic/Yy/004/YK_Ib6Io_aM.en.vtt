works<00:00:25.439> by<00:00:26.340> creating<00:00:26.670> products<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.689> layers

these<00:00:28.890> layers<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.640> thin<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.000> 0.1

generally<00:00:38.550> create<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> mold<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.809> put<00:00:40.050> material

generally create a mold and put material

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
generally create a mold and put material
in<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> cost<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.450> mold<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.960> quite

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
in it so the cost of that mold is quite

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
in it so the cost of that mold is quite
high<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> design<00:00:44.460> something<00:00:44.489> you've

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
high so if you design something you've

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.389 
high so if you design something you've
had<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> create<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.539> lot<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.829> order<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
had to create a lot of them in order to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 
had to create a lot of them in order to
justify<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.149> cost<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> mold<00:00:48.930> additive

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
justify the cost of the mold additive

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.060

individually create each product one at

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920 
individually create each product one at
a<00:00:55.410> time<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> changes<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> game<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.690> terms

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a time so it changes the game in terms

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.319 
a time so it changes the game in terms
of<00:00:58.140> mass<00:00:58.350> mass<00:00:58.829> production<00:00:59.460> moving<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
of mass mass production moving it

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.139 
of mass mass production moving it
towards<00:01:00.690> mass<00:01:00.899> customization<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:02.190> did<00:01:03.030> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
towards mass customization I did this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.700 
towards mass customization I did this
just<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.480> fun<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.690> wanted<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
just for fun I wanted to see is it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
just for fun I wanted to see is it
possible<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> make<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> real<00:01:05.790> electric<00:01:06.270> guitar

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
possible to make a real electric guitar

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.560 
possible to make a real electric guitar
and<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.530> traditional<00:01:08.040> machining<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> wood<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and a traditional machining of wood you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
and a traditional machining of wood you
couldn't<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.439> shapes<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.100> aesthetics

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
couldn't make the shapes the aesthetics

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280 
couldn't make the shapes the aesthetics
that<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.939> achieve<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.270> 3d<00:01:12.630> printing<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that I can achieve with 3d printing and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
that I can achieve with 3d printing and
that's<00:01:13.950> what's<00:01:14.159> amazing<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.850> stuff

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that's what's amazing you can do stuff

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.539 
that's what's amazing you can do stuff
that's<00:01:15.210> almost<00:01:16.049> seems<00:01:16.590> impossible<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.400> with

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that's almost seems impossible but with

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.550 
that's almost seems impossible but with
this<00:01:17.640> technology<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.450> make<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.049> think

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
this technology you can make it I think

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
this technology you can make it I think

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
first process that our students learn

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.710 
first process that our students learn
and<00:02:15.129> as<00:02:15.430> far<00:02:15.610> as<00:02:15.700> I'm<00:02:15.819> aware<00:02:15.940> that's<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.450> first

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
