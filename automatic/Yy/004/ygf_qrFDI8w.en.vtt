keep that in mind as well like once it
gets<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> zero<00:01:37.680> you'll<00:01:37.860> probably<00:01:38.070> die

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
gets to zero you'll probably die

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.429 
gets to zero you'll probably die
anything<00:01:38.700> restart<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.119> again<00:01:39.360> anyways<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
anything restart this again anyways so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.999 
anything restart this again anyways so
that's<00:01:40.560> pretty<00:01:40.799> cool<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.490> figure<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> now

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that's pretty cool to figure out so now

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
that's pretty cool to figure out so now
that's<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:45.060> were<00:01:45.149> trying<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> kill<00:01:45.570> these

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's you were trying to kill these

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.260 
that's you were trying to kill these
guys<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.040> understand<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.700> main

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
guys I really don't understand the main

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
guys I really don't understand the main
aspect<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> thought<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
aspect of this I thought I think this is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.100 
aspect of this I thought I think this is
just<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:50.820> place<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.960> the
