00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.059
 football is basically one 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.100
 simple game two teams liver 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.570
 compete for a ball 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.000
 when you actually have the ball zigi 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.000
 soho may prefer to leave in it again 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.770
 do by once then i can finally 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.580
 the ball you have to go so must 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.039
 center 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.800
 preferably in the goal 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.449
 a ball in the goal counts as a goal 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.189
 A ball next to the goal is also started 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.970
 for the compilers of 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.970
 programs such as this 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.050
 football goal from pole to pole and 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.309
 width of 7 meters 32 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.570
 for some, that is not an issue 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.309
 plenty of other unique ones carefully 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.559
 between the posts of shoots in just again 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.970
 too high for that too 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.970
 to temporarily raise the bar 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.980
 not only is their goal often too small 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.680
 from piece 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.790
 In addition , the technology volume 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.790
 is is it becomes 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.520
 no attacks are a tough job 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.759
 above the is not easy 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.759
 but 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.550
 the program is not meant to be it 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.510
 insist that it is twice as old as it 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.610
 soccer itself 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.610
 You do not necessarily need your fellow player 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 but in his vacation from the category 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.130
 he himself made his grave mother to me 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.890
 I
