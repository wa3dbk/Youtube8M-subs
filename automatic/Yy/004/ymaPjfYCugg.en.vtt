00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.539 
to begin with but when I saw it it
looked<00:01:36.990> pretty<00:01:37.290> cool<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.829> super<00:01:38.009> saiyan<00:01:38.369> goku

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
looked pretty cool and super saiyan goku

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
looked pretty cool and super saiyan goku
so<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.829> fits<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so I was like you know what it fits and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.270 
so I was like you know what it fits and
it<00:01:42.240> looks<00:01:42.479> good<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.040> there

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
it looks good and I think that there

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
it looks good and I think that there
shouldn't<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.820> war<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> costume

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
shouldn't be this war about the costume

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.859 
shouldn't be this war about the costume
because<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> end<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> day<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:48.689> could

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
because at the end of the day you could

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.740 
because at the end of the day you could
choose<00:01:49.170> not<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.890> costume<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.460> there

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
choose not to have that costume on there

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.280 
choose not to have that costume on there
you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.200> i<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.630> my<00:01:54.630> honest<00:01:54.869> opinion

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you know and i think my honest opinion

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.319 
you know and i think my honest opinion
is<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.680> should<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.909> care<00:01:56.939> about

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
is that you should just not care about

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.780 
is that you should just not care about
it<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.229> could<00:01:58.380> play<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:59.430> whatever

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
it because you could play with whatever

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.580 
it because you could play with whatever
cap<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.290> use<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
cap do you want and not have to use the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
to just be this I don't know they want

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.290 
to just be this I don't know they want
them<00:05:07.920> separated<00:05:08.550> for<00:05:08.670> some<00:05:08.820> reason<00:05:09.090> I<00:05:09.240> don't

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
them separated for some reason I don't

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.910 
them separated for some reason I don't
know<00:05:09.510> why<00:05:09.570> it's<00:05:09.990> like<00:05:10.110> those<00:05:10.260> type<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.470> people

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
know why it's like those type of people

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.190 
know why it's like those type of people
that<00:05:10.950> don't<00:05:11.880> like<00:05:12.000> their<00:05:12.330> foods<00:05:12.630> touching<00:05:13.140> I

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
that don't like their foods touching I

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.840 
that don't like their foods touching I
guess<00:05:13.410> it's<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.800> they<00:05:14.280> want<00:05:14.580> everything

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
guess it's like they want everything

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.300 
guess it's like they want everything
separate<00:05:15.510> because<00:05:15.960> they<00:05:16.590> feel<00:05:16.890> like<00:05:16.920> it's

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
separate because they feel like it's

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.340 
separate because they feel like it's
better<00:05:17.700> or<00:05:18.000> more<00:05:18.300> balanced<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:18.960> way<00:05:19.140> I<00:05:19.170> don't

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
better or more balanced that way I don't

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.230 
better or more balanced that way I don't
get<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.950> point<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.280> but<00:05:20.580> that's<00:05:21.180> how

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
get the point of that but that's how

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.700 
get the point of that but that's how
people<00:05:21.600> think<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.930> guess<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.350> it's<00:05:22.500> kind<00:05:22.680> of

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
people think I guess and it's kind of

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.190 
people think I guess and it's kind of
stupid<00:05:22.920> but<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.520> already<00:05:24.120> already<00:05:24.510> said<00:05:24.810> what<00:05:25.140> I
