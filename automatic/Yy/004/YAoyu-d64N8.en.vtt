00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Bella do you know that almost any linux 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.799
 distribution kit you can download his site 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.420
 absolutely free 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.600
 yes someday they wo n't have to 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.490
 to make 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.200
 all zdarov oddly enough for that 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.629
 to meet new today 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.980
 we have no version of windows 8.1 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.619
 need to look there for something on 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.020
 torrents ask friends to ask 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:25.630
 look for keys to crack no we can 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.580
 just write in google and windows 8.1 and 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:34.379
 we go to the site microsoft.com where 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.770
 we are offered to download windows 81 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.699
 that is, we can download the iso file 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.399
 write it here we have a few 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.949
 multilingual editions for 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.679
 different versions of computers and right there we 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.760
 see the product key I do not know what 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.219
 time all this will be possible 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.739
 use but it seems to me 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.379
 more marketing move with it 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.809
 started even before it started 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.670
 selling windows 8 ie marketers 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.179
 initially it was possible to guess 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.159
 what 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:08.680
 shove in one windows edition 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.290
 Immediately and subway and classic here this 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.719
 kind of it sucks because on 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.969
 horseradish on the master's desktop after all on the simple 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.860
 normal work computer use 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.860
 from going huge tiles 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.060
 here these are huge icons here this 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.479
 gesture and some 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.090
 as uncomfortable as on the tablet 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.549
 use classic desktop with 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.979
 small icons that is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.009
 use of two simultaneously editors 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.929
 in one it's a complete bullshit 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.070
 it used to be quite logical and separation 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.380
 on windows nt and windows mobile windows and 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.570
 for desktops that is expressive 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.000
 now they stuffed it all different 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.609
 interfaces in one and it is very very 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.189
 very depressing besides I want 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:58.149
 note that in general, windows 8 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.340
 the interface is pretty interesting and 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.579
 ugly compared to the same windows 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.579
 seven that is, that's what it's these 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.600
 pretty ascetic little colored 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.630
 edging icons controls all 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.360
 it is somehow out of balance 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.460
 coming to what we used to see I 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.290
 in principle, every day is compared to 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.030
 windows ce it on 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.319
 because at home now I have 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.090
 windows 8 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.840
 at work I have to install windows 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.909
 seven eleven is much more interesting 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.370
 looks even if not to mention that 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.799
 that it is much more convenient on the desktop 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.670
 I want to say that I tried skype in this 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.430
 your windows store is something old there and 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.349
 skype let's say complete bullshit and gum 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.799
 there is a good one 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.299
 birds angry birds space but when it comes 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.200
 to a certain level we are not given 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.319
 play on and write a buoy with flags even 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.450
 here we were not allowed to have fun 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.560
 even worse is what opens for example 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.159
 pictures like this 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.459
 for a long time there is loaded here in this 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.689
 pictures are opened and we need everything 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.980
 just set the view through 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.569
 photo viewer windows and then 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 we can more or less classic it 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.650
 see everything with me that is not yet 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.250
 enjoyed it in this transition in the floor 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.489
 meters ska and condition that places 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.760
 it 's still windows seven and in some places 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.739
 something like a subway that is right here 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.000
 we see these badges like these 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:40.239
 left with a glare like this 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.870
 so now they are at the same time 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.719
 choosing somewhere here we see that we have 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.639
 framing is more 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.250
 monochrome or something a lot of hype 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.230
 rose from the fact that there seems to be windows 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.019
 81 should be added start button well 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.299
 she also added nothing good 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.040
 she is not foreshadowed because she 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.139
 performs exactly the same function as 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.780
 see if I moved the panel to the top then 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:09.540
 me now with as many as two start buttons and 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.459
 when pressed even if I make it from below 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.970
 then when you click on this start button in my 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.880
 floats as well as this meter a little bit 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.579
 changed this creepy panel which 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.830
 It was not convenient before now it is all so 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.430
 it is not convenient but it was changed to 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.190
 something 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.330
 go we have a control panel 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.190
 and here we can customize the taskbar and 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.710
 navigation and returned what I had 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.360
 and in the navigation tab I do not know whether 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.479
 it's in windows 8 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.240
 just 8 but here there are such here 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.289
 various jackdaws with the help of which we 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.380
 can do something like a remote 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.500
 on our good old start and on 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.909
 our old classic desktop 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.680
 that is, we can deliver at the entrance 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.440
 open the desktop and we immediately 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.020
 the worker will open instead of the meter 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.820
 the table is more or less classic besides 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.520
 here it can be removed so that it does not interfere 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.240
 these are terrible applications besides 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.310
 you can do something like this 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:17.400
 and on going and or even like this 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.590
 transition to this our start will be 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.479
 The application is shown here 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.259
 This is the kind that I did not like 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.720
 even in this subway then what even if he 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.919
 trying to look like android then in 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.099
 android at least you can 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.259
 grab the mouse at any place and carry 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.660
 here it is not entirely intuitive 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:40.020
 turn the wheel to pro 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.819
 scroll these our applications done well 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.039
 not mind at all, and besides you can 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.110
 remove this daw here which shows 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.479
 mouse buttons when you hover the mouse right 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.220
 the top corner is how we call the buttons 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.110
 swinging on mouse over 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.159
 top right corner of the common button 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.380
 system management 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.990
 function buttons let's call them 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.569
 just wonder buttons really if 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:07.319
 talk about windows 8 in general, then she 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:10.020
 developing in terms of stability and in 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:13.949
 system health plan 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.340
 since i have been sitting for three weeks 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.949
 absolutely without antivirus, I do not put 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.990
 viruses specifically as they do 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.750
 Some go on porn sites put 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.940
 imagine a virus and no, I basically pretty 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.449
 I 'm trying to go to different sites 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.889
 but no system crashes and requirements 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.430
 send off with me still not 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.650
 there was a firewall and defenders 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.650
 various which are windows 8 they 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.110
 work very, very well and 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.940
 only 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.569
 fun toy and whatever you want 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.789
 to praise 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.930
 windows 8 is what you can do in the store 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.930
 play here 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.450
 we
