00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.650
 everything else is engaged on the wood she 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.529
 has already exhibited at metropolis de montréal 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.099
 at the imperial quebec at home at the 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.829
 redemption 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.930
 and if at limoux what at the burnery she 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.450
 is above all mother of two children but 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.770
 also tattoo artist and artist 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.480
 can be today we are you 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.980
 let's introduce christelle unleashes the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.340
 painting room started so I 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.980
 coughing 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.160
 I took professional courses 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.650
 with a lady named raymonde 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.489
 levasseur me and who taught me the emptiness 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.860
 the tattoo sauce appeared around 15 that 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.750
 I want I knew I was going to lead 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.640
 a tattoo 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.860
 I was convinced she gained in that 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.470
 I was going to end up at and just 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.330
 arrived in rimouski moved to 17 years 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.809
 I started at home we have to be 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.150
 polyvalent 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.540
 especially in the region because we are 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.420
 a small number of tattoos have to be 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.880
 able to meet a customer who 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.789
 is where my ideas I'll be varied on the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.369
 world knows we have versatile we can 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.610
 reserve the right to choose projects 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.850
 but basically have to do what the customer 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.310
 wants but for the completely it takes 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.930
 whether it's 55 years still always my 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.119
 mother was telling me that when I was little 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.860
 to keep it a little paper a 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.970
 pencil it was supports said 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.020
 watch her but she knew that 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:43.510
 I was quiet far away I 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.810
 draws and everything they could yes 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.940
 but it was more really patterns game 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.970
 very emotional tht when I was a teenager 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.310
 instead of speaking express it to them 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.720
 love his new dada integrate the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.060
 cubism to realism 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.350
 something easier to say than to do that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.580
 often it's harder than 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.730
 realism cubism 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.100
 because realism have capped what 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.100
 already exists in that Cubism the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.750
 cubism seedlings like gpl it takes 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.230
 think how we could 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.970
 transform what already exists one a 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.190
 form that we recognize we recognize very 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.970
 although it's a fox but two 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.390
 mathematical rounds all cut with 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.580
 curves 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.140
 so it's a bit more complicated but 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.410
 that's what I like is the complexity 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.120
 it's if we do not have misery we stop 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.570
 to learn is a technique of 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.790
 Renaissance 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.080
 yes that I learned with a very good 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.260
 professor who come the mosquitoes 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.510
 who's called ljubomir ivankovic yes that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 I took too many two to three course 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.790
 with him who taught me this technique 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.040
 law that I will thank I thank 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.120
 all the talent is 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.159
 is we going to get some 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.909
 dimension the light is going to be more 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.280
 striking 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.260
 the man you be leaner the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.870
 mysterious joconde of Leonardo da Vinci 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 has been taken over and over again and 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.829
 christelle could not resist but in there 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.049
 adding his personal touch 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.819
 what did it do is a fund see it 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.040
 hair my hair is in coffee a 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.349
 little everything that was most prompt 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.480
 happened on the real age canvas 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.329
 group has become a coffee I have more than 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.489
 I did several tests 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.260
 the effect tps and that become like a 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.439
 no others and at that moment I painted 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.510
 with coffee and mangin oil 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.669
 rich argument and then a little bit then 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.669
 I said to myself I can not not do it 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.230
 i have so much like him studying léonard 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.269
 of vinci in everything that was in 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.480
 all his inventions that I owed 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.120
 I had to modestly redo it again 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.939
 it's just that I wanted you I 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.980
 did not want to do it all over again 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:50.379
 then it always annoyed me that 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.409
 not smile to idiots is so po to 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.250
 smile I make them smile but I 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.109
 make an oic coffee 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.669
 everything is done here painting to even 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.609
 to put the house yes yes but I try 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.440
 to raise my children in this context 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.109
 a little gma of six with whom 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.599
 I would like to do an exhibition someday 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.250
 that I'm already starting to teach him to 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.020
 oil which is really difficult but 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.070
 I work hard on it but it's 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:20.570
 after that cubism appeared on 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.570
 work it's all the state has to 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.570
 sell
