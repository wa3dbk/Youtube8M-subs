after you've explored the basic

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.729 
after you've explored the basic
parameters<00:00:32.630> of<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.809> tuning<00:00:33.200> which<00:00:33.350> we<00:00:33.559> did<00:00:33.710> in

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
parameters of the tuning which we did in

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.020 
parameters of the tuning which we did in
Dead<00:00:34.309> Yet<00:00:34.520> volume<00:00:35.000> 1<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:37.160> strum<00:00:37.550> in<00:00:37.699> it<00:00:37.850> is

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
Dead Yet volume 1 and the strum in it is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.979 
Dead Yet volume 1 and the strum in it is
more<00:00:38.710> syncopated<00:00:39.790> it's<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.030> pinch<00:00:41.270> bring

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
more syncopated it's the pinch bring

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.229 
more syncopated it's the pinch bring
your<00:00:42.140> thumb<00:00:42.350> down<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:42.830> then<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.760> thumb<00:00:43.970> is<00:00:44.120> by

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
your thumb down and then the thumb is by

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.400 
your thumb down and then the thumb is by
itself<00:00:45.100> first<00:00:46.100> finger<00:00:46.520> on<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.699> second<00:00:47.150> string

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
itself first finger on the second string

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.650 
itself first finger on the second string
and<00:00:48.500> thumb<00:00:49.010> down<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.550> fourth<00:00:49.790> so<00:00:50.570> it

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
and thumb down to the fourth so it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
and thumb down to the fourth so it
sounds<00:00:50.870> like<00:00:50.990> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

you're<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.210> hitting<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.479> load<00:01:24.840> II<00:01:25.110> got

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
you're just hitting that load II got

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.500 
you're just hitting that load II got
this<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.100> cord<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.520> front<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
this little cord up front and you can

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.770 
this little cord up front and you can
actually<00:01:27.979> use<00:01:28.979> these<00:01:29.820> three<00:01:30.150> fingers<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
actually use these three fingers and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.830 
actually use these three fingers and
pinch<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.440> together<00:01:34.610> in<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.330> case<00:01:36.600> I'm

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
pinch them together in this case I'm

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.780 
pinch them together in this case I'm
going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> use<00:01:37.190> sort<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.420> two<00:01:39.420> notes<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
going to use sort of two notes on the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
going to use sort of two notes on the
fourth<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.060> third<00:01:42.330> strings<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.170> try<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> put

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
fourth and third strings and try to put

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.640 
fourth and third strings and try to put
them<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.729> much<00:01:44.940> use<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.690> possibly<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.380> so

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
them to as much use as I possibly can so

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.469 
them to as much use as I possibly can so
it's<00:01:47.310> trying<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> keep<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.000> simple<00:01:48.409> but<00:01:49.409> yet

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
it's trying to keep it simple but yet

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.150 
it's trying to keep it simple but yet
sort<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.539> compelling<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.170> same<00:01:52.380> time<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
sort of compelling at the same time so

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.100 
sort of compelling at the same time so
this<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.369> Yankee<00:01:53.850> swamp<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.930> slow

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
this is Yankee swamp kind of a slow

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.149 
this is Yankee swamp kind of a slow
version<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.619> it

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159
