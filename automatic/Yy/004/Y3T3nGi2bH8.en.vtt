00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
via the Bluetooth then what happens is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.209 
via the Bluetooth then what happens is
when<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> hit<00:02:01.140> star<00:02:01.469> around<00:02:01.740> i'll<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.100> the

going to head and hit start round and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.339 
going to head and hit start round and
then<00:02:34.739> hit<00:02:35.010> tap<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.909> away<00:02:36.720> beer<00:02:37.110> round

goes twisting and turning until

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.410 
goes twisting and turning until
eventually<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.299> settles<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.840> somebody<00:02:40.290> and

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
very simple to do against a mechanic as

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.240 
very simple to do against a mechanic as
before<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:02.060> let's<00:05:02.210> say<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.389> add<00:05:02.810> another<00:05:03.620> test

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
before so let's say I add another test

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.469 
before so let's say I add another test
person<00:05:04.669> this<00:05:04.760> time<00:05:04.820> will<00:05:05.090> spell<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.360> correctly

person this time will spell it correctly

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.360 
person this time will spell it correctly

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
and then I scroll down to let's say that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.210 
and then I scroll down to let's say that
they<00:05:10.490> are<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.669> vodka<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.240> coke<00:05:11.570> drinker<00:05:12.220> what

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
they are a vodka and coke drinker what

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.430 
they are a vodka and coke drinker what
are<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.370> rare<00:05:13.550> breeds<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.240> then<00:05:15.200> we<00:05:15.289> can<00:05:15.380> add

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
are the rare breeds and then we can add

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.469 
are the rare breeds and then we can add
yet<00:05:15.710> another<00:05:15.740> person<00:05:16.340> so<00:05:16.490> let's<00:05:16.639> do<00:05:16.789> this<00:05:16.940> and

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
yet another person so let's do this and

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.540 
yet another person so let's do this and
name<00:05:17.900> them<00:05:18.050> test<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:20.770> hit<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.889> Go<00:05:22.039> button<00:05:22.070> and

name them test to hit the Go button and
