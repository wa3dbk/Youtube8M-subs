ex buy backup just in case you know you
never<00:01:41.270> know<00:01:42.159> now<00:01:43.159> how<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.729> system<00:01:44.240> works<00:01:44.450> is

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
never know now how the system works is

this<00:01:46.189> water<00:01:46.670> pump

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
this water pump

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.340 
this water pump
this<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.979> epicenter<00:01:49.899> let's<00:01:50.899> call<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.229> at

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
this is the epicenter let's call you at

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.480 
this is the epicenter let's call you at
the<00:01:51.500> center<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:51.979> where<00:01:52.130> you'll<00:01:52.369> be

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
the center this is where you'll be

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.999 
the center this is where you'll be
checking<00:01:52.700> your<00:01:53.000> levels<00:01:53.270> your<00:01:53.780> pH<00:01:54.049> is<00:01:54.079> your

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
checking your levels your pH is your

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.380 
checking your levels your pH is your
water<00:01:55.159> temperatures<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.939> is<00:01:56.090> what<00:01:56.240> you'll

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
water temperatures this is what you'll

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.450 
water temperatures this is what you'll
be<00:01:56.420> putting<00:01:56.780> your<00:01:56.899> nutrients<00:01:57.409> in<00:01:57.590> when<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.340> do

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
be putting your nutrients in when you do

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.880 
be putting your nutrients in when you do
all<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.789> now<00:01:59.090> what<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.780> doing<00:02:00.079> is<00:02:00.439> its

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
all that now what this is doing is its

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.609 
all that now what this is doing is its
pumping<00:02:01.280> as<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.610> can<00:02:01.759> see<00:02:02.170> from<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.320> furthest

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
pumping as you can see from the furthest

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.950 
pumping as you can see from the furthest
point<00:02:03.710> over<00:02:04.159> here<00:02:04.429> now<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:04.939> epicenter<00:02:05.600> it

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
point over here now this epicenter it

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.740 
point over here now this epicenter it
has<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.439> be<00:02:06.590> VC<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.159> has<00:02:07.280> one<00:02:07.549> here<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.149> one

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
has to be VC if it has one here and one

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.470 
has to be VC if it has one here and one
here<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.679> pulling<00:02:09.890> out<00:02:10.310> from<00:02:10.670> each<00:02:11.180> one

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
here so it's pulling out from each one

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.479 
here so it's pulling out from each one
but<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:12.260> falling<00:02:12.500> through<00:02:12.769> these<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.130> the

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
but it's falling through these on the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.580 
but it's falling through these on the
same<00:02:13.790> time<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.300> back<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.630> here<00:02:14.870> now<00:02:15.410> what<00:02:15.560> that

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
same time and back to here now what that

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.100 
same time and back to here now what that
is<00:02:15.920> doing<00:02:16.099> is<00:02:16.310> creating<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.819> very<00:02:16.849> stable<00:02:17.450> ppm

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
is doing is creating a very stable ppm

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.500 
is doing is creating a very stable ppm
and<00:02:18.709> your<00:02:18.980> pH<00:02:19.280> levels<00:02:19.310> keeping<00:02:20.269> everything

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
and your pH levels keeping everything

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
and your pH levels keeping everything
nice<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:20.900> stable<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.560> no<00:02:21.739> hot<00:02:21.980> spot<00:02:22.250> guys

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
nice and stable and no hot spot guys

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.860 
nice and stable and no hot spot guys
now<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.630> undercurrent<00:02:24.290> part<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.739> system

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
now the undercurrent part of this system

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.370 
now the undercurrent part of this system
take<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> little<00:02:27.140> off<00:02:27.290> for<00:02:27.620> us<00:02:28.269> now<00:02:29.269> as<00:02:30.019> you<00:02:30.260> can

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
take a little off for us now as you can

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.039 
take a little off for us now as you can
see<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.830> PVC<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.310> cut<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.790> diagonal<00:02:32.269> that's

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
see the PVC is cut a diagonal that's

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.229 
see the PVC is cut a diagonal that's
creating<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> current<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.700> when<00:02:34.849> it's<00:02:34.970> coming

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
creating the current so when it's coming

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.699 
creating the current so when it's coming
through<00:02:35.269> here<00:02:35.569> it's<00:02:35.690> turning<00:02:35.900> now<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
through here it's turning now the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.710 
through here it's turning now the
current<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.459> root<00:02:37.640> zone<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:38.209> creating

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
current in the root zone is creating

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.949 
current in the root zone is creating

the<00:02:42.380> system<00:02:42.799> rocks<00:02:43.099> for<00:02:43.459> us<00:02:43.580> guys<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.480> flats

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
the system rocks for us guys the flats

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.229 
the system rocks for us guys the flats
just<00:02:44.930> really<00:02:45.319> love<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> good<00:02:46.099> system<00:02:46.549> mom

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
just really love it a good system mom

guys this couple of ways you can do it

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.560 
guys this couple of ways you can do it
what<00:03:20.070> I'm<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> do<00:03:20.610> is<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.210> already<00:03:21.420> built

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
what I'm going to do is I already built

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.390 
what I'm going to do is I already built
a<00:03:21.900> little<00:03:22.140> adapter<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.620> don't<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.220> here

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
a little adapter I don't have it in here
