 Hello friends of God today greetings 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.630
 for everyone this time we come with 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.879
 a new tutorial in which we will see 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.830
 how to erase the cache that is created for us 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.139
 when updating our system 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.119
 this can be done by programs like 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.340
 blade beat but here I show you 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.340
 manually so we started 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.910
 good so we started let's go to 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.170
 our lower left corner we're going 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.129
 to open the as the plan as 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.330
 administrator with which we give him yes 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.160
 when they have already opened we are going to 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.950
 declare the commands these commands go 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.050
 to serve to stop services and 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.699
 avoid deleting necessary files in 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.640
 our system we are going to run the 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:05.950
 first that is net stop w and it's going to be 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.720
 we press the -inter here tells us that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.290
 is stopping and that has already stopped 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 then the second one is net stop bits 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.190
 we go to the enter 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.040
 is almost stopping and here says it does 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.940
 stopped then let's go to our 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940
 local disk I know 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.720
 when we upload the local disk then 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.090
 let's go to the windows folder 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.990
 and then to the software folder 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.990
 distribution 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.300
 we're going to go this folder and we're going to 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.280
 go to the download folder 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.310
 and here we are going to delete all the files 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.320
 what are necessary to you can you 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.630
 appear more always delete them all 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.630
 we make a right click we delete them 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.130
 to the poor then we return to the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.590
 software distribution folder and we 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.750
 let's go to the one that says detector let's 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.900
 open this folder and here we are going to save 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.500
 that says detector edebÃ© point we're going 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.500
 to erase it 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.440
 then let's go back to the folder 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.010
 software distribution and here in the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.780
 folder post reboot event yesterday we are going to 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.490
 open it 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.940
 here I have it empty because 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.760
 recently I deleted the files 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.880
 you may see files 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.200
 if they appear they must delete them for 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.370
 that they are definitely eliminated 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.440
 then let's go back to the cmd 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.470
 and we are going to start the services again 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.180
 here we are going to change the word stop and 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.579
 let's start 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.210
 we go to the enter and it says that it is already 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:11.980
 starting then we want the other 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.980
 ned stark beats 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.400
 We pressed the entity and here we were 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.269

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.189
 your computer and well that would be all 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.000
