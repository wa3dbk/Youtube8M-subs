something<00:01:51.899> about<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.259> design<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.890> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
something about this design this I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.010 
something about this design this I
believe<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.000> pair<00:01:54.600> squirrels<00:01:54.930> design<00:01:57.020> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
believe is pair squirrels design this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
believe is pair squirrels design this
can<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.350> converted<00:01:58.799> into<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.219> into<00:01:59.880> an

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
can be converted into a into an

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.190 
can be converted into a into an
underground<00:02:00.829> tea<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> i<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:03.960> show<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
underground tea but so i will show you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.130 
underground tea but so i will show you
that<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.649> well<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:05.729> see<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that as well but you will see that that

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
that as well but you will see that that
it<00:02:07.409> gets<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.009> bulky<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.090> know

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it gets kind of bulky and I don't know

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.080 
it gets kind of bulky and I don't know
though<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.349> one<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.790> have

the<00:02:13.989> disks<00:02:14.989> are<00:02:15.110> here<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.430> have

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the disks are here the one that I have

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.050 
the disks are here the one that I have
is<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:17.659> very<00:02:18.019> lightweight<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:19.129> easier

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
is just it's very lightweight and easier

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.210 
is just it's very lightweight and easier
and<00:02:20.299> quicker<00:02:20.690> set<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.409> don't<00:02:21.560> know<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.799> just<00:02:21.830> I

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
and quicker set up I don't know I just I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.190 
and quicker set up I don't know I just I
like<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.549> overall<00:02:22.790> anyway<00:02:23.780> here's<00:02:24.080> your

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
like it overall anyway here's your

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.410 
like it overall anyway here's your
underground<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:24.860> switch<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
underground but switch and this is a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.940 
underground but switch and this is a
true<00:02:26.750> underground<00:02:27.319> but<00:02:27.500> switch<00:02:27.769> where<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
true underground but switch where the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.990 
true underground but switch where the
piston<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.040> lined<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.459> floor<00:02:31.760> here

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
piston is lined up with the floor here

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.640 
piston is lined up with the floor here
and<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.450> actually<00:02:32.629> get<00:02:32.930> receive<00:02:33.349> updates

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
and you can actually get receive updates

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.550 
and you can actually get receive updates
from<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.950> block<00:02:34.299> any<00:02:35.299> block<00:02:35.629> as<00:02:35.870> opposed<00:02:36.349> to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.479 
from a block any block as opposed to
being<00:02:36.860> limited<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.220> only<00:02:37.390> redstone<00:02:38.530> okay<00:02:40.269> so

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
being limited to only redstone okay so

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.160 
being limited to only redstone okay so
should<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.579> show<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.790> how<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.000> okay<00:02:44.930> real<00:02:45.110> quick

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
whoops okay so if you notice right here

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.559 
whoops okay so if you notice right here
let's<00:03:00.890> give<00:03:01.069> enough<00:03:01.250> really<00:03:01.700> fast<00:03:02.329> pulse<00:03:02.959> okay

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
let's give enough really fast pulse okay

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.080 
let's give enough really fast pulse okay
this<00:03:05.569> if<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:06.680> use<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.700> use<00:03:07.849> it<00:03:07.879> to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
this if you use that you can use it to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.319 
this if you use that you can use it to
your<00:03:08.209> advantage<00:03:08.269> whoops<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.760> add<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> piston

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
your advantage whoops and add a piston

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.490 
your advantage whoops and add a piston
like<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:13.420> ha<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.629> have<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.140> have<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.319> tea

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
like so and ha you have a you have a tea

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.309 
like so and ha you have a you have a tea
flip-flop<00:03:15.859> there<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.430> go<00:03:16.660> okay<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:20.169> you<00:03:21.169> could

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
flip-flop there you go okay so you could

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.080 
flip-flop there you go okay so you could
also<00:03:21.440> put<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.190> thing<00:03:23.000> right<00:03:23.030> over<00:03:23.269> here<00:03:23.569> I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
also put the thing right over here I

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.129 
also put the thing right over here I
believe<00:03:26.139> yes<00:03:27.139> yes<00:03:27.620> yes<00:03:27.829> yes<00:03:28.419> whoops<00:03:29.419> the<00:03:29.840> wrong

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
believe yes yes yes yes whoops the wrong

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:36.839 
believe yes yes yes yes whoops the wrong
block<00:03:31.000> yeah<00:03:32.019> anyway<00:03:33.019> um<00:03:33.669> so<00:03:34.669> as<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.150> can<00:03:35.269> see<00:03:35.660> I

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
block yeah anyway um so as you can see I

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.839 
block yeah anyway um so as you can see I
don't<00:03:37.849> know<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.239> me<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:38.540> it's<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.900> bit<00:03:39.049> bulky

okay and you know as you can see it does
except<00:04:09.200> block<00:04:09.530> updates<00:04:10.959> but<00:04:11.959> if<00:04:12.199> you're<00:04:12.349> gonna

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
except block updates but if you're gonna

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.800 
except block updates but if you're gonna
use<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.829> for<00:04:13.069> that<00:04:13.340> I<00:04:13.730> mean<00:04:14.120> there's<00:04:14.569> better

use it for that I mean there's better
designs<00:04:15.230> out<00:04:15.440> there<00:04:15.500> than<00:04:15.859> this<00:04:16.010> one

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
designs out there than this one

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.230 
designs out there than this one
in<00:04:19.100> fact<00:04:19.370> let<00:04:19.520> me<00:04:19.580> show<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:19.910> one<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.060> came

because that's mine this is mighty bud
if<00:04:31.340> you're<00:04:31.490> going<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.670> just<00:04:31.820> use<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.150> for<00:04:32.180> block

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
if you're going to just use it for block

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.870 
if you're going to just use it for block
updates<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.350> might<00:04:33.500> as<00:04:33.620> well<00:04:33.650> use<00:04:33.980> something
