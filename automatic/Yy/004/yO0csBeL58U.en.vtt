00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.430
 Maybe I'll do another thing 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.690
 should or not 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.060
 then you can decide depending on 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.770
 I really work a lot this little 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.740
 video here reintegrated if it maybe 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.440

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.150
 yes it was really a lot of work as I said 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.220

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.780

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.100

 I have cut in here 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.490
 of course , a video description 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.960
 definitely covers the project that 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.970
 it's worth it 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.620
 especially at the same time 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.590
 to see different perspectives 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.330
 that is very interesting I am 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.250
 curious how the project in the 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.840
 Above all, how will the future develop? 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.300
 long it will run who will like 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.880
