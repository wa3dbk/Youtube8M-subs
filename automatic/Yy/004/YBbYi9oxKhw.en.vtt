00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
skates were a size too big so I went

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.400 
skates were a size too big so I went
from<00:01:22.730> a<00:01:22.910> five<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.720> these<00:01:23.870> new<00:01:24.080> ones<00:01:24.260> I'm

or<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.700> spin<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:47.060> just<00:01:47.420> kind<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.780> out<00:01:47.870> of<00:01:47.930> whack

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
or a spin it's just kind of out of whack

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.540 
or a spin it's just kind of out of whack
and<00:01:48.200> it's<00:01:48.500> going<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.650> take<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> little<00:01:49.130> have<00:01:49.460> to

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
and it's going to take a little have to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.520 
and it's going to take a little have to
get<00:01:49.700> used<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.180> especially<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.440> know

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
get used to it especially on you know

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.219 
get used to it especially on you know
three<00:01:51.920> turns<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.460> things<00:01:52.610> like<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:52.850> but<00:01:53.229> I'm

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
three turns and things like that but I'm

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.020 
three turns and things like that but I'm
not<00:01:54.409> worried<00:01:54.650> I'll<00:01:54.770> get<00:01:54.920> used<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.460> so

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
not worried I'll get used to it and so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.260 
not worried I'll get used to it and so
the<00:01:56.479> first<00:01:56.690> clips<00:01:56.960> are<00:01:57.200> those<00:01:57.380> jumps<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:59.090> toe

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
the first clips are those jumps the toe

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.969 
the first clips are those jumps the toe
jumps<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.720> did<00:01:59.840> include<00:02:00.080> because<00:02:00.620> we<00:02:00.799> didn't

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
jumps it did include because we didn't

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.310 
jumps it did include because we didn't
do<00:02:01.100> any<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.549> first<00:02:01.790> day<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:02.960> video<00:02:03.170> was

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
still and baby you're going to the ice

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.559 
still and baby you're going to the ice
doesn't<00:02:09.560> feel<00:02:09.920> good<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:11.360> did<00:02:11.510> a

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
doesn't feel good so we just did a

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.510 
doesn't feel good so we just did a
couple<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.930> edge<00:02:12.050> jumps<00:02:12.500> themselves<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.340> some

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
couple of edge jumps themselves and some

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.840 
couple of edge jumps themselves and some
loops<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.260> after<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.410> my<00:02:16.100> program<00:02:16.580> that

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
loops and after that my program that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.820 
loops and after that my program that
Laura<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.300> put<00:02:17.450> together<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
Laura and I put together it's the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.650 
Laura and I put together it's the
shortened<00:02:19.250> one<00:02:19.520> because<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.300> first<00:02:20.450> video

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
shortened one because in the first video

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.809 
shortened one because in the first video
is<00:02:20.959> saying<00:02:21.200> because<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> concussion<00:02:22.730> i

I'm just not fit yet did not fit enough
to<00:02:33.230> go<00:02:33.410> through<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> four-minute<00:02:34.040> program<00:02:34.340> so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
to go through a four-minute program so

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.320 
to go through a four-minute program so
we<00:02:36.250> shortened<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.250> down<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.519> two<00:02:37.790> minutes<00:02:38.060> and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
we shortened it down to two minutes and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.360 
we shortened it down to two minutes and
I<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.750> kind<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.050> cut<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.350> up<00:02:39.500> there<00:02:39.980> was<00:02:40.130> one

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
I just kind of cut it up there was one

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.120 
I just kind of cut it up there was one
from<00:02:40.670> practice<00:02:41.510> run<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.170> ice<00:02:42.290> show<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.830> did

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
from practice run for the ice show I did

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.310 
from practice run for the ice show I did
and<00:02:43.310> then<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.300> regular<00:02:44.750> practice

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
and then just like a regular practice

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.060 
and then just like a regular practice
day<00:02:45.500> i<00:02:45.530> cutted<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.519> program<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:48.010> try<00:02:49.010> to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
day i cutted the program up and try to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.009 
day i cutted the program up and try to
notice<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.580> difference<00:02:50.030> between<00:02:50.239> my<00:02:50.660> skating

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
notice the difference between my skating

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.930 
notice the difference between my skating
I<00:02:51.260> guess<00:02:51.440> from<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.130> clips<00:02:52.519> where<00:02:52.640> I'm<00:02:52.730> doing

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
I guess from the clips where I'm doing

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940 
I guess from the clips where I'm doing
jumps<00:02:53.239> for<00:02:53.420> have<00:02:53.540> my<00:02:53.630> new<00:02:53.810> skates<00:02:54.080> on<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
jumps for have my new skates on and the

jumps for have my new skates on and the
clips<00:02:55.610> where<00:02:55.940> I'm<00:02:56.239> doing<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.140> programs

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
clips where I'm doing the programs

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.270 
clips where I'm doing the programs
because<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:57.860> have<00:02:58.010> my<00:02:58.130> old<00:02:58.340> skates<00:02:58.670> on<00:02:58.970> in

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280

during the clips or I'm doing the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.979 
during the clips or I'm doing the
program<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:04.269> enjoy<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:07.209> things<00:03:08.209> only<00:03:08.569> get
