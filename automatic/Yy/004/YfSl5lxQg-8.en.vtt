00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.300
 we came back to be our four minute exercises to lose fat and the 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.450
 day 1 was day of push studied is already of milestones for it we are going to begin 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.260
 with some dead prisoners we will not be inclined oars after some 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.460
 box highs and then let's do some assisted pullups remember what 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.820
 let's do for time 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 the secret of these exercises is not to count the repetitions is to concentrate 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.480
 to continue until we can no longer find the right weight that you 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.119
 allow to do the exercise until the time runs out you will discover that this 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.280
 makes a big difference in the intensity of tutsis and hutus rate 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.890
 metabolism and the hormones you produce to get the results you want 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.800
 before you start if you want more exercises like this one just review 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.160
 the address of our website that is located here below by the way 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.290
 I also want to tell you that today I will only be with you for 30 seconds 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.120
 for demonstration purposes do it for a minute the katu stopwatch in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.379
 60 seconds so when I reach them I heard an alarm can occupy a little 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.399
 slow down to do these exercises and I'm going to work my glutes 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.399
 a little the inner part of the groin and my muscles 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 keep your back flat and sit right in the hole 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 You can also do it like that 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.509
 ap 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.129
 now 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.469
 if you feel you can do dominated throughout the event 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.839
 ahead 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.119
 that is just a modification 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.069
 however most people can not be combined with the weight 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.849
 body for 60 full seconds 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 therefore do not be ashamed you are assisted 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.919
 it's more challenging to do them that way 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.900
 then that was the day 2 weights dead tilted branches alternating the 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:41.219
 variation and if you get some cash and we finish with chin-ups 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.049
 anyway 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.049
 that is the exercise on day 2 you can rotate these exercises 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.139
 day one could be done on Monday and Thursday day 2 could it be on Tuesday and 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.699
 Friday of 4 5 sets of 20 minutes of weights 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.679
 and then finish with ten or twenty minutes of cardiovascular exercises 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.569
 high intensity 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.419
 that's going to be quite invigorating and it's going to be a very effective exercise for 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.109
