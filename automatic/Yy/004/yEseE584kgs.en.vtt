like<00:00:57.149> netflix<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.719> some<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.109> like

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
like netflix and some time about like

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
like netflix and some time about like
let's<00:00:59.010> say<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> had<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.460> app<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.640> monitored

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
let's say you had an app that monitored

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
let's say you had an app that monitored
a<00:01:00.660> web<00:01:00.780> IP<00:01:00.960> cam<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.620> 1080p<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.520> would

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
a web IP cam that was 1080p it would

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.920 
a web IP cam that was 1080p it would
actually<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:03.000> able<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> transfer<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.719> cuz

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
actually be able to transfer that cuz

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
actually be able to transfer that cuz
it's<00:01:04.049> dual<00:01:04.290> band<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.129> does<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.580> 300

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it's dual band so it does up to 300

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.219 
it's dual band so it does up to 300
megabytes<00:01:06.150> per<00:01:06.360> second<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.049> more

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
megabytes per second and it has more

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
megabytes per second and it has more
than<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.560> antenna<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:09.000> does<00:01:09.150> some

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
than one antenna it also does some

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240 
than one antenna it also does some
pretty<00:01:09.540> serious<00:01:09.840> multitasking<00:01:10.619> i'd<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:11.100> as

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
pretty serious multitasking i'd say as

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
pretty serious multitasking i'd say as
far<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.150> maybe<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:12.780> bit

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
far as going maybe it's a little bit

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.940 
far as going maybe it's a little bit
better<00:01:12.990> than<00:01:13.200> android<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.740> far<00:01:13.890> as

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
better than android as far as

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
better than android as far as
multitasking<00:01:14.280> goes<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:14.880> try<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> turn<00:01:15.780> on

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
multitasking goes I just try to turn on

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
multitasking goes I just try to turn on
like<00:01:16.049> every<00:01:16.380> app<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:16.979> handled<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.400> no

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
like every app here and it handled it no

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310 
like every app here and it handled it no
problem<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.240> pretty<00:01:18.600> impressive<00:01:18.960> now

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
problem so that's pretty impressive now

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.780

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.620 
very similar to other tablets the top
right<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> give<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.329> power

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
right is going to give you your power

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
right is going to give you your power
and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.619> also<00:01:34.920> over<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> right

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and then also over here on the right

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.210 
and then also over here on the right
again<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> other<00:01:37.200> tablets<00:01:37.710> there

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
again like a lot of other tablets there

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.819 
again like a lot of other tablets there
is<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> volume<00:01:39.390> control<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.409> bottom<00:01:40.710> you'll

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
is a volume control on the bottom you'll

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.090 
is a volume control on the bottom you'll
see<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.240> mini<00:01:42.240> USB<00:01:42.540> 2.0<00:01:43.020> port<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> can

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
see the mini USB 2.0 port now you can

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
see the mini USB 2.0 port now you can
use<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> regular<00:01:44.850> USB<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:46.079> actually

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
use it as a regular USB or this actually

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.960 
use it as a regular USB or this actually
has<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> couple<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.280> accessories<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
