For Soup the girl the bad guys want so
it's<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> little<00:00:08.880> bit<00:00:09.090> hard<00:00:09.540> like<00:00:10.519> one<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.580> those

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
it's a little bit hard like one of those

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.580 
it's a little bit hard like one of those
songs<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.179> sounds<00:00:12.540> easy<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> little

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
songs it sounds easy but it is a little

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.740 
songs it sounds easy but it is a little
bit<00:00:13.710> tricky<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.000> would<00:00:15.179> do<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.509> pull<00:00:15.719> up

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
bit tricky so what I would do is pull up

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.040 
bit tricky so what I would do is pull up
the<00:00:15.990> two<00:00:16.139> tabs<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.100> think<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:18.000> helpful<00:00:18.050> so

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the two tabs that I think are helpful so

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.109 
the two tabs that I think are helpful so
the<00:00:19.140> first<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.650> version<00:00:20.369> six<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.000> it's

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the first one is version six and it's

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.929 
the first one is version six and it's
super<00:00:21.539> accurate<00:00:22.250> but<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.279> don't<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.609> how<00:00:23.699> good

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
super accurate but I don't know how good

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.519 
super accurate but I don't know how good
you<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.570> would<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.810> too<00:00:24.990> hard<00:00:25.260> for

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
you are like this would be too hard for

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.120 
you are like this would be too hard for
a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> my<00:00:25.980> students<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> play<00:00:26.609> um<00:00:28.130> like

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
a lot of my students to play um like

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.209 
a lot of my students to play um like
beginner<00:00:29.670> students<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.769> that's<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:32.009> because

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
beginner students so that's just because

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.370 
beginner students so that's just because
it<00:00:32.550> uses<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> lot<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.719> kind<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.020> subtle

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it uses like a lot of kind of subtle

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
it uses like a lot of kind of subtle
little<00:00:34.530> things<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.370> here's<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> intro<00:00:36.059> from

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
little things but here's the intro from

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.330 
little things but here's the intro from
that<00:00:37.200> tab<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:39.860> one<00:00:40.860> thing<00:00:41.160> this

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that tab so can I go one thing this

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.080 
that tab so can I go one thing this
needs<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.670> drop<00:00:42.000> D<00:00:42.270> tuning<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
needs to be drop D tuning so what you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.729 
needs to be drop D tuning so what you
have<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.570> real<00:00:45.809> fast<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:46.680> know

have to do real fast if you don't know

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.490 
have to do real fast if you don't know
how<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.070> drop<00:00:47.340> D<00:00:47.520> tuning<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:50.760> need<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
how to do drop D tuning is you need to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:00.479 
how to do drop D tuning is you need to
say<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.739> regular<00:00:53.039> tuning

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.369 

and<00:01:01.489> power<00:01:02.030> cords<00:01:02.359> like<00:01:02.449> power<00:01:03.019> cords<00:01:03.320> like

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
and power cords like power cords like

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.649 
and power cords like power cords like
that<00:01:03.739> right

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
that right

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.120 
that right
listen<00:01:05.659> drop<00:01:05.930> D<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:06.409> you<00:01:06.500> do<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.710> hit<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.950> D

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
listen drop D so you do is hit the D

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:20.920 
listen drop D so you do is hit the D
string<00:01:08.020> I'm<00:01:09.020> starting<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:19.180> now<00:01:20.180> power<00:01:20.630> cords

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
string I'm starting this now power cords

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.679 
string I'm starting this now power cords
are<00:01:21.020> like<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:24.340> okay<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.240> if<00:01:26.299> there's<00:01:26.420> make

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
are like this okay so if there's make

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.149 
are like this okay so if there's make
sense<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:27.020> just<00:01:27.229> get<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.350> tuner<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:27.770> tunas

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
sense you just get a tuner and tunas

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.090 
sense you just get a tuner and tunas
down<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.580> D<00:01:29.200> then<00:01:30.200> what<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.649> want<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.890> do<00:01:30.979> is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
down to D then what you want to do is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.570 
down to D then what you want to do is
look<00:01:31.520> at<00:01:31.700> version<00:01:31.880> 16<00:01:32.509> shows<00:01:32.780> real<00:01:33.080> Gators<00:01:36.580> so

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
look at version 16 shows real Gators so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:02:10.089 
look at version 16 shows real Gators so
that<00:01:37.970> was<00:01:38.060> fast<00:01:38.330> but<00:01:38.630> you<00:02:08.769> structured<00:02:09.769> slow<00:02:10.039> so

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
that was fast but you structured slow so

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.360 
that was fast but you structured slow so
you<00:02:10.310> got<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:14.379> kind<00:02:15.379> of<00:02:15.440> helps<00:02:15.680> us<00:02:15.800> remember<00:02:16.129> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
you got it kind of helps us remember the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.509 
you got it kind of helps us remember the
first<00:02:16.610> notice<00:02:17.230> then<00:02:18.230> he<00:02:18.290> goes<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.590> four<00:02:18.830> and

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
first notice then he goes to four and

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.320 
first notice then he goes to four and
five<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:21.410> they<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.560> mean<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.030> notes<00:02:23.030> on<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
five so they I mean the the notes on the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:33.180 
five so they I mean the the notes on the
bond<00:02:23.510> string<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:26.230> okay<00:02:27.230> now<00:02:27.409> I<00:02:27.440> memorize<00:02:27.860> it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.670 

was<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> first<00:02:34.580> part<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.959> next<00:02:36.110> part<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.590> would

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
was the first part the next part I would

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.649 
was the first part the next part I would
also<00:02:36.800> look<00:02:37.069> at<00:02:37.159> version<00:02:37.340> 6<00:02:37.819> and<00:02:38.000> after<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.450> I

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
also look at version 6 and after this I

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.030 
also look at version 6 and after this I
would<00:02:38.780> go<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.170> other<00:02:39.290> tab<00:02:39.590> which<00:02:39.890> is

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
would go to the other tab which is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.309 
would go to the other tab which is
version<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:41.500> don't<00:02:42.500> know<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:42.739> version<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.280> is

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
version I don't know what version it is

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.259 
version I don't know what version it is
I'm<00:02:45.319> not<00:02:45.470> sure<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:46.159> it's<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.430> alright<00:02:46.819> easier

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
I'm not sure but it's the alright easier

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.070 
I'm not sure but it's the alright easier
tab<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.840> description<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.840> easy

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
tab in the description so I the the easy

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.899 
tab in the description so I the the easy
the<00:02:51.379> easier<00:02:51.680> tabs<00:02:51.920> got<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.489> part<00:02:52.700> wrong

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
the easier tabs got this part wrong

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.240 
the easier tabs got this part wrong
definitely<00:02:53.599> so<00:02:54.140> look<00:02:54.470> at<00:02:54.590> version<00:02:54.739> six<00:02:55.069> for

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
definitely so look at version six for

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:07.020 
definitely so look at version six for
this<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.610> going<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.760> be<00:02:55.879> all<00:02:55.970> zeros

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.360 

zero<00:03:08.030> one<00:03:08.990> two<00:03:09.020> three<00:03:09.530> four<00:03:09.830> one<00:03:09.950> two<00:03:10.010> three

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
zero one two three four one two three

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:29.300 
zero one two three four one two three
four<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:11.180> five<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:12.640> seven<00:03:14.200> four<00:03:15.200> times

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.449 

after<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.730> switch<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.269> easier<00:03:31.390> tab<00:03:32.459> to

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.679 
after this I switch to the easier tab to
learn<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.760> other<00:03:33.909> parts<00:03:34.299> because<00:03:34.540> they're

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
learn the other parts because they're

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.069 
learn the other parts because they're
accurate<00:03:34.989> enough<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:37.450> only<00:03:37.480> thing<00:03:37.780> like<00:03:37.930> I

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
accurate enough the only thing like I

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.780 
accurate enough the only thing like I
said<00:03:38.110> was<00:03:38.409> wrong<00:03:38.620> was<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.040> intro<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.670> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
said was wrong was that intro on the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.699 
said was wrong was that intro on the
verse<00:03:40.000> cuz<00:03:40.989> they<00:03:41.110> have<00:03:41.140> zero<00:03:41.319> they<00:03:41.920> have<00:03:43.709> this

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
verse cuz they have zero they have this

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.670 
verse cuz they have zero they have this
is<00:03:44.920> not<00:03:45.099> right<00:03:45.629> after<00:03:46.629> that<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.260> want<00:03:47.439> to<00:03:47.500> go

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
is not right after that you want to go

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.860

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:36.799 
and I'll just do version six because

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:38.349 
and I'll just do version six because
it's<00:06:36.949> got<00:06:37.069> like<00:06:37.249> a<00:06:37.279> lot<00:06:37.489> of<00:06:37.579> weird<00:06:37.759> stuff<00:06:37.819> like
