above<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.630> servo<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:12.400> luckily<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:13.329> not

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
above the servo but luckily it's not

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.000 
above the servo but luckily it's not
going<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.810> damage<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.230> server<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.920> because

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
going to damage the server so because

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.199 
going to damage the server so because
zoom<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.549> can<00:03:18.579> see<00:03:18.819> over<00:03:19.030> there<00:03:21.120> there's<00:03:22.120> a

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
zoom in you can see over there there's a

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.020 
zoom in you can see over there there's a
boat<00:03:22.389> there<00:03:22.450> going<00:03:22.930> right<00:03:23.170> down<00:03:23.200> through

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
boat there going right down through

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.110 
boat there going right down through
straight<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.299> man

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.460 

so<00:03:28.629> that<00:03:28.930> should<00:03:29.170> be<00:03:29.200> right<00:03:31.470> pretty

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
so that should be right pretty

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.410 
so that should be right pretty
rock-solid<00:03:32.890> that's<00:03:33.069> fixed<00:03:33.580> straight<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.330> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
rock-solid that's fixed straight to the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.030 
rock-solid that's fixed straight to the

there's a light is to put it on a time

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.809 
there's a light is to put it on a time
you<00:04:08.109> move<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.769> slightly<00:04:09.099> up<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.670> down

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
you move it slightly up and down

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.899 
you move it slightly up and down
whatever<00:04:10.260> you're<00:04:11.260> in<00:04:11.410> sac<00:04:11.650> bread<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.819> took

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
whatever you're in sac bread so I took

the<00:04:13.090> switch<00:04:13.390> Mordreaux<00:04:13.870> well<00:04:14.739> I've<00:04:14.829> met<00:04:15.010> with

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
the switch Mordreaux well I've met with

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.390 
the switch Mordreaux well I've met with
a<00:04:15.190> switch<00:04:15.400> module<00:04:15.790> here<00:04:16.620> brother<00:04:17.620> works<00:04:18.100> fine

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
a switch module here brother works fine

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.879 
a switch module here brother works fine
but<00:04:18.669> I'll<00:04:19.239> see<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.840> can<00:04:20.049> easily<00:04:20.320> knock<00:04:20.680> it

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
but I'll see you can easily knock it

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.159 
but I'll see you can easily knock it
sometimes<00:04:21.900> it's<00:04:22.900> quite<00:04:23.080> freely<00:04:23.410> moving<00:04:25.139> so<00:04:26.139> i

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
sometimes it's quite freely moving so i

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.810 
sometimes it's quite freely moving so i
thought<00:04:26.500> it's<00:04:26.650> better<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:27.010> just<00:04:27.160> have<00:04:27.400> it

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
thought it's better to just have it

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.450 
thought it's better to just have it
