background image feature in Rhino so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.280 
background image feature in Rhino so
that<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.640> could<00:01:16.820> get<00:01:17.030> good<00:01:17.330> detail<00:01:17.870> in<00:01:18.170> the

that I could get good detail in the
outline<00:01:18.680> by<00:01:19.400> drawing<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:20.000> curve<00:01:20.360> then<00:01:21.290> using

exact watch here coming up and you'll
see<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.800> mistake<00:01:28.510> that's<00:01:29.510> a<00:01:29.750> no-no<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.740> in<00:01:30.890> this

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
see a mistake that's a no-no but in this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.260 
see a mistake that's a no-no but in this
case<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.460> won't<00:01:31.550> show<00:01:31.820> up

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
case it won't show up

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.560 
case it won't show up
I<00:01:32.950> could<00:01:33.950> have<00:01:34.100> slowed<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.580> Z<00:01:34.850> speed<00:01:35.210> slightly

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
I could have slowed the Z speed slightly

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.750 
I could have slowed the Z speed slightly
or<00:01:35.990> used<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.410> tail<00:01:36.650> stock<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.160> prevent<00:01:37.520> that

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
or used a tail stock to prevent that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.060 
or used a tail stock to prevent that
that's<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.570> great<00:01:38.870> way<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.110> snap<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> tool<00:01:39.890> or

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
that's a great way to snap a tool or

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.600 
that's a great way to snap a tool or
ruin<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:40.400> part<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:42.280> constant<00:01:43.280> rotary
