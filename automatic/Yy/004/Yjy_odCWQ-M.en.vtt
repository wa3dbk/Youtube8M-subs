about this little piece of gear which is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.680 
about this little piece of gear which is
a<00:00:13.920> follow<00:00:14.400> focus<00:00:14.580> from<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> company<00:00:15.389> called

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
a follow focus from the company called

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.779 
a follow focus from the company called
Lydia<00:00:16.080> ow<00:00:16.220> personally<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.250> never<00:00:17.430> heard<00:00:17.670> of

Lydia ow personally I never heard of
that<00:00:17.850> company<00:00:18.300> before<00:00:18.600> honest<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.939> on<00:00:20.939> the

that company before honest and on the
first<00:00:21.210> look<00:00:21.480> most<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.800> think<00:00:22.980> many

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
first look most of you I think many

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.519 
first look most of you I think many
people<00:00:24.060> who<00:00:24.390> watch<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.750> video<00:00:24.960> will<00:00:25.260> think

people who watch this video will think

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.070 
people who watch this video will think
that<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.460> doesn't<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:27.119> good<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.930> I'm

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that this one doesn't look good and I'm

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960 
that this one doesn't look good and I'm
totally<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.220> design<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.910> not

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
totally with you the design is not

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.999 
totally with you the design is not
really<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.840> call<00:00:31.140> modern<00:00:31.380> though<00:00:31.800> which

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
really what we call modern though which

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.700 
really what we call modern though which
is<00:00:32.130> nice<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.870> function<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
is nice but the function and this is the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.170 
is nice but the function and this is the
main<00:00:34.950> thing<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.760> important<00:00:36.120> about

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
main thing that is important about

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
main thing that is important about
falsehood<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.079> function<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> book

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
falsehood is the function and the book

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.619 
falsehood is the function and the book
quality<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.730> device<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.390> really

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
quality of this device is really

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.060 
quality of this device is really
stunning<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
stunning but you can see here now is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
stunning but you can see here now is
that<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.700> full<00:00:41.969> focus<00:00:42.149> only<00:00:42.390> connects<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that this full focus only connects to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.389 
that this full focus only connects to
one<00:00:43.140> rock<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.530> pretty<00:00:43.800> cool<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
one rock this is pretty cool because it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.040 
one rock this is pretty cool because it
leaves<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.640> bit<00:00:44.760> more<00:00:44.969> room<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> saves<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> bit

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
leaves a bit more room and saves a bit

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.779 
leaves a bit more room and saves a bit
of<00:00:46.110> weight<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> single

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
of weight when we have a one as a single

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
of weight when we have a one as a single
rod<00:00:48.000> connected<00:00:48.420> follow<00:00:48.600> focus<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
rod connected follow focus we have to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.240 
rod connected follow focus we have to
unlock<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.640> main<00:00:50.879> screw<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
unlock the main screw and just get it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.430 
unlock the main screw and just get it
the<00:00:53.610> follow<00:00:53.789> focus<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.270> angle<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the follow focus to an angle so it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
the follow focus to an angle so it
connects<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> blend<00:00:56.460> however<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.719> full

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
connects to blend however on this full

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.330 
connects to blend however on this full
of<00:00:57.989> focus<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.379> also<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
of focus we can also get it to a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.979 
of focus we can also get it to a
position<00:00:59.579> where<00:00:59.879> we<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.239> simply<00:01:00.809> might

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
position where we want it simply might

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.080 
position where we want it simply might
be<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> bit<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.879> lower

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
be like this so we get a bit of a lower

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149 
be like this so we get a bit of a lower
angle<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.040> can

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
angle if you want it to then we can

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
angle if you want it to then we can
unscrew<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:07.460> also<00:01:08.460> shift<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.450> focus

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
unscrew this and also shift the focus

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.760 
unscrew this and also shift the focus
unit<00:01:11.150> closer<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> camera<00:01:13.049> offer<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> way

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
unit closer to the camera offer the way

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.560 
unit closer to the camera offer the way
just<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.090> pretty<00:01:15.360> cool

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
just how we like it a pretty cool

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
just how we like it a pretty cool
feature<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.369> common<00:01:18.000> for

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
feature and this is not common for

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.240 
feature and this is not common for
single<00:01:18.930> route<00:01:19.080> connecting<00:01:19.259> color<00:01:19.560> focuses<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
single route connecting color focuses so

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
single route connecting color focuses so
you<00:01:20.340> may<00:01:20.520> already<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.970> seen<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.900> gear

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
you may already have seen that the gear

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.590 
you may already have seen that the gear
wheel<00:01:22.470> itself<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.400> reversible<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.479> are

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
wheel itself is not reversible so we are

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.070 
wheel itself is not reversible so we are
fixed<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.170> side<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:27.080> gearbox

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
fixed on one side of the gearbox

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.760 
fixed on one side of the gearbox
mechanism<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:31.020> may<00:01:31.229> sound<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
mechanism so this may sound like a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.170 
mechanism so this may sound like a
downside<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> isn't<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.909> will<00:01:33.060> tell

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
downside but it isn't and I will tell

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.399 
downside but it isn't and I will tell
you<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> second<00:01:33.659> why<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> actually<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you in a second why this is actually a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.140 
you in a second why this is actually a
great<00:01:34.530> benefit<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.820> i<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:35.970> show

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
great benefit but for now i will show

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450 
great benefit but for now i will show
you<00:01:36.299> something<00:01:36.720> because<00:01:37.710> here's<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.189> little

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.850 
side I have a little allen key here so
we<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.079> lose<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.920> glue<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.860> I'm

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
we can just lose this glue a bit and I'm

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.609 
we can just lose this glue a bit and I'm
not<00:01:47.009> very<00:01:47.159> good<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:49.200> thing<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> we

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
not very good at this so one thing is we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.039 
not very good at this so one thing is we
can<00:01:49.799> adjust<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> height<00:01:50.630> as<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.930> see

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
can adjust the height as you can see

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
can adjust the height as you can see
here<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.979> also<00:01:53.130> revert<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.329> whole

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
here we can also revert the whole

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.980 
here we can also revert the whole
gearbox<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.310> pretty<00:01:56.490> cool<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:57.930> we

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
gearbox which is pretty cool and now we

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
gearbox which is pretty cool and now we
can<00:01:58.200> tie<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.439> again<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.579> actually

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
can tie this again this is actually

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.249 
can tie this again this is actually
pretty<00:02:00.000> fast<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.479> you're<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.659> bit<00:02:00.840> better<00:02:00.960> in

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
pretty fast if you're a bit better in

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.609 
pretty fast if you're a bit better in
this<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> am<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.149> now<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.590> have

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
this and I am so and now we have

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.850 
this and I am so and now we have
reversed<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.579> gear<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.380> now<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.560> tell

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
reversed the gear and now I will tell

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.859 
reversed the gear and now I will tell
you<00:02:07.979> why<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.849> actually<00:02:09.149> benefit<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.840> not

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you why this is actually benefit and not

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.630 
you why this is actually benefit and not
a<00:02:10.289> downside<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.400> big<00:02:11.580> thing

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
a downside so there is one big thing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.190 
a downside so there is one big thing
that<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.300> hate<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.690> full<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.930> oak

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that we all hate with full of oak

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.470 
that we all hate with full of oak
devis<00:02:13.770> backlash<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.940> full<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.180> focus

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.559 
devis backlash this full of focus

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
all it has the tiniest bit of backlash

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.150 
all it has the tiniest bit of backlash
as<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.120> here<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:21.599> it's<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.800> tiny<00:02:23.040> I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
as you can see here now it's so tiny I

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.369 
as you can see here now it's so tiny I
maybe<00:02:23.790> won't<00:02:24.180> even<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.569> able<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.019> see<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.319> on

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
maybe won't even be able to see it on

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.430 
maybe won't even be able to see it on
the<00:02:25.500> camera<00:02:25.819> however<00:02:26.819> um<00:02:27.140> virtually<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.319> is

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the camera however um virtually there is

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.900 
the camera however um virtually there is
no<00:02:28.560> backlight<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.099> follow<00:02:29.280> focus<00:02:29.459> and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
no backlight on this follow focus and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
no backlight on this follow focus and
the<00:02:30.090> thing<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.330> when<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.200> gears<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the thing is when you have gears that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.160 
the thing is when you have gears that
are<00:02:31.739> reversible<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.780> introduce

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
are reversible this can introduce

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.160 
are reversible this can introduce
backlash<00:02:35.010> over<00:02:35.190> time<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.090> far<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.390> owned<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.989> few

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
backlash over time so far I owned a few

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.470 
backlash over time so far I owned a few
follow<00:02:37.380> focuses<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.010> usually<00:02:38.400> always<00:02:38.760> after

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
follow focuses and usually always after

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.059 
follow focuses and usually always after
some<00:02:39.690> time<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.049> may<00:02:40.230> be<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.410> year<00:02:40.799> or<00:02:40.950> maybe

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
some time this may be a year or maybe

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.460 
some time this may be a year or maybe
two<00:02:41.459> years<00:02:41.489> they<00:02:42.180> always<00:02:42.450> introduce<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.260> bit<00:02:43.379> of

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
two years they always introduce a bit of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.350 
two years they always introduce a bit of
backlash<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.190> was<00:02:44.340> not<00:02:44.519> purely<00:02:45.060> because

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
backlash and this was not purely because

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.120 
backlash and this was not purely because
of<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> gear<00:02:46.110> wheel<00:02:46.349> or<00:02:46.560> break<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.860> up<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
of the gear wheel or break it up the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.039 
of the gear wheel or break it up the
gearbox<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:47.790> because<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.569> connection

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
gearbox but because of the connection

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.289 
gearbox but because of the connection
from<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.349> gear<00:02:49.650> wheel<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.580> gearbox<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
from the gear wheel to the gearbox and

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.930 
from the gear wheel to the gearbox and
usually<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.590> at<00:02:52.769> some<00:02:53.220> point<00:02:53.459> connected

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
usually this is at some point connected

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.240 
usually this is at some point connected
to<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.870> mechanism<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.650> lets<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:55.950> change

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
to the mechanism that lets you change

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.910 
to the mechanism that lets you change
and<00:02:56.579> revert<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.780> gears<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.620> now<00:02:58.739> where<00:02:58.890> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
and revert the gears so now where the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.490 
and revert the gears so now where the
gear<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.519> solidly<00:02:59.910> connected<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.959> gearbox

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
gear is solidly connected to the gearbox

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.589 
gear is solidly connected to the gearbox
and<00:03:01.769> not<00:03:02.069> reversible<00:03:02.670> at<00:03:02.849> all<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.180> cannot

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
and not reversible at all so you cannot

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.170 
and not reversible at all so you cannot
change<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.319> connection<00:03:04.829> between<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
change the connection between it to you

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.789 
change the connection between it to you
have<00:03:06.269> too<00:03:06.390> much<00:03:06.540> more<00:03:07.079> solid<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.680> much

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
have too much more solid and much

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.800 
have too much more solid and much
stronger<00:03:08.250> connection<00:03:09.000> between<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.420> two<00:03:09.599> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
stronger connection between the two and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.250 
stronger connection between the two and
therefore<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:11.160> are<00:03:11.370> most<00:03:12.120> likely<00:03:12.630> not<00:03:12.989> to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
therefore you are most likely not to

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.949 
therefore you are most likely not to
introduce<00:03:13.590> any<00:03:13.950> backlash<00:03:14.190> at<00:03:14.519> all<00:03:14.670> over<00:03:15.540> the

introduce any backlash at all over the
years<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.349> using<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.739> because<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.099> mechanism

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
years of using it because the mechanism

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.440 
years of using it because the mechanism
can<00:03:18.269> be<00:03:18.329> we<00:03:18.660> can't<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.049> wasted<00:03:19.489> with<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:21.239> force

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
can be we can't be wasted with the force

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.120

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
whole gearbox and not only the gear

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.559 
whole gearbox and not only the gear
wheel<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.340> much<00:03:32.549> better<00:03:32.790> connection<00:03:33.299> you

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
wheel if the much better connection you

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.979 
wheel if the much better connection you
still<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.049> change<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.440> pretty<00:03:34.980> fast<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
still can change it pretty fast and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.750 
still can change it pretty fast and
you're<00:03:36.989> pretty<00:03:37.200> much<00:03:37.319> suited<00:03:37.739> for<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.609> later

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
you're pretty much suited for the later

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
you're pretty much suited for the later
years<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.389> next<00:03:39.660> thing<00:03:39.900> we<00:03:40.079> usually<00:03:40.380> are

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
years the next thing we usually are

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.379 
years the next thing we usually are
worried<00:03:40.650> about<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.130> how<00:03:41.549> smooth<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.239> full

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
worried about is how smooth is this full

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.509 
worried about is how smooth is this full
of<00:03:42.420> focus<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.410> photo<00:03:43.620> focus<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.040> actually

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
of focus so this photo focus is actually

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.090 
of focus so this photo focus is actually
a<00:03:44.700> bit<00:03:45.000> stiff<00:03:45.389> so<00:03:45.660> it's<00:03:45.810> not<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.319> lose<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.010> you

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
a bit stiff so it's not to lose so you

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.849 
a bit stiff so it's not to lose so you
know<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.670> can't<00:03:48.049> breathe<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.470> it

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
know you just can't breathe it it and it

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.460 
know you just can't breathe it it and it
turns<00:03:50.190> around<00:03:50.519> 180<00:03:51.150> degrees<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.260> use

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
turns around 180 degrees you have to use

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.020 
turns around 180 degrees you have to use
some<00:03:52.829> force<00:03:53.100> personally<00:03:53.609> like<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.850> very

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
some force personally like this very

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.530 
some force personally like this very
much<00:03:54.209> because<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.410> have<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.280> ability<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.639> to

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
much because you have the ability to to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.870 
much because you have the ability to to
be<00:03:57.690> much<00:03:58.019> more<00:03:58.049> precise<00:03:58.620> with<00:03:59.099> your<00:03:59.160> movement

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
be much more precise with your movement

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.970 
be much more precise with your movement
much<00:04:00.329> more<00:04:00.599> precise<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.380> hedge<00:04:01.560> map<00:04:01.769> more

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
much more precise and hedge map more

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.129 
much more precise and hedge map more
control<00:04:02.489> over<00:04:02.670> your<00:04:03.090> focus<00:04:03.599> that's<00:04:04.049> some

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
control over your focus that's some

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.140 
control over your focus that's some
people<00:04:04.349> like<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:04.650> fast<00:04:04.859> so<00:04:05.760> basically

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
people like it really fast so basically

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.390 
people like it really fast so basically
that<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.569> why<00:04:06.780> we<00:04:07.230> get<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.829> little<00:04:08.040> handle

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
that is why we get this little handle

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.890 
that is why we get this little handle
which<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.670> basically<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.090> speed<00:04:09.359> crank<00:04:09.660> for

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
which is basically a speed crank for

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.440 
which is basically a speed crank for
free<00:04:10.200> with<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.680> fellow<00:04:10.889> focus<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.849> basically

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
free with this fellow focus so basically

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.839 
free with this fellow focus so basically
the<00:04:12.959> most<00:04:13.079> foully<00:04:13.380> focuses<00:04:13.829> have<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.430> standard

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
the most foully focuses have a standard

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.770 
the most foully focuses have a standard
accessory<00:04:15.329> port<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.680> knob<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:18.180> speed

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
accessory port on the knob and the speed

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.870 
accessory port on the knob and the speed
crank<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.109> course<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.709> fitting<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.549> standard

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
crank of course is fitting the standard

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.640 
crank of course is fitting the standard
of<00:04:20.940> Saturday<00:04:21.269> poor<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.140> can<00:04:22.260> simply<00:04:22.380> go

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
of Saturday poor so you can simply go

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.330 
of Saturday poor so you can simply go
get<00:04:22.800> up<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.610> then<00:04:23.729> pull<00:04:23.909> focus

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.339 

blazing<00:04:27.340> fast<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.699> just<00:04:28.599> for<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.780> record<00:04:28.960> of

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
blazing fast and just for the record of

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.499 
blazing fast and just for the record of
course<00:04:29.860> we<00:04:30.220> have<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.340> marking<00:04:30.729> disk<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.270> while

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
course we have a marking disk and while

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.029 
course we have a marking disk and while
we're<00:04:31.629> talking<00:04:31.840> about<00:04:32.110> what's<00:04:32.379> in<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.500> box<00:04:32.740> we

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
we're talking about what's in the box we

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.619 
we're talking about what's in the box we
also<00:04:33.160> get<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.430> gearing<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.120> smaller<00:04:34.389> one<00:04:34.599> and

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
also get to gearing a smaller one and

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.570 
also get to gearing a smaller one and
the<00:04:34.810> bigger<00:04:35.020> one<00:04:35.229> so<00:04:35.259> basically<00:04:35.979> we<00:04:36.159> can<00:04:36.340> fit

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the bigger one so basically we can fit

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.029 
the bigger one so basically we can fit
any<00:04:36.849> lens<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.599> actually<00:04:38.560> these<00:04:38.710> are<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.919> good

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
any lens and actually these are the good

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.909 
any lens and actually these are the good
ones<00:04:39.280> because<00:04:39.639> these<00:04:39.819> are<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.060> bit<00:04:40.180> thinner<00:04:40.539> and

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
ones because these are a bit thinner and

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.589 
ones because these are a bit thinner and
hard<00:04:41.919> enough<00:04:42.159> so<00:04:42.490> we<00:04:42.610> don't<00:04:42.819> lose<00:04:43.000> any<00:04:43.330> can't

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
hard enough so we don't lose any can't

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.420 
hard enough so we don't lose any can't
grip<00:04:43.810> on<00:04:44.050> our<00:04:44.409> Lance's<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.190> follow<00:04:45.370> focus

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
grip on our Lance's and the follow focus

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.550 
grip on our Lance's and the follow focus
in<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.240> real-life<00:04:46.419> situation<00:04:47.199> it's<00:04:47.319> pretty

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
in the real-life situation it's pretty

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.469 
in the real-life situation it's pretty
cool<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:48.039> you<00:04:48.430> connect<00:04:48.759> this<00:04:49.000> whole<00:04:49.210> focus

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
cool that you connect this whole focus

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.180 
cool that you connect this whole focus
only<00:04:49.599> 21<00:04:50.050> rot<00:04:50.259> the<00:04:50.379> kiss<00:04:50.560> when<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.860> then<00:04:51.039> lose

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.730 
focus just like everybody likes it if
you<00:05:13.479> watch<00:05:13.659> my<00:05:13.810> channel<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.139> bit<00:05:14.289> more<00:05:14.440> often

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
you watch my channel a bit more often

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.020 
you watch my channel a bit more often
you<00:05:14.860> know<00:05:15.009> how<00:05:15.159> I<00:05:15.190> like<00:05:15.400> my<00:05:15.460> things<00:05:15.759> I<00:05:15.880> like

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
you know how I like my things I like

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.149 
you know how I like my things I like
them<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.210> be<00:05:16.300> strong<00:05:16.630> durable<00:05:17.259> and<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.979> last

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
them to be strong durable and to last

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.249 
them to be strong durable and to last
forever<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.849> this<00:05:19.270> full<00:05:19.449> of<00:05:19.479> focus<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.960> really

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
forever and this full of focus is really

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.890 
forever and this full of focus is really
built<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:21.069> last<00:05:21.219> I<00:05:21.490> really<00:05:21.759> like<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.690> build

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
built to last I really like the build

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.480 
built to last I really like the build
quality<00:05:23.110> of<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.560> because<00:05:23.800> it's<00:05:23.979> so<00:05:24.159> strong

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
quality of it because it's so strong

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.149 
quality of it because it's so strong
it's<00:05:24.729> pretty<00:05:25.300> simple<00:05:25.599> build<00:05:26.379> and<00:05:26.680> it's<00:05:27.039> not

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
it's pretty simple build and it's not

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.370 
it's pretty simple build and it's not
that<00:05:27.190> big<00:05:27.520> however<00:05:28.180> it's<00:05:28.509> really<00:05:29.080> strong

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
that big however it's really strong

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.200 
that big however it's really strong
build<00:05:29.680> you<00:05:29.860> know<00:05:29.919> it's<00:05:30.159> also<00:05:30.310> not<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.789> that

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
build you know it's also not that that

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.050 
build you know it's also not that that
the<00:05:31.539> light<00:05:31.780> it's<00:05:32.110> not<00:05:32.800> heavy<00:05:33.099> at<00:05:33.520> all<00:05:33.669> you<00:05:33.940> know

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
the light it's not heavy at all you know

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
the light it's not heavy at all you know
it's<00:05:34.330> something<00:05:34.870> in<00:05:35.349> between<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:36.490> um<00:05:37.449> I<00:05:37.750> really

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
it's something in between so um I really

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.990 
it's something in between so um I really
like<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.319> mechanism<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:38.949> I<00:05:39.250> cannot<00:05:39.550> enhance

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
like the mechanism and I cannot enhance

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.749 
like the mechanism and I cannot enhance
or<00:05:40.270> expose<00:05:41.199> enough<00:05:41.590> how<00:05:41.979> great<00:05:42.250> it<00:05:42.370> is<00:05:42.460> or<00:05:42.699> a

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
or expose enough how great it is or a

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.420 
or expose enough how great it is or a
hug<00:05:43.210> I<00:05:43.389> like<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.409> this<00:05:44.770> gear<00:05:45.190> isn't

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
hug I like it that this gear isn't

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.790 
hug I like it that this gear isn't
reversible<00:05:46.090> but<00:05:46.569> only<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.930> gearbox<00:05:47.440> because

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
reversible but only the gearbox because

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.159 
reversible but only the gearbox because
this<00:05:48.340> makes<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.759> follow<00:05:48.909> focus<00:05:48.969> at<00:05:49.360> all<00:05:49.449> a<00:05:49.659> lot

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
this makes the follow focus at all a lot

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.399 
this makes the follow focus at all a lot
more<00:05:50.349> durable<00:05:51.009> for<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:51.909> future<00:05:52.539> and<00:05:52.779> from<00:05:53.319> the

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
more durable for the future and from the

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.129 
more durable for the future and from the
pier<00:05:53.620> build<00:05:53.860> quality<00:05:54.009> spoken<00:05:54.669> and<00:05:55.509> now<00:05:55.630> Iraq

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
pier build quality spoken and now Iraq

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.709 
pier build quality spoken and now Iraq
the<00:05:56.469> knob<00:05:57.039> fields<00:05:57.430> interact<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:58.330> whole

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
the knob fields interact the whole

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.649 
the knob fields interact the whole
mechanism<00:05:59.319> fields<00:05:59.919> it<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.639> clearly<00:06:01.060> stronger

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
mechanism fields it is clearly stronger

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.209 
mechanism fields it is clearly stronger
and<00:06:01.810> better<00:06:01.960> than<00:06:02.380> my<00:06:02.469> father<00:06:02.650> follow<00:06:03.009> focus

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
and better than my father follow focus

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.399 
and better than my father follow focus
so<00:06:03.940> despite<00:06:04.150> this<00:06:04.479> is<00:06:04.599> somewhat<00:06:04.870> off<00:06:04.870> design

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
so despite this is somewhat off design

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.100 
so despite this is somewhat off design
the<00:06:05.830> follow<00:06:06.009> focus<00:06:06.099> from<00:06:06.490> Lydia<00:06:06.940> is<00:06:07.360> really

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
the follow focus from Lydia is really

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.809 
the follow focus from Lydia is really
worth<00:06:08.319> a<00:06:08.440> try<00:06:08.650> because<00:06:08.830> it<00:06:09.099> is<00:06:09.190> also<00:06:09.370> super

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
worth a try because it is also super

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.850 
worth a try because it is also super
affordable<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.659> this<00:06:10.810> is<00:06:10.960> maybe<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.560> basic

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
affordable and this is maybe the basic

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.350 
affordable and this is maybe the basic
thing<00:06:12.069> why<00:06:12.520> most<00:06:12.699> people<00:06:13.180> should<00:06:13.330> be

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
thing why most people should be

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.120 
thing why most people should be
interested<00:06:13.840> in<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:13.990> because<00:06:14.319> it<00:06:14.620> costs<00:06:15.009> around

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
interested in it because it costs around

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.100 
interested in it because it costs around
one<00:06:15.699> hundred<00:06:15.729> dollars<00:06:16.270> which<00:06:16.539> is<00:06:16.569> really

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
one hundred dollars which is really

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.379 
one hundred dollars which is really
cheap<00:06:17.440> for<00:06:17.860> a<00:06:17.889> good<00:06:18.219> full<00:06:18.430> of<00:06:18.550> focus<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:19.210> get

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
cheap for a good full of focus you get

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.909 
cheap for a good full of focus you get
many<00:06:19.659> photo<00:06:19.930> focuses<00:06:20.380> for<00:06:20.529> around<00:06:20.740> one

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
many photo focuses for around one

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.320 
many photo focuses for around one
hundred<00:06:20.949> dollars<00:06:21.430> but<00:06:21.669> there<00:06:21.909> are<00:06:22.029> not<00:06:22.150> as

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
hundred dollars but there are not as
