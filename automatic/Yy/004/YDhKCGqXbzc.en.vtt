00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.470
 hello everyone guys are all e 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:22.060
 welcome to this new extra part in 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.160
 This extra door will address a theme 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.439
 previously analyzed and we have you 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.570
 given of the fragments of the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.239
 addresses and finally now it 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.580
 we will reveal to is not one of there is one of the 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.710
 many secrets of this pokémon of 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.680
 this pokémon crystal west version 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.829
 we say that here it goes well if this 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.550
 and ross that is crystal silver red and 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.010
 blue are the pokémon games performed 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.710
 let's say the appropriate word glitch o 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.020
 bugs that are game errors 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.629
 thanks to which they are exploited precisely 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.050
 so without using tricks you can 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.519
 get the benefits we say 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.109
 we will analyze two that are precisely that 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.780
 of the cloning that what we will go 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.270
 to analyze today and the other than that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.640
 perhaps more characteristic than that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.470
 however an application of that of 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.690
 cloning however a bit particular that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.880
 not everyone knows what it is after 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.590
 a bit more advanced application than 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.380
 we will explain one cloning anyway 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 next part we do not anticipate anything 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.250
 so let's move on to real cloning e 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.929
 own thing to create a pokémon 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.450
 in pokémon crystal and eaten 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.800
 choose the pokémon to clone then 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.530
 put mini teams obviously not 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.810
 will have to be alone because yes 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.420
 he would only hear if not if you ca n't 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.250
 simply deposit it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.680
 then go to a pokémon center 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.390
 where there is a box then reds in the team 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.000
 the pokemon we are going to duplicate will be 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.280
 our mythical uselessness is never 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.530
 been so useful right now is 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 team we have taken and styles since 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.090
 nasse of think uselessness that the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.549
 pokemon for world profit will stand for 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.880
 have a useless twin brother 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.830
 but he's the nice thing is that when 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.869
 split a pokémon when you clone it 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.270
 the object that will be crowned will also be crowned 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.590
 you gave then as we did ad 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.110
 have so many but if you want 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.610
 we simply go on master ball from 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.489
 we give it to the forum that we want to crown 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.049
 in this case perfect uselessness vi 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.200
 we repeat the master mall was chosen 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.030
 as a sample but then the object more 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.190
 desirable for a game of pokémon though 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.730
 you can duplicate anything 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.510
 from the poké ball to the escape rope 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.220
 revitalizing especially the fact that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.930
 is not a dancing instrument of course 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.000
 because you can't have that is not really 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.310
 in fact reassign it anything to 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.290
 mark ok so go to the pc 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.530
 first of all save to be more 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.049
 safe so much so that it almost never fails 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.000
 this however, remember to 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.100
 save the various are the minimum of 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.660
 timing , however, now there 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.350
 we will also explain the time schedule 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.900
 access the box let's go on a pc of a bill yes 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.019
 let's change boxes immediately 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.850
 put an empty box so which case the 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.739
 our 3 ours but it's okay which ones 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.900
 caesano a warning 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.450
 the data is saved or asks if 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.070
 let's save and save in 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.010
 course turn it off perfect and we do 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.019
 to save 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.230
 it didn't save me the fantastic game 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.239
 now we do deposit must then vi 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.760
 you will notice every pokémon that it will deposit 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.010
 the will be located precisely in the box that it is 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.810
 been changed that now for us the box 3 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.510
 ok now but we challenge you well then 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.110
 we deposit uselessness which has therefore been 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.390
 registered 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.980
 no he didn't deposit me in the box 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.280
 perfect bottle 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.370
 now you see that it's ok so that's fine 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.140
 let's go over us always has pc 's and bill 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.680
 let's do it again box changes you see that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.299
 see in the box braids went useless 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.769
 let's go to another void for example 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.280
 let's go to 4 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.980
 we do ok change now get ready 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.109
 will tell you again when you change boxes and 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.980
 bla bla bla bla bla bla there game saved 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.079
 you want to save yes and then it will just come 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.760
 Saturday 5 I'm off press in this 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.720
 case we stopped the game thanks to 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.060
 file and do reset otherwise you can do 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.549
 precisely the combination of keys 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.810
 against the plus r to reset 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.829
 if you have a game boy simply 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.919
 turn off hint ok as you can see there 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.049
 we find ourselves in the team we have 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.580
 uselessness to 7 with the master flight 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.740
 assigned the important thing was 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.199
 exactly we teach to see in the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.430
 our pc and now if everything went well 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.430
 if everything went well 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.500
 he withdraws pokémon and we have his 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.120
 twin brother 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.009
 there is no trick there is no trick now 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.900
 you can see them both and insert that 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.870
 we have retired so let's take a look 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.569
 the different sonata ii pokémon that 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.819
 we put there are two elements well 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.190
 distinct have the same statistics 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.060
 obviously it's a clone a nice clone e 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.400
 good 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.229
 see they are these 1 has not changed 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.080
 nothing this is logical among remained 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.819
 useless are exact exact though not 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.389
 they follow a slightly different factor 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:08.860
 what we do take tools e 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:12.169
 we get a master one tool 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.650
 take and anger another from the underworld 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.210
 who was reported for this plagiarism 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.969
 to the multiplication of the fish loaves of 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.099
 jesus christ and had to pay one 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.280
 bail but now got anyway 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:28.879
 from the Christian church the pass 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.280
 in order to implement this practice of 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:34.090
 multiplication of the master balls e 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.530
 so now bullshit on bullshit 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.330
 exact so about it looks like of 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.460
 save your clones will be two with 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.410
 also the instrument remember then the 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.129
 timing when you need to change boxes e 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.319
 push had to 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.639
 that is, the timing is different from 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.919
 crystal silver and gold 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.989
 this thing they pointed out is true for both 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.419
 I'm crystal that for gold that loses 

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:56.679
 not exactly for the other versions 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.089
 attention exactly 

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.099
 yes ok, then you can do it too 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.869
 Emerald smussini are modes of much 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.429
 similar but they are different modalities indeed 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.330
 this is for now crystal people 

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.860
 similar but not equal 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.269
 remember for crystal you must have the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.039
 same timing as we did 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:12.279
 or is saved in progress not 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:15.399
 push wait just 30 thousandths 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.839
 second and turn it off turn on again or 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.610
 if you're on an emulator like I did 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:21.069
 see before you do file reset 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.419
 I recommend not for me it won't premise 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.279
 hicks at the top reopen why not 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.279
 it works you have to do 7 well what to say 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.529
 now find yourself with a master sea 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:32.050
 mole have fun launching from the pokémon 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:34.029
 more powerful than you ever are ever 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.249
 successful cutter to catch with go to 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:38.379
 rack land like ours maybe 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:40.419
 antei that gave us from 9 or 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:42.219
 you can pull them on the useless pokemon like 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.839
 it may be a little bit because it is not 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:45.009
 he knew a pinch or its uselessness 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.769
 exactly 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:49.360
 and remember another important thing vi 

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:51.399
 I was saying the silver timing 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.659
 and gold are different but this is an ex 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.849
 crystal play and therefore not there 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:56.499
 I say 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.629
 well simply because the balls 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.759
 you have to when it is being saved 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:04.749
 you don't have to take it when it appears 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:06.159
 the ice rescue in progress goes well not it 

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.990
 I know go and see you here 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.669
 go see a former play of golds 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.949
 silvers there is one that is there anyway 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.839
 a thousand tutorials explaining it perhaps in 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.189
 however, I do not have English in Italy 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.259
 just understand the timing 

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:18.999
 so that 's all for duplicating i 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.409
 pokémon I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:22.809
 already saved so there is need for the 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:23.860
 unless executed I liked leave a 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:26.079
 nice i like it 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.819
 subscribe to the channel and we hope that there 

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:30.009
 this glee cv has been useful if not 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.719
 you knew and the next part for 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.279
 the most complicated application of this 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:38.069
 deputy to do something really 

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:38.069
 pussy then the next part hello fi
