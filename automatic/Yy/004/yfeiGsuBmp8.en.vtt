this<00:01:08.940> commentary<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.570> compared<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.230> own

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this commentary there compared to my own

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
this commentary there compared to my own
unit<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.280> running<00:01:11.490> through<00:01:11.730> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
unit right now it's running through a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.400 
unit right now it's running through a
high-low<00:01:12.180> converter<00:01:12.570> into<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:13.050> aunt's<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
high-low converter into my aunt's the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.600 
high-low converter into my aunt's the
same<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:13.860> factory<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> did

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
same as my factory you know it did

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.220 
same as my factory you know it did
because<00:01:15.090> I've<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.660> much<00:01:15.810> unplugged

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
because I've just pretty much unplugged

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.570 
because I've just pretty much unplugged
my<00:01:16.380> factory<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.430> one

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
my factory in it and going this one

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.200 
my factory in it and going this one
straight<00:01:17.760> in<00:01:19.250> personally<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.850> sounds<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
straight in personally this one sounds a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810 
straight in personally this one sounds a
lot<00:01:21.330> clearer<00:01:21.660> than<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:22.340> doesn't<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.580> any<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
lot clearer than me doesn't have any of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
lot clearer than me doesn't have any of
that<00:01:23.880> background<00:01:24.240> fuzzing<00:01:24.900> back<00:01:25.050> noise<00:01:25.320> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that background fuzzing back noise like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
that background fuzzing back noise like
mine<00:01:25.800> original<00:01:26.010> didn't<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.580> originally

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
mine original didn't I originally

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.040 
mine original didn't I originally
thought<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.020> was

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
thought that was just because I was

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.440 
thought that was just because I was
running<00:01:28.260> through<00:01:28.410> high-low<00:01:28.800> converter<00:01:29.270> as<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
running through high-low converter as it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.470 
running through high-low converter as it
is<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.690> now<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.110> had<00:01:31.230> this<00:01:31.320> unit<00:01:31.590> my<00:01:31.710> car

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
is right now if I had this unit my car

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.590 
is right now if I had this unit my car
permanently<00:01:33.480> I<00:01:33.750> should<00:01:34.050> say<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:35.330> probably<00:01:36.330> find

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
permanently I should say I probably find

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
permanently I should say I probably find
no<00:01:36.780> real<00:01:37.020> advantage<00:01:37.260> to<00:01:37.740> running<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.370> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
no real advantage to running out and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
no real advantage to running out and
getting<00:01:38.610> RCA<00:01:39.090> straight<00:01:39.479> away<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.290> sounds

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
getting RCA straight away it just sounds

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.880 
getting RCA straight away it just sounds
that<00:01:40.680> clear<00:01:42.229> let's<00:01:43.229> explore<00:01:43.619> some<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that clear let's explore some of the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.050 
that clear let's explore some of the
features<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> unit<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.580> couldn't<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:44.910> last

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
features of the unit we couldn't do last

00:01:45.060 --> 00:02:00.780 
features of the unit we couldn't do last
time<00:01:46.970> TV<00:01:51.590> same<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> lot<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> fun

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.890

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.210 
research
reckon

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.590 

now<00:02:07.220> let's<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:07.880> if<00:02:07.940> we<00:02:08.030> can<00:02:08.180> change<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
now let's see if we can change the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.710 
now let's see if we can change the
channels<00:02:08.930> on<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.650> want<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.430> go<00:02:13.510> what<00:02:14.510> sure

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
channels on this I want to go what sure

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.790 
channels on this I want to go what sure
how<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.870> use<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.260> thing

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
sources everything the only thing which

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.629 
sources everything the only thing which
will<00:05:45.820> not<00:05:45.970> resume<00:05:46.330> is<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.810> ipod<00:05:47.169> itself<00:05:50.639> so

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639
