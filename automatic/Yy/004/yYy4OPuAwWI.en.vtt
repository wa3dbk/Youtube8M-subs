00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
here we go tip number one make sure all

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
here we go tip number one make sure all
your<00:00:33.600> bricks<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.170> interlocked<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.550> we

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
your bricks are interlocked well what we

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.880 
your bricks are interlocked well what we
mean<00:00:35.910> by<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.450> make<00:00:37.230> sure<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.620> bricks

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
mean by that is make sure the bricks

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040 
mean by that is make sure the bricks
overlap<00:00:38.550> each<00:00:38.789> other<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.239> wall<00:00:39.539> built<00:00:39.780> like
