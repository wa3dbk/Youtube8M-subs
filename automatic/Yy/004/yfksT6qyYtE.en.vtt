00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.340
 not of but it can also be a bit 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.600
 You have to be dangerous with you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 valuables with you 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320
 so I'm going to show you how today 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 which you can mask it best while 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
 going to the beach this is what i own 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.830
 Bring the beach to work 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.520
 a towel slippers something like toys 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.140
 sunscreen 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.680
 a magazine lipgloss and my tree 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.899
 big essentials namely my keys 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
 then my wallet the passes and my 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.379
 mobile as i should choose then be 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.760
 this actually my most valuable 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.239
 stuff 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 well tip 1 make it anyway 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.120
 most importantly look what you need 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 in this case you have to go to the beach 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.079
 Just take a note with my money 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 this is if it is less than that whole port 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.489
 memesa we continue if it succeeds 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.949
 just take your important keys off and on 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.770
 leave the rest at home ready this is already one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.990
 much less than that whole tree with 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.570
 stuff you first had this compact 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.540
 fits together and then we go this now 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 put things together somewhere 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.330
 see here an old deodorant bottle 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 graper 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.299
 still attracted to me why I get open 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.000
 inside you out there is such a stick 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.380
 handy to chill the pass in the inside 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 can still do a little cleaning 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.189
 rinse me a cloth and voila you have 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.869
 a secret sleeve for your keys and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.329
 for your money and possibly passes or 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.130
 another small important tip so you can 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.600
 also put in immobile but honestly x 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.119
 the whole time and play my mobile 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 so I'd rather have that loose than on 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.130
 who would think something worthy here 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.280
 us in nobody is in your bag 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.159
 ready but that mobile is of course also 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.899
 important and I'll keep it loose 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.000
 I also find annoying bowl as interesting 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
 so what my ultimate tip is you take one 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.010
 magazine hey look it's my clasie 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.900
 how and 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.270
 Take the magazine scrolls up to something from it 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.710
 the middle and just put your mobile in 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.570
 what magazine and newspaper is also one 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.470
 good because nobody picks up on it 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.140
 general 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.120
 magazines from others or newspapers or 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.160
 don't really book the plate 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.870
 is not fascinating visible we stood in 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.380
 and no one has been through a he can 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.330
 in your bag while you run very 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.630
 i really have garden and a tube of ideas 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
 but I also don't want thieves on ideas 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.770
 so you can also do other kind 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.930
 I have one last tip for buyers 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.000
 how you can do something very valuable 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.650
 and is a really pretty nasty place 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.720
 but I still want to show this 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.760
 is a new clean underpants that really 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 not yet tolerated then worry 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.440
 take underpants this dip saw on 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 internet and he is just genius 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.520
 then take the cross there you stop 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.200
 valuable item so for example you 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.810

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.450
 so diggle it around that path crosses 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.520
 really say very clearly 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.920
 on top then you make that 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.140
 cross ties with ketchup with chocolate 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.209
 pasta or something and believe me already know 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.110
 someone has a cell phone and no one dares 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.120
 to touch 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.670

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.090
