it's<00:01:14.820> unlikely<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.170> moving<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.710> space<00:01:16.979> is

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.809 
those troops now can't move this turn
and<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:26.260> my<00:02:26.500> only<00:02:26.620> useable<00:02:27.160> heroes<00:02:27.489> are

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
cover and failing the kill is going to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.990 
cover and failing the kill is going to
have<00:02:32.590> dire<00:02:32.980> consequences

reliable shot and not rolling Oakley

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.570 
reliable shot and not rolling Oakley
shot<00:02:49.870> means<00:02:50.410> now<00:02:50.739> she<00:02:50.799> can<00:02:51.160> be<00:02:51.250> used<00:02:51.400> for
