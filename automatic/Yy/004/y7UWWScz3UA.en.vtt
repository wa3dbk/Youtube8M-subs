nice in there fits in well and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.389 
nice in there fits in well and
installing<00:01:03.230> your<00:01:03.379> ipad<00:01:03.739> is<00:01:03.949> sort<00:01:04.339> of

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
installing your ipad is sort of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.969 
installing your ipad is sort of
difficult<00:01:04.639> with<00:01:05.029> this<00:01:05.179> case<00:01:05.420> this<00:01:05.779> is<00:01:05.959> a<00:01:05.990> hard

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
difficult with this case this is a hard

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.719 
difficult with this case this is a hard
TPU<00:01:07.310> case<00:01:08.319> so<00:01:09.319> installing<00:01:09.859> it<00:01:10.039> may<00:01:10.340> be<00:01:10.399> a

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
TPU case so installing it may be a

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.819 
TPU case so installing it may be a
little<00:01:10.909> difficult<00:01:11.179> but<00:01:11.569> basically<00:01:11.899> once<00:01:12.709> you

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
little difficult but basically once you

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.969 
little difficult but basically once you
have<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.100> bottom<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:13.490> your<00:01:13.520> ipad<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.979> slid

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
have the bottom of your ipad and slid

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.069 
have the bottom of your ipad and slid
into<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.249> case<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.209> have<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.420> work<00:01:17.569> with<00:01:17.599> the

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
into the case you have to work with the

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.339 
into the case you have to work with the
two<00:01:18.859> top<00:01:19.490> corners<00:01:20.029> and<00:01:20.420> make<00:01:20.599> sure<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.049> those

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:21.349 
two top corners and make sure that those

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:24.489 
two top corners and make sure that those
are<00:01:21.880> wrapped<00:01:22.880> around<00:01:23.090> as<00:01:23.420> well<00:01:23.599> it's

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
are wrapped around as well it's

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:27.660 
are wrapped around as well it's
definitely<00:01:24.799> hard<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.700> do<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.329> is<00:01:26.509> pretty

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
definitely hard to do this is pretty

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.989 
definitely hard to do this is pretty
thick<00:01:28.670> material<00:01:30.369> but<00:01:31.369> once<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:31.700> do<00:01:31.819> have<00:01:31.969> it

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
thick material but once you do have it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.120 
thick material but once you do have it
installed<00:01:32.389> it<00:01:32.659> looks<00:01:32.869> very<00:01:33.259> nice<00:01:33.469> you<00:01:33.859> can<00:01:34.009> see

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
installed it looks very nice you can see

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.609 
installed it looks very nice you can see
that<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:34.639> the<00:01:35.209> the<00:01:35.630> sides<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.109> case<00:01:36.289> sort

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
that it the the sides of the case sort

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.349 
that it the the sides of the case sort
of<00:01:36.709> covers<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.279> bezel<00:01:37.639> a<00:01:37.789> little<00:01:38.090> bit<00:01:38.179> maybe

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
of covers the bezel a little bit maybe

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.469 
of covers the bezel a little bit maybe
one<00:01:38.630> third<00:01:38.869> of<00:01:38.959> the<00:01:39.079> way<00:01:40.329> going<00:01:41.329> through<00:01:41.450> all

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
one third of the way going through all
