00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.200
 find you examples 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.440
 the best example to be swept the table 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.449
 that I can have a good contract from the old by creating advances 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.299
 but by because that's best ever I know in March there are 9 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.079
 says against 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.079
 after i know a lot less wait and even 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.310
 after the saint pieters welcome 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.810
 So 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 yes and that he does not like this kind of fun 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.730
 I always said that I touched the club after making a move 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.199
 so that sony came 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.170
 I am waiting for you there too 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.590
 three weeks, of course, everything else for the front page makes it 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.590
 is waiting for the club waiting for sure at ado the hague 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.940
 a 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.980
 well it is buying something again 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.830
 On the club itself man that someone who kim yoo commission canceled few things 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.490
 what you know to be 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.050
 yes that was not from the feet that I had 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.200
 and after a year at home catching up because he could still set a deadline for ourselves 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.440
 no then that marijke is walking 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.890
 be honest with the club and 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.330
 year because if she still comes then yes it's fun for me 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.860
 but in the end I prefer to do the euro today than tomorrow if possible 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.760
 because i think the club would like us to be there at the last 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.930
 day of August somewhere else 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.250
 Gasselte they offered the best contract that spectacle full 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.680
 trust down 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.510
 yes, of course, but it's not just about that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.810
 it was not too bad 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.320
 In other words, the year we were still staying with Mr. because those guys we tailor 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.660
 Those people can be that way 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.010
 that the group that put the club in addition they still wanted to go with those guys 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.110
 speaking in connection with a contract and 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.640
 that all things change 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.180
 which boys is that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.650
 we think about 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.590
 guys that you also know the important guys like a wise one 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.770
 hands 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.630
 I think that is normal compared to what was achieved last year 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.880
 have all together and that those guys still deserve for that sector like you 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.590
 that you certainly depend on other guys at the club 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.070
 yes it is always 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.690
 yes difficult to say such a thing of course if there is a nice club 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.870
 said you can make the move and how it was with the boys 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.580
 So 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.759
 that's just a wait and see but I am thinking about it 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.969
 if those guys were here for so long, chances are that I'll be open again 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.669
 writes definition is a nice club 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.179
 I already told you that is next year 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.559
 it is a top club in the Netherlands or abroad and now it has to be fair 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.069
 has not yet come 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.969
 And yes there stop waiting and a player with pleasure in even more 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.429
 well that the name speak contracts or the key of new contract 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.659
 yeah that's hard to say i don't know what that that the other guys do 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.499
 the way the group stays together and the committee one or two new ones 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:38.539
 players at 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.229
 well so interesting maybe normal to draw but even that far it is 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.799
 not yet to be, we must all do that
