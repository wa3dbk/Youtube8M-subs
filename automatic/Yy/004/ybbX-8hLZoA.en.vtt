00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.570
 lesson on the descent we are doing 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.220
 give a lift up from our pick up 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.579
 because today we're going to see how 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.640
 face a technical descent roots 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.370
 stones how to balance weights and how 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.019
 be safe without being afraid because 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.480
 we can do with our own 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.000
 all then strength and courage to matri 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.350
 we're going to have fun 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.460

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.490

 [Music] 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.630
 in the school 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.720
 the stand 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.710
 in January 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.410
 [Music] 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.410
 I hope 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.480
 never 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.480
 [Music] 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.640
 [Music] 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.750
 let's say in the woods how you can see 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.000
 beautiful squat muddy but we like it so much 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.819
 and we have this area of ​​cesi stica here 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.940
 there is not a line for faster strength and 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.849
 a slower one are two lines a choice 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.340
 It is to drive round to go high 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.989
 stay on the track and then go to 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.569
 still look for support from this one 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.989
 part still up and then close the 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.870
 curve 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.230
 the other one is narrower maybe it is 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.060
 more difficult comes straight on the stones and 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.799
 pass on this Saxon here to do 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.590
 this line we have to make the curve 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.019
 first we must anticipate the curve 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.739
 stay very tall and then cut tight 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.890
 and come down straight speed of 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.590
 approach a stone like this 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.690
 if you go too fast, jump off 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.340
 therefore the problem does not arise 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.590
 [Music] 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.110
 if instead you go too slow and risky 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.480
 to get stuck so you can get there 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.730
 even sass lenses is not a problem 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.310
 the important thing is that you leave the brakes 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.650
 or like a brake on this one 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.720
 case we arrive at the entrance with the weight 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.310
 balanced then balanced 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.290
 slightly back 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.410
 here we have a very slight elevation 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.630
 on the step then you copy with le 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.510
 arms for then when the slope 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.700
 then you move backwards then 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.520
 you go off the saddle as they say 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.000
 then move with the bust to the pelvis 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.930
 back and just the fact is balanced 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.990
 that the bike goes down the board of 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.390
 fonzie for the descent is to 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.440
 especially if you don't know the path 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.870
 so you're going a little blindly 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.030
 always to stay beautiful round in high 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.390
 high bank still look for the bank 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.520
 because this gives me the opportunity to 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.250
 see first what will happen then 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.230
 on the path because you are tall you can 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.330
 decide if you then go straight or 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.920
 going to look for another bank but one 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.050
 once you cut straight for straight is 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.150
 much harder to look for the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.070
 correct line in the case especially in 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.150
 where the path is not known 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.150
 [Music] 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.100
 tire pressure very much 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.859
 important is the contact we have 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.870
 on the ground therefore the rubber does not have to 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.759
 be too hard so we risk 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.009
 bounce or be too soft 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.110
 because it is comfortable but it happens that 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:33.130
 we can pierce so I keep one 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.550
 pressure from 1.516 to below two bars 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.889
 therefore 1.8 weight 68 kg then adjust 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.840
 good but don't ride a bike without having 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.840
 first check your pressure 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.699
