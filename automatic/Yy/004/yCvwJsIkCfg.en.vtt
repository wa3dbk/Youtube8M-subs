00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
then red boxes on resets on no recoil on

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.829 
then red boxes on resets on no recoil on
and<00:00:43.409> in<00:00:43.499> shams<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.190> shams<00:00:45.089> is<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.600> cool

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
and in shams now shams is pretty cool

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.590 
and in shams now shams is pretty cool
I'll<00:00:46.109> show<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.559> shams<00:00:46.859> is<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.640> champ

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that's not good enough you don't win

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.469 
that's not good enough you don't win
boxes<00:00:59.069> on<00:00:59.219> they're<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.489> exactly<00:00:59.850> red<00:01:00.089> boxes

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
boxes on they're not exactly red boxes

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.770 
boxes on they're not exactly red boxes
they're<00:01:00.659> more<00:01:00.839> like<00:01:00.989> orange<00:01:02.569> boxes<00:01:03.569> or

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.580 
they're more like orange boxes or
whatever<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.770> mean<00:01:05.160> every<00:01:05.460> course<00:01:05.790> till

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
whatever but I mean every course till

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.090 
whatever but I mean every course till
then<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.710> thought<00:01:08.270> reset<00:01:09.270> which<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:10.830> guys

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
then we thought reset which is you guys

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.460 
then we thought reset which is you guys
probably<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.790> obvious<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.690> I'm<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
probably know obvious that is I'm the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.620 
probably know obvious that is I'm the
one<00:01:13.620> interesting<00:01:14.040> sure<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.630> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
one interesting sure on that but you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
one interesting sure on that but you
should<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.140> are<00:01:16.200> these<00:01:16.350> days<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.830> they

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
should know what are these days if they

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.050 
should know what are these days if they
load<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> black<00:01:17.610> suit<00:01:18.290> now<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.370> no

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
load the black suit now and then no

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030 
load the black suit now and then no
recoil<00:01:21.480> on<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.500> turn<00:01:22.710> them<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:23.010> off

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
recoil on and you can turn them all off

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.570 
recoil on and you can turn them all off
after<00:01:23.850> no<00:01:24.180> recoil<00:01:24.630> will<00:01:24.810> work<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:24.990> well<00:01:25.580> like

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
after no recoil will work very well like

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.330 
after no recoil will work very well like
you<00:01:27.450> normally<00:01:27.750> would

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
you normally would

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
you normally would
FMJ<00:01:29.340> works<00:01:29.790> better<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.930> yeah<00:01:32.120> also<00:01:33.260> as<00:01:34.260> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
FMJ works better but yeah also as you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.440 
FMJ works better but yeah also as you
can<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.980> right<00:01:35.370> now<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.580> am<00:01:35.850> actually<00:01:36.030> host

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can see right now I am actually host

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.150 
can see right now I am actually host
like<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.870> game<00:01:37.080> like<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.650> should<00:01:37.920> maybe<00:01:38.040> not

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
like the game like I should maybe not

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.830 
like the game like I should maybe not
from<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.440> yeah<00:01:41.000> reason<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> host<00:01:42.570> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
from that but yeah reason on the host is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.750 
from that but yeah reason on the host is
looks<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.290> minister<00:01:43.860> online<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
looks like a minister online because I

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.800 
looks like a minister online because I
don't<00:01:44.940> have<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> 48-hour<00:01:45.660> trail<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:47.030> yeah<00:01:48.030> but

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
don't have a 48-hour trail so yeah but

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.470 
don't have a 48-hour trail so yeah but
it's<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.740> good<00:01:49.980> for<00:01:50.160> clearing<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.730> if<00:01:51.000> you

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
it's really good for clearing out if you

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.000 
it's really good for clearing out if you
know<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.660> want<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:51.990> play<00:01:52.230> with<00:01:52.440> Church<00:01:52.680> others

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
know and then also it's a method of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.130 
know and then also it's a method of
faking<00:01:59.700> clips<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.150> know<00:02:00.300> maybe<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.690> guys<00:02:00.870> don't

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
faking clips I know maybe you guys don't

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.750 
faking clips I know maybe you guys don't
want<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> fake<00:02:01.500> lips<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:02.130> whatever<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.670> if

want to fake lips or whatever but if
you've<00:02:02.940> got<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.150> JTAG<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.690> could<00:02:03.900> fake<00:02:04.140> lips

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you've got a JTAG you could fake lips

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
you've got a JTAG you could fake lips
this<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.940> because<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.900> go<00:02:07.050> online

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this way because you could go online

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.100 
this way because you could go online
with<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> clip<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.390> go<00:02:09.990> in

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
with it get a clip and then go in

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.580 
with it get a clip and then go in
theater<00:02:10.500> mode<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.009> turn<00:02:11.310> everything<00:02:11.640> off<00:02:11.940> in
