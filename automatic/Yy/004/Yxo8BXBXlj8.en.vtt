website<00:00:51.739> I've<00:00:52.739> used<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.280> little<00:00:53.430> heat<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
website I've used a little heat in the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.189 
website I've used a little heat in the
fork<00:00:55.230> itself<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.789> try<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.360> expand<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> fork

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
fork itself to try and expand the fork

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.900 
fork itself to try and expand the fork
which<00:00:58.559> makes<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.980> much<00:00:59.100> easier<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
which makes it much easier to get the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
which makes it much easier to get the
seal<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.890> including<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.160> dust<00:01:02.550> seal<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.589> if

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
seal out including the dust seal so if

at<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.869> instances<00:01:19.680> we've<00:01:19.890> shown<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> the

at the instances we've shown in the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
at the instances we've shown in the
video<00:01:20.549> I've<00:01:20.790> used<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> propane<00:01:21.509> torch<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> very

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
video I've used a propane torch and very

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
video I've used a propane torch and very
gently<00:01:22.650> heated<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> area<00:01:23.820> where<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> oil

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
gently heated the area where the oil

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
gently heated the area where the oil
seal<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.130> able<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> seal<00:01:26.970> out

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
seal is to be able to get the seal out

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.660 
seal is to be able to get the seal out
now<00:01:28.350> obviously<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> dust<00:01:29.250> seal<00:01:29.430> as

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
now obviously with the dust seal as

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
now obviously with the dust seal as
you've<00:01:29.850> tried<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> screwdriver<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.170> getting<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you've tried a screwdriver and getting a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.710 
you've tried a screwdriver and getting a
screwdriver<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> dust

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
screwdriver in there to get the dust

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.710 
screwdriver in there to get the dust
seal<00:01:33.930> down<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:35.250> dust<00:01:35.490> seal<00:01:35.670> may<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.479> now

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
seal down the dust seal may be a by now

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.710 
seal down the dust seal may be a by now
be<00:01:36.960> damaged<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.400> case<00:01:38.820> then

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
be damaged so if that's the case then

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.999 
be damaged so if that's the case then
you're<00:01:39.869> much<00:01:39.990> better<00:01:40.290> off<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:41.310> ahead<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
you're much better off going ahead and

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
you're much better off going ahead and
taking<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> forks<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:45.119> get<00:01:45.329> new<00:01:45.479> seals

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
taking the forks off just get new seals

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
taking the forks off just get new seals
in<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> unless<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.860> were<00:01:46.920> done<00:01:47.159> recently<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
in it unless they were done recently and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.600 
in it unless they were done recently and
get<00:01:48.479> new<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.899> seals<00:01:49.140> put<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.619> well<00:01:49.860> now

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
get new just seals put in as well now

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.340 
get new just seals put in as well now
whenever<00:01:50.820> new<00:01:51.060> dust<00:01:51.329> seals<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.079> there

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
whenever new dust seals get put in there

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.590 
whenever new dust seals get put in there
should<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> tiny<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.729> grease<00:01:53.939> all<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
should be a tiny bit of grease all the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.980 
should be a tiny bit of grease all the
way<00:01:54.750> around<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.470> step<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.549> dust<00:01:56.759> seal<00:01:57.000> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
way around the step in the dust seal so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
way around the step in the dust seal so
that<00:01:58.140> when<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.409> locates<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> fork<00:01:59.909> tube

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that when it locates into the fork tube

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.050 
that when it locates into the fork tube
itself<00:02:01.100> removal<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.189> easy<00:02:02.399> because<00:02:02.670> there's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
itself removal is easy because there's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.789 
itself removal is easy because there's
grease<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.630> rather<00:02:04.020> than<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.469> being<00:02:04.680> just

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
grease there rather than it being just

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.910 
grease there rather than it being just
straight<00:02:05.369> rubber<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.079> getting<00:02:07.079> basically

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
straight rubber and getting basically

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.370 
straight rubber and getting basically

as<00:02:11.380> there<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.800> step<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.160> there<00:02:12.490> if<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.820> find

as there is a step in there if you find

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690 
as there is a step in there if you find
you<00:02:13.660> can<00:02:13.900> create<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.230> small<00:02:14.560> gap<00:02:14.860> then<00:02:15.250> slowly

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you can create a small gap then slowly

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.350 
you can create a small gap then slowly
get<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> larger<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.780> larger<00:02:16.900> blade

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
get a larger and larger blade

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.510 
get a larger and larger blade

things<00:02:54.970> but<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.140> you've<00:02:56.350> been<00:02:56.380> hitting<00:02:56.920> it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
things but if you've been hitting it

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.040 
things but if you've been hitting it
with<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> screwdriver<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:58.150> doubt<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.720> gonna<00:02:58.900> be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
with a screwdriver I doubt it's gonna be

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.010 
with a screwdriver I doubt it's gonna be
in<00:02:59.260> very<00:02:59.560> good<00:02:59.740> condition<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:01.360> if<00:03:01.750> you're

in very good condition so if you're

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.320 
in very good condition so if you're
really<00:03:02.350> struggling<00:03:02.650> with<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.060> take<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.300> a

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
really struggling with it take it to a

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.390 
really struggling with it take it to a
suspension<00:03:04.750> professional<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.860> good<00:03:06.100> shot

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
suspension professional or a good shot

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.700 
suspension professional or a good shot
around<00:03:07.150> where<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.540> are<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.930> have<00:03:08.500> them
