new Jessica Simpson pumps with like a
really<00:01:34.530> huge<00:01:35.430> platform<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.390> they're<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
really huge platform but they're really

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
really huge platform but they're really
comfortable<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.710> recently<00:01:38.189> got<00:01:38.310> these<00:01:38.640> from

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
comfortable just recently got these from

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.660 
comfortable just recently got these from
bakers<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:40.229> were<00:01:40.290> about<00:01:40.590> seventy<00:01:41.159> dollars

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.160 

so<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.850> got<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> double<00:01:45.720> platform<00:01:45.990> here

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
so it's got like a double platform here

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.929 
so it's got like a double platform here
that's<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> side<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.640> then

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that's just the side of it and then

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
that's just the side of it and then
here's<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> heel<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:52.049> say<00:01:52.340> altogether

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
here's the heel I would say altogether

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.060 
here's the heel I would say altogether
it's<00:01:53.939> probably<00:01:54.210> about<00:01:54.329> five<00:01:54.720> inches<00:01:54.930> tall<00:01:55.350> but

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it's probably about five inches tall but

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's probably about five inches tall but
because<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.060> platform<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.810> makes<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
because of this platform it makes it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.230 
because of this platform it makes it
really<00:01:58.259> comfortable<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> walk<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
really comfortable to walk in so that is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
really comfortable to walk in so that is
