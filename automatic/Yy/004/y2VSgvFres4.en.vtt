things out at the moment because as you

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.619 
things out at the moment because as you
know<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.639> cuz<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.909> maps<00:03:47.120> don't<00:03:47.329> have

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
know that cuz the maps don't have

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.899 
know that cuz the maps don't have
questions<00:03:48.290> in<00:03:48.409> them<00:03:48.620> I'm<00:03:49.489> gonna<00:03:49.669> try<00:03:49.909> and<00:03:51.909> get

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
questions in them I'm gonna try and get

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.330 
questions in them I'm gonna try and get
pedestrians<00:03:53.569> in<00:03:53.689> the<00:03:53.959> mat<00:03:54.109> somehow<00:03:54.590> even<00:03:55.219> if

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
pedestrians in the mat somehow even if

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.979 
pedestrians in the mat somehow even if
that<00:03:55.489> means<00:03:55.609> just<00:03:55.879> using<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.209> mod<00:03:56.419> instead<00:03:56.870> of

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
that means just using a mod instead of

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.050 
that means just using a mod instead of
getting<00:03:57.290> them<00:03:57.439> in<00:03:57.560> naturally<00:03:58.099> I<00:03:58.370> would<00:03:58.819> do

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
getting them in naturally I would do

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.580 
getting them in naturally I would do
that<00:03:59.239> so<00:03:59.629> I<00:03:59.659> see<00:03:59.840> this<00:03:59.900> video<00:04:00.169> guys<00:04:00.260> thanks<00:04:00.560> for
