of<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.700> most<00:00:08.910> important<00:00:09.389> things<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.780> think

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
of the most important things I think

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.780 
of the most important things I think
about<00:00:10.050> 3d<00:00:10.469> digitization<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.400> museum

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
about 3d digitization in a museum

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.730 
about 3d digitization in a museum
context<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.719> its<00:00:12.960> ability<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.380> make<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
context is its ability to make the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.550 
context is its ability to make the
museum's<00:00:14.190> walls<00:00:14.429> invisible<00:00:15.269> nowadays<00:00:16.139> he<00:00:16.470> has

museum's walls invisible nowadays he has

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.029 
museum's walls invisible nowadays he has
a<00:00:16.590> new<00:00:16.830> thing<00:00:17.070> 3d<00:00:17.940> scanning<00:00:18.529> today<00:00:19.529> he<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.010> his

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
a new thing 3d scanning today he and his

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.090 
a new thing 3d scanning today he and his
team<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.430> scanning<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> bones<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> t-rex

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
team are scanning the bones of a t-rex

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.279 
team are scanning the bones of a t-rex
so<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.430> we're<00:00:23.550> looking<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.180> part<00:00:25.140> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
so what we're looking at here is part of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.890 
so what we're looking at here is part of
a<00:00:25.350> t-rex<00:00:25.680> fossil<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> part<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> skull

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
a t-rex fossil at the part of the skull

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.570 
a t-rex fossil at the part of the skull
actually<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.769> we're<00:00:29.099> looking<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.519> from

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
actually it's we're looking at it from

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.099 
actually it's we're looking at it from
the<00:00:29.730> inside<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the inside and you can see some of the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.900 
the inside and you can see some of the
teeth<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.500> are<00:00:31.619> still<00:00:32.130> remain<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> skull

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
teeth that are still remain in the skull

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.479 
teeth that are still remain in the skull
and<00:00:33.290> what<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> 3d<00:00:35.219> scanner

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and what I have here is a 3d scanner

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.940 
and what I have here is a 3d scanner
this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> handheld<00:00:36.719> unit<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.230> captures

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
this is a handheld unit it captures

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.979 
this is a handheld unit it captures
geometry<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.760> color<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> same<00:00:39.390> time<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
geometry and color at the same time and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.869 
geometry and color at the same time and
so<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.739> happens<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.670> takes

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so what happens is this actually takes

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.330 
so what happens is this actually takes
about<00:00:42.210> ten<00:00:42.690> frames<00:00:43.110> per<00:00:43.350> second<00:00:43.710> ten<00:00:43.920> 3d

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
about ten frames per second ten 3d

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.150 
about ten frames per second ten 3d
images<00:00:44.820> per<00:00:45.059> second<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.260> paint<00:00:46.500> this

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
images per second and I just paint this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
images per second and I just paint this
the<00:00:47.670> surface<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> object<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.750> few<00:00:49.140> inches

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the surface of the object a few inches

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.430 
the surface of the object a few inches
away<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.300> automatically<00:00:51.870> stitch

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
away and it will automatically stitch

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.520 
away and it will automatically stitch
together<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.699> images<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.360> make<00:00:55.320> one

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
together all the images and make one

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.340 
together all the images and make one
comprehensive<00:00:56.100> 3d<00:00:56.489> model<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.449> once<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.199> have

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
comprehensive 3d model so once we have

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
comprehensive 3d model so once we have
that<00:00:58.379> 3d<00:00:58.800> model<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.370> disseminate<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.090> for

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that 3d model we can disseminate it for

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.170 
that 3d model we can disseminate it for
research<00:01:00.739> we<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> available<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.760> 3d

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
research we can make it available for 3d

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.700 
research we can make it available for 3d
print<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> things<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
print and that's one of the things that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.469 
print and that's one of the things that
we're<00:01:04.949> most<00:01:05.280> excited<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> t-rex

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
we're most excited about with the t-rex

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
we're most excited about with the t-rex
is<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.869> we'll<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.110> making<00:01:07.350> everything

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
is that we'll be making everything

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
is that we'll be making everything

hold those whale bones in your hands
through<00:02:14.569> 3d<00:02:14.780> printing<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.349> that's<00:02:15.500> not

through 3d printing and that's not
