00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.050
 Life is meanwhile 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.590
 become so complicated 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.439
 at the same time she is supposed to be able to hear quite nice on her own sometimes 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:09.869
 but luckily 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.139
 There are a lot of possibilities here how to rely on more 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.249
 with Gyro Gearloose as a lord 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.079
 for mothers, there are colonels in working life 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.079
 and she always Gabrielle has Andrea Nahles no 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.150
 and the example shows that it is not always easy to help and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.000
 This is especially evident in the many election helpers 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 election officials 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.370
 who have to get back to NRW state elections in May this year 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.920
 and we're allowed to just take a look 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.060
 in a classroom resident fieldbus velvet back 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.300
 in Meerbusch near Dusseldorf 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.880
 untern 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.510
 that did not go to me as a polling station for the electoral district next to Streif and we are 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.510
 now curious whether it is the declining turnout 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.430
 in this constituency 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.210
 it's ten minutes 4 6 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.740
 lsw resorts ago 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 I have canceled 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.799
 somebody should come slowly 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.389
 probably not very nice weather 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.709
 but it has rained all day so that's why 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.429
 not the rain 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.429
 but only three hours have stopped raining 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.679
 in North Rhine-Westphalia probably chosen as crazy 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:55.169
 and we are her 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.139
 only 11 percent that the carnival session looks like 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.909
 we'll get together and 2 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.279
 so I had to do something nice I do not want anymore 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.659
 I do not want to be fooled 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.149
 I will not 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.149
 he said I was alone now 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.989
 the guests from no sow "not a single voice" 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.839
 I think we want to get 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.449
 and women without work that were then in the middle of winter comes to mind 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.709
 to 7 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.809
 I'm not naively happy 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.119
 Linde got it 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:31.590
 he acknowledges seeing 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.399
 the artist has been awarded 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.749
 Brigitte Andrae's criticisms 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.749
 I am not a parent's day today 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:48.989
 good wife 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.989
 today has warned 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.539
 little 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.170
 Klopp still has 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.059
 after 8 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.059
 I think I do not know how he got a rebound 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:04.959
 yes 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.919
 they are politics disaffection I do not mean it would be okay but not 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.709
 to know more that you choose me 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.229
 let's see 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.190
 was written 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.100
 I feel like the ballot 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.870
 You can not do that, I can do that very well 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.850
 for this stupid goat would have 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.600
 that I'm gone for them and that's exactly what I've done 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.689
 after all, we were easy 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.379
 After all, they could have Innsbruck and if the winning picture 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.169
 May SPD closes so sees the everyday life more still open he became 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.270
 their union is elected politics and when was that 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.680
 because they are good as well as with the SPD 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.120
 a video with 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.099
 the TIG too 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.099
 at the fdp-plan brings important 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:04.039
 how about the Green Dr 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.650
 sure the quality of a car with the CDU 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.229
 that is so the Denic EG net and the and also does not give me enough 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.490
 am there the demolished says Bahr 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.599
 Dr 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.710
 but there is also some party you can choose 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.539
 but which 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.129
 one of you has made the Wahlomat 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.370
 tight and 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.419
 he says 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.889
 the only thing I do after Belek is suicide 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.990
 more 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.969
 we have two minutes left 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.099
 the escape 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:49.150
 and what do you want 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
 I do not say because secret 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.600
 Mark Williams and Toyota 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.110
 why not with total responsibility 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.110
 perhaps 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.990
 Johannsen 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.990
 who picks pumped 5 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.490

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.699
 news 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.110
 Good evening ladies and gentlemen at the first extrapolation to the state election 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.340
 stands out a picture sat for all parties have 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.560
 voter turnout throughout North Rhine-Westphalia remained at 0 2 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.199
 percent 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.969
 as I just commanded but elected in the electoral district Meerbusch 3 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.830
 Thus, the distribution of seats looks like the new Dusseldorf state parliament 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.349
 the 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.829
 the violet in the test 47 percent 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.909
 the gray panthers 28 percent 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.169
 the animal welfare party 25 percent 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.080
 SPD one vote other 0 percent 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:03.589
 Please contact Carla Kriwet in Düsseldorf 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:06.309
 Gutjahr 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:09.989
 I stand here in the party headquarters he explained 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.369
 first the future Prime Minister Dr 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.939
 on site the work was on site 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:29.979
 their success that's not surprising to me at all i have 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:31.669
 just a better karma 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.479
 as Jürgen Rüttgers 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.460
 and what will they fear in the new state parliament? 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.979
 next to 1 4 TSI and outsiders 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.840
 Introduce Hans Niessl in the plenary sessions on menopause 

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:47.219
 We will also start negotiating with the Animal Protection Party, I think 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:50.020
 given the recent good fourth quarter 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.520
 on the opposite side 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.099
 Thank you
