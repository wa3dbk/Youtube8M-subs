00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
low angle situations now I'm going to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
low angle situations now I'm going to
talk<00:00:43.289> to<00:00:43.350> Ken<00:00:43.679> about<00:00:43.949> having<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.699> into

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
angle view finder it's going to give you

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.959 
angle view finder it's going to give you
a<00:00:52.079> great<00:00:52.440> angle<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.429> you<00:00:53.550> need<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.789> some

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
a great angle but what you need is some

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
a great angle but what you need is some
stabilization<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.679> that<00:00:55.859> shot

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
stabilization to really get that shot

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.829 
stabilization to really get that shot
that's<00:00:56.460> still<00:00:56.820> shot<00:00:57.089> that<00:00:57.269> you<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.570> that's

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
that's still shot that you need that's

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.279 
that's still shot that you need that's

the center post put the fall head right
down<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> base<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:41.220> its

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
down on the base and because of its

a huge camera and now you can get two

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
a huge camera and now you can get two
