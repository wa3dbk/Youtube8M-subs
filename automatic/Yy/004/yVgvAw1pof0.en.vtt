00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.509
 and then the themes in the member states are nico woonink 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.710
 the first attack of the almelose team 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.019
 no school and the routine person during injury time 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.039
 suffer from his Achilles tendon 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.039
 he just continued to play the new one here 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.589
 this gives the routinely experienced team the lead 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.060
 goalscorer johannis shot 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.839
 take a collision 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.339
 very nervous 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.770
 playing from the sea in the initial phase 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.840
 that turned out to be absolutely nervous 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.950
 is suffering 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.950
 nice distance shot by messi 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.020
 has two squatters difficult in the initial phase 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.950
 grab too few rebounds 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.550
 if your opponent is on good shot 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.230
 then you get it hard 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.520
 very calm in attacking 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.970
 wash it you the rest 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.200
 if remon had the freezer demonstrated 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200
 3 0 for the team from dordrecht 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 both theobroma set the case 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.650
 and therefore Taliban did not properly take care of carnival again 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 be taken over as 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.030
 we now look at the list 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.590
 take the rebound well 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 I just have the chance to attack again 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.720
 the movement with the team from dordrecht 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.870
 the four against 0 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 goal from wouter van den boogert 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160
 We are about to get Aachen sea back 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 in the meantime 5 0 in favor of the rules 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.320
 therefore no school 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.920
 who remotely controlled the ball holding the team from Almelo 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 integrity 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.900
 then they can not enjoy for a long time one against 6 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 remon de vries 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.020
 but then contacts are better in the game, it can offer more resistance 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.539
 we are not all shots that did cause 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.539
 the benefit is fine and then the acquisition 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.389
 samantha jonkman from distance 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.099
 zwevegem 6 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.099
 health care expenses certainly closer 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.249
 grab the rebound position 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.249
 no clean 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.819
 the dot can be played perfectly 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.059
 Grab the falling ball 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.129
 and then a storm 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.599
 they shot three many 6 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.489
 good work in the attack again 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.489
 of the greece perpetrators 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.119
 he will be nice 4 against 6 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.919
 manon thomas kraft 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.919
 they want difference lies being second game 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:03.389
 also look better becomes nervous before getting closer from the seat 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.389
 the team did not perform a miracle before 4 7 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:13.089
 meanwhile arrived at the stand 5 8 at a disadvantage the black sea the free ball 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.109
 kick from far 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.169
 6 7 8 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.169
 she remains a reasonable hacker week 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.859
 but look at coming one goal difference would not have come in the rebound 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:30.809
 good 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.249
 that the ball unhappily bounces off through the basket 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.249
 can only take over again 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.019
 position the pole position properly 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.609
 provide a rebound 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.069
 also real fall 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.379
 clothing is already being made 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.529
 between the stations 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.679
 awarded by referee Berkelland 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.529
 the silent 3 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:56.999
 six to 9 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:58.569
 remon de vries again 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.169
 excellent on track this afternoon 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.819
 I think this is the reason that has always been well tried 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 six to 10 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.659
 that is possible that she was allowed in the final phase 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.169
 the stand 9 13 has since become the painters of four goals 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.759
 we are still not really comfortable in the game 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.939
 This is a nice distance hit 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:32.529
 the difference is again 50 meters against 14 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.680
 goal managed to calm down 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.490
 what could be better than the ball 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.520
 terneuzen player 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.080
 who many 16 consciously in this contest donor 7 4 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.110
 start of the second half 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.020
 samantha jonkman with the movement 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.300
 because of this 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.129
 Thu Fri 17 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.990
 samantha jonkman beautiful movements 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.319
 Pork doesn't let you get different how close it is 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.319
 girls who score six to seven goals 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 just better on all fronts 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.569
 she lives and junk 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.279
 the attempts 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.279
 and of course the rebound depots 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.520
 take your time off 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.379
 lead could not be in danger anymore 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.349
 beautiful movement support of action 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.559
 brussels lose anchor c 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.860
 hopeless mission 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.050
 I think anp 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.470
 that did play a very good match that they didn't play any 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.419
 week this level reach the hands especially I think we did have golden 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.210
 brash competitions will come 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.569
 but we give ground too little pressure and the station street you interrogate is a girl 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.099
 but well we can be of more encouragement to the deceased
