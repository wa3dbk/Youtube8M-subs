00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.710
 this video deals with the majors 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.020
 mayo she essentially pursues two 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 goals for a generation unfortunately have 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.930
 germ cells and the other one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.779
 recombination of the dna thereby ensures the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.060
 meiosis in a natural way for one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.689
 certain degree of genetic variability 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.600
 and makes sure that I am individual 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.670
 to distinguish more strongly the process of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.510
 Meiosis can be divided into two parts 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 subdivide 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 mose 1 meier josi 2 the first section 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.050
 is also called the reduction division 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.270
 second day of action at the beginning so too 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.820
 Beginning of the reduction division lie in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.039
 All cells have homologous chromosomes 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.199
 diplomat before so each cell contains 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:02.160
 Regarding each chromosome two 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.739
 versions namely Croatia 22 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.659
 versions 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.900
 you could say now again is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.330
 for the maternal side and green for 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.820
 the paternal during the reduction 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 division is now the homologues 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.340
 chromosomes on individual cells 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.430
 divided so that only one each 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.390
 simple set of two chromosomes per 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.930
 cell is the second major division 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.340
 the ecra zions division now has its goal 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.890
 similar to the mitose pablo ide 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.780
 construct chromosomal sentences so 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.790
 that in total from a diploma 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.390
 output cells 4k fluid no cells 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.119
 arise 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.369
 as on the day the meiosis is 2 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.090
 on the procedure here and on the individual 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.580
 steps 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.800
 it also contains the prof 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.440
 the phase of a phase tello phase very much 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.980
 similar to mitosis the only one 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.750
 difference is just here the four 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.760
 Therefore, packages are at the end before lying 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.120
 I'm not on the deposit now 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.610
 more exactly for this you are welcome 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.750
 the video to the mitosis and the nerd 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.630
 look at the factory but the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.290
 actual features and the goal 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.400
 the dena recombination will only be in the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.290
 mensa 1 realized therefore we look 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.000
 now the reduction division more exactly 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.010
 on 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.470
 The reduction division can also be 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.040
 in the flood 1 meter phase one anna 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.780
 phase 1 of phase 1 divide very much 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.300
 interesting are the first two 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.430
 So phases per phase 1 with Apfalter 1 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.970
 here is an accumulation of 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.570
 homologous chromosome on the equatorial 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.420
 level 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.250
 here we have the equatorial level as 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.370
 dotted line shown 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.540
 here is the other pool here 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 now the homologous chromosome 1 of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.250
 the mother in our father along here 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.269
 lined up 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.790
 what follows is a trade education 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.650
 symbolizing this here 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.370
 different sections on the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.820
 chromosomes with the respective not 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.220
 sister chromatin glue on 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.769
 so to speak here and here 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.660
 that can happen but not it 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.750
 can only happen up or down 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.730
 It can also be repeated several times on a chromatik 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.790
 happen 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.930
 these are completely random events in 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.530
 This condition is what you call something now 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.930
 Subsequently, the fact occurs is a 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.070
 Croatia called piece exchange 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.250
 crossing over 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.560
 this will now be from this 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.370
 clarification and link point the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.100
 exchanged chromatin pieces so that re 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.090
 combined promotions or chromatin 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.120
 arise 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.390
 This happens all during the late 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.770
 per phase 1 or early beta phase 1 the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.079
 will be in different textbooks 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.730
 handled differently and around here 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.920
 I do not have to lose it 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.740
 summarized 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.080
 another important point, too 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.210
 on the variability of the genetic 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.340
 information is that is this 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.040
 attachment along the equatorial plane 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.110
 So here is the heart of the cell here 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.550
 polish impro equatorial do not live by 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.980
 out of it comes the giddy apparatus and 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.050
 from there this accumulation is 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.160
 completely arbitrary one could also do that 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.300
 song at the chromosomes could also be here 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.080
 stand the green here 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.540
 this randomness of the arrangement 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.610
 implies another point of 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.120
 genetic variability 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.760
 So these are the two elements 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.540
 the late pro phase 1 or early beta 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.570
 phase 1 the goal at the beginning 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.160
 mentioned goal of dna recombination 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.030
 realize 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.490
 maybe that would be important 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.580
 during the phase 1 of the tenant 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.240
 phase 1 following this step now 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.150
 not like the mitosis a chromatic 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.680
 chromosomes are pulled to the poles 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.380
 but logically whole chromosomes 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.330
 namely the homologues and only then 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.790
 during the action division of the muse 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.630
 two will be the chromosomes 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.620
 as with the 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.620
 to the reason
