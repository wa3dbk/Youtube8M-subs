of nice as you see that right there did

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.630 
of nice as you see that right there did
you<00:02:39.910> see<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.240> maybe<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.170> didn't<00:02:41.470> see<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
you see that maybe you didn't see that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.800 
you see that maybe you didn't see that
but<00:02:42.640> his<00:02:42.790> man<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.270> all<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.480> way<00:02:43.570> on<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> other

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
but his man is all the way on the other

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.530 
but his man is all the way on the other
side<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> formation<00:02:44.520> okay<00:02:45.520> so<00:02:45.580> basically

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
side of the formation okay so basically

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.860 
side of the formation okay so basically
you<00:02:46.960> could<00:02:47.080> put<00:02:47.260> him<00:02:47.380> on<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> zig<00:02:47.800> route<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:49.240> if

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
you could put him on a zig route and if

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.450 
you could put him on a zig route and if
they're<00:02:50.050> in<00:02:50.170> man<00:02:50.380> coverage<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.190> he's<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.430> a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
they're in man coverage and he's on a

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.640 
they're in man coverage and he's on a
zig<00:02:51.870> instead<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.990> drag<00:02:53.230> he's<00:02:53.410> still<00:02:53.560> going

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
zig instead of a drag he's still going

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.440 
zig instead of a drag he's still going
to<00:02:53.710> beat<00:02:53.860> zone<00:02:54.100> tolerance<00:02:54.910> for<00:02:55.000> my<00:02:55.060> controller

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
to beat zone tolerance for my controller

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.570 
to beat zone tolerance for my controller
effing<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:55.960> kind<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.860> like<00:02:56.950> my<00:02:57.100> mouth<00:02:57.310> feels

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
effing up kind of like my mouth feels

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.420 
effing up kind of like my mouth feels
right<00:02:57.850> now<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.900> if<00:02:59.110> he's<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.680> cig<00:03:00.100> he<00:03:00.220> still

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
right now but if he's in a cig he still

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.740 
right now but if he's in a cig he still
will<00:03:00.520> be<00:03:00.610> zone<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.000> same<00:03:01.150> way<00:03:01.330> but<00:03:01.390> he<00:03:01.540> sees

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
will be zone the same way but he sees

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.130 
will be zone the same way but he sees
even<00:03:02.080> more<00:03:02.260> effective<00:03:02.440> against<00:03:02.800> ma'am<00:03:04.140> all

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
even more effective against ma'am all

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.420 
even more effective against ma'am all
right<00:03:05.320> oh<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.440> that's<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.860> play<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:10.300> then

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
right oh so that's that play and then

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.720 
right oh so that's that play and then
also<00:03:12.430> that's<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.720> first<00:03:13.960> read<00:03:14.730> on

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
also that's this is the first read on

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.210 
also that's this is the first read on
the<00:03:16.120> route<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.540> woods<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:17.560> very<00:03:17.860> effective

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
the route to woods is very effective

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.750 
the route to woods is very effective
against<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.270> max<00:03:20.050> pressure<00:03:20.440> defense<00:03:21.010> like

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
against a max pressure defense like

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.120 
against a max pressure defense like
something<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.300> where<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.770> deep<00:03:23.950> ball

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
something like this where the deep ball

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.150 
something like this where the deep ball
will<00:03:24.460> kill<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.000> or<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.750> top<00:03:25.990> I<00:03:26.290> don't<00:03:27.070> know

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
will kill it or the top I don't know

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.530 
will kill it or the top I don't know
what<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.520> is<00:03:27.670> with<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.940> Raiders<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.450> they

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
what it is with the Raiders but they

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.380 
what it is with the Raiders but they
just<00:03:28.690> get<00:03:28.930> deep<00:03:29.140> some<00:03:29.470> reason<00:03:29.800> but<00:03:30.010> most<00:03:30.730> I'm

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
just get deep some reason but most I'm

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.360 
just get deep some reason but most I'm
telling<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.900> game<00:03:32.110> you'll<00:03:32.320> be<00:03:32.410> fine<00:03:32.620> if

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
telling you in game you'll be fine if

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.570 
telling you in game you'll be fine if
their<00:03:33.580> cover<00:03:33.820> zero<00:03:34.150> blissing<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:36.400> this

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
their cover zero blissing you on this

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.930 
their cover zero blissing you on this
play<00:03:36.760> becomes<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.090> really<00:03:37.300> good<00:03:37.420> option<00:03:38.940> so

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
play becomes a really good option so

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.200 
play becomes a really good option so
here<00:03:40.090> we<00:03:40.120> look<00:03:40.270> at<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.780> then<00:03:40.900> Johnson's<00:03:41.620> route

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
here we look at and then Johnson's route

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.380 
here we look at and then Johnson's route
it's<00:03:43.210> a<00:03:43.390> it's<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.990> user<00:03:44.200> catch<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.150> or

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
it's a it's a user catch like that or

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.160 
it's a it's a user catch like that or
the<00:03:46.480> top<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.930> don't<00:03:47.230> recommend<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.740> against<00:03:47.980> man

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
the top I don't recommend it against man

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.640 
the top I don't recommend it against man

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
and then lastly we have the corner route

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.120 
and then lastly we have the corner route
to<00:03:53.650> Goodwin<00:03:54.990> pass<00:03:55.990> lead<00:03:56.230> down<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.770> outside

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
to Goodwin pass lead down to the outside

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.590 
to Goodwin pass lead down to the outside
going<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.460> beat<00:03:57.550> man<00:03:57.670> coverage<00:03:57.700> we<00:03:58.240> meet<00:03:58.420> men

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
going to beat man coverage we meet men

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.310 
going to beat man coverage we meet men
all<00:03:58.750> year<00:03:58.960> so<00:03:59.530> that's<00:03:59.710> the<00:04:00.030> HB<00:04:01.030> option<00:04:01.390> get<00:04:02.230> the

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
I've ran into that a couple times before

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.230 
I've ran into that a couple times before
this<00:06:28.669> so<00:06:29.060> if<00:06:29.379> if<00:06:30.379> that<00:06:30.680> happens<00:06:31.129> then<00:06:31.909> i<00:06:32.060> would

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
this so if if that happens then i would

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.149 
this so if if that happens then i would
say<00:06:32.389> snap<00:06:32.810> before<00:06:32.990> he<00:06:33.229> sets<00:06:33.500> so<00:06:33.889> something

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
say snap before he sets so something

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.499 
say snap before he sets so something
