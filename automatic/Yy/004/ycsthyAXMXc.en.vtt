00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.930 
the location for the way you punch the
hole<00:00:37.989> initially<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:45.100> we'll<00:00:45.280> do<00:00:45.429> is<00:00:45.640> we'll

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
hole initially what we'll do is we'll

pull it back we can look in before we

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.470 
pull it back we can look in before we
initially<00:00:50.739> make<00:00:50.920> our<00:00:51.070> first<00:00:51.280> cut<00:00:51.429> we'll<00:00:52.239> look

initially make our first cut we'll look

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.360 
initially make our first cut we'll look
in<00:00:52.749> and<00:00:53.079> we'll<00:00:53.199> place<00:00:53.440> our<00:00:53.649> finger<00:00:54.129> where<00:00:54.339> the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
in and we'll place our finger where the

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.489 
in and we'll place our finger where the
factory<00:00:54.910> bolt<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:55.359> and<00:00:55.960> what<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.199> can<00:00:56.320> do<00:00:56.440> is

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
factory bolt is and what you can do is

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:57.599 
factory bolt is and what you can do is
you<00:00:56.589> can<00:00:56.710> come<00:00:56.829> out<00:00:56.949> here<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.280> course<00:00:57.429> we've

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
you can come out here of course we've

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:58.709 
you can come out here of course we've
already<00:00:57.699> cut<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:57.999> little<00:00:58.120> bit<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.300> hole<00:00:58.480> here

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
already cut a little bit of hole here

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.180 
already cut a little bit of hole here
but<00:00:58.749> just<00:00:58.989> pretend<00:00:59.320> it's<00:00:59.499> not<00:00:59.559> there<00:00:59.679> for<00:00:59.920> now

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
but just pretend it's not there for now

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.770 
but just pretend it's not there for now
so<00:01:00.760> what<00:01:00.909> you'll<00:01:01.089> do<00:01:01.210> is<00:01:01.239> if<00:01:01.449> you'll<00:01:01.570> have<00:01:01.690> your

so what you'll do is if you'll have your

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.209 
so what you'll do is if you'll have your
finger<00:01:02.079> on<00:01:02.109> the<00:01:02.289> inside<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.800> you'll<00:01:02.890> put<00:01:03.070> this

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
finger on the inside and you'll put this

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.430 
finger on the inside and you'll put this
finger<00:01:03.579> on<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.909> outside<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.960> then<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.290> can

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
finger on the outside and then you can

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.500 
finger on the outside and then you can
go<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.710> here<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:05.980> you<00:01:06.040> can<00:01:06.159> look<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.700> as<00:01:07.390> you

look down there you can see that your

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.560 
look down there you can see that your
finger<00:01:09.070> on<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.280> outside<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.909> lined<00:01:10.149> up<00:01:10.360> and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
then you can come up here a lot of times

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.850 
then you can come up here a lot of times

you're able to just look and see where

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.319 
you're able to just look and see where
the<00:01:14.920> bolt<00:01:15.130> is<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.579> when<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.759> look<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.180> see

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
the bolt is and when you look and see

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:17.370 
the bolt is and when you look and see
where<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.509> bolt<00:01:16.689> is<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:16.960> just<00:01:17.110> put<00:01:17.259> your

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
where the bolt is you just put your

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.440 
where the bolt is you just put your
finger<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:17.890> lining<00:01:18.430> it<00:01:18.490> up<00:01:18.610> vertically<00:01:19.030> and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
finger and lining it up vertically and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.240 
finger and lining it up vertically and
then<00:01:19.659> come<00:01:19.869> over<00:01:19.899> here<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.470> move<00:01:20.890> something

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
then come over here and move something

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.560 
then come over here and move something
around<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:22.060> can<00:01:22.240> see<00:01:22.450> it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
around so that you can see it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.050 
around so that you can see it
horizontally<00:01:23.229> as<00:01:23.350> well<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:24.640> once<00:01:24.850> you've

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
horizontally as well then once you've

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.149 
horizontally as well then once you've
located<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.810> doesn't<00:01:26.170> have<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.500> be<00:01:26.619> perfect

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
located it doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.130 
located it doesn't have to be perfect
and<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.460> reason<00:01:27.880> for<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.329> is<00:01:28.570> what<00:01:29.020> we're

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
and the reason for that is is what we're

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.889 
and the reason for that is is what we're
going<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.290> do<00:01:29.469> is<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:30.219> take<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.460> die<00:01:30.729> grinder

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
going to do is we take a die grinder

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.109 
going to do is we take a die grinder
with<00:01:31.899> a<00:01:31.930> rotary<00:01:32.170> file<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.700> we'll<00:01:33.880> go<00:01:34.000> ahead

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
with a rotary file and we'll go ahead

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.880 
with a rotary file and we'll go ahead
and<00:01:34.240> where<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.750> where<00:01:35.079> we<00:01:35.110> set<00:01:35.409> our<00:01:35.439> finger

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
and where we where we set our finger

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.859 
and where we where we set our finger
we'll<00:01:36.039> just<00:01:36.189> punch<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.670> hole<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.180> even<00:01:37.659> if<00:01:37.750> it's

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
we'll just punch a hole and even if it's

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.630 
we'll just punch a hole and even if it's
off<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> half<00:01:38.649> of<00:01:38.829> an<00:01:38.920> inch<00:01:39.009> it's<00:01:39.280> not<00:01:39.399> going<00:01:39.579> to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
off a half of an inch it's not going to

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.709 
off a half of an inch it's not going to
matter<00:01:39.759> because<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.090> diameter<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.659> hole

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
matter because the diameter of the hole

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:41.910 
matter because the diameter of the hole
is<00:01:40.899> going<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.079> be<00:01:41.140> an<00:01:41.229> inch<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.530> five-eighths

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
is going to be an inch and five-eighths

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.410 
is going to be an inch and five-eighths
right<00:01:42.159> so<00:01:42.490> at<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.750> at<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.469> point<00:01:44.740> where<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
right so at the at the point where you

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.539 
right so at the at the point where you
punched<00:01:46.899> your<00:01:47.020> hole<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.860> can<00:01:48.039> use<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.369> die

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
punched your hole you can use the die

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.370 
punched your hole you can use the die
grinder<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.240> just<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:49.630> into<00:01:49.899> where<00:01:50.229> the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
grinder and just go into where the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.349 
grinder and just go into where the
factory<00:01:50.890> bolt<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.579> then<00:01:51.670> open<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.210> up

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
factory bolt is and then open it up

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.630 
factory bolt is and then open it up
around<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.719> factory<00:01:53.170> bolt<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.710> then<00:01:54.399> use<00:01:54.609> a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
around the factory bolt and then use a

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.459 
around the factory bolt and then use a
tool<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:54.969> pull<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.450> factory<00:01:55.810> bolt<00:01:56.020> out<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.409> the

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
tool to pull the factory bolt out of the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.340 
tool to pull the factory bolt out of the
hole<00:01:56.649> that<00:01:56.680> you've<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:57.130> made<00:01:58.350> now

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
hole that you've just made now

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.459 
hole that you've just made now
considered<00:01:59.979> all<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.869> have<00:02:02.109> to<00:02:02.289> remember

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
considered all that you have to remember

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.109 
considered all that you have to remember
that<00:02:02.679> different<00:02:03.130> bikes<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.579> of<00:02:03.759> course<00:02:04.000> we

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
that different bikes and of course we

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.550 
that different bikes and of course we
can't<00:02:04.359> film<00:02:04.600> every<00:02:04.810> one<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.109> them<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.350> need

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
can't film every one of them so you need

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.590 
can't film every one of them so you need
to<00:02:05.649> remember<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.070> different<00:02:06.789> bikes<00:02:07.210> are

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
to remember that different bikes are

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.260 
to remember that different bikes are
going<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.320> have<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:09.460> this<00:02:09.700> bike<00:02:10.090> in

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
going to have like this bike in

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.230 
going to have like this bike in
particular<00:02:10.890> it's<00:02:11.890> got<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.310> cables<00:02:12.880> for<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
particular it's got the cables for the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.000 
particular it's got the cables for the
butterflies<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:14.110> your<00:02:14.230> exhaust<00:02:14.560> running

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
butterflies for your exhaust running

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.730 
butterflies for your exhaust running
right<00:02:15.160> here<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.450> what<00:02:17.110> we're<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.560> is

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
right here so what we're going to do is

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.900 
right here so what we're going to do is
I<00:02:18.070> just<00:02:18.280> tied

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
I just tied

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.790 
I just tied
zip<00:02:19.030> tie<00:02:19.270> around<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> know<00:02:20.650> that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
zip tie around it so that I know that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.410 
zip tie around it so that I know that
they're<00:02:21.100> pulled<00:02:21.370> out<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> way<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:21.970> when<00:02:22.390> I

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
they're pulled out of the way so when I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.360 
they're pulled out of the way so when I
go<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.690> cut<00:02:22.990> this<00:02:23.170> hole<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:24.070> know<00:02:24.190> there's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
go to cut this hole you know there's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.730 
go to cut this hole you know there's
nothing<00:02:24.490> behind<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.090> just<00:02:25.330> got<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.380> make<00:02:26.530> sure

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
nothing behind it just got to make sure

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.160 
nothing behind it just got to make sure
because<00:02:27.160> most<00:02:28.030> bikes<00:02:28.360> don't<00:02:28.630> have<00:02:28.930> anything

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
because most bikes don't have anything

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.010 
because most bikes don't have anything
where<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.680> put<00:02:29.980> these<00:02:30.160> items<00:02:30.600> but<00:02:31.600> just<00:02:31.870> in

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
where we put these items but just in

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.900 
where we put these items but just in
case<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.410> does<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.920> check<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.490> know<00:02:33.610> just

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
case it does just check it you know just

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.590 
case it does just check it you know just
reaching<00:02:34.210> there<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.480> feel<00:02:34.630> behind<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.380> on

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
reaching there and feel behind and so on

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.700 
reaching there and feel behind and so on
99%<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> time<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.050> think<00:02:38.260> there's<00:02:38.500> only<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
99% of the time I think there's only a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.200 
99% of the time I think there's only a
couple<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.160> models<00:02:39.460> like<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.700> early<00:02:39.940> model

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
couple of models like the early model

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.200 
couple of models like the early model
Kawasaki's<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:42.430> really<00:02:42.670> needed<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:42.970> remove

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
Kawasaki's you really needed to remove

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.000 
Kawasaki's you really needed to remove
the<00:02:43.390> fairing<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:44.080> some<00:02:44.260> work<00:02:44.440> before<00:02:44.650> you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
go in with our product but 99% of the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.160 
go in with our product but 99% of the
motorcycles<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.360> don't<00:02:49.540> have<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.930> all<00:02:50.080> you

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
motorcycles you don't have to all you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.740 
motorcycles you don't have to all you
got<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.410> do<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.860> figure<00:02:51.580> out<00:02:51.610> where<00:02:51.970> where

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
got to do is just figure out where where

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.330 
got to do is just figure out where where
the<00:02:52.870> hole<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.080> going<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.470> based<00:02:53.950> off<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the hole is going to be based off the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
the hole is going to be based off the
pictures<00:02:54.670> we've<00:02:54.820> showed<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.060> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
pictures we've showed you the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.300 
pictures we've showed you the
instructions<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.110> then<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.710> can<00:02:56.830> just<00:02:56.980> do

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
instructions and then you can just do

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.500 
instructions and then you can just do
what<00:02:57.460> we're<00:02:57.580> talking<00:02:57.910> about<00:02:58.000> here<00:02:58.300> punching

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
what we're talking about here punching

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.470 
what we're talking about here punching
the<00:02:58.750> hole<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.020> opening<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.380> up<00:03:00.270> you'll<00:03:01.270> notice

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
the hole and opening it up you'll notice

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.630 
the hole and opening it up you'll notice
that<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.810> move<00:03:02.080> these<00:03:02.380> fasteners<00:03:03.040> right<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
that I move these fasteners right and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.520 
that I move these fasteners right and
then<00:03:04.420> I've<00:03:04.540> established<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:05.230> there's<00:03:05.440> going

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
then I've established that there's going

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.350 
then I've established that there's going
to<00:03:05.590> be<00:03:05.650> nothing<00:03:05.890> behind<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.760> hole<00:03:06.940> when<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.210> go

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
to be nothing behind the hole when I go

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.360 
to be nothing behind the hole when I go
to<00:03:07.420> cut<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.500> now<00:03:08.650> what<00:03:08.920> we're<00:03:09.040> going<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.190> do

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
to cut it so now what we're going to do

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.130 
to cut it so now what we're going to do
is<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.700> we're<00:03:09.850> going<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.030> put<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.420> plastic

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
is is we're going to put this plastic

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.750 
is is we're going to put this plastic
and<00:03:11.350> we're<00:03:11.440> going<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> pop<00:03:11.860> everything<00:03:12.490> right

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
and we're going to pop everything right

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.140 
and we're going to pop everything right
back<00:03:12.940> into<00:03:13.240> position<00:03:13.740> because<00:03:14.740> if<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:16.000> don't

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
back into position because if you don't

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.390 
back into position because if you don't
have<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.630> perfect<00:03:17.170> when<00:03:17.680> you're<00:03:17.800> cutting<00:03:18.130> that

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
have it perfect when you're cutting that

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.030 
have it perfect when you're cutting that
final<00:03:18.880> hole<00:03:19.090> even<00:03:20.050> if<00:03:20.290> you've<00:03:20.440> got<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:20.770> moved

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
final hole even if you've got this moved

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.620 
final hole even if you've got this moved
at<00:03:21.190> eighth<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.610> an<00:03:21.730> inch<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.210> cut<00:03:22.450> that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
at eighth of an inch and you cut that

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.820 
at eighth of an inch and you cut that
hole<00:03:22.840> guess<00:03:23.260> what

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
hole guess what

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.330 
hole guess what
now<00:03:24.190> you're<00:03:24.370> off<00:03:24.520> a<00:03:24.550> quarter<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.150> an<00:03:25.240> inch<00:03:25.360> so

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
now you're off a quarter of an inch so

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.949 
now you're off a quarter of an inch so
you<00:03:27.340> got<00:03:27.490> to<00:03:27.580> make<00:03:27.700> sure<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.150> all<00:03:28.720> the

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
you got to make sure that the all the

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.540 
you got to make sure that the all the
plastics<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.590> its<00:03:29.740> place<00:03:29.950> when<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.220> before<00:03:30.459> you

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
plastics in its place when it before you

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.570 
plastics in its place when it before you
cut<00:03:30.730> it

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.950 

there's<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.640> few<00:03:35.910> ways<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.360> figuring<00:03:36.720> out<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
there's a few ways of figuring out the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.540 
there's a few ways of figuring out the
hole<00:03:37.140> diameter<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.770> can<00:03:37.920> either<00:03:38.040> put<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
hole diameter you can either put in the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.190 
hole diameter you can either put in the
stock<00:03:38.820> bolt<00:03:39.060> or<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.480> bolt<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.900> supply

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
stock bolt or the bolt that we supply

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.580 
stock bolt or the bolt that we supply
and<00:03:40.680> go<00:03:41.640> like<00:03:41.880> seven<00:03:42.330> eighths<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.840> an<00:03:43.470> inch

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
and go like seven eighths of an inch

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.950 
and go like seven eighths of an inch
from<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.160> center<00:03:44.460> and<00:03:44.610> Mark<00:03:45.390> all<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.870> way

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
from the center and Mark all the way

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.740 
from the center and Mark all the way
around<00:03:46.350> or<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.180> do<00:03:48.270> like<00:03:48.300> we're<00:03:48.570> going<00:03:48.690> to

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
around or you can do like we're going to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.070 
around or you can do like we're going to
do<00:03:48.900> here<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:51.030> can<00:03:51.180> take<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.600> bolt<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.990> we

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
do here you can take the bolt that we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.140 
do here you can take the bolt that we
supply<00:03:52.410> or<00:03:52.860> if<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.100> have<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> longer<00:03:53.790> bolt<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
supply or if you have a longer bolt the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.090 
supply or if you have a longer bolt the
longer<00:03:54.450> bolts<00:03:54.720> even<00:03:54.960> better<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:55.950> can

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
longer bolts even better but you can

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.300 
longer bolts even better but you can
take<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> bolt<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.670> we<00:03:56.820> supply<00:03:58.190> for<00:03:59.190> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
take the bolt that we supply for the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.740 
take the bolt that we supply for the
slider<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.850> you<00:03:59.970> can<00:04:00.090> run<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.330> into<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.540> hole

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
slider and you can run it into the hole

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.990 
slider and you can run it into the hole
and<00:04:01.050> then<00:04:01.280> make<00:04:02.280> sure<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.610> it's<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and then make sure that it's in the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.220 
and then make sure that it's in the
center<00:04:03.240> that<00:04:03.360> hole<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.840> can<00:04:03.959> scribe

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
center that hole and you can scribe

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.350 
center that hole and you can scribe
around<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.800> or<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.760> can<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.000> know<00:04:06.120> use<00:04:06.330> a

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
around it or you can you know use a

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.150 
around it or you can you know use a
sharpie<00:04:06.900> what<00:04:07.140> we<00:04:07.230> use<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.470> silver<00:04:07.770> sharpie<00:04:08.130> or

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
sharpie what we use is silver sharpie or

a black sharpie and then a little paint

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.860 
a black sharpie and then a little paint
thinner<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> just<00:04:10.770> comes<00:04:10.920> right<00:04:11.010> off<00:04:11.870> we

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
thinner and it just comes right off we

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.750 
thinner and it just comes right off we

do have the luxury however I'm having a
little<00:04:14.940> bit<00:04:15.030> longer<00:04:15.330> bolt<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.720> use<00:04:15.930> we<00:04:16.859> can<00:04:17.010> put

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
little bit longer bolt to use we can put

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.479 
little bit longer bolt to use we can put
it<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> hole<00:04:18.829> run<00:04:19.829> it<00:04:19.950> down<00:04:20.070> just<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.459> few

the line now see earlier here's a prime
example<00:04:32.910> earlier<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.140> didn't<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:35.040> these

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
example earlier I didn't have these

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.719 
example earlier I didn't have these
these<00:04:36.180> last<00:04:36.570> two<00:04:36.810> bolts<00:04:37.070> into<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.310> end<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.669> the

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
these last two bolts into the end of the

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.880 
these last two bolts into the end of the
plastic<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.990> hold<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.320> in<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.500> perfect

plastic to hold it in the perfect

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.270 
plastic to hold it in the perfect
position<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:42.030> can<00:04:42.180> see<00:04:42.919> that<00:04:43.919> I'm<00:04:44.220> a

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
position and you can see that I'm a

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.070 
position and you can see that I'm a
little<00:04:44.550> bit<00:04:44.640> off<00:04:44.669> so<00:04:45.120> when<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.330> want<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.600> started

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
little bit off so when I want to started

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.290 
little bit off so when I want to started
drilling<00:04:46.260> on<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.820> putting<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.880> rotary<00:04:48.120> file

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
drilling on this putting the rotary file

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.430 
drilling on this putting the rotary file
on<00:04:48.479> this<00:04:48.570> I'd<00:04:48.810> have<00:04:48.840> been<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> little<00:04:49.140> bit<00:04:49.290> off

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
on this I'd have been a little bit off

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.650 
on this I'd have been a little bit off
if<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.680> didn't<00:04:49.950> check<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.310> so<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.970> you'll<00:04:51.450> have

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
if I didn't check it so and you'll have

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.360 
if I didn't check it so and you'll have
to<00:04:51.810> do<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.110> two<00:04:52.380> or<00:04:52.590> three<00:04:52.800> different<00:04:53.010> times

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
to do this two or three different times

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.450 
to do this two or three different times
before<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.720> make<00:04:54.870> your<00:04:55.050> final<00:04:55.350> cuts<00:04:56.220> you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
before you you make your final cuts you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.460 
before you you make your final cuts you
don't<00:04:56.610> just<00:04:56.790> cut<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.060> all<00:04:57.180> at<00:04:57.330> once<00:04:57.540> you<00:04:58.169> cut<00:04:58.440> it

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
don't just cut it all at once you cut it

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.620 
don't just cut it all at once you cut it
away<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.130> then<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.640> run<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.030> slider<00:05:00.330> in<00:05:00.600> a

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
away and then you run the slider in a

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.510 
away and then you run the slider in a
little<00:05:00.900> bit<00:05:00.990> further<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.919> trace<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
little bit further and you trace the

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.980 
little bit further and you trace the
hole<00:05:02.700> because<00:05:02.940> each<00:05:03.060> time<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.360> can<00:05:03.660> run<00:05:03.810> more

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
hole because each time you can run more

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.380 
hole because each time you can run more
threads<00:05:04.320> in<00:05:04.590> on<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.430> bolt<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:05.910> get<00:05:06.270> the

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
threads in on the bolt and get the

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.240 
threads in on the bolt and get the
slider<00:05:06.660> closer<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.500> plastic<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.220> that

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
slider closer to the plastic and that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.520 
slider closer to the plastic and that
brings<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.570> know<00:05:09.660> it's<00:05:09.870> just<00:05:09.990> like<00:05:10.110> target

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
brings you know it's just like target

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.659 
brings you know it's just like target
practice<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:11.010> closer<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.370> are<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.580> the

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
practice the closer you are to the

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.940 
practice the closer you are to the
target<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.180> better<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.510> can<00:05:12.690> hit<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.200> the

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
target the better you can hit it so the

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.070 
target the better you can hit it so the
closer<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:14.640> and<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.150> draw<00:05:15.360> your<00:05:15.510> line<00:05:15.780> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
closer it is and you draw your line the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.110 
closer it is and you draw your line the
better<00:05:16.200> you<00:05:16.410> can<00:05:16.560> make<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.800> cut<00:05:22.910> you<00:05:23.910> don't

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
better you can make the cut you don't

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.880 
better you can make the cut you don't
necessarily<00:05:24.330> have<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:25.169> have<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.590> know<00:05:25.710> an<00:05:25.800> air

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
necessarily have to have you know an air

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.500 
necessarily have to have you know an air
compressor<00:05:26.070> rotary<00:05:26.729> file<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.270> all<00:05:27.360> that

compressor rotary file and all that

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.270 
compressor rotary file and all that
stuff<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:27.930> can<00:05:27.960> do<00:05:28.350> it<00:05:28.440> with<00:05:28.530> a<00:05:28.590> hand<00:05:28.800> file<00:05:29.040> you

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
stuff you can do it with a hand file you

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.280 
stuff you can do it with a hand file you
can<00:05:29.400> do<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.669> with<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:29.850> little<00:05:30.419> jigsaw<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:31.140> can

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
can do it with a little jigsaw you can

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.040 
can do it with a little jigsaw you can

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
do it with a dremel tool now I'm going

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.420 
do it with a dremel tool now I'm going
to<00:05:37.110> go<00:05:37.200> ahead<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.500> retrace<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:38.190> line

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
to go ahead and retrace that line

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.070 
to go ahead and retrace that line
because<00:05:38.790> I'm<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:38.970> little<00:05:39.120> bit<00:05:39.240> off<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.990> I

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
because I'm a little bit off and I

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.570 
because I'm a little bit off and I
always<00:05:43.349> cut<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.060> inside<00:05:45.840> of<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:47.400> line

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580

always cut to the inside of the line
that<00:05:47.849> I<00:05:47.910> trace<00:05:57.470> okay<00:05:58.470> once<00:05:58.740> again<00:05:59.099> remember<00:05:59.370> we

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
that I trace okay once again remember we

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.400 
that I trace okay once again remember we
went<00:05:59.849> ahead<00:05:59.910> and<00:06:00.060> we<00:06:00.150> put<00:06:00.390> these<00:06:00.599> fasteners<00:06:01.080> in

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
went ahead and we put these fasteners in

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.040 
went ahead and we put these fasteners in
to<00:06:02.070> make<00:06:02.250> sure<00:06:02.430> that<00:06:02.640> all<00:06:02.849> the<00:06:03.300> plastic<00:06:03.870> is

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
to make sure that all the plastic is

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.620 
to make sure that all the plastic is
perfectly<00:06:04.560> in<00:06:04.770> its<00:06:04.919> location<00:06:05.490> so<00:06:06.390> now<00:06:06.479> we're

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
perfectly in its location so now we're

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.150 
perfectly in its location so now we're
going<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.780> go<00:06:06.900> ahead<00:06:06.990> and<00:06:07.200> take<00:06:07.349> this<00:06:07.530> I've

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
going to go ahead and take this I've

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.580 
going to go ahead and take this I've
already<00:06:08.340> trimmed<00:06:08.640> the<00:06:08.940> hole<00:06:09.120> up<00:06:09.360> to<00:06:09.570> my<00:06:10.020> inside

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
already trimmed the hole up to my inside

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.210 
already trimmed the hole up to my inside
line<00:06:12.349> now<00:06:13.349> I'm<00:06:13.410> just<00:06:13.530> going<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.710> start<00:06:14.010> a<00:06:14.070> few

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
line now I'm just going to start a few

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.490 
line now I'm just going to start a few
threads<00:06:14.570> so<00:06:15.570> that<00:06:15.690> I<00:06:15.750> know<00:06:15.810> it's<00:06:16.050> centered<00:06:16.349> up

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
threads so that I know it's centered up

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.820 
threads so that I know it's centered up
and<00:06:16.770> I'm<00:06:16.830> going<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.039> push<00:06:17.220> in<00:06:18.470> now<00:06:19.470> it's<00:06:19.620> also

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
and I'm going to push in now it's also

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.400 
and I'm going to push in now it's also
important<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:20.520> once<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:21.090> once<00:06:21.840> you<00:06:21.960> get<00:06:22.289> it

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
important that once you once you get it

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.770 
important that once you once you get it
in<00:06:22.740> and<00:06:23.010> it's<00:06:23.160> going<00:06:23.220> through<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.700> hole<00:06:23.910> that

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
in and it's going through the hole that

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.010 
in and it's going through the hole that
don't<00:06:25.200> just<00:06:25.440> assume<00:06:25.680> it's<00:06:26.370> finished<00:06:26.789> because

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
don't just assume it's finished because

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.779 
don't just assume it's finished because
when<00:06:28.020> you<00:06:28.110> tighten<00:06:28.380> it<00:06:28.590> up<00:06:28.680> to<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:28.950> chassis<00:06:29.220> it

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
when you tighten it up to the chassis it

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.510 
when you tighten it up to the chassis it
may<00:06:30.390> move<00:06:31.200> it<00:06:31.470> a<00:06:31.530> little<00:06:31.710> bit<00:06:31.890> different<00:06:32.370> than

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
may move it a little bit different than

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.490 
may move it a little bit different than
what<00:06:32.669> you<00:06:32.849> originally<00:06:32.970> thought<00:06:36.200> so<00:06:37.200> you<00:06:37.260> run

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
what you originally thought so you run

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.240 
what you originally thought so you run
it<00:06:37.560> all<00:06:37.830> the<00:06:37.950> way<00:06:38.070> down<00:06:38.750> snug<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.900> up<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:41.010> see

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
it all the way down snug it up and see

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.210 
it all the way down snug it up and see
where<00:06:41.430> your<00:06:41.550> clearances<00:06:42.090> are<00:06:42.560> I've<00:06:43.560> got<00:06:43.860> one

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
where your clearances are I've got one

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.100 
where your clearances are I've got one
little<00:06:44.580> bitty<00:06:44.729> spot<00:06:45.060> touching<00:06:45.630> right<00:06:45.840> down

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
little bitty spot touching right down

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.589 
little bitty spot touching right down
here<00:06:46.500> other<00:06:47.340> than<00:06:47.490> that<00:06:47.760> my<00:06:47.970> clearances<00:06:48.479> are

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
here other than that my clearances are

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.050 
here other than that my clearances are
identical<00:06:49.169> all<00:06:49.289> the<00:06:49.410> way<00:06:49.530> around<00:06:49.830> so<00:06:50.490> we're

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
identical all the way around so we're

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.610 
identical all the way around so we're
pretty<00:06:51.240> much<00:06:51.360> there<00:06:51.750> I'm<00:06:51.990> still<00:06:52.289> going<00:06:52.470> to<00:06:52.500> do

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
pretty much there I'm still going to do

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.820 
pretty much there I'm still going to do
this<00:06:52.740> process<00:06:53.280> one<00:06:53.490> more<00:06:53.520> time<00:06:54.080> just<00:06:55.080> to<00:06:55.169> I'll

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
this process one more time just to I'll

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.460 
this process one more time just to I'll
do<00:06:56.010> that<00:06:56.190> bottom<00:06:56.550> trim<00:06:56.880> and<00:06:57.150> then<00:06:57.990> I'll<00:06:58.140> put<00:06:58.380> it

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
do that bottom trim and then I'll put it

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.200 
do that bottom trim and then I'll put it
back<00:06:58.620> in<00:06:58.830> I'll<00:06:59.130> take<00:06:59.370> some<00:06:59.550> paint<00:06:59.789> thinner

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
back in I'll take some paint thinner

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.300 
back in I'll take some paint thinner
you<00:07:00.659> know<00:07:00.750> just<00:07:01.050> remove<00:07:01.320> the<00:07:01.470> mark<00:07:01.740> and<00:07:01.979> bang

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
you know just remove the mark and bang
