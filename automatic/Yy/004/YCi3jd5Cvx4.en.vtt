00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.129
 in the world of globalized 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.379
 Large companies can be found here and there 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.480
 small lone fighters in Hans families 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.990
 that offer the big ones their foreheads 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.210
 one of them is the 1920 founded 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.370
 take gassner from Bavaria 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.050
 against hofen about two years ago 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.120
 The engineers redesigned 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.420
 company founder and construction manager 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.570
 benno gassner senior the new gs 500 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.149
 strip body of up to 55 cm 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.829
 cut the trend to wider 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.829
 tug tire should meet 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.609
 the v 1480 vario is of basic construction 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.620
 a four year full three flight around 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.969
 a body can be extended 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.829
 with 100 cm body distance and 80 cm 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 Frame height is also for corn straw and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.149
 between fruit enough passage available 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.119
 and also with the 140 x 140 mm frame 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.259
 the green vario also built solid what 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.210
 the basic weight of 1,450 kilograms 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.909
 highlights the three wave 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.729
 tempered 120 mm profile in 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.190
 solid construction with adjusting wars 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.929
 roll camps as well as the massive warehouse 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.700
 Tap for the pivot of the 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.710
 show working hours presentation 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.319
 also that they are not wrong 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.270
 saved 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.789
 All moving parts are loud gaÃŸner 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.619
 with hardened wear resistant and 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.750
 equipped with a noticeable socket 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.060
 when setting the flight, it works 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 Classic too for the front paws wide 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.959
 is there a lying spindle the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 using the included key 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.250
 the sled shifts the sled 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.440
 both sides each with a contract 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.390
 secured hand spindle adapted for the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.640
 there is an adaptation of the point 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.950
 also donates a small lying 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.629
 according to gassner stay to point location and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.910
 also received before the fresh breadth 

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:59.940
 when the working width is changed 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.039
 is the same as the name suggests vario 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.459
 the cutting width adjustment stepless 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.700
 hydraulically maximum 55 to 60 cm 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.220
 working width is the gs500 muster 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.349
 in some cases even wider 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.230
 until just the cutting effect visible 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.140
 subsides drgs 500 leaves the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.239
 use on slightly frozen ground with 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.420
 barely from born between fruit 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.170
 very good working environment at just under 20 cm 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.420
 working depth and 45 cm cutting width 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.010
 the ground was cooled very well and the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.980
 stand the intercrop 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.140
 accurately incorporated with glue the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.690
 ground, the flight had no problems 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.920
 The stripes of the GS500 have a three 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.319
 lay construction 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.810
 while externally hardened material with 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.909
 fine pores and accordingly good ones 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.280
 sliding properties and low 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.499
 Wear is used is located 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.659
 inside a rough colleague drilling barn 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:57.480
 Layer the loadable and the strip 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.909
 After all, it must be made flexible 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.159
 missile take up a lot of power 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.049
 because the shell is still sitting up 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.150
 ground with ship's bolt securing 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.889
 a hydraulic override fuse 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.689
 is working according to gassner 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.969
 By the way, the stripes are over 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.340
 taken in profits at the back 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.379
 screwed when turning the flight is 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.499
 on level ground behind the landrats 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.120
 still place with 5-year-old equipment 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.189
 But you do not come around anymore 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.319
 Use of the frame pivoting cylinder 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.090
 around 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.459
 this is always included in the vario 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.379
 because the working width cylinder has 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.620
 a floating piston of the two 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.329
 functions can perform 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.459
 border flights is with the integrated 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.099
 commutes land advice easily possible 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.709
 the deep idea with spindle goes 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.049
 tool-free and easy to prevent 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.569
 a chain while turning the flight that 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.730
 the wheel forward and switzerland good 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.769
 also liked the podium testers 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.719
 the adjustment of the fertilizer feeder with 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.879
 clamp raster all pivot points 1480 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.480
 Incidentally, vario have to be greased 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.180
 become 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.400
 Some people do not like that as obsolete 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.829
 judge more contemporary but who 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.989
 some vario wings without lubrication after 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.480
 a few years' use 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.550
 notice that there's something we firmly 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.260
 but would have been very good 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.900
 as a crushing us a level one 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.200
 gassner supplies the uniplan in tool 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 two versions of the uni plan a is a 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.820
 simple and light tool that loud 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.520
 gassner the traction required by 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.120
 relief of flight systems has less 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.280
 as a separate packer than the uni 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.979
 plan not only pulls forward but also 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.930
 at the rear end of the frame 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.729
 thanks to the integrated design, he can 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.310
 be used also fear for you 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.680
 the adjustment of aggressiveness is 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.040
 just the detailed test report 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.040
 read in traction january february 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.040
