let's say for instance my hair is a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.540 
let's say for instance my hair is a
stowaway<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.320> it's<00:02:34.620> air<00:02:34.860> drying<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:35.460> i'm

stowaway and it's air drying but i'm
just<00:02:35.700> going<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.880> show<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.420> instance

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
just going to show you for instance

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.170 
just going to show you for instance
let's<00:02:37.440> say<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.770> wanted<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.370> start<00:02:38.700> from<00:02:38.940> back

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
let's say you wanted to start from back

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.540 
let's say you wanted to start from back
here<00:02:39.510> from<00:02:39.780> ear<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.170> ear<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:41.010> would<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.280> take

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
here from ear to ear you would just take

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.620 
here from ear to ear you would just take
the<00:02:41.730> hair<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:43.230> would<00:02:43.350> measure<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.770> from<00:02:43.890> ear

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the hair you would measure it from ear

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.080 
the hair you would measure it from ear
to<00:02:45.630> ear<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.260> then<00:02:47.010> keep<00:02:47.580> your<00:02:47.700> finger<00:02:48.060> there

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
to ear and then keep your finger there

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.510 
to ear and then keep your finger there
so<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
so you know that this is the this is the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.280 
so you know that this is the this is the
length<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.240> want<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.750> clippings<00:02:52.080> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
length that you want your clippings to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.830 
length that you want your clippings to
be<00:02:52.470> me<00:02:53.190> personally<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.880> don't<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.690> have

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
be me personally I don't like to have

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.870 
be me personally I don't like to have
too<00:02:55.230> many<00:02:55.380> clip-ins<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.130> hair<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.400> what<00:02:56.760> I

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
too many clip-ins in my hair so what I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.600 
too many clip-ins in my hair so what I
would<00:02:57.240> do<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.630> would<00:02:57.840> double<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> would

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
would do is I would double it so I would

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.520 
would do is I would double it so I would
take<00:02:59.820> keep<00:03:00.060> my<00:03:00.210> finger<00:03:00.570> where<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.840> was<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
take keep my finger where it was and

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.560 
take keep my finger where it was and
then<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:01.860> will<00:03:02.010> fold<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.460> in<00:03:02.550> half<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:06.450> is

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
then I will fold it in half and this is

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.350 
then I will fold it in half and this is
how<00:03:06.720> long<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.770> then<00:03:08.520> I'll<00:03:08.610> cut<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.000> excess

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
how long and then I'll cut the excess

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.449 
how long and then I'll cut the excess
off<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.260> how<00:03:13.410> long<00:03:13.740> my<00:03:14.130> first

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
off so this is how long my first

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.190 
off so this is how long my first
clipping<00:03:14.940> will<00:03:15.090> be<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.750> will<00:03:15.900> be<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
clipping will be and this will be the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.250 
clipping will be and this will be the
one<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.830> back<00:03:17.100> from<00:03:17.640> here<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.050> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
one for the back from here to here it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.470 
one for the back from here to here it
will<00:03:19.320> be<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> one<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:19.980> back<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:21.239> it's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
will be the one for the back so it's

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.790 
will be the one for the back so it's
doubled<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.470> next<00:03:22.770> thing<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.070> do<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.310> you

00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:46.369 
and do the same thing now the longer you

get the longer the hair gets let's say

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:50.979 
get the longer the hair gets let's say
for<00:06:49.069> instance<00:06:49.099> you<00:06:49.789> wanted<00:06:50.209> to<00:06:50.329> do<00:06:50.539> a<00:06:50.569> clip<00:06:50.959> in

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:50.989 
for instance you wanted to do a clip in

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:53.109 
for instance you wanted to do a clip in
in<00:06:51.319> the<00:06:51.409> middle<00:06:51.709> of<00:06:51.860> course<00:06:52.459> that<00:06:52.699> part<00:06:52.999> is

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:53.119 
in the middle of course that part is

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:55.779 
in the middle of course that part is
going<00:06:53.269> to<00:06:53.360> be<00:06:53.419> longer<00:06:53.869> than<00:06:54.649> the<00:06:55.099> bottom<00:06:55.579> part

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
going to be longer than the bottom part

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.579 
going to be longer than the bottom part
because<00:06:56.209> that's<00:06:56.479> the<00:06:56.959> middle<00:06:57.229> part<00:06:57.409> of<00:06:57.529> your

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:57.589 
because that's the middle part of your

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:00.399 
because that's the middle part of your
head<00:06:57.949> so<00:06:58.879> you're<00:06:59.479> clipping<00:07:00.019> is<00:07:00.110> going<00:07:00.259> to<00:07:00.319> be

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409 
head so you're clipping is going to be

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.229 
head so you're clipping is going to be
really<00:07:00.619> long<00:07:00.949> so<00:07:01.279> instead<00:07:01.519> of<00:07:01.579> sewing<00:07:01.909> two

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:02.239 
really long so instead of sewing two

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:05.830 
really long so instead of sewing two
pieces<00:07:02.749> on<00:07:02.959> you<00:07:03.289> would<00:07:03.559> just<00:07:03.739> put<00:07:03.979> a<00:07:04.009> clip

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
pieces on you would just put a clip

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.450 
pieces on you would just put a clip
section<00:07:06.260> on<00:07:06.410> so<00:07:06.710> it<00:07:06.860> anchors<00:07:07.220> on

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
section on so it anchors on

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.939 
section on so it anchors on
um<00:07:08.970> I<00:07:09.360> hope<00:07:09.810> this<00:07:10.080> video<00:07:10.350> was<00:07:10.410> able<00:07:10.710> to<00:07:10.800> help
