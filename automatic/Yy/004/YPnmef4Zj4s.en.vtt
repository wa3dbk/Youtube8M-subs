obviously the plastic part up here is
pretty<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:31.979> plastic<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.729> things<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.060> are

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
pretty much plastic so things that are

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
pretty much plastic so things that are

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
meant for windshields at least the ones

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
meant for windshields at least the ones
for<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> interior<00:01:49.770> dashboards<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
for the interior dashboards are so I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.850 
for the interior dashboards are so I
tend<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.509> want<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.960> use<00:01:52.140> anything<00:01:52.470> there

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
tend to not want to use anything there

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.859 
tend to not want to use anything there
now<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.490> screen<00:01:53.790> itself<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.479> use<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
now the screen itself you can use the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
now the screen itself you can use the
same<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.500> use<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> same<00:01:55.950> technique<00:01:56.430> now

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
same you can use the same technique now

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.679 
same you can use the same technique now
it's<00:01:56.729> much<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.060> difficult<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> see

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
it's much more difficult to see

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.300 
it's much more difficult to see
obviously<00:01:57.840> because<00:01:58.200> we've<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> picture<00:01:59.159> up

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
obviously because we've got a picture up

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
obviously because we've got a picture up
here<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> screen<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> tapping<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.049> not

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
here on the screen and tapping it's not

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.450 
here on the screen and tapping it's not
a<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.469> idea<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.829> general<00:02:02.189> either

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
a good idea in general either

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.819 
a good idea in general either
but<00:02:02.939> that'll<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.600> dust<00:02:03.930> off<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.500> also

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
