all<00:05:19.770> right<00:05:19.889> let's<00:05:20.099> do

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.520 

one<00:05:25.940> vector

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.020 

this<00:05:29.010> isn't<00:05:29.340> usually<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.270> way<00:05:30.390> I<00:05:30.420> go<00:05:30.660> down

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
this isn't usually the way I go down

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.350 
this isn't usually the way I go down
that's<00:05:33.030> safe<00:05:33.360> okay<00:05:33.900> I<00:05:34.140> mean<00:05:35.150> there's<00:05:36.150> also

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
that's safe okay I mean there's also

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.570 
that's safe okay I mean there's also
some<00:05:36.810> storage<00:05:37.260> up<00:05:37.800> here<00:05:38.390> on<00:05:39.390> top<00:05:40.220> it's<00:05:41.220> pretty

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
some storage up here on top it's pretty

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.540 
some storage up here on top it's pretty
sweet

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
sweet

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.770 
sweet
okay<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:45.350> it's<00:05:46.350> pretty<00:05:46.830> much<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.400> just<00:05:47.670> you<00:05:48.660> can

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
okay so it's pretty much it just you can

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.900 
okay so it's pretty much it just you can
sit<00:05:48.960> on<00:05:48.990> this<00:05:49.110> couch<00:05:49.490> okay<00:05:50.490> it's<00:05:50.640> a<00:05:50.700> little

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
walk back outside it's just a bunch of

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.679
