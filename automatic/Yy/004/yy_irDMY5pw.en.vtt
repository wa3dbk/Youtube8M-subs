 the arm 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.669
 the team that benefits then has three possibilities 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 played quickly by hand to energize the game 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.490
 gaining ground in good weather touched benefit from the throw-in near

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.079
 goal to score three points 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.079
 the game is stopped since she is then the one in action 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.730
 she 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.710
 now see the case of a penalty where the ball falls for the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.570
 run run 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.390
 players or I get a penalty 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.290
 he decides to play it on foot 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.280
 the kicker logically puts the kid on the lawn 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.210
 they put the ball on the title 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 eight children he takes the necessary step back for his run-up 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.730
 during his run-up 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.360
 the ball falls 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 he is now forced to type whatever happens 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600
 fell during the run-up 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.490

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 to kick the ball on the ball for a penalty 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.660
 on a music 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.570
 the problem is that it makes too many mistakes it's a disappointment I do not

 did not know
