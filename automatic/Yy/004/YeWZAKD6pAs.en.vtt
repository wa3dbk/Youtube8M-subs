00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
you doing the game it's a strategy game

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.630 
you doing the game it's a strategy game
is<00:03:33.910> based<00:03:34.150> around<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.450> idea<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.810> terraforming

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
is based around the idea of terraforming

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.370 
is based around the idea of terraforming
so<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:37.240> have<00:03:37.360> these<00:03:37.480> life<00:03:37.690> forms<00:03:37.720> which<00:03:38.170> have

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
so you have these life forms which have

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.290 
so you have these life forms which have
been<00:03:38.500> sent<00:03:38.860> in<00:03:39.010> advance<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.460> terraform<00:03:40.180> an

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
been sent in advance to terraform an

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
been sent in advance to terraform an
asteroid<00:03:40.630> belt<00:03:40.840> they're<00:03:41.850> self-replicating

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
asteroid belt they're self-replicating

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.800 
asteroid belt they're self-replicating
mining<00:03:44.320> machines<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:45.610> they<00:03:45.640> plant<00:03:45.970> trees

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
mining machines so they plant trees

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.930 
mining machines so they plant trees
which<00:03:47.680> then<00:03:47.950> produce<00:03:48.160> more<00:03:48.520> of<00:03:48.640> their<00:03:48.820> own

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
which then produce more of their own

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.810 
which then produce more of their own
kind<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.900> use<00:03:50.350> those<00:03:50.560> two<00:03:50.770> as<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.070> currency<00:03:51.370> or

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
kind and use those two as a currency or
