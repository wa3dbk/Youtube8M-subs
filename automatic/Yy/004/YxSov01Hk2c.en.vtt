00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.070 
keep going over here using the manage em
but<00:02:41.720> still<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.440> it's<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.670> boost<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.510> up<00:02:44.600> but<00:02:44.930> it

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
but still like it's a boost it up but it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.240 
but still like it's a boost it up but it
will<00:02:45.200> bring<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.500> down<00:02:45.680> right<00:02:45.950> away<00:02:46.270> um<00:02:47.270> and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
will bring it down right away um and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.949 
will bring it down right away um and
then<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.489> after<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.180> use<00:02:50.480> arcane

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
then so after that I use arcane

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.550 
then so after that I use arcane
brilliance<00:02:52.090> because<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.480> increases<00:02:53.900> your

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
brilliance because it increases your

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.840 
brilliance because it increases your
maximum<00:02:55.519> mana<00:02:55.760> by<00:02:56.180> 200<00:02:56.930> our<00:02:58.239> 2126<00:02:59.239> and<00:03:00.850> spell

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
maximum mana by 200 our 2126 and spell

power<00:03:02.060> spell<00:03:02.780> power<00:03:03.140> by<00:03:03.560> six<00:03:03.860> percent<00:03:04.900> and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
power spell power by six percent and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.949 
power spell power by six percent and
then<00:03:06.190> make<00:03:07.190> sure<00:03:07.220> your<00:03:07.880> elemental<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.750> out

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
just hit 12 k with that and it just

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.870 
just hit 12 k with that and it just
whenever<00:04:39.470> something<00:04:39.919> prox<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.669> make<00:04:40.850> sure

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
whenever something prox and make sure

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.780 
whenever something prox and make sure
you<00:04:41.389> use<00:04:41.419> it<00:04:41.840> because<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.980> also<00:04:43.190> it's<00:04:43.460> a

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
you use it because it's also it's a

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.400 
you use it because it's also it's a
damage<00:04:44.210> increase<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:47.840> just<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.200> don't

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
damage increase and it's just I don't

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.159 
damage increase and it's just I don't
know<00:04:48.620> as<00:04:49.250> soon<00:04:49.610> as<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:49.910> see<00:04:50.090> some<00:04:50.300> rock<00:04:50.630> use<00:04:50.960> it

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
know as soon as you see some rock use it

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.620 
know as soon as you see some rock use it
but<00:04:51.650> after<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.910> just<00:04:52.940> keep<00:04:53.419> repeating

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
but after that you just keep repeating

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.820 
but after that you just keep repeating
so<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.830> spell<00:04:55.070> rotation<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:56.380> basically<00:04:57.380> pets

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
so the spell rotation is basically pets

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.830 
so the spell rotation is basically pets
