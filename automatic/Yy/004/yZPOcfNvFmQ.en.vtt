00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
storyline but like no one really

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.469 
storyline but like no one really
expected<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.520> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.180> um

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
expected it so it's kind of like that um

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
expected it so it's kind of like that um
but<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.560> different<00:01:13.830> very

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
but this is very different very

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.850 
but this is very different very
different<00:01:14.640> from<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.170> there's<00:01:16.170> still<00:01:16.560> all

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
different from that there's still all

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
different from that there's still all
five<00:01:17.689> stories<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:20.430> don't<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.860> play

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
five stories and I don't know if we play

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.690 
five stories and I don't know if we play
each<00:01:23.880> story<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.080> where<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> goes<00:01:25.700> because

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
each story to see where it goes because

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.020 
each story to see where it goes because
this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> DLC<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> five<00:01:29.549> stories

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
this is a DLC or the five stories

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.330 
this is a DLC or the five stories
emerged<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.350> really<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.070> about

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
emerged some I really don't know about

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.969 
emerged some I really don't know about
that<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:33.259> be<00:01:34.259> pretty<00:01:34.439> cool<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.860> could

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that but be pretty cool if you could

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
that but be pretty cool if you could
play<00:01:35.159> all<00:01:35.310> five<00:01:35.520> stories<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
play all five stories to see where it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.819 
play all five stories to see where it
goes<00:01:36.990> um<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.759> expect<00:01:39.320> too<00:01:40.320> much<00:01:42.530> like<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
goes um I don't expect too much like you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
goes um I don't expect too much like you
will<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.509> emotionally<00:01:45.509> attached

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
will get is emotionally attached

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.460 
will get is emotionally attached
characters<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.280> did<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:49.049> seasons

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
characters like you did and the seasons

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
characters like you did and the seasons
I<00:01:49.680> expect<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:51.030> how<00:01:52.820> because<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
I expect because of how because of the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
I expect because of how because of the
fact<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.560> only<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.100> DLC

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
fact that it's only going to be a DLC

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.219 
fact that it's only going to be a DLC
and<00:01:56.579> we're<00:01:56.909> probably<00:01:57.329> never<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> see

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and we're probably never going to see

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.530 
and we're probably never going to see
these<00:01:58.380> people<00:01:58.979> again<00:01:59.219> only<00:01:59.729> might<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.329> maybe

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
these people again only might and maybe

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
these people again only might and maybe
that's<00:02:00.750> why<00:02:00.869> they're<00:02:01.079> introducing<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> DLC

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that's why they're introducing the DLC

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.569 
that's why they're introducing the DLC
because<00:02:03.360> maybe<00:02:04.079> I'll<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.070> season

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
because maybe I'll going to be in season

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.680 
because maybe I'll going to be in season
2<00:02:05.790> or<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.079> don't<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.649> um<00:02:08.539> from<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
2 or not I don't know um from the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.839 
2 or not I don't know um from the
trailer<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.319> does<00:02:10.679> look<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> lot<00:02:11.310> of

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
trailer it does look like this a lot of

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.420 
trailer it does look like this a lot of
action

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
action

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.500 
action
and<00:02:12.519> um<00:02:13.329> now<00:02:13.780> i<00:02:14.200> do<00:02:14.799> believe<00:02:15.459> looking<00:02:15.879> though

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and um now i do believe looking though

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.770 
and um now i do believe looking though
probably<00:02:16.840> still<00:02:17.200> gonna<00:02:17.319> continue<00:02:17.530> with<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
probably still gonna continue with the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.640 
probably still gonna continue with the
way<00:02:19.780> they've<00:02:20.019> been<00:02:20.049> moving<00:02:20.319> like<00:02:20.560> a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
way they've been moving like a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.369 
way they've been moving like a
point-and-click<00:02:21.189> kind<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.760> game<00:02:21.939> um<00:02:22.239> but<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.260> do

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
point-and-click kind of game um but I do

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.160 
point-and-click kind of game um but I do
expect<00:02:23.739> more<00:02:24.370> action<00:02:24.879> they<00:02:25.269> really<00:02:25.689> started

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
expect more action they really started

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.879 
expect more action they really started
putting<00:02:26.409> more<00:02:26.530> action<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.099> ever<00:02:27.459> since<00:02:28.299> a

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
putting more action and ever since a

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.319 
putting more action and ever since a
season<00:02:29.889> four<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.639> I<00:02:30.700> think<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:31.299> the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
season four and I think that was the

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.910 
season four and I think that was the
first<00:02:31.659> time<00:02:31.840> they<00:02:32.049> actually<00:02:32.379> lets<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.620> shoot

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
first time they actually lets you shoot

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.000 
first time they actually lets you shoot
a<00:02:33.040> gun<00:02:33.069> maybe<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:33.879> think<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.049> don't<00:02:35.319> remember<00:02:35.500> I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
a gun maybe I think I don't remember I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.849 
a gun maybe I think I don't remember I
think<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.310> would<00:02:36.790> think<00:02:36.939> of<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.150> season<00:02:37.859> episode

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
think I would think of a season episode

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.360 
think I would think of a season episode
4<00:02:39.129> well<00:02:39.430> they<00:02:40.239> let<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.109> did<00:02:41.799> where<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.010> were

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
4 well they let you did where you were

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.819 
4 well they let you did where you were
trapped<00:02:42.609> in<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:44.019> trapped<00:02:44.439> and<00:02:44.650> then<00:02:44.739> you

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
trapped in the you trapped and then you

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.319 
trapped in the you trapped and then you
gotta<00:02:45.010> shoot<00:02:45.189> your<00:02:45.340> gun<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.909> I<00:02:45.970> think<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.239> was

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
gotta shoot your gun and I think I was

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.509 
gotta shoot your gun and I think I was
the<00:02:46.389> first<00:02:46.599> time<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.959> energy<00:02:47.109> star<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.919> lot<00:02:48.489> of

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
the first time the energy star a lot of

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.009 
the first time the energy star a lot of
people<00:02:48.639> were<00:02:48.909> pretty<00:02:49.150> happy<00:02:49.419> that<00:02:49.689> they<00:02:49.810> did

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
people were pretty happy that they did

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.199 
people were pretty happy that they did
something<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.409> that<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.459> expect<00:02:51.700> more

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
something like that but I do expect more

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.879 
something like that but I do expect more
action<00:02:52.659> but<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.109> still<00:02:53.349> gonna<00:02:53.500> be<00:02:53.620> at

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
action but it's still gonna be at

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.640 
action but it's still gonna be at
regular<00:02:54.370> point<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.329> click<00:02:55.480> game<00:02:55.810> where<00:02:56.560> you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
regular point and click game where you

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.140 
regular point and click game where you
can<00:02:56.769> choose<00:02:57.099> what<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.400> want<00:02:57.639> to<00:02:57.669> say<00:02:57.849> in<00:02:58.030> that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
can choose what you want to say in that

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.750 
can choose what you want to say in that
kind<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.569> thing<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.069> you<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.219> course<00:03:00.340> we're

kind of thing and you of course we're

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.890 
kind of thing and you of course we're
going<00:03:00.879> to<00:03:00.939> stick<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.269> same<00:03:01.419> graphics

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
going to stick with the same graphics

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.750 
going to stick with the same graphics
and<00:03:02.049> not<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.379> have<00:03:02.500> anything<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.099> not<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.669> have

a<00:03:03.790> problem<00:03:04.239> with<00:03:04.359> them<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:04.659> different<00:03:05.169> and

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
a problem with them it's different and

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.229 
a problem with them it's different and
this<00:03:05.680> game<00:03:05.919> is<00:03:06.069> very<00:03:06.099> different<00:03:06.669> from<00:03:06.879> logging

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
this game is very different from logging

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.259 
this game is very different from logging
and<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:08.530> know<00:03:08.620> that's<00:03:09.280> why<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> like<00:03:09.879> it<00:03:10.090> because

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
and I know that's why I like it because

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.490 
and I know that's why I like it because
it's<00:03:10.569> so<00:03:10.870> different<00:03:13.109> there<00:03:14.109> really<00:03:14.230> isn't

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it's so different there really isn't

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.530 
it's so different there really isn't
much<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.919> go<00:03:14.950> on<00:03:15.159> but<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.879> trailer<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.389> like
