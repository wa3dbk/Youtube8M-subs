point<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.990> nice<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.189> very<00:01:32.460> orangey<00:01:32.759> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
point it's nice but it's very orangey so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.319 
point it's nice but it's very orangey so
it<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:33.930> can't<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.290> relied<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:35.210> coming<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
last is haste haste increases our attack

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.469 
last is haste haste increases our attack
speed<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.840> energy<00:01:40.170> regen<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:42.090> doesn't
