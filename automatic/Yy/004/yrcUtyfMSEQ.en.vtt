page and basically you know we've looked
at<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> mixer<00:00:23.039> before<00:00:23.160> I've<00:00:24.090> shown<00:00:24.449> how<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
at the mixer before I've shown how to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.140 
at the mixer before I've shown how to
send<00:00:25.050> reverb<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.830> delay<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.070> chorus<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
cleaner signal and I'll tap the effects

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
cleaner signal and I'll tap the effects
you<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:39.000> basically<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> pages

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you know basically a lot of the pages

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.549 
you know basically a lot of the pages
have<00:00:41.040> two<00:00:41.520> modes<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.300> them<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.440> know

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
have two modes to them so you know

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
have two modes to them so you know
program<00:00:44.010> song<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.789> these<00:00:44.940> things<00:00:45.090> have

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
program song all these things have

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.100 
program song all these things have
multiple<00:00:45.719> modes<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.390> mixer<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.930> no

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
multiple modes so in the mixer is no

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.170 
multiple modes so in the mixer is no
different<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> fax<00:00:50.670> page<00:00:50.879> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
different you know we have a fax page so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.260 
different you know we have a fax page so
tab<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:53.129> basically<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
tab to that and basically here we have a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.439 
tab to that and basically here we have a
boom<00:00:54.600> room<00:00:54.809> reverb<00:00:55.260> echo<00:00:56.129> delay<00:00:56.340> whirl<00:00:56.910> chorus

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
boom room reverb echo delay whirl chorus

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.540 
boom room reverb echo delay whirl chorus
flanger<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.050> an<00:00:58.410> inter<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> perfect<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.340> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
flanger and an inter a perfect which I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.080 
flanger and an inter a perfect which I
will<00:01:00.480> talk<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.020> little<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.379> later<00:01:02.719> so

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
will talk about a little bit later so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.370 
will talk about a little bit later so
let's<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> add<00:01:06.600> some<00:01:06.900> reverb<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
let's go and add some reverb to the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
let's go and add some reverb to the
drums<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> basically<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.630> see

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
drums here so basically now you can see

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.450 
drums here so basically now you can see
it's<00:01:12.990> sort<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> responding<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.159> like

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it's sort of responding to that and like

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
it's sort of responding to that and like
on<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.700> top<00:01:15.030> row<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.570> every<00:01:16.290> effect<00:01:16.500> kind<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
on the top row here every effect kind of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
on the top row here every effect kind of
has<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> same<00:01:17.040> thing<00:01:17.430> where<00:01:17.580> there's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> power

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
has the same thing where there's a power

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.039 
has the same thing where there's a power
switch<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:19.140> turn<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.320> off<00:01:19.470> real<00:01:19.710> easily<00:01:21.049> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
switch and turn it off real easily and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.800 
switch and turn it off real easily and
at<00:01:22.500> return<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.159> these<00:01:23.310> effects<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.850> send

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
at return so these effects are send

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
at return so these effects are send
effects<00:01:25.259> they're<00:01:25.500> basically<00:01:25.770> sending<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
effects they're basically sending to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
effects they're basically sending to
varying<00:01:27.060> degrees<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.570> each<00:01:27.689> mixer<00:01:28.049> channel

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
varying degrees from each mixer channel

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
varying degrees from each mixer channel
into<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> effect<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.970> signal<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.299> routing

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
into the effect the signal is routing

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.789 
into the effect the signal is routing
through<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> effects<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.259> being<00:01:31.439> returned

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
through the effects and being returned

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.219 
through the effects and being returned
back<00:01:32.220> into<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.579> mix<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.689> return<00:01:34.020> knob

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
back into the mix so the return knob

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.609 
back into the mix so the return knob
sets<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.890> much<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:36.600> returned<00:01:37.110> so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
sets how much is actually returned so

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.960 
sets how much is actually returned so
you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.799> dial<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> down<00:01:38.220> across<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> whole

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you can dial it down across the whole

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.380 
you can dial it down across the whole
mix

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.600 

so<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.780> blue<00:01:44.930> room<00:01:45.110> itself<00:01:45.440> we<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.460> take<00:01:46.550> a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
so the blue room itself we can take a

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.530 
so the blue room itself we can take a
look<00:01:46.700> at<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.880> parameters<00:01:47.000> here<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.480> know

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
look at the parameters here you know

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.910 
look at the parameters here you know
basically<00:01:47.870> first<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.170> all<00:01:48.290> there's<00:01:48.710> this

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
basically first of all there's this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.070 
basically first of all there's this
Buddha<00:01:49.640> statue<00:01:49.880> that's<00:01:50.300> kind<00:01:50.540> of<00:01:50.630> our

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
Buddha statue that's kind of our

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.000 
Buddha statue that's kind of our
signature

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
signature

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.900 
signature
Reverb<00:01:52.850> icon<00:01:53.810> here<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.290> when<00:01:54.980> audio<00:01:55.550> passes

Reverb icon here and when audio passes

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.760 
Reverb icon here and when audio passes
through<00:01:56.060> him<00:01:56.240> he<00:01:56.510> he<00:01:56.840> sort<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.170> emanates<00:01:57.530> these

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
through him he he sort of emanates these

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.300 
through him he he sort of emanates these
spheres<00:01:58.370> from<00:01:58.520> his<00:01:58.760> forehead<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.160> main

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
spheres from his forehead and the main

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.490 
spheres from his forehead and the main
parameter<00:02:01.760> is<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:02.030> boom<00:02:02.300> knob<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:02.900> basically

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
parameter is this boom knob so basically

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.390 
parameter is this boom knob so basically
a<00:02:03.740> big<00:02:04.130> boom<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.870> big<00:02:06.200> room<00:02:06.500> with<00:02:06.530> tons<00:02:07.190> of

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
a big boom is a big room with tons of

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.810 
a big boom is a big room with tons of
bass<00:02:07.640> boost<00:02:11.440> down<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> smaller<00:02:13.100> room<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.730> you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
bass boost down to a smaller room so you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.850 
bass boost down to a smaller room so you
can<00:02:13.910> adjust<00:02:14.210> kind<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.480> like<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.780> basic<00:02:15.260> bass

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
can adjust kind of like the basic bass

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.730 
can adjust kind of like the basic bass
parameter<00:02:16.340> here<00:02:16.490> with<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:17.380> on<00:02:18.380> top<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.680> that

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
parameter here with this on top of that

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.630 
parameter here with this on top of that
there's<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.980> filter<00:02:19.280> where<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.550> adjust

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
there's a filter where you can adjust

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.140 
there's a filter where you can adjust
high<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.330> low<00:02:20.540> kind<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.459> EQ<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.490> little<00:02:22.760> bit<00:02:22.880> so

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
high and low kind of EQ a little bit so

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.500 
high and low kind of EQ a little bit so
if<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.330> want<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.570> get<00:02:23.630> more<00:02:23.810> high<00:02:24.080> out<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.260> this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.770 

and<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:31.160> pre-delay<00:02:31.730> which<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.209> basically

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
and then pre-delay which is basically

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.420 
and then pre-delay which is basically
kind<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.230> first<00:02:33.500> bounce<00:02:33.830> back<00:02:34.130> from<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
kind of the first bounce back from the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.370 
kind of the first bounce back from the
wall<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.760> get<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.209> can<00:02:35.750> turn<00:02:35.930> down<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.200> mix

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
wall you get I can turn down the mix

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.920 
wall you get I can turn down the mix
here<00:02:36.500> as<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.650> can<00:02:36.770> hear<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.070> lot<00:02:43.930> so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
here as you can hear it a lot so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.880 
here as you can hear it a lot so
basically<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.560> play<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:45.739> these

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
basically just have to play with these

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.000 
basically just have to play with these
parameters<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.459> get<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.640> sound<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.940> want

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.890 

I'll<00:02:52.010> turn<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.280> off<00:02:52.400> for<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.610> second<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.060> add

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
I'll turn that off for a second and add

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.840 
I'll turn that off for a second and add
some<00:02:54.140> delay<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.680> lot<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.670> are<00:02:58.730> probably

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
some delay so a lot of you are probably

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.640 
some delay so a lot of you are probably
familiar<00:02:59.030> with<00:02:59.330> play<00:02:59.630> basically<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.470> a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
familiar with play basically just a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.449 
familiar with play basically just a
clean<00:03:01.280> sort<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.180> musical<00:03:02.570> echo<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
clean sort of musical echo this is a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.250 
clean sort of musical echo this is a
tempo<00:03:04.820> sinkable<00:03:05.209> delay<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:06.080> can<00:03:06.200> either

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
tempo sinkable delay so I can either

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.440 
tempo sinkable delay so I can either
have<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.739> sort<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.160> arbitrary<00:03:07.610> seconds<00:03:08.030> or

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
have it on sort of arbitrary seconds or

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.420 
have it on sort of arbitrary seconds or
tempo<00:03:08.810> right<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:09.110> it's<00:03:09.230> thanks<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.470> tempo<00:03:09.830> so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
tempo right now it's thanks to tempo so

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.140 
tempo right now it's thanks to tempo so
I<00:03:10.459> can<00:03:10.580> go<00:03:10.670> down<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.850> 64<00:03:11.840> notes<00:03:12.430> or<00:03:13.430> 1/32<00:03:14.060> out

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
I can go down to 64 notes or 1/32 out

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.479 
I can go down to 64 notes or 1/32 out
here<00:03:14.590> feedback<00:03:15.590> obviously<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.190> amount<00:03:16.400> of

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
here feedback obviously is the amount of

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.380 
here feedback obviously is the amount of
time<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.970> reading<00:03:17.269> brings<00:03:17.510> out<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:19.580> dampen

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
time this reading brings out and dampen

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.250 
time this reading brings out and dampen
is<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.630> filter<00:03:21.080> over<00:03:21.350> time<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.890> turn<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.250> up

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
is a filter over time so I turn that up

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.900 
is a filter over time so I turn that up
and<00:03:24.260> here

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.570 

and<00:03:30.910> then<00:03:31.630> obviously<00:03:31.900> dry/wet<00:03:32.500> how<00:03:32.680> much<00:03:32.890> dry

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
and then obviously dry/wet how much dry

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.020 
and then obviously dry/wet how much dry
signal<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.120> no<00:03:34.270> effect<00:03:34.599> wet<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:35.050> voidable<00:03:37.830> okay

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
signal is no effect wet is voidable okay

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.460 
signal is no effect wet is voidable okay
and<00:03:40.030> finally<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.360> chorus<00:03:40.780> flanger<00:03:41.020> I'm<00:03:41.290> gonna

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
and finally a chorus flanger I'm gonna

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.840 
and finally a chorus flanger I'm gonna
turn<00:03:41.770> on<00:03:41.890> another<00:03:42.300> track<00:03:43.300> here<00:03:44.640> sort<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.700> get

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
turn on another track here sort of get

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.530 
turn on another track here sort of get
that<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.770> basically<00:03:50.980> an<00:03:51.100> LFO<00:03:51.610> again<00:03:52.180> sync

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
that so it's basically an LFO again sync

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.089 
that so it's basically an LFO again sync
to<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.720> tempo<00:03:53.400> some<00:03:54.400> sort<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.670> here<00:03:59.099> working

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
to the tempo some sort of here working

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.199 
to the tempo some sort of here working
the<00:04:00.220> sound<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:00.670> can<00:04:00.790> get<00:04:00.849> like<00:04:01.030> really

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
the sound you can get like really

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.670 
the sound you can get like really
dramatic<00:04:01.390> effects<00:04:01.930> out<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.290> or<00:04:02.500> very

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
dramatic effects out of this or very

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.340 
dramatic effects out of this or very
subtle<00:04:03.100> kind<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.430> chorus<00:04:04.239> effects<00:04:04.540> Julian's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
subtle kind of chorus effects Julian's

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:13.350 
subtle kind of chorus effects Julian's
feedback<00:04:05.620> similar<00:04:06.069> again<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.819> delay<00:04:12.360> okay

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
feedback similar again to the delay okay

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.960 
feedback similar again to the delay okay
so<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.230> finally<00:04:14.680> I'm<00:04:15.250> really<00:04:15.610> excited<00:04:15.790> about

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
so and finally I'm really excited about

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.670 
so and finally I'm really excited about
