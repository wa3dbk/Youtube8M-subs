00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
them and that's child's play so the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.250 
them and that's child's play so the
first<00:00:36.320> one<00:00:36.470> is<00:00:36.650> just<00:00:36.710> child's<00:00:37.280> play<00:00:37.900> and<00:00:38.900> it's

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
first one is just child's play and it's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.840 
first one is just child's play and it's
about<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:40.310> guy<00:00:40.550> called<00:00:40.880> Chucky<00:00:42.190> who<00:00:43.190> started

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
about this guy called Chucky who started

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.530 
about this guy called Chucky who started
off<00:00:43.970> as<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.750> villain<00:00:45.649> a<00:00:45.890> murderer<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:46.790> then<00:00:47.240> he

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
off as a villain a murderer and then he

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.050 
off as a villain a murderer and then he
put<00:00:47.780> his<00:00:47.870> soul<00:00:48.170> into<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:48.800> good<00:00:49.100> guy<00:00:49.310> doll<00:00:49.520> and

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
put his soul into this good guy doll and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.430 
put his soul into this good guy doll and
so<00:00:50.420> that's<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.900> story<00:00:51.110> of<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:52.520> first<00:00:52.700> film

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
so that's the story of the first film

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.230 
so that's the story of the first film
and<00:00:54.440> then<00:00:54.860> there<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.490> trans<00:00:56.090> play<00:00:56.330> -<00:00:58.000> voiced<00:00:59.000> by

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
and then there is trans play - voiced by

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.980 
and then there is trans play - voiced by
Brad<00:00:59.570> Dourif

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
Brad Dourif

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.310 
Brad Dourif
I<00:01:00.290> think<00:01:01.280> he<00:01:01.520> voiced<00:01:01.910> most<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.930> them<00:01:03.140> if<00:01:03.290> not

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
I think he voiced most of them if not

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.280 
I think he voiced most of them if not
all<00:01:03.470> of<00:01:03.590> them<00:01:04.479> but<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.540> can't<00:01:05.810> actually<00:01:05.960> see<00:01:06.200> his

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
all of them but I can't actually see his

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.690 
all of them but I can't actually see his
name<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.680> back<00:01:06.799> of<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.009> one<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:07.220> possibly

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
name on the back of this one so possibly

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.060 
name on the back of this one so possibly
not<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.000> one<00:01:08.180> but<00:01:08.600> Brad<00:01:08.869> Dourif<00:01:09.140> did<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
not this one but Brad Dourif did the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.670 
not this one but Brad Dourif did the
voice<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.460> most<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.880> them

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
voice of most of them

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.499
