00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
very satisfying and just a little

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.000

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.380 

I<00:01:26.750> think<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.870> went<00:01:28.580> way<00:01:29.580> better<00:01:29.760> than<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

I think it went way better than you
could<00:01:30.540> ever<00:01:30.660> expect<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.410> I<00:01:31.560> don't<00:01:31.770> know

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
could ever expect you know I don't know

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.490 
could ever expect you know I don't know
we<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.100> practiced<00:01:32.610> four<00:01:32.820> times<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.500> then

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
we just practiced four times and then

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
we just practiced four times and then
you<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.800> jump<00:01:34.980> into<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.370> scenario<00:01:36.180> where

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you just jump into a scenario where

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
you just jump into a scenario where
there's<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:37.080> few<00:01:37.830> thousand<00:01:38.250> people<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.580> front

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
there's a few thousand people in front

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.780 
there's a few thousand people in front
of<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:40.200> turned<00:01:40.410> out<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.620> a<00:01:41.010> lot<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
of you and it turned out that a lot of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.120 
of you and it turned out that a lot of
them<00:01:41.990> were<00:01:42.990> singing<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.410> lyrics<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> really

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
them were singing the lyrics and really

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.530 
them were singing the lyrics and really
into<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.400> end<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.820> tunes<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
into the end of the tunes and do the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.590 
into the end of the tunes and do the
songs<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:46.800> way<00:01:47.790> way<00:01:48.120> better<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.570> ever

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
songs so way way better than we ever

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:06.210 
songs so way way better than we ever
expected

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.520 

there<00:02:07.180> was<00:02:07.270> kind<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.510> three<00:02:07.690> little<00:02:07.840> phases<00:02:08.320> of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
there was kind of three little phases of

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.080 
there was kind of three little phases of
this<00:02:08.710> band<00:02:08.950> killer<00:02:09.190> be<00:02:09.369> killed<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.700> first<00:02:09.850> one

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
this band killer be killed the first one

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.910 
this band killer be killed the first one
was<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.840> idea<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.200> all<00:02:11.290> getting<00:02:11.470> together<00:02:11.680> in

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
was the idea of all getting together in

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.560 
was the idea of all getting together in
writing<00:02:12.190> music<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.760> next<00:02:13.000> step<00:02:13.150> was<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.360> try

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
writing music the next step was to try

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.090 
writing music the next step was to try
to<00:02:13.600> get<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> other<00:02:13.990> record<00:02:14.440> music<00:02:14.560> which

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
to get the other record music which

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.930 
to get the other record music which
happened<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.430> September<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.470> 2013<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:18.460> had<00:02:18.550> 21
