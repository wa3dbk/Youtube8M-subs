00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:10.640 
all right in this section we're going to

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.030 
all right in this section we're going to
take<00:00:10.820> a<00:00:10.850> look<00:00:11.150> at<00:00:11.390> creating<00:00:11.870> some<00:00:12.139> maps<00:00:12.440> from

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
take a look at creating some maps from

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.860 
take a look at creating some maps from
what<00:00:13.219> we've<00:00:13.370> done<00:00:13.639> but<00:00:14.030> before<00:00:14.180> we<00:00:14.480> do<00:00:14.660> that<00:00:14.690> I

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
what we've done but before we do that I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.779 
what we've done but before we do that I
did<00:00:15.200> think<00:00:15.410> of<00:00:15.530> one<00:00:15.740> more<00:00:15.950> thing<00:00:16.219> I<00:00:16.309> wanted<00:00:16.640> to

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
did think of one more thing I wanted to

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.630 
did think of one more thing I wanted to
do<00:00:17.030> so<00:00:17.840> I'm<00:00:18.050> going<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.380> create<00:00:18.590> one<00:00:18.680> more<00:00:19.130> multi

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
do so I'm going to create one more multi

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.840 
do so I'm going to create one more multi
normal<00:00:21.699> so<00:00:22.699> I<00:00:22.730> have<00:00:22.940> access<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.480> my<00:00:23.660> tools<00:00:24.850> I'm

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
normal so I have access to my tools I'm

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.430 
normal so I have access to my tools I'm
going<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.030> come<00:00:26.210> over<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.600> I<00:00:26.810> am<00:00:26.960> going<00:00:27.290> to

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
going to come over and I am going to

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:38.740 
going to come over and I am going to
create<00:00:27.830> a<00:00:28.190> text<00:00:28.700> file<00:00:36.760> all<00:00:37.760> righty<00:00:38.090> let's<00:00:38.210> see

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
create a text file all righty let's see

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.960 
create a text file all righty let's see
here

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
here

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.970 
here
let's<00:00:40.970> make<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.570> ubiquitous<00:00:44.980> section

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
let's make this the ubiquitous section

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:57.160 
let's make this the ubiquitous section
seven<00:00:53.829> let's<00:00:54.829> slant<00:00:55.190> this<00:00:55.399> down<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:56.899> now<00:00:56.930> you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
seven let's slant this down and now you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.729 
seven let's slant this down and now you
can<00:00:57.380> see<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:59.090> can<00:00:59.239> also<00:00:59.390> place<00:00:59.780> text<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.620> on

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
can see you can also place text in on

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.359 
can see you can also place text in on
our<00:01:00.860> normal<00:01:01.010> Maps<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:06.680> I'm<00:01:06.799> pretty<00:01:07.070> pleased

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
our normal Maps so I'm pretty pleased

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.480 
our normal Maps so I'm pretty pleased
with<00:01:07.549> all<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:08.799> so<00:01:09.799> now<00:01:09.890> I'm<00:01:09.979> gonna<00:01:10.159> come<00:01:10.340> up

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
with all that so now I'm gonna come up

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.840 
with all that so now I'm gonna come up
pull<00:01:10.880> down<00:01:10.909> my<00:01:11.180> file<00:01:11.420> menu<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:13.430> I'm<00:01:13.549> gonna<00:01:13.670> go

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
pull down my file menu and I'm gonna go

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.440 
pull down my file menu and I'm gonna go
to<00:01:13.909> map<00:01:14.240> converter<00:01:15.820> that's<00:01:16.820> going<00:01:17.120> to<00:01:17.210> bring

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
to map converter that's going to bring

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.880 
to map converter that's going to bring
up<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.020> lovely<00:01:18.530> little<00:01:18.680> dialog<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:20.890> it's

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
up this lovely little dialog and it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.250 
up this lovely little dialog and it's
set<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.130> normal<00:01:22.430> but<00:01:23.030> depending<00:01:23.360> on<00:01:23.420> what<00:01:23.840> kind

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
set on normal but depending on what kind

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.550 
set on normal but depending on what kind
of<00:01:24.470> map<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:25.159> have<00:01:25.280> created<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:27.350> can

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
of map that you have created you can

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.070 
of map that you have created you can
also<00:01:27.799> convert<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.670> normal<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:29.869> made<00:01:30.049> it

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
also convert to a normal but we made it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.700 
also convert to a normal but we made it
normal

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
normal

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.539 
normal
so<00:01:31.430> I'm<00:01:31.490> going<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.729> grab<00:01:31.909> an<00:01:32.090> AO<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:34.040> diffuse

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
so I'm going to grab an AO and a diffuse

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.560 
so I'm going to grab an AO and a diffuse
and<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:36.619> specular<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:39.700> since<00:01:40.700> we<00:01:40.880> have<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.360> on

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
and a specular and since we have this on

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.179 
and a specular and since we have this on
our<00:01:41.600> active<00:01:42.080> dock<00:01:42.320> I'm<00:01:42.560> going<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.950> click

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
our active dock I'm going to click

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.070 
our active dock I'm going to click
active<00:01:43.670> dock<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.790> then<00:01:46.790> we're<00:01:46.970> gonna<00:01:47.150> let<00:01:47.630> and

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
active dock and then we're gonna let and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.840 
active dock and then we're gonna let and
do<00:01:48.890> go<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.159> work<00:01:51.189> now<00:01:52.189> I<00:01:52.220> will<00:01:52.400> pause<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
do go to work now I will pause the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.270 
do go to work now I will pause the
recording<00:01:52.880> because<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:53.750> will<00:01:53.990> take<00:01:54.290> just<00:01:55.070> a

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
recording because this will take just a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.789 
recording because this will take just a
little<00:01:55.430> bit<00:01:55.580> of<00:01:55.790> time<00:01:56.030> most<00:01:56.479> likely<00:01:56.600> or<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.350> can

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
little bit of time most likely or I can

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.539 
little bit of time most likely or I can
jamber<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.490> be<00:01:58.580> just<00:01:58.790> about<00:01:59.060> there<00:02:00.549> for

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
jamber on and be just about there for

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.560 
jamber on and be just about there for
the<00:02:01.610> moment<00:02:01.759> let's<00:02:02.060> pause

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.720 

all<00:02:05.290> right<00:02:05.500> so<00:02:05.650> that's<00:02:05.770> finished<00:02:06.190> running<00:02:06.430> and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
all right so that's finished running and

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.060 
all right so that's finished running and
as<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.240> can<00:02:07.360> see<00:02:07.420> we<00:02:07.840> have<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.350> normal<00:02:08.710> map<00:02:08.890> we

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
as you can see we have the normal map we

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.710 
as you can see we have the normal map we
created<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:10.470> qixels<00:02:11.470> also<00:02:12.010> created<00:02:12.460> an

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
created and qixels also created an

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.160 
created and qixels also created an
ambient<00:02:13.720> occlusion<00:02:13.870> map<00:02:14.700> specular<00:02:15.700> map<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:17.020> a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
ambient occlusion map specular map and a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.400 
ambient occlusion map specular map and a
diffuse<00:02:17.500> map<00:02:17.530> Buckeye<00:02:18.070> access<00:02:18.580> state<00:02:19.090> -<00:02:19.410> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
diffuse map Buckeye access state - and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.990 
diffuse map Buckeye access state - and
of<00:02:20.470> course<00:02:20.710> now<00:02:20.890> these<00:02:21.100> are<00:02:21.280> created<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.880> can

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
of course now these are created you can

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.370 
of course now these are created you can
always<00:02:22.270> play<00:02:22.540> around<00:02:22.570> with<00:02:22.990> them<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> little

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
always play around with them a little

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.670 
always play around with them a little
bit

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
bit

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.180 
bit
for<00:02:24.130> example<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> specular<00:02:25.210> map<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.890> am<00:02:26.890> going

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
for example the specular map I am going

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:51.190 
for example the specular map I am going
to<00:02:27.340> go<00:02:27.550> ahead

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.420 

all<00:02:51.920> right<00:02:52.130> I'm<00:02:52.310> pretty<00:02:52.459> happy<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:54.430> and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
all right I'm pretty happy with that and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.220 
all right I'm pretty happy with that and
of<00:02:55.550> course<00:02:55.760> our<00:02:55.970> diffuse<00:02:56.239> as<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.810> see<00:02:56.989> we

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
of course our diffuse as you can see we

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.559 
of course our diffuse as you can see we
didn't<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.770> any<00:02:58.069> color<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.849> our<00:02:59.000> normal<00:02:59.390> map

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
didn't have any color in our normal map

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.839 
didn't have any color in our normal map
so<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.870> did<00:03:00.110> not<00:03:00.290> create<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.709> diffuse<00:03:01.280> color<00:03:01.640> map

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
so I did not create a diffuse color map

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.510 
so I did not create a diffuse color map
for<00:03:02.390> us<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:02.690> that's<00:03:02.840> alright<00:03:03.290> when<00:03:04.130> we<00:03:04.250> get<00:03:04.400> to

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520
