00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.839
 a new video guy I 'm here to make 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.590
 a video tutorial on how we say a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.389
 create flyers let's say only three 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.430
 almost at the time of this we should have 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.140
 need from minds of images from 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:39.510
 put on our flyer I believe in 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:43.020
 for any strike force starting 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.090
 up from cs3 so it's fine success 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.829
 456 in this case 23 after which we have 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 open photos we make ourselves create a new one 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:01.140
 or image we put into thinking 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.250
 we put international card and at 5 that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.000
 the model that is used to move forward there 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.350
 we do ok and will try this then 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.750
 first let's insert images 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.810
 I usually do what I do 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.729
 a base to put into the whole 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.570
 flyer in the sense that I don't 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 always white white but I always change one 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.350
 base filter on which the change is dyed 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.350
 guy 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:40.320
 so here is a basis so a christ if not 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.899
 let's go look for some effect 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.939
 let's put on the white then effects that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.710
 it goes from the present white we cairo 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.790
 it was so 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.450
 to give a little more color after that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.170
 we must other images see a 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.659
 talk to take all pictures and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:07.320
 put on our photoshop 3 Jun 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.700
 here it is we take your 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.250
 the first thing I want to do is put the classic 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.950
 view we do this we do with stan 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.830
 making a flyer for a restaurant 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 let's take this image cutini 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.340
 we take wand monks ce tool 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:31.019
 has them but tolerance we put the maximum 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.820
 from 15 100 males 55 and we take how 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.560
 will precipitate all this if we want 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.430
 use all images if we can't 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.910
 do not decrease committing more than 100 e 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.400
 unfiltered by images almost all 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.130
 then also it depends on where you click to take 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.280
 dealt with by which filming I want 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.010
 take a point and then well 355 where 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.000
 dietrick call this we take 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:02.400
 the image inside a control p 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.390
 we can choose how regular it is 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.390
 great and it seems to me 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:26.040
 we are in the way we go so it's called 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:29.190
 the meeting the t of the magnitude forget 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.900
 and then you can show it to people like 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.940
 write something next now 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:41.180
 we do a lot we also want to put the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:44.209
 the restaurant's website there are everything 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:53.130
 however, the instrument is called rapid 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:55.430
 from the same thing we all do a lot 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.430
 wind 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.840
 Hello 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:19.120
 now let's take this text 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:26.200
 horizontal and we write you here we choose 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.200
 wrong on the karate paragraph window 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:33.070
 write for example new restaurant 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:52.040
 restaurant called pasta are 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:57.920
 shoot the case below we can 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:00.400
 reduce the test while 13 and give one 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.400
 nice description 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:21.229

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:24.349
 example after a good pasta is fine 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:32.440
 after that we can go to the present 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:32.440
