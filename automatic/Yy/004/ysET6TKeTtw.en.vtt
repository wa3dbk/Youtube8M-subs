smaller<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.750> scale<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.590> let's<00:02:22.980> say<00:02:23.280> his

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
smaller in scale to let's say his

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.509 
smaller in scale to let's say his
colleague<00:02:24.600> bring<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.590> Sulley<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.370> see

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
colleague bring in Sulley you can see

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.460 
colleague bring in Sulley you can see
the<00:02:26.609> difference<00:02:27.030> between<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.540> two<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.870> would

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the difference between the two I would

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.110 
the difference between the two I would
say<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.680> know<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.400> they're<00:02:29.549> pretty<00:02:29.820> good

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
say you know what they're pretty good

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.550 
say you know what they're pretty good
Solly<00:02:30.510> could<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:30.870> been<00:02:30.959> maybe<00:02:31.109> a<00:02:31.230> little<00:02:31.410> bit

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
Solly could have been maybe a little bit

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.940 
Solly could have been maybe a little bit
taller<00:02:31.829> but<00:02:31.950> still<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.239> toy<00:02:33.720> level<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.859> know

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
taller but still on a toy level you know

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.619 
taller but still on a toy level you know
they're<00:02:35.370> still<00:02:35.610> complimenting<00:02:36.300> each<00:02:36.390> other

in<00:03:18.810> weight<00:03:19.320> comparison<00:03:20.160> Sully<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.240> lot

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
in weight comparison Sully is a lot

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.530 
in weight comparison Sully is a lot
heavier<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:22.260> makes<00:03:22.500> some<00:03:22.830> sense<00:03:23.540> his

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
heavier but that makes some sense his

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.630 
heavier but that makes some sense his
pose<00:03:24.720> ability<00:03:25.200> he's<00:03:25.710> not<00:03:25.860> super<00:03:26.430> poseable

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
pose ability he's not super poseable

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.000 
pose ability he's not super poseable
that's<00:03:27.060> unfortunately<00:03:27.930> only<00:03:28.200> problem<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
that's unfortunately only problem you

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.950 
that's unfortunately only problem you
can<00:03:29.160> see<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.610> he<00:03:29.730> has<00:03:29.760> rotations<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
can see that he has rotations in the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.370 
can see that he has rotations in the
feet<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.670> he<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:32.910> rotate<00:03:33.090> his<00:03:33.360> feet<00:03:33.600> sideways

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
feet so he can rotate his feet sideways

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380 
feet so he can rotate his feet sideways
I<00:03:34.770> guess<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.010> he<00:03:35.100> wants<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.400> sit<00:03:35.670> down<00:03:35.850> or<00:03:36.090> you

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
I guess if he wants to sit down or you

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.500 
I guess if he wants to sit down or you
know<00:03:36.510> if<00:03:36.630> he's<00:03:36.810> got<00:03:37.650> heat<00:03:37.890> stroke<00:03:38.390> but<00:03:39.390> you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
know if he's got heat stroke but you

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.300 
know if he's got heat stroke but you
can't<00:03:39.660> rotate<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.140> legs<00:03:40.380> not<00:03:40.890> really<00:03:41.160> too

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
can't rotate the legs not really too

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.730 
can't rotate the legs not really too
much<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.970> arms<00:03:42.270> themselves<00:03:42.450> rotate<00:03:43.200> back<00:03:43.440> and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
much the arms themselves rotate back and

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.250 
much the arms themselves rotate back and
forth<00:03:44.070> back<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.730> forth<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.480> they<00:03:45.990> also

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
forth back and forth and they also

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.900 
forth back and forth and they also
rotate<00:03:46.680> out<00:03:49.010> this<00:03:50.010> arms<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.490> so<00:03:50.610> much<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.850> an

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
rotate out this arms not so much of an

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.940 
rotate out this arms not so much of an
issue<00:03:51.000> because<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.110> arm<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.410> bent<00:03:52.590> down

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
issue because the arm is bent down

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.430 
issue because the arm is bent down
obviously<00:03:53.540> because<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.690> hinge<00:03:54.990> works<00:03:55.230> back

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
obviously because that hinge works back

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.410 
obviously because that hinge works back
and<00:03:55.650> forth<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.070> out<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> arm<00:03:56.910> certainly

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
and forth and and out the arm certainly

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.260 
and forth and and out the arm certainly
was<00:03:57.630> set<00:03:57.930> at<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> natural<00:03:58.440> pose<00:03:59.270> unfortunately

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
was set at a natural pose unfortunately

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.540 
was set at a natural pose unfortunately
this<00:04:00.360> arm<00:04:00.570> here<00:04:01.110> because<00:04:02.010> where<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> is

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
this arm here because where it is

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.060 
this arm here because where it is
currently<00:04:02.820> sculpted<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.890> arm

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
currently sculpted you can have the arm

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.030 
currently sculpted you can have the arm
down<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:06.240> can<00:04:06.390> have<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.630> up<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.800> can<00:04:07.920> have

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
down you can have it up and you can have

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.250 
down you can have it up and you can have
it<00:04:08.130> out<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.060> always<00:04:09.480> gonna<00:04:09.780> kind<00:04:10.170> of

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
it out but it is always gonna kind of

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.170 
it out but it is always gonna kind of
stick<00:04:10.770> itself<00:04:11.160> out<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:11.640> never<00:04:11.760> going<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.030> be

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
stick itself out it's never going to be

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.620 
stick itself out it's never going to be
as<00:04:12.420> far<00:04:12.870> down<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:14.430> arm<00:04:14.670> here<00:04:15.090> as<00:04:15.240> you<00:04:15.510> can

as far down as this arm here as you can

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.420 
as far down as this arm here as you can
see<00:04:15.750> that's<00:04:15.870> about<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:16.260> far<00:04:16.500> as<00:04:16.560> one<00:04:17.010> can<00:04:17.220> get

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
see that's about as far as one can get

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.380 
see that's about as far as one can get
with<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.890> more<00:04:20.310> natural<00:04:20.609> poses

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
with it so it's more natural poses

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.720 
with it so it's more natural poses
probably<00:04:21.660> likely<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.260> have<00:04:22.470> Mike<00:04:22.950> waving

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
probably likely to have Mike waving

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.370 
probably likely to have Mike waving
that's<00:04:24.030> probably<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.080> way<00:04:25.170> you're<00:04:25.290> gonna

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
that's probably the way you're gonna

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.050 
that's probably the way you're gonna
want<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> have<00:04:25.860> him<00:04:25.980> at<00:04:26.130> all<00:04:26.310> times<00:04:26.580> unless<00:04:26.910> you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
want to have him at all times unless you

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.910 
want to have him at all times unless you
kind<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.450> want<00:04:27.660> him<00:04:27.750> as<00:04:28.530> if<00:04:28.680> he's<00:04:28.800> gonna

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
kind of just want him as if he's gonna

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.500 
kind of just want him as if he's gonna
clothesline<00:04:29.550> somebody<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.030> don't<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.240> you

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
clothesline somebody I don't know you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.080 
clothesline somebody I don't know you
could<00:04:30.630> do<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.780> as<00:04:30.990> well<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:32.610> big<00:04:32.760> gimmick

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
could do that as well the big gimmick

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.820 
could do that as well the big gimmick
for<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.630> toy<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.200> fact<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.410> he's<00:04:34.560> got<00:04:34.650> a

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
for this toy is the fact that he's got a

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.490 
for this toy is the fact that he's got a
poseable<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.520> suppose<00:04:36.510> it<00:04:36.720> pretty<00:04:37.260> much<00:04:37.350> is

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
poseable I suppose it pretty much is

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.840 
poseable I suppose it pretty much is
gonna<00:04:37.590> put<00:04:37.800> your<00:04:37.920> thumb<00:04:38.100> on<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.490> eye<00:04:38.520> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
gonna put your thumb on the eye and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.130 
gonna put your thumb on the eye and
rotate<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:40.740> can<00:04:40.770> rotate<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.400> eye<00:04:41.430> left<00:04:42.210> up

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
rotate it you can rotate the eye left up

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.710 
rotate it you can rotate the eye left up
down<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.880> has<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> little<00:04:45.360> bit<00:04:45.420> of<00:04:45.540> an<00:04:45.630> issue

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
down it has a little bit of an issue

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.930 
down it has a little bit of an issue
when<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.020> comes<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.740> other<00:04:46.920> section<00:04:47.730> the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
when it comes to the other section the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.659 
when it comes to the other section the
other<00:04:48.060> this<00:04:48.810> side<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.560> his<00:04:49.680> eye<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.370> side<00:04:50.550> of

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
other this side of his eye this side of

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.240 
other this side of his eye this side of
his<00:04:50.760> body<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:52.320> kind<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.590> have<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.770> do<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.979> little

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
his body you kind of have to do a little

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.119 
his body you kind of have to do a little
finagling

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
finagling

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.829 
finagling
I find<00:04:54.459> at<00:04:54.580> least<00:04:54.789> to<00:04:54.999> get<00:04:55.119> the<00:04:55.209> I<00:04:55.239> to<00:04:55.360> rotate

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:55.839 
I find at least to get the I to rotate

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.229 
I find at least to get the I to rotate
all<00:04:55.959> the<00:04:55.989> way<00:04:56.110> on<00:04:56.439> this<00:04:56.709> side<00:04:56.979> but<00:04:57.789> it<00:04:57.999> still

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.239 
all the way on this side but it still

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:00.299 
all the way on this side but it still
works<00:04:58.479> you<00:04:59.409> can<00:04:59.529> still<00:04:59.800> get<00:04:59.979> some<00:05:00.009> movement

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:00.309 
works you can still get some movement

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:02.459 
works you can still get some movement
and<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:01.149> suppose<00:05:01.509> after<00:05:01.719> a<00:05:01.929> while

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
and I suppose after a while

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.199 
and I suppose after a while
see<00:05:02.860> after<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.219> while<00:05:03.309> you<00:05:03.610> can't<00:05:03.849> see<00:05:03.969> it

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:04.209 
see after a while you can't see it

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:05.939 
see after a while you can't see it
loosens<00:05:04.659> itself<00:05:05.080> up<00:05:05.289> so<00:05:05.499> maybe<00:05:05.709> it's<00:05:05.889> just

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
loosens itself up so maybe it's just

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.129 
loosens itself up so maybe it's just
some<00:05:06.159> early<00:05:06.580> packaging<00:05:07.179> once<00:05:07.419> you<00:05:07.749> get<00:05:07.869> it<00:05:07.959> out

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
some early packaging once you get it out

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.679 
some early packaging once you get it out
of<00:05:08.289> packaging<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:09.879> know<00:05:09.969> you're<00:05:10.389> gonna<00:05:10.509> have

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
of packaging you know you're gonna have

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.459 
of packaging you know you're gonna have
to<00:05:10.809> just<00:05:10.989> play<00:05:11.169> around<00:05:11.289> with<00:05:11.469> it<00:05:11.649> a<00:05:11.709> bit<00:05:11.739> I

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
to just play around with it a bit I

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.359 
to just play around with it a bit I
don't<00:05:14.469> know<00:05:14.529> which<00:05:14.679> way<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:14.889> would<00:05:15.039> have<00:05:15.189> the<00:05:15.339> I

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:15.369 
don't know which way I would have the I

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:17.639 
don't know which way I would have the I
mean<00:05:15.729> that's<00:05:15.879> a<00:05:16.029> that's<00:05:16.269> an<00:05:16.869> odd<00:05:16.989> question<00:05:17.259> to

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:17.649 
mean that's a that's an odd question to

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.699 
mean that's a that's an odd question to
ask<00:05:17.830> myself<00:05:18.599> hmm<00:05:19.599> which<00:05:19.779> way<00:05:20.169> should<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.529> have

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:20.709 
ask myself hmm which way should I have

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.820 
ask myself hmm which way should I have
Mike's<00:05:21.039> eye<00:05:21.279> facing<00:05:21.999> I<00:05:22.229> suppose<00:05:23.229> I<00:05:23.409> what<00:05:23.800> I

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
Mike's eye facing I suppose I what I

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.070 
Mike's eye facing I suppose I what I
would<00:05:24.039> do<00:05:24.219> is<00:05:24.399> if<00:05:24.699> anyone<00:05:25.119> really<00:05:25.509> cared<00:05:25.779> is<00:05:25.959> I

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
would do is if anyone really cared is I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.299 
would do is if anyone really cared is I
probably<00:05:26.259> would<00:05:26.439> have<00:05:26.469> the<00:05:26.619> eye<00:05:26.649> this<00:05:26.800> way

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:27.309 
probably would have the eye this way

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:29.609 
probably would have the eye this way
then<00:05:28.149> if<00:05:28.539> I'm<00:05:28.689> gonna<00:05:28.779> have<00:05:29.019> him<00:05:29.229> posed

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:29.619 
then if I'm gonna have him posed

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.529 
then if I'm gonna have him posed
sideways<00:05:30.219> I<00:05:30.459> can<00:05:30.610> have<00:05:30.729> Mike<00:05:30.999> kind<00:05:31.300> of<00:05:31.389> like

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
sideways I can have Mike kind of like

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.339 
sideways I can have Mike kind of like
this<00:05:31.749> and<00:05:31.959> really<00:05:32.559> uh<00:05:32.769> what<00:05:33.339> we<00:05:33.429> could<00:05:33.580> do<00:05:34.349> we

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
this and really uh what we could do we

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.899 
this and really uh what we could do we
can<00:05:35.499> have<00:05:35.589> imposing<00:05:36.159> like<00:05:36.550> so<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:39.610> can<00:05:39.729> kind

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
can have imposing like so you can kind

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.809 
can have imposing like so you can kind
of<00:05:39.939> have<00:05:40.149> him<00:05:40.240> on<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:40.509> shelf<00:05:40.689> like<00:05:40.959> that<00:05:41.110> that

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:50.679 
attack from Saved by the Bell how's that

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:52.169 
attack from Saved by the Bell how's that
for<00:05:50.829> a<00:05:50.889> reference<00:05:51.039> how<00:05:51.759> was<00:05:51.879> that<00:05:51.999> for<00:05:52.089> a

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:52.179 
for a reference how was that for a

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.389 
for a reference how was that for a
reference<00:05:52.269> I<00:05:52.749> really<00:05:53.259> thought<00:05:53.469> they<00:05:54.219> did<00:05:54.369> a

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:54.399 
reference I really thought they did a

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:57.119 
reference I really thought they did a
great<00:05:54.459> job<00:05:54.639> on<00:05:54.999> Sully<00:05:55.739> the<00:05:56.739> super<00:05:56.949> poseable

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:57.129 
great job on Sully the super poseable

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:58.619 
great job on Sully the super poseable
arms<00:05:57.519> definitely<00:05:57.879> make<00:05:57.999> this<00:05:58.149> figure<00:05:58.449> of

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
arms definitely make this figure of

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.169 
arms definitely make this figure of
really<00:05:59.019> neat<00:05:59.229> figured<00:05:59.619> to<00:05:59.740> have<00:05:59.919> I<00:06:00.219> likes<00:06:00.939> I

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:01.179 
really neat figured to have I likes I

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.809 
really neat figured to have I likes I
like<00:06:01.449> Mike<00:06:01.719> though<00:06:01.990> I<00:06:02.229> do<00:06:02.409> like<00:06:02.740> Mike<00:06:03.039> and<00:06:03.369> as<00:06:03.759> a

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
like Mike though I do like Mike and as a

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.939 
like Mike though I do like Mike and as a
contrast<00:06:04.629> I<00:06:04.839> think<00:06:05.019> these<00:06:05.139> two<00:06:05.379> work<00:06:05.559> really

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
contrast I think these two work really

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.629 
contrast I think these two work really
really<00:06:06.099> well<00:06:06.339> on<00:06:06.759> a<00:06:06.849> shelf<00:06:08.639> problems

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
really well on a shelf problems

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.069 
really well on a shelf problems
unfortunately<00:06:10.360> with<00:06:10.449> the<00:06:10.539> figure<00:06:10.809> maybe

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:11.079 
unfortunately with the figure maybe

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.109 
unfortunately with the figure maybe
necessarily<00:06:11.649> is<00:06:11.860> that<00:06:12.039> the<00:06:12.189> arm<00:06:12.519> doesn't<00:06:12.879> go

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:13.119 
necessarily is that the arm doesn't go

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.439 
necessarily is that the arm doesn't go
there's<00:06:13.749> not<00:06:13.899> really<00:06:14.139> a<00:06:14.259> proper<00:06:15.039> way<00:06:15.309> to<00:06:15.449> put

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
there's not really a proper way to put

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.939 
there's not really a proper way to put
the<00:06:16.569> arm<00:06:16.719> down<00:06:16.959> you<00:06:17.199> kind<00:06:17.379> of<00:06:17.499> always<00:06:17.649> have<00:06:17.860> the

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
the arm down you kind of always have the

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.459 
the arm down you kind of always have the
arm<00:06:18.099> up<00:06:18.309> but<00:06:19.059> I<00:06:19.089> like<00:06:19.329> the<00:06:19.539> opposable<00:06:19.929> eye<00:06:20.169> I

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
arm up but I like the opposable eye I

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.009 
arm up but I like the opposable eye I
think<00:06:20.649> that's<00:06:20.800> a<00:06:20.860> really<00:06:21.009> neat<00:06:21.929> acessory<00:06:22.929> I

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:23.019 
think that's a really neat acessory I

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.199 
think that's a really neat acessory I
really<00:06:23.289> need<00:06:23.469> gimmick<00:06:23.889> for<00:06:24.399> the<00:06:24.610> toy<00:06:24.819> itself

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:25.209 
really need gimmick for the toy itself

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:27.480 
really need gimmick for the toy itself
