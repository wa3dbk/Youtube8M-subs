today what we are going to do is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
today what we are going to do is
substitute<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.719> poha<00:00:40.379> poha<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:42.120> you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
substitute it as poha poha is as you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.979 
substitute it as poha poha is as you
know<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.110> typical<00:00:43.430> Moroccan<00:00:44.430> dish<00:00:45.120> which<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
know a typical Moroccan dish which is

know a typical Moroccan dish which is
made<00:00:46.200> out<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> flattened<00:00:47.190> rice<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.840> base

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
made out of flattened rice so the base

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.319 
made out of flattened rice so the base
of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> recipe<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.070> pretty<00:00:50.340> much<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.789> same<00:00:50.969> so

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of the recipe is pretty much the same so

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
of the recipe is pretty much the same so
we'll<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.690> substitute<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.620> poha<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
we'll just substitute the poha for the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.299 
we'll just substitute the poha for the
cooked<00:00:54.329> quinoa<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.500> let's<00:00:55.710> take<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.160> at

cooking<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.729> quinoa<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.080> kinwa<00:01:19.439> has<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
cooking the quinoa the kinwa has a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.490 
cooking the quinoa the kinwa has a
slight<00:01:20.430> bitter<00:01:20.939> flavor<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.290> want

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
slight bitter flavor to it and you want

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
slight bitter flavor to it and you want
to<00:01:22.619> obviously<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:23.520> rid<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.090> flavor<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to obviously get rid of that flavor so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.890 
to obviously get rid of that flavor so
the<00:01:25.290> best<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.540> want<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the best way to do this is you want to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.120 
the best way to do this is you want to
just<00:01:28.140> rinse<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.549> least<00:01:29.820> once<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.920> rid

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
just rinse it at least once to get rid

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429 
just rinse it at least once to get rid
of<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.640> bitterness<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.900> gonna<00:01:34.170> add

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
of that bitterness so I'm just gonna add

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
of that bitterness so I'm just gonna add
some<00:01:34.860> water<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.030> ready

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
some water to this and this is now ready

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.730 
some water to this and this is now ready
to<00:01:39.930> cook<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.640> about<00:01:41.759> 1<00:01:42.360> cup<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.990> quinoa

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to cook so I have about 1 cup of quinoa

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.359 
to cook so I have about 1 cup of quinoa
out<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:46.140> cooks<00:01:46.350> exactly<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.100> rice

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
out here and it cooks exactly like rice

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.690 
out here and it cooks exactly like rice
so<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.970> proportion<00:01:48.509> would<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.899> say<00:01:49.200> 1<00:01:50.159> cup<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
so the proportion would be say 1 cup of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.819 
so the proportion would be say 1 cup of
quinoa<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.420> you'd<00:01:51.810> use<00:01:52.020> double<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> amount

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
quinoa and you'd use double the amount

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.649 
quinoa and you'd use double the amount
of<00:01:53.009> water<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.939> are<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> use<00:01:54.360> 2

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
of water so that we are going to use 2

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.139 
of water so that we are going to use 2
cups<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.170> water<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
cups of water for this so I'm going to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.010 
cups of water for this so I'm going to
go<00:01:57.329> ahead<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.890> add<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.850> here

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
go ahead and we just add this in here

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.370 
go ahead and we just add this in here
and<00:02:03.020> I'm<00:02:03.770> going<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.159> measure<00:02:05.259> double<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
and I'm going to measure double the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:16.900 
and I'm going to measure double the
amount<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:06.829> water<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.930> we've<00:02:15.230> put<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.550> water

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
amount of water so we've put the water

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.750 
amount of water so we've put the water
with<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.599> quinoa<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.860> want<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.400> let

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
with the quinoa and you want to just let

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.000 
with the quinoa and you want to just let
it<00:02:19.790> come<00:02:20.120> up<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.540> boil<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.620> would<00:02:21.769> want

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
it come up to a boil and you would want

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.860 
it come up to a boil and you would want
to<00:02:22.069> then<00:02:22.280> turn<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.790> flame<00:02:23.060> down<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.360> little<00:02:23.750> bit

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
to then turn the flame down a little bit

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.220 
to then turn the flame down a little bit
and<00:02:24.190> cover<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.510> would<00:02:26.780> take<00:02:26.810> at

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
and cover it and this would take at

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.830 
and cover it and this would take at
least<00:02:27.470> about<00:02:27.739> 18<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.550> 20<00:02:28.580> minutes<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.360> cook<00:02:29.540> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
least about 18 to 20 minutes to cook and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.320 
least about 18 to 20 minutes to cook and
the<00:02:30.380> check<00:02:30.739> for<00:02:31.130> doneness<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.819> basically

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the check for doneness is basically

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.870 
the check for doneness is basically
obviously<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.170> quinoa<00:02:33.410> will<00:02:34.010> be<00:02:34.190> will<00:02:34.670> look

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
obviously the quinoa will be will look

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.640 
obviously the quinoa will be will look
cooked<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.690> would<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:35.959> absorbed<00:02:36.319> all

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
cooked and it would have absorbed all

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.160 
cooked and it would have absorbed all
the<00:02:36.709> water<00:02:37.099> and<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:37.910> see<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.510> each<00:02:38.810> grain

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the water and you see that each grain

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.650 
the water and you see that each grain
will<00:02:39.440> have<00:02:39.680> like<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> small<00:02:40.370> little<00:02:40.549> white<00:02:41.030> tail

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
will have like a small little white tail

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.500 
will have like a small little white tail
that's<00:02:42.470> that's<00:02:42.799> your<00:02:42.980> best<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.549> bit<00:02:43.880> at<00:02:44.150> it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
that's that's your best a bit at it

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.140 
that's that's your best a bit at it
being<00:02:45.019> cooked<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:46.069> we<00:02:46.250> will<00:02:46.430> temper<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.940> with

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
being cooked then we will temper it with

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.570 
being cooked then we will temper it with
the<00:02:47.420> rest<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.080> spices<00:02:48.349> so<00:02:49.010> we<00:02:49.220> let<00:02:49.430> this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
the rest of the spices so we let this

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.120 
the rest of the spices so we let this
simmer<00:02:50.060> now<00:02:50.299> for<00:02:50.480> about<00:02:50.690> 20<00:02:51.019> minutes<00:02:51.200> okay<00:02:52.069> so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
simmer now for about 20 minutes okay so

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.460 
simmer now for about 20 minutes okay so
while<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.549> quinoa<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.299> cooking<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.019> think<00:02:54.079> we

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
while that quinoa is cooking I think we

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.430 
while that quinoa is cooking I think we
can<00:02:54.650> go<00:02:54.829> ahead<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.569> tempering<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.870> rest<00:02:57.230> of

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
can go ahead with tempering the rest of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.740 
can go ahead with tempering the rest of
the<00:02:57.530> spices<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.250> getting<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> base<00:02:59.239> for<00:02:59.630> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
the spices and getting the base for the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.500

just give it a nice stir and next we

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.930 
just give it a nice stir and next we
have<00:04:12.030> some<00:04:12.800> chopped<00:04:13.800> boiled<00:04:14.070> potatoes<00:04:14.700> which

have some chopped boiled potatoes which

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.940 
have some chopped boiled potatoes which
are<00:04:15.090> going<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.330> go<00:04:15.510> into<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.170> could<00:04:16.770> even

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
are going to go into this you could even

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.460 
are going to go into this you could even
use<00:04:17.310> boiled<00:04:18.090> green<00:04:18.540> peas<00:04:18.570> they<00:04:19.230> go<00:04:19.410> really

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
use boiled green peas they go really

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.750

well

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.840 
well
carrots<00:04:21.420> work<00:04:22.320> great<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:23.160> course<00:04:23.400> if<00:04:23.700> you're

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
carrots work great of course if you're

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.670 
carrots work great of course if you're
using<00:04:24.060> things<00:04:24.420> like<00:04:24.600> cauliflower<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.500> all

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
using things like cauliflower and all

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.410 
using things like cauliflower and all
then<00:04:25.890> you're<00:04:26.010> probably<00:04:26.190> turning<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.850> into<00:04:27.030> a

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
then you're probably turning it into a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.290 
then you're probably turning it into a
rice<00:04:28.200> more<00:04:28.710> than<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.040> poha<00:04:29.400> poha

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
rice more than the poha poha

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.440 
rice more than the poha poha
traditionally<00:04:30.960> has<00:04:31.200> either<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:32.450> boiled

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
traditionally has either the boiled
