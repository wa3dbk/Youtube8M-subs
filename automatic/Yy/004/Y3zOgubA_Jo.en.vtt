 ah 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.500
 pit and fissure sealants 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.260
 are a very effective measure in the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.390
 prevention of occlusal caries in effect 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.129
 are intended to fill in the points and 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.589
 Enamel cracks preventing the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.480
 colonization of bacteria due to 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.489
 high prevalence of lesions or crystals 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.680
 as flo protects primarily the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.589
 superficial as the sealers are going to 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.019
 be doubly important indication of 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.729
 the dreamers applies on teeth like 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.350
 archeology crossing susceptible to 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.600
 caries those who have their other 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.979
 deep of molars up to four 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.810
 years ago or rashes that are healthy 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.300
 with incipient caries in fistula 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.490
 limited enamel in patients who 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.009
 can be checked regularly in and 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.630
 with beaches or enamel fractures for 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.940
 the sealing of reconstruction margins 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.550
 with composite resins in first 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.770
 permanent molars from 6 to 10 years old 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.350
 the permanent molars of 11 to 15 years 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.840
 and in premolars in moderate vision 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.789
 and high risk of falling into molars 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.040
 temporary in high primary decision 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.840
 risk 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.729
 contraindications of sealants in 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.130
 molars and premolars with caries people 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.380
 next in patients with numerous 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.880
 proximal and molar crises and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.610
 premolars with clinical caries 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.640
 detectable control techniques 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.560
 application follows that male patient 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 of 9 years old that meets the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.770
 requirements for the application of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.170
 sealants of pits and fissures in 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.299
 first lower molars 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.090
 the first one is made an isolation of 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.939
 operational field there are two methods of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.310
 absolute isolated isolator with serious 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.099
 rubber dam or relative isolated with 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.750
 cotton rolls in any case this 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.280
 first step is essential for a 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.560
 correct application technique 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.710
 teacher since the field should 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.540
 stay completely dry 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.090
 given that the absolute tool 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.520
 can receive anesthesia in this case it 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.470
 uses relative isolation and is placed 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.100
 an opener so that the child does not 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.100
 interrupt the process 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.030
 step number 2 a cleaning of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.100
 the surface that the purpose uses is 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.040
 remove remains without bacterial plaque 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.660
 the surface of the molar cleaning 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.420
 It can be performed with a toothbrush 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.920
 prophylaxis works revolution in no 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.150
 case you should use pasta 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.269
 properties 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.569
 Number 3 washing and drying with syringe 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.269
 dry air before drying should be changed 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.939
 the cotton rolls number 4 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.010
 application of the top before the 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.930
 Application of the acid will proceed to the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.269
 placement of new cotton rolls 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.700
 the vestibular in case of teeth 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.310
 superiors can vestibular more equal 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.799
 lower if he has been 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.620
 used the phosphoric ortho to a 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.079
 37 percent concentration can 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.110
 used in its fusion with the gel and it 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:28.200
 leave for 20 seconds 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.870
 number 5 an acid wash is performed 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.580
 and then acceptable past the time of 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.820
 engraving is proceeded to wash 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.950
 abundantly with water spray 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.570
 applied on the surface to cross it and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.090
 ending this process will proceed 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.099
 replacement of the rolls 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.720
 be careful that there is no 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.990
 pollution greet in the client 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.600
 Record 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.240
 you must be for 30 seconds with air 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.720
 to check that the recorded area has 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.720
 acquired the color white 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.150
 number 6 application taught with all 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.050
 the strong divisions taking I believe what 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.730
 that I can catch and has taught 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.180
 help yourself to a cell 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.220
 number 7 Paul and look at this city of the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.799
 halogen light bulb for 40 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.440
 seconds the vision of the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.820
 patient and the operator with glasses 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.770
 protection or screen filter number 8 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.690
 Sealant evaluation is evaluated with 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.780
 an exploration probe and it will be checked 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.360
 that the sealant has acquired a good 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.340
 retention and that there are no areas with 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.710
 deficit of material such as wrinkles 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.310
 this will be done trying to take off the 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.860
 sealant number 9 is removed the 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.560
 isolation and occlusion checked 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.840
 with joint paper 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.700
 in case of interference remove the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.120
 material left over from round compress 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.060
 small low resolution 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.070
 Periodic evaluation in each review 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.370
 of the patient usually every six 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.350
 months or each year will have to be checked 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.280
 there was a partial or total loss of 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.280
 Applied material
