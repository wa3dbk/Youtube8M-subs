00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
and the rook is one of the most powerful

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.749 
and the rook is one of the most powerful
pieces<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.230> digital<00:00:04.470> come<00:00:04.650> across<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.580> rook

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
pieces of digital come across the rook

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.650 
pieces of digital come across the rook
is<00:00:05.879> worth<00:00:06.150> five<00:00:06.930> pause<00:00:08.300> now<00:00:09.300> let's<00:00:09.330> go<00:00:09.599> ahead

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
is worth five pause now let's go ahead

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.970 
is worth five pause now let's go ahead
and<00:00:09.840> take<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> look<00:00:10.170> at<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.590> rook<00:00:10.950> moves

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
and take a look at how the rook moves

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.640 
and take a look at how the rook moves
the<00:00:11.340> rook<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.059> move<00:00:12.380> vertically<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the rook is going to move vertically and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.939 
the rook is going to move vertically and
horizontally<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.549> many<00:00:14.969> moves<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:15.599> he<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:16.230> now

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
horizontally is many moves as he can now

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
horizontally is many moves as he can now
if<00:00:17.100> there's<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.400> piece<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.730> his<00:00:18.090> way<00:00:18.420> he's<00:00:19.230> not

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
if there's a piece in his way he's not

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.230 
if there's a piece in his way he's not
going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.859> able<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.910> let's<00:00:21.090> go

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
going to be able to do that so let's go

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.200 
going to be able to do that so let's go
ahead<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.449> put<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> piece<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.289> way<00:00:23.210> let's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
ahead and put a piece in the way let's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.279 
ahead and put a piece in the way let's
say<00:00:24.590> there's<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.980> pawn<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.820> now<00:00:27.660> instead<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
say there's a pawn here now instead of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.070 
say there's a pawn here now instead of
going<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> entire<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.240> move<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
going the entire way we can move all the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920 
going the entire way we can move all the
way<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.890> five<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> move<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> way<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
way to a five we can move all the way to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.690 
way to a five we can move all the way to
h5<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> move<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.960> d1

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
h5 we can move all the way down to d1

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.380 
h5 we can move all the way down to d1
but<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.850> can't<00:00:39.180> move<00:00:40.340> back<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.610> d8<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.239> we

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
but we can't move back to d8 like we

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.170 
but we can't move back to d8 like we
could<00:00:42.600> before<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.320> only<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:44.460> far<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> can

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
could before the only as far as we can

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.709 
could before the only as far as we can
go<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.289> capture<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.980> these<00:00:47.910> six<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.600> we

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
go we can capture on these six but we

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.750 
go we can capture on these six but we
can't<00:00:48.989> hop<00:00:49.230> over<00:00:49.559> pieces<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.340> rook<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.520> go

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
can't hop over pieces the rook can go

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.939 
can't hop over pieces the rook can go
horizontally<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.510> vertically<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.260> long<00:00:52.800> as

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
horizontally and vertically as long as

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.430 
horizontally and vertically as long as
there's<00:00:53.100> no<00:00:53.250> pieces<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:55.410> can

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there's no pieces in the way as you can

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.670 
there's no pieces in the way as you can
imagine<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.090> rook<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.410> much

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
imagine we want the rook to have as much

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.540 
imagine we want the rook to have as much
space<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.370> roam<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.850> possible<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.340> look

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
space to roam as possible so if you look

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.450 
space to roam as possible so if you look
at<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> chessboard<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.949> you<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.250> about

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
at a chessboard and you think about

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.700 
at a chessboard and you think about
what's<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> best<00:01:06.000> way<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.780> rook<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.470> act

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
what's the best way for a rook to act

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
what's the best way for a rook to act
right<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> beginning<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
right now at the beginning of a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
right now at the beginning of a
chessboard<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.560> rook<00:01:10.740> has<00:01:10.920> nowhere<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> move

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
chessboard the rook has nowhere to move

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.560 
chessboard the rook has nowhere to move
now<00:01:12.689> let's<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:13.049> ahead<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> remove<00:01:14.299> one<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.330> our

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
now let's go ahead and remove one of our

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
now let's go ahead and remove one of our
pawns<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> beginning<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> already

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
pawns at the beginning you can already

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.960 
pawns at the beginning you can already
tell<00:01:18.270> right<00:01:18.840> away<00:01:18.869> our<00:01:19.470> rook<00:01:19.799> has<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.729> more

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
tell right away our rook has a lot more

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.960 
tell right away our rook has a lot more
room<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.689> move<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.710> says<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
room to move in there says now this is

not to say that you should start your

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
not to say that you should start your
chess<00:01:25.830> games<00:01:26.100> without<00:01:26.369> pawns<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.090> never<00:01:27.390> want

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
chess games without pawns you never want

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.120 
chess games without pawns you never want
to<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.750> down<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> material<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> can't

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
to be down a material if you can't

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.670 
to be down a material if you can't
avoid<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:31.000> but<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.110> say<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.530> the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.059 
here castling looks like this you can
see<00:02:28.480> right<00:02:28.630> now<00:02:28.690> our<00:02:28.989> King<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.349> kind<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.650> out<00:02:29.829> in

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.340 
move your king over twice and your rook
hops<00:02:37.000> over<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.450> that's<00:02:37.569> one<00:02:37.900> move<00:02:38.109> right

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
hops over and that's one move right

rook<00:02:43.450> hops<00:02:43.690> over<00:02:43.980> some<00:02:44.980> people<00:02:45.310> get<00:02:45.489> confused

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
rook hops over some people get confused

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.699 
rook hops over some people get confused
and<00:02:46.150> try<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.359> move<00:02:46.600> their<00:02:46.780> King<00:02:47.049> over<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.500> be

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
one which is three moves that's an

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.890 
one which is three moves that's an
illegal<00:02:50.200> move<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:51.130> two<00:02:51.519> spaces<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.750> each

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
illegal move it's two spaces to each

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.099 
illegal move it's two spaces to each
side<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.799> either<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.190> g1<00:02:54.760> or<00:02:54.970> 2<00:02:55.630> c1

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
side so either it's g1 or 2 c1

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.559 
side so either it's g1 or 2 c1
it's<00:02:57.069> called<00:02:57.220> King<00:02:57.549> side<00:02:57.790> or<00:02:58.060> Queens<00:02:58.359> outer

short<00:02:59.019> side<00:02:59.260> or<00:02:59.560> long<00:02:59.799> side<00:03:00.100> however<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.730> hear

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
short side or long side however you hear

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.789 
short side or long side however you hear
that's<00:03:01.359> what<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.200> castling

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
that's what it is it's castling

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.800 
that's what it is it's castling
now<00:03:03.100> there's<00:03:03.340> four<00:03:03.400> rules<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.359> you<00:03:04.480> have<00:03:04.660> to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
now there's four rules that you have to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.440 
now there's four rules that you have to
keep<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.139> mind<00:03:05.459> when<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.489> comes<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.970> castling

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
keep in mind when it comes to castling

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.369 
keep in mind when it comes to castling
the<00:03:07.870> first<00:03:08.139> one<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.590> none<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.519> pieces

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
the first one is none of the pieces

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.470 
the first one is none of the pieces
can<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.250> moved<00:03:12.519> before<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.060> if<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.209> look<00:03:13.390> at

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
can have moved before so if you look at

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.929 
can have moved before so if you look at
this<00:03:13.599> position<00:03:13.810> right<00:03:14.170> here<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.400> rooks<00:03:15.700> have

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
this position right here the rooks have

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.550 
this position right here the rooks have
obviously<00:03:16.359> moved<00:03:16.629> since<00:03:16.930> they<00:03:17.079> started<00:03:17.290> mhm

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
obviously moved since they started mhm

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.990 
obviously moved since they started mhm
one<00:03:17.769> day<00:03:17.950> one<00:03:18.159> they've<00:03:18.340> already<00:03:18.489> moved<00:03:18.760> so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
one day one they've already moved so

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.670 
one day one they've already moved so
there's<00:03:19.180> no<00:03:19.420> castling<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.109> this<00:03:20.230> position

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
there's no castling in this position

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.610 
there's no castling in this position
even<00:03:21.129> if<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.609> rooks<00:03:21.819> move<00:03:22.120> back<00:03:22.329> to<00:03:22.480> h1<00:03:22.930> you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
even if the rooks move back to h1 you

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.410 
even if the rooks move back to h1 you
can't<00:03:23.920> Castle<00:03:24.400> because<00:03:25.090> they've<00:03:25.269> already

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
can't Castle because they've already

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.380 
can't Castle because they've already
moved<00:03:25.750> as<00:03:25.900> well<00:03:26.799> as<00:03:27.010> if<00:03:27.159> your<00:03:27.310> King<00:03:27.579> moves<00:03:27.849> you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
moved as well as if your King moves you

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.869 
moved as well as if your King moves you
can<00:03:28.569> no<00:03:28.750> longer<00:03:28.989> Castle<00:03:29.650> another<00:03:30.519> thing<00:03:30.760> you

can no longer Castle another thing you

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
because there's a piece in the way so

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.659 
because there's a piece in the way so
that's<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.109> second<00:03:56.530> one<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.769> third<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
that's the second one the third that the

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.369 
that's the second one the third that the
third<00:03:57.939> one<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.450> want<00:03:58.629> to<00:03:58.689> look<00:03:58.780> at<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.169> if

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
third one that you want to look at is if

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.890 
third one that you want to look at is if
you're<00:03:59.709> in<00:03:59.919> check<00:04:00.389> let's<00:04:01.389> take<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.569> look<00:04:01.810> at

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
you're in check let's take a look at

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.270 
you're in check let's take a look at
this<00:04:01.989> position<00:04:02.470> in<00:04:02.590> casting<00:04:02.950> let's<00:04:03.159> say

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
this position in casting let's say

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.210 
this position in casting let's say
Bishop<00:04:03.760> moves<00:04:04.120> Bishop<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.200> b4<00:04:05.680> now<00:04:05.889> we're<00:04:06.099> in

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
Bishop moves Bishop to b4 now we're in

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.710 
Bishop moves Bishop to b4 now we're in
check<00:04:06.489> now<00:04:06.669> we<00:04:06.790> would<00:04:06.939> like<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.150> Castle

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
check now we would like to Castle

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.750 
check now we would like to Castle
queenside<00:04:08.129> obviously<00:04:09.129> we<00:04:09.220> can't<00:04:09.400> Castle

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
queenside obviously we can't Castle

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.179 
queenside obviously we can't Castle
kingside<00:04:10.030> because<00:04:10.659> our<00:04:10.900> Knights<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.069> way

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
kingside because our Knights in the way

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.860 
kingside because our Knights in the way
but<00:04:12.669> let's<00:04:12.790> say<00:04:12.909> we<00:04:13.030> want<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.269> Castle<00:04:13.689> queenside

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
but let's say we want a Castle queenside

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.580 
but let's say we want a Castle queenside
that<00:04:14.739> would<00:04:14.889> be<00:04:15.069> awesome<00:04:15.849> because<00:04:16.000> we<00:04:16.329> can<00:04:16.590> one

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
that would be awesome because we can one

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.319 
that would be awesome because we can one
get<00:04:17.829> our<00:04:17.949> rook<00:04:18.130> into<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.489> game<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:18.849> to<00:04:19.030> put

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
get our rook into the game and to put

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.170 
get our rook into the game and to put
our<00:04:19.359> king<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.019> safety<00:04:20.769> but<00:04:21.220> we<00:04:21.370> can't<00:04:21.699> castle

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
our king and safety but we can't castle

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.909 
our king and safety but we can't castle
because<00:04:22.389> we're<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.720> check<00:04:23.020> this<00:04:23.409> is<00:04:23.620> another

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
because we're in check this is another

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.629 
because we're in check this is another
thing<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.310> want<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.610> think<00:04:24.789> about<00:04:24.880> in<00:04:25.289> chess

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
thing you want to think about in chess

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.730 
thing you want to think about in chess
now<00:04:27.639> what<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.479> do<00:04:28.659> is<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.050> can<00:04:29.199> play<00:04:29.440> let's

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
now what we can do is we can play let's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.100 
now what we can do is we can play let's
say<00:04:29.889> c3<00:04:30.639> and<00:04:30.849> then<00:04:30.940> when<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.539> bishop<00:04:31.960> moves

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
say c3 and then when the bishop moves

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.409 
say c3 and then when the bishop moves
now<00:04:32.530> we're<00:04:32.740> no<00:04:32.830> longer<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.250> check<00:04:33.550> now<00:04:34.000> we<00:04:34.060> can

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
now we're no longer in check now we can

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.420 
now we're no longer in check now we can
Castle<00:04:34.810> queenside<00:04:34.930> this<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.949> something<00:04:36.340> to

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
Castle queenside this is something to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.339 
Castle queenside this is something to
think<00:04:36.490> about<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.840> last<00:04:37.870> and

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
think about and the last and

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.929 
think about and the last and
the<00:04:39.499> fourth<00:04:39.830> thing<00:04:40.129> to<00:04:40.399> think<00:04:40.610> about<00:04:40.669> when

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
the fourth thing to think about when

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.939 
the fourth thing to think about when
castling<00:04:41.479> is<00:04:42.309> let's<00:04:43.309> say<00:04:43.520> instead<00:04:43.789> of<00:04:44.949> putting

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
castling is let's say instead of putting

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.489 
castling is let's say instead of putting
us<00:04:46.129> in<00:04:46.279> check<00:04:46.580> he<00:04:46.969> plays<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.240> move<00:04:47.569> like<00:04:47.960> Bishop

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:48.499 
us in check he plays a move like Bishop

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.540 
us in check he plays a move like Bishop
to<00:04:48.830> g4<00:04:49.759> now<00:04:50.689> he's<00:04:50.960> not<00:04:51.139> attacking<00:04:51.740> our<00:04:52.249> king

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
to g4 now he's not attacking our king

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.760 
to g4 now he's not attacking our king
and<00:04:52.759> if<00:04:53.270> we<00:04:53.479> Castle<00:04:54.050> we're<00:04:54.169> gonna<00:04:54.289> end<00:04:54.469> up<00:04:54.559> on

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
and if we Castle we're gonna end up on

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.519 
and if we Castle we're gonna end up on
c1<00:04:55.369> but<00:04:55.999> our<00:04:56.119> king<00:04:56.419> is<00:04:56.569> going<00:04:56.749> to<00:04:56.990> move<00:04:57.229> through

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
c1 but our king is going to move through

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.790 
c1 but our king is going to move through
the<00:04:58.129> d1<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.999> since<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.719> d1<00:05:00.110> squares<00:05:00.499> in<00:05:00.680> our

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
the d1 and since the d1 squares in our

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.389 
the d1 and since the d1 squares in our
attack<00:05:01.300> we<00:05:02.300> cannot<00:05:02.779> castle<00:05:03.319> now<00:05:03.919> what<00:05:04.099> we<00:05:04.249> can

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:04.399 
attack we cannot castle now what we can

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:06.249 
attack we cannot castle now what we can
do<00:05:04.520> here<00:05:04.849> kind<00:05:05.149> of<00:05:05.210> like<00:05:05.330> before<00:05:05.689> is<00:05:05.869> we<00:05:06.020> can

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
do here kind of like before is we can

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.999 
do here kind of like before is we can
block<00:05:07.129> that<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.729> once<00:05:08.419> he<00:05:08.569> moves<00:05:08.930> now<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:09.409> d<00:05:09.800> 1

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
block that and once he moves now the d 1

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.159 
block that and once he moves now the d 1
square<00:05:10.279> is<00:05:10.399> no<00:05:10.520> longer<00:05:10.759> under<00:05:11.180> attack<00:05:11.659> and<00:05:11.869> now

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
square is no longer under attack and now

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.089 
square is no longer under attack and now
we<00:05:12.229> can<00:05:12.589> castle<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.669> if<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:13.939> square<00:05:14.919> we<00:05:15.919> don't

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
we can castle but if the square we don't

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.119 
we can castle but if the square we don't
even<00:05:16.249> have<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.669> be<00:05:16.909> in<00:05:17.059> check<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.659> it<00:05:18.439> we<00:05:18.949> don't

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
even have to be in check and it we don't

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.679 
even have to be in check and it we don't
even<00:05:19.279> have<00:05:19.459> to<00:05:19.610> end<00:05:19.789> up<00:05:19.939> on<00:05:20.119> the<00:05:20.240> square<00:05:20.479> that's

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
even have to end up on the square that's

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:22.989 
even have to end up on the square that's
under<00:05:20.930> attack<00:05:21.050> if<00:05:21.499> the<00:05:22.069> square<00:05:22.399> that<00:05:22.669> we<00:05:22.789> go

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:22.999 
under attack if the square that we go

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:24.699 
under attack if the square that we go
through<00:05:23.449> is<00:05:23.779> under<00:05:24.080> attack

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:24.709 
through is under attack

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:27.129 
through is under attack
we<00:05:25.399> can't<00:05:25.639> castle<00:05:26.089> so<00:05:26.629> those<00:05:26.779> are<00:05:26.930> just<00:05:26.990> some

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
we can't castle so those are just some

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.359 
we can't castle so those are just some
of<00:05:27.259> the<00:05:27.379> things<00:05:27.649> that<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:27.919> want<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.159> think

of the things that you want to think

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.189 
of the things that you want to think
about<00:05:28.459> with<00:05:28.759> your<00:05:28.789> rook<00:05:29.209> 1<00:05:29.839> they're<00:05:30.050> very

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.439 
about with your rook 1 they're very

that<00:05:35.599> they<00:05:35.749> can<00:05:35.930> move<00:05:36.080> if<00:05:36.319> they're<00:05:36.469> always

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:36.709 
that they can move if they're always

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:39.459 
that they can move if they're always
trapped<00:05:36.949> behind<00:05:37.279> your<00:05:37.430> pieces<00:05:38.229> it's<00:05:39.229> really

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
trapped behind your pieces it's really

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.679 
trapped behind your pieces it's really
not<00:05:39.589> going<00:05:39.709> to<00:05:39.770> be<00:05:40.009> as<00:05:40.249> valuable<00:05:40.939> because<00:05:41.539> they

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:41.689 
not going to be as valuable because they

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.689 
not going to be as valuable because they
can't<00:05:41.899> move<00:05:42.020> around<00:05:42.349> and<00:05:42.709> although<00:05:43.189> they<00:05:43.580> are

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
can't move around and although they are

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.850 
can't move around and although they are
worth<00:05:43.909> 5<00:05:44.149> points<00:05:44.180> if<00:05:44.779> they're<00:05:45.169> always<00:05:45.349> blocked

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
worth 5 points if they're always blocked

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.649 
worth 5 points if they're always blocked
you're<00:05:46.430> not<00:05:46.580> going<00:05:46.729> to<00:05:46.789> get<00:05:46.909> any<00:05:47.089> benefit<00:05:47.569> out

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
you're not going to get any benefit out

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.659 
you're not going to get any benefit out
of<00:05:47.719> it<00:05:47.899> so<00:05:48.159> hopefully<00:05:49.159> you<00:05:49.249> learned<00:05:49.430> a<00:05:49.519> lot
