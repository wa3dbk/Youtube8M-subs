my pond this is out of a hand-dug
hand-dug<00:00:41.010> well<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.750> recovery<00:00:42.989> rate<00:00:43.320> was

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
hand-dug well and the recovery rate was

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.210 
hand-dug well and the recovery rate was
a<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:45.480> bit<00:00:45.570> lower<00:00:45.780> than<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:46.170> pump<00:00:46.380> the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
a little bit lower than the pump the

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.220 
a little bit lower than the pump the
pump<00:00:47.490> it<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:47.760> pump<00:00:48.060> it<00:00:48.240> and<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> installed

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
pump it out pump it and so I installed

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.010 
pump it out pump it and so I installed
this<00:00:52.230> timer<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:53.280> line<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:54.240> it<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.630> just

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
this timer in line with it this is just

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.370 
this timer in line with it this is just
a<00:00:55.140> pill<00:00:55.410> tech<00:00:55.680> very<00:00:56.400> simple<00:00:56.760> timer<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
a pill tech very simple timer and the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.350 
a pill tech very simple timer and the
pump<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.740> go<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.070> I've<00:00:59.250> got<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.550> pumping<00:01:00.180> for

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
pump will go off I've got it pumping for

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.250 
pump will go off I've got it pumping for
five<00:01:00.600> minutes

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
five minutes

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
five minutes
off<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.450> it'll<00:01:03.630> come<00:01:03.870> back

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
off for one and then it'll come back

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.060 
off for one and then it'll come back
that<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.430> keeps<00:01:05.579> doing<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> cycle<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.070> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that just keeps doing that cycle so I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.069 
that just keeps doing that cycle so I
run<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> lot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.939> people<00:01:09.329> that<00:01:09.509> have<00:01:09.780> low

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
run into a lot of people that have low

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.289 
run into a lot of people that have low
producing<00:01:10.590> wells<00:01:10.829> and<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.850> run<00:01:12.030> through<00:01:12.180> all

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
producing wells and they run through all

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
producing wells and they run through all
these<00:01:12.450> different<00:01:12.869> hoops<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.649> trying<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
these different hoops and trying to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.319 
these different hoops and trying to
figure<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> do

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
figure out what to do

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.480 
figure out what to do
some<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.380> spend<00:01:16.649> a<00:01:16.740> lot<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> extra<00:01:17.250> money

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
some of them spend a lot of extra money

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
some of them spend a lot of extra money
and<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.000> another<00:01:18.240> well<00:01:18.510> drilled<00:01:18.930> which<00:01:19.440> can

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and have another well drilled which can

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.250 
and have another well drilled which can
cost<00:01:19.860> tremendous<00:01:20.760> amount<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> money<00:01:21.260> so

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
cost tremendous amount of money so

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.760 
cost tremendous amount of money so
something<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.950> simple<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.550> timer<00:01:24.770> or

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
it's and quiet now the pump is shut off

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.660 
it's and quiet now the pump is shut off
and<00:01:50.360> we'll<00:01:50.930> stay<00:01:51.170> off<00:01:51.200> for<00:01:52.070> about<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.430> minute

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
and we'll stay off for about a minute

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.999 
and we'll stay off for about a minute
and<00:01:52.939> then<00:01:53.030> it'll<00:01:53.329> come<00:01:53.509> back<00:01:53.570> on<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.409> then

and then it'll come back on so then
these<00:01:55.250> are<00:01:55.610> time<00:01:56.060> settings<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.049> don't<00:01:57.170> know<00:01:57.229> if

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
these are time settings I don't know if

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.389 
these are time settings I don't know if
you<00:01:57.350> can<00:01:57.409> see<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.829> this<00:01:57.920> video<00:01:58.070> I'm<00:01:58.280> just

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
you can see it on this video I'm just

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.520 
you can see it on this video I'm just
taking<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.640> with<00:01:58.729> my<00:01:58.850> phone<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.479> you're<00:02:00.439> able

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530

taking it with my phone and you're able
to<00:02:00.740> basically<00:02:01.280> dial<00:02:01.820> your<00:02:02.090> well<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.869> it's

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
to basically dial your well and it's

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.080 
to basically dial your well and it's
recovery<00:02:03.890> rate<00:02:04.069> into<00:02:04.429> whatever<00:02:04.909> you're

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
recovery rate into whatever you're

recovery rate into whatever you're
pumping<00:02:05.450> out<00:02:05.569> of<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.049> have<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.939> you

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
pumping out of it so you have a you

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.669 
pumping out of it so you have a you
don't<00:02:08.119> have<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:09.080> have<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.289> worry<00:02:09.440> about<00:02:09.470> your

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
don't have you have to worry about your

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.240 
don't have you have to worry about your
pump<00:02:10.039> burning<00:02:10.670> out<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.810> just<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:13.010> pump

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
pump burning out and you just you pump

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.750 
pump burning out and you just you pump
what's<00:02:13.459> there<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.170> not<00:02:15.170> pump<00:02:15.470> air<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.580> let<00:02:16.700> me

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
what's there and not pump air so let me

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.039 
what's there and not pump air so let me
show<00:02:16.879> you<00:02:16.910> another<00:02:17.030> one<00:02:17.269> okay<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.690> want<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.959> show

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
show you another one okay I want to show

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.140 
show you another one okay I want to show
you<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:18.410> my<00:02:18.590> external<00:02:19.400> controller<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.000> my

you on my external controller for my

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.110 
you on my external controller for my
deep<00:02:20.540> well<00:02:20.750> pump<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.799> have<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.580> speed<00:02:23.090> control

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
deep well pump I have a speed control

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.110 
deep well pump I have a speed control
knob<00:02:23.989> right<00:02:24.200> here<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.310> can<00:02:25.519> adjust<00:02:25.819> down

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
knob right here that I can adjust down

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.509 
knob right here that I can adjust down
I'm<00:02:26.900> not<00:02:27.110> fully<00:02:27.530> pumping<00:02:28.040> here<00:02:28.190> but<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.400> can

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
I'm not fully pumping here but you can

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.979 
I'm not fully pumping here but you can
see<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> water<00:02:28.940> coming<00:02:29.239> out<00:02:29.269> there<00:02:29.480> I'm

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
see the water coming out there I'm

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.900 
see the water coming out there I'm
adjusting<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.530> speed<00:02:30.739> control<00:02:31.190> running<00:02:31.760> this

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
adjusting the speed control running this

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.720 
adjusting the speed control running this
thing<00:02:32.120> down<00:02:32.349> downing<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.310> barely

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
thing down downing it in so it's barely

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.729 
thing down downing it in so it's barely
pumping<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.599> trickling<00:02:36.019> now<00:02:36.170> shut<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.590> off

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
pumping just trickling now shut it off

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.289 
pumping just trickling now shut it off
actually<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:37.790> I'm<00:02:37.880> going<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.060> turn<00:02:38.180> it

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
actually and then I'm going to turn it

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.400 
actually and then I'm going to turn it
back<00:02:38.390> up<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.790> I'm<00:02:41.180> back<00:02:41.390> up<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.690> pumping<00:02:42.079> full

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
back up and I'm back up to pumping full

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.580 
back up and I'm back up to pumping full
speed<00:02:42.799> so<00:02:43.579> what<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.630> does<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.349> allows<00:02:45.380> me

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
speed so what that does is it allows me

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.350 
speed so what that does is it allows me
to<00:02:45.829> fine-tune<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.620> pump<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.099> your<00:02:49.190> well<00:02:49.459> also

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
to fine-tune the pump to your well also

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.150 
to fine-tune the pump to your well also
has<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> timer<00:02:50.780> button<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.500> combination

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
has a timer button so in a combination

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.319 
has a timer button so in a combination
of<00:02:52.220> timers<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.819> speed<00:02:53.090> controls<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:54.650> can

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
of timers and speed controls I can

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.440 
of timers and speed controls I can
basically<00:02:56.329> dial<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.590> solar<00:02:58.370> water<00:02:58.579> pump<00:02:58.730> into

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
basically dial a solar water pump into

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.360 
basically dial a solar water pump into
what<00:02:59.660> your<00:02:59.810> well<00:03:00.019> actually<00:03:00.260> produces<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
what your well actually produces and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.910 
what your well actually produces and
that<00:03:02.209> can<00:03:02.359> help<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.079> many<00:03:03.109> ways<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.739> save

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
that can help you in many ways to save

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.390 
that can help you in many ways to save
you<00:03:04.040> from<00:03:04.130> drilling<00:03:04.430> another<00:03:04.639> well<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:06.400> using

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
you from drilling another well and using

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.949 
you from drilling another well and using
the<00:03:07.489> concept<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.000> pumping<00:03:08.359> slow<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.720> steady

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
the concept of pumping slow and steady

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.960 
the concept of pumping slow and steady
all<00:03:09.170> day<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:10.130> can<00:03:10.280> get<00:03:10.400> ahead<00:03:10.579> of<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:10.790> game

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
all day you can get ahead of the game

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.930 
all day you can get ahead of the game
through<00:03:11.389> storage<00:03:12.139> and<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.670> want<00:03:13.880> to

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
through storage and so just want to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.030 
through storage and so just want to
share<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.180> little<00:03:14.299> video<00:03:14.600> on<00:03:14.660> timers<00:03:15.410> speed

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
share this little video on timers speed

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.509 
share this little video on timers speed
controls<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:17.709> saving<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.859> hopefully<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.400> lot

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
controls and saving you hopefully a lot

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.400 
controls and saving you hopefully a lot
of<00:03:19.579> money<00:03:19.819> from<00:03:20.120> drilling<00:03:20.569> another<00:03:20.840> well<00:03:21.019> if

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
of money from drilling another well if

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.470 
of money from drilling another well if
you<00:03:21.560> really<00:03:21.799> don't<00:03:21.980> have<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.489> run<00:03:23.209> into<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.420> lot

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
you really don't have to run into a lot

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.390 
you really don't have to run into a lot
of<00:03:23.660> people<00:03:23.989> that<00:03:24.139> have<00:03:24.290> wells<00:03:24.889> that<00:03:25.160> they<00:03:25.250> just

of people that have wells that they just
can't<00:03:25.760> because<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.720> was<00:03:26.840> only<00:03:26.959> producing<00:03:27.560> one
