won the individual and a in a medal at
the<00:01:22.380> Olympics<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:22.950> even<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.280> world

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the Olympics or even the world

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.850 
the Olympics or even the world
championship<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.080> definitely<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.439> motivation

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
championship so definitely my motivation

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.140 
championship so definitely my motivation
to<00:01:25.950> continue<00:01:26.040> swimming<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> individual

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
to continue swimming was the individual

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.539 
to continue swimming was the individual
race<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.659> i<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.200> relay<00:01:28.710> definitely

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
race but i think that relay definitely

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.600 
race but i think that relay definitely
