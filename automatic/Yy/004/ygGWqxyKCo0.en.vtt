00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
guides to line it up we can assume it

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.850 
guides to line it up we can assume it
will<00:02:03.630> stitch<00:02:03.959> it<00:02:04.080> together<00:02:06.319> and<00:02:07.319> there<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:07.830> go

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
will stitch it together and there you go

will stitch it together and there you go
it's<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.519> whole<00:02:08.610> image<00:02:08.759> together<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
it's just the whole image together and

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's just the whole image together and
we<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> panorama<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.590> pretty<00:02:10.799> neat

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050
