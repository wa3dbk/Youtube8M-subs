00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.010

 I'll show you first 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.500
 Favorite sports and I totally drive 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.329
 like to bike in the summer mainly because 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.579
 I too in a very rural area 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.649
 live and there is easy because 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.780
 to take the bike more often and what I 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.300
 In the past, for example, I always liked to do it 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.759
 is just great with the bike 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.979
 to drive to buy something to drink 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.110
 and maybe this was a magazine 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.660
 then always have the bravo and have 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.130
 I read somewhere in the field and stuff 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.830
 Do you have such a goal where to go? 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.539
 can and that is really fun and as 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.459
 I have read this bravo I have 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.880
 I realized that there was so much there 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.020
 is somehow did not know it 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.539
 Here you can see my outfit again 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.610
 Wearing a great pant from adidas 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.259
 a pot of karl marx and my shoes 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.929
 are completely normal chucks of converse 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.220
 I also try the things in 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.569
 to link the infobox 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.500
 then you can take a closer look 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.610
 and next comes now 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.380
 inline skating that i love too 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.440
 Everything and for that I like to wear 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.289
 this top from monti and this one for the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.509
 twenty one shorts and I know that 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.209
 do not wear any protection that really does me 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.250
 I've been in it for twelve years 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.840
 yours that's my excuse but so 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.940
 if not so well 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.970
 request please protectors because I can 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.920
 dangerous ends and that is real 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.989
 a great sport in the weather and 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.619
 I love jogging in the summer too 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.569
 go 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.450
 Usually these pants are enough 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.360
 adidas and tshirt by betrayal of thurn 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.410
 and taxis or sneakers sneakers 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.030
 actually lee 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.190
 if the a bit more convenient to 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.010
 are running and if you still music in 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.020
 euro plugged in then it makes me total 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.910
 have fun and there is nothing better 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.130
 in great weather now I show you 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.570
 a few more of my favorite exercise and 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.330
 I hope you might get a few 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.970
 imitate the first exercise called 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.400
 Hampelmann kick and is also real 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.470
 just has to be a jig 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.170
 make and click so I'll show you 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.480
 So that was a joke so it looks like then 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.310
 and then kick and then it does 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.070
 Just so you did 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.380
 Hampelmann and hampelmann and keeps 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.970
 kick and that makes you about 60 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.040
 for a second and that's real 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.780
 exhausting the next exercise is too 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.760
 a cardio exercises I would times 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.000
 knee-high because they just call it 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.310
 your knees alternately take high-need 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.920
 and if that's the case for 60 seconds 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.630
 then it is really relative 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.850
 exhausting and very much on the 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.730
 condition but that's just great 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.980
 I can give you cardio exercise and country biscuit 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.020
 Also highly recommend is not at all 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.840
 as hard as it looks like you have to 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.270
 just your front thighs 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.300
 Angled at 90 degrees and then with the 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.850
 kick another leg and repeat that 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.430
 You then also several times best so 20 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.810
 about every page and then 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.300
 can you do great with your legs 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.160
 work out 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.650
 I have the next exercise plane 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.990
 called and from blanc there for free 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.970
 you just have to go to your knees 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.190
 while the other leg just after 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.350
 outstretched and you can 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.690
 to do that almost like a squat or 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.360
 then you try at some point the poor 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.790
 and legs just stretch out and then 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.440
 how to make such a downright and that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.050
 can you then on both sides 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.590
 make the best of each 15 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.300
 repetitions and yes that really works 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.650
 the legs and is also a great exercise 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.650
 for the balance easy 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.650
 the next exercise is really cool too 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.479
 means that the lift is great for 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.519
 your abdominal muscles and you just have to 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.010
 just move your legs up and down 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.650
 while the rest of her body is still 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.199
 it's almost like or you do this exercise 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.660
 where he just in the push-up 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.520
 then go to your elbows 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.710
 puts that could be quite good here 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.500
 and then you just go back 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.889
 up from this position and then go 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.870
 back down and that 's great for yours 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.930
 abdominal muscles and I strain you can 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.449
 in between times just in the 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.530
 Go opposition is also very cool and 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.479
 then carry on again 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.120
 and now we are doing so weird 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.430
 sit-ups you just see their touches 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.250
 with the right evening of the left leg and 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.680
 with the name of the right leg or with 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.900
 The elbow and you can then 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.539
 also make it longer and yours 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.690
 Belly muscles will eventually become very much 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.550
 hurt and these are my favorites 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.280
 Exercise you can then easily in 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.630
 finish the child pose and you can me 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.180
 like to write in the comments 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.580
 what your favorite exercise of these is 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.690
 and what you do so much sport and 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.460

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.820
 comments on such fitness videos 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.169
 maybe more often I want to see what I do 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.419

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.220
 that you liked it you can do me 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.740
 like to write in the comments if the 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.690
 more often want to see something like that and otherwise 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.979
 can you also rate that if 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.570
 you want and I wish you then still 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.690
 a great day there hopefully 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.010
 she is just as sunny here and then 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.270
 that must be in my next video 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.270
