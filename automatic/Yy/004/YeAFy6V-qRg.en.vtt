a<00:01:32.250> battery<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.759> remember<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.780> are

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a battery in it remember that so we are

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
a battery in it remember that so we are
talking<00:01:34.350> about<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.829> little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> weight

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
talking about a little bit of weight

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
talking about a little bit of weight
here<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.570> expected<00:01:36.829> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
here but that's to be expected the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
here but that's to be expected the
inside<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.610> lined<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.600> rubberized

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
inside is lined with this rubberized

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.770 
inside is lined with this rubberized
material<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.520> while<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.240> snap-on

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
material so that while it is a snap-on

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.030 
material so that while it is a snap-on
back<00:01:43.020> shell<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> give<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
back shell and it's going to give you a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
back shell and it's going to give you a
moderate<00:01:45.000> level<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.420> protection<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.259> drops

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
moderate level of protection if it drops

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730 
moderate level of protection if it drops
that's<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> impact<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.840> say<00:01:49.350> reduce

that's going to impact or I say reduce

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
that's going to impact or I say reduce
the<00:01:50.070> impact<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.700> those<00:01:51.149> drops<00:01:51.570> let<00:01:51.810> me<00:01:51.840> go

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

and finger prints because you're

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.440 
and finger prints because you're
probably<00:03:04.500> not<00:03:04.709> going<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.910> impact

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
probably not going to have that impact

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.360 
probably not going to have that impact
to<00:03:06.780> your<00:03:07.020> flash<00:03:07.410> would<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.100> been<00:03:08.190> nice<00:03:08.340> to
