get out of there with two of my lane so
already<00:03:25.600> they<00:03:25.810> got<00:03:25.960> their<00:03:26.110> money's<00:03:26.410> worth

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
already they got their money's worth

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.860 
already they got their money's worth
they<00:03:27.100> killed<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.460> 50<00:03:27.820> mineral<00:03:28.150> drone<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.660> that

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
they killed a 50 mineral drone and that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.510 
they killed a 50 mineral drone and that
drone<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.200> no<00:03:29.350> longer<00:03:29.530> mining<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.130> got<00:03:30.400> the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
drone is no longer mining so I got the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.390 
drone is no longer mining so I got the
better<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:31.440> if<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:32.620> look<00:03:32.770> at<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> income

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
better of that if we look at the income

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.180 
better of that if we look at the income
I<00:03:33.550> am<00:03:33.670> one<00:03:33.880> harvester<00:03:34.390> ahead<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.990> hooray<00:03:35.740> for

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
I am one harvester ahead so hooray for

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.940 
I am one harvester ahead so hooray for
me<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.520> once<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.180> got<00:03:37.330> my<00:03:37.540> link<00:03:37.840> speed<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.410> my

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
me and once I got my link speed and my

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.160 
me and once I got my link speed and my
melee<00:03:39.640> attack<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.330> pulled<00:03:40.570> everything<00:03:40.900> off

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
melee attack I pulled everything off

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.870 
melee attack I pulled everything off
gasps<00:03:41.500> I'm<00:03:41.770> gonna<00:03:41.920> be<00:03:42.010> focusing<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.610> mass

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
gasps I'm gonna be focusing on mass

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.120 
gasps I'm gonna be focusing on mass
lings<00:03:43.210> but<00:03:43.960> you'll<00:03:44.110> see<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.620> game<00:03:44.890> is<00:03:45.100> a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
lings but you'll see that this game is a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.610 
lings but you'll see that this game is a
bit<00:03:45.370> longer<00:03:45.640> 21<00:03:46.240> minutes<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.660> 50<00:03:46.930> seconds<00:03:47.320> so

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
bit longer 21 minutes and 50 seconds so

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.280 
bit longer 21 minutes and 50 seconds so
my<00:03:48.400> math<00:03:48.580> legs<00:03:48.910> might<00:03:49.270> not<00:03:49.450> carry<00:03:49.750> me<00:03:49.960> all<00:03:50.140> the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
my math legs might not carry me all the

my math legs might not carry me all the

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
expansion know so i might have this up

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.980 
expansion know so i might have this up
on<00:04:45.729> him<00:04:45.849> if<00:04:45.969> i'm<00:04:46.150> able<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.419> get<00:04:46.629> it<00:04:46.719> up<00:04:46.810> and

blocking this off pretty well with a
couple<00:05:02.169> of<00:05:02.199> roaches<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:02.650> i<00:05:02.680> don't<00:05:02.860> think<00:05:03.009> it

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
couple of roaches so i don't think it
