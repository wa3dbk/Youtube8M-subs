00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:11.070
 on air the most reactive among rocket 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.110
 and the most rocket among jet 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.670
 Gover program program which 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.010
 called experiments dear friends 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.859
 just admiring the flying ball 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.410
 Our Kulibin Alexey Ivanchenko became 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 dream of glory and the great queen and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 came up with his rocket launcher as she 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.610
 actually it works very much 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.309
 just on the same principle as only 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 that a melted ball but it was a little 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.510
 Alexey improved to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 create this masterpiece ravaged several 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.760
 private plots taking from there here 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.360
 this is a castle familiar to all gardeners 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.640
 for watering 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.989
 actually this is a bottle of one 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.960
 hand he has a lock 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.300
 court connects and here ordinary 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.210
 the pump from the bike is the most important thing 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 This system has a launcher 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.060
 the wireless will almost prove 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.470
 wireless control and so 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.310
 ordinary bicycle brake wire 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.680
 transfer gear 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.710
 and here is such a system look I press 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.130
 the brake opens the lock press on 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.950
 brake 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.189
 the lock is opened I press the brake 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.890
 open the lock for the brakes said 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.560
 all three times so friends try 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.200
 launch this rocket with the so -called 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.920
 test mode just pumping it up 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.229
 By air seven points of our treasured times 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:46.979
 two three 4 5 six 7 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:52.890
 get ready run on the bill three times 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.930
 two three about roughly spotted then i 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.149
 asked you neatly mark now 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.630
 that place where the bottle flew to 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.450
 your screens using do not wash it off 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.460
 felt-tip pens and so and now the most important 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.099
 focus 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.879
 try this bottle just a little bit 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.510
 add ordinary distilled 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.340
 water 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.340
 it's not flammable and here you are 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:29.220
 usually distilled water 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:34.739
 We pour that's just a little bit here 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:40.680
 So we twist it neatly put on 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:49.590
 our starting position and doing everything 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:57.290
 same time two three 4 5 6 7 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.290
 and now we run one-two-three 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.319
 nifiga a I tell you 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.739
 she really went into orbit and returned 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.200
 backwards 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.870
 but all here with. water added strange 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.629
 yes the bottle has become heavier 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.049
 such a quantity of water and she flew away well 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.290
 to put it mildly 5 times higher 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.930
 why I guessed why I guessed 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.790
 why listen after all why do we fly 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.250
 bottle because it forms here 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.480
 air flow well when we air 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.940
 we pump this air flow 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.519
 accordingly imparts bottle momentum 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.709
 and the momentum of the bottle is the flow of air 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.629
 the speed multiplied by the mass of it 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.599
 flow that is to the air mass air 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.150
 so weighs a little so that's why 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.030
 momentum is small and if we add 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.730
 here the water from this nozzle flies water 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.889
 which as you know is much harder 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.409
 air and accordingly poured out with that 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.680
 same speed it gives the bottle much 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.310
 greater momentum this was ingenious 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.250
 guess 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.639
 of our kulibin alexey ivanchenko between 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.049
 other things 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.329
 this man as you know nothing 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.819
 afraid so he didn't say listen you 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.709
 when you launch a rocket try 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:22.139
 download 7a about 12 points and also 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.090
 with water, I said lech I for you that 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.000
 I will do what he pleases only when 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.950
 will you rock 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.440
 keep your head down gently 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:39.130
 but I 'm not afraid of anything 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:40.480
 times two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 now 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.500
 our operators take care 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.940
 stratosphere and we are in this stratosphere 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.940
 launch our rocket 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.830
 321 down 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.720
 By the way, we have a new one. 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.320
 air vent by the way dark 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.320
 already on the street
