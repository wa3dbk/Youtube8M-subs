00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
how do you get on top of the wheel

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.520 
how do you get on top of the wheel
without<00:00:05.819> super<00:00:06.600> jumping<00:00:08.120> because<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:10.050> super

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
without super jumping because the super

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.610 
without super jumping because the super
jump<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:11.070> be<00:00:11.190> pretty<00:00:11.519> difficult<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:13.200> even<00:00:13.380> if

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
you hit it sometimes you don't make it

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.760 
you hit it sometimes you don't make it
on<00:00:15.900> top<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.320> wheel<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:18.320> yeah<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:19.650> you

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.099 
on top of the wheel so yeah what you
need<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.550> need<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> rocket

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
need is you need to have a rocket

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.740 
need is you need to have a rocket

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
launcher which does fall on the map you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.620 
launcher which does fall on the map you
don't<00:00:24.900> need<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.140> set<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> rockets<00:00:26.420> but<00:00:27.420> you

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
don't need to set it to rockets but you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.800 
don't need to set it to rockets but you
