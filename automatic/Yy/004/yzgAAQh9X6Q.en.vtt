00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
to be able to handle and read those cues

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.759 
to be able to handle and read those cues
very<00:00:55.239> quickly<00:00:55.570> at<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.839> college<00:00:56.230> level<00:00:56.290> or<00:00:56.739> at

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
very quickly at the college level or at

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
the higher levels and that's usually the

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.719 
the higher levels and that's usually the
difference<00:00:58.629> between<00:00:58.979> average<00:00:59.979> and<00:01:00.280> good<00:01:00.489> and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
intelligent I think working with it is

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.780 
intelligent I think working with it is
going<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.320> like<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.650> say<00:01:05.830> force<00:01:06.250> them<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.549> make

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
going to like you say force them to make

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.330 
going to like you say force them to make
good<00:01:07.210> decisions<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:08.409> be<00:01:08.560> able<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.799> understand

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340

some<00:02:02.109> of<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.289> systems<00:02:02.710> at<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:02.950> NHL<00:02:03.340> users<00:02:03.819> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
some of the systems at the NHL users and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.289 
some of the systems at the NHL users and
