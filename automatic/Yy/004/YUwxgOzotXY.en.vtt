the<00:00:01.290> other<00:00:01.560> lead<00:00:01.770> sounds<00:00:02.250> that<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.490> use<00:00:02.879> which

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
the other lead sounds that I use which

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.350 
the other lead sounds that I use which
is<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.080> other<00:00:04.200> Bank<00:00:04.470> come<00:00:04.770> back<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:08.210> as<00:00:09.210> I

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
is on the other Bank come back to as I

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.290 
is on the other Bank come back to as I
said<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.719> previous<00:00:09.870> video<00:00:10.170> my<00:00:10.860> bank<00:00:11.099> one<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
said in a previous video my bank one is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.379 
said in a previous video my bank one is
made<00:00:12.840> up<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.320> clean<00:00:13.620> sound<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.670> crunch<00:00:15.089> Jones

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
made up of a clean sound to crunch Jones

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.140 
made up of a clean sound to crunch Jones
to<00:00:15.929> lead<00:00:16.170> sounds<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.740> bank<00:00:17.430> 2<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.789> made<00:00:17.940> up<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
to lead sounds and bank 2 is made up of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840 
to lead sounds and bank 2 is made up of
two<00:00:18.359> clean<00:00:18.600> sounds<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.800> crunch<00:00:20.100> sounds<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
two clean sounds to crunch sounds and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.880 
two clean sounds to crunch sounds and
one<00:00:21.090> lead<00:00:21.300> town<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:23.600> now<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.779> lead<00:00:25.650> town

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
one lead town and now this lead town

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.589 
one lead town and now this lead town
actually<00:00:26.310> uses<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> rhythm<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.390> crunch

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
actually uses the rhythm the crunch

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
actually uses the rhythm the crunch
channels<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> two<00:00:29.279> heads<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
channels are on the two heads and the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.490 
channels are on the two heads and the
functions<00:00:33.239> which<00:00:33.420> switches<00:00:33.719> between<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.350> two

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
functions which switches between the two

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.889 
functions which switches between the two
heads<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.149> that's<00:00:36.149> kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.540> preferred

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
heads and that's kind of my preferred

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.740 
heads and that's kind of my preferred
way<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.140> working<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> tone<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:39.510> two

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
way of working to have a tone with two

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.410 
way of working to have a tone with two
variations<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:43.309> what<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
variations and what it is it's the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
variations and what it is it's the
crunch<00:00:45.660> channel<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.039> marshal<00:00:47.910> ed<00:00:48.149> one

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
crunch channel with the marshal ed one

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.189 
crunch channel with the marshal ed one
compressor<00:00:48.780> pedal<00:00:49.760> before<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> which<00:00:51.600> gives

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
compressor pedal before it which gives

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.430 
compressor pedal before it which gives
it<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.559> gain<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> smoothness<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.440> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
it a bit more gain and smoothness and it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.910 
it a bit more gain and smoothness and it
kind<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> things<00:00:55.980> quite<00:00:56.340> nicely<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> on

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
kind of things quite nicely so on the on

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:13.250 
kind of things quite nicely so on the on
the<00:00:58.980> JS<00:00:59.250> excellent<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:02.210> have

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.270 

so<00:01:14.260> it's<00:01:14.380> much<00:01:14.620> lower<00:01:14.890> game<00:01:15.220> sound<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.950> it's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
so it's much lower game sound but it's

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.610 
so it's much lower game sound but it's
still<00:01:19.090> got<00:01:19.270> lots<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.660> sustained<00:01:20.110> going<00:01:20.410> about

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
still got lots of sustained going about

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.250 
still got lots of sustained going about
it<00:01:20.880> which<00:01:21.880> again<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.510> very<00:01:22.780> useful<00:01:23.170> at

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
it which again it is very useful at

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.400 
it which again it is very useful at
certain<00:01:23.530> times<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.540> way<00:01:25.690> this<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.080> set<00:01:26.110> up

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
certain times the way this is set up

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.490 
certain times the way this is set up
it's<00:01:27.010> not<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.250> stereo<00:01:27.730> sound<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.720> it's<00:01:29.380> not

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
it's not a stereo sound that it's not

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.870 
it's not a stereo sound that it's not
panning<00:01:29.860> delays<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.460> what<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.270> get<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.880> GSP

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
panning delays and what I get is the GSP

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.570 
panning delays and what I get is the GSP
1101<00:01:35.430> has<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.930> modulation<00:01:37.930> delay<00:01:38.440> of<00:01:38.680> 250

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
1101 has a modulation delay of 250

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.490 
1101 has a modulation delay of 250
milliseconds<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.450> which<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.320> all<00:01:41.470> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
milliseconds on it which is on all the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.180 
milliseconds on it which is on all the
time<00:01:42.479> there's<00:01:43.479> also<00:01:43.690> running<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.590> parallel<00:01:44.740> on

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
time there's also running in parallel on

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.050 
time there's also running in parallel on
that<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:46.030> pitch<00:01:46.330> shifter<00:01:46.750> up<00:01:47.290> an<00:01:47.500> octave

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that is a pitch shifter up an octave

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.010 
that is a pitch shifter up an octave
which<00:01:49.060> gives<00:01:49.390> it<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.540> bit<00:01:49.570> more<00:01:49.690> brightness

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
which gives it a bit more brightness

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.120 
which gives it a bit more brightness
it's<00:01:50.710> quite<00:01:50.890> low<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.220> mix<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.530> then<00:01:53.920> the

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
it's quite low in the mix and then the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.640 
it's quite low in the mix and then the
g-major<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:55.780> I've<00:01:55.900> actually<00:01:56.050> got<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.500> this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
g-major what I've actually got on this

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.969 
g-major what I've actually got on this
setting<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.160> some<00:01:57.880> detune<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:59.410> delight<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.950> a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
setting is some detune the delight is a

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.650 
setting is some detune the delight is a
dynamic<00:02:00.280> delay<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.550> only<00:02:03.910> kicks<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.450> when

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
dynamic delay so that only kicks in when

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.780 
dynamic delay so that only kicks in when
you<00:02:04.750> stop<00:02:05.050> playing<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.860> ducks<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.520> delay

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
you stop playing it ducks the delay

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.490 
you stop playing it ducks the delay
level<00:02:07.090> when<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.360> when<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:07.990> actually<00:02:08.200> play

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
level when you when you actually play

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.859 
level when you when you actually play
which<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.340> one<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.550> tc's<00:02:10.030> great<00:02:10.360> inventions

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
which is one of tc's great inventions

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.140 
which is one of tc's great inventions
and<00:02:11.050> it's<00:02:11.290> fantastic<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.610> that's<00:02:15.730> a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and it's fantastic and so and that's a

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.180 
and it's fantastic and so and that's a
that'sthat's<00:02:16.510> 500<00:02:16.989> milliseconds<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.650> then

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
that'sthat's 500 milliseconds and then

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.270 
that'sthat's 500 milliseconds and then
there's<00:02:18.400> also<00:02:18.459> in<00:02:18.760> parallel<00:02:19.150> with<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:20.280> every

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
there's also in parallel with that every

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:35.400 
there's also in parallel with that every
verb<00:02:21.489> as<00:02:21.730> well<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.130> lot<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.459> reverb

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:51.020 

Oh

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.610 

so<00:02:52.030> I'm<00:02:52.090> gonna<00:02:52.210> do<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.630> little<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.200> just

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
so I'm gonna do that little but I just

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.860 
so I'm gonna do that little but I just
pulled<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.950> volume<00:02:54.280> pop<00:02:54.490> back<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> bit<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.150> it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
pulled the volume pop back a bit and it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.510 
pulled the volume pop back a bit and it
just<00:02:56.260> cleaned<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.800> town<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> little<00:02:57.220> bit

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
just cleaned up the town a little bit

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:19.940 
just cleaned up the town a little bit
more<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.810> oil<00:02:59.230> taps<00:02:59.500> quite<00:02:59.770> nicely<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.280> well

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.100 

okay<00:03:20.950> um<00:03:21.640> as<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.599> hear<00:03:22.660> when<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.930> was

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
okay um as you can hear when I was

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.630 
okay um as you can hear when I was
playing<00:03:23.230> there<00:03:23.830> wasn't<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.250> whole<00:03:24.310> load<00:03:24.610> of

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
playing there wasn't a whole load of

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.280 
playing there wasn't a whole load of
delay<00:03:24.970> going<00:03:25.269> on<00:03:25.360> but<00:03:25.660> when<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:25.989> played<00:03:26.260> that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
delay going on but when I played that

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.559 
delay going on but when I played that
last<00:03:26.590> note<00:03:26.860> then<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.640> delays<00:03:27.910> really<00:03:28.239> kick<00:03:28.390> in

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
last note then the delays really kick in

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.570 
last note then the delays really kick in
and<00:03:28.780> that's<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.140> real<00:03:29.650> good<00:03:30.129> thing<00:03:30.280> about<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
and that's the real good thing about the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.110 
and that's the real good thing about the
dynamic<00:03:30.940> delay<00:03:31.709> am<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.069> then<00:03:33.610> function

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
dynamic delay am and then function

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.550 
dynamic delay am and then function
switch<00:03:34.330> again<00:03:34.660> just<00:03:34.930> switches<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.440> amp

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
switch again just switches the amp

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.100 
switch again just switches the amp
across<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.750> XXX<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:40.000> that's<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.630> much

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
across to the XXX and so that's a much

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.410 
across to the XXX and so that's a much
more<00:03:41.260> aggressive<00:03:41.380> tone<00:03:41.920> because<00:03:42.250> my<00:03:42.400> room<00:03:42.580> on

more aggressive tone because my room on

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.150 
more aggressive tone because my room on
