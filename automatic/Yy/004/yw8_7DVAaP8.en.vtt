particular fern remember where the would
turn<00:00:19.480> was<00:00:19.750> much<00:00:20.349> water<00:00:20.650> at<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.040> base<00:00:21.189> and<00:00:21.430> much

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
turn was much water at the base and much

you'll<00:00:31.650> also<00:00:31.830> notice<00:00:32.190> that<00:00:32.340> again<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:34.260> are

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
you'll also notice that again they are

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.260 
you'll also notice that again they are
leaflets<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:37.590> they're<00:00:38.000> much<00:00:39.000> more

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
leaflets here but they're much more

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.710 
leaflets here but they're much more
they're<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.750> low<00:00:39.960> nearly<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.680> heavily<00:00:41.040> as

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
they're not low nearly as heavily as

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.940 
they're not low nearly as heavily as
Filippis<00:00:42.720> and<00:00:43.220> if<00:00:44.220> you<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:44.580> off<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> leaflet

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
Filippis and if you take off a leaflet

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.920 
Filippis and if you take off a leaflet
off<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.280> fron<00:00:47.570> there's<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.720> little

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
off of the fron there's this little

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.320 
off of the fron there's this little
almost<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.150> beginning<00:00:51.150> of<00:00:51.239> an

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
almost like a little beginning of an

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.780 
almost like a little beginning of an
article<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.770> remember<00:00:53.610> how<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
article over the remember how the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.840 
article over the remember how the
immaculately<00:00:54.570> faces<00:00:55.200> sort<00:00:55.950> of<00:00:56.040> wrap<00:00:56.489> around

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
immaculately faces sort of wrap around

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.970 
immaculately faces sort of wrap around
so<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.809> guys<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.110> pass<00:00:58.290> them<00:00:59.750> but<00:01:00.980> so

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so you can you guys can pass them but so

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
so you can you guys can pass them but so
the<00:01:02.160> fronds<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> particular<00:01:04.050> fern<00:01:04.290> are

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the fronds on this particular fern are

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.690 
the fronds on this particular fern are
much<00:01:04.770> more<00:01:04.979> sword<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.630> much<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
much more sword like so much more on the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.430 
much more sword like so much more on the
same<00:01:08.970> sort<00:01:09.300> of<00:01:09.330> diameter<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
same sort of diameter all the way up and

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.990 
same sort of diameter all the way up and
down<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> frond<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.360> then<00:01:13.640> again<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.790> see

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
down the frond and then again we see

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.160 
down the frond and then again we see
this<00:01:15.270> sort<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:17.390> doesn't<00:01:18.390> seem<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.660> be<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.960> seems

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this sort of doesn't seem to be it seems

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
this sort of doesn't seem to be it seems
will<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.410> little<00:01:19.649> bit<00:01:19.740> darker<00:01:20.160> than<00:01:20.190> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
will be a little bit darker than the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.320 
will be a little bit darker than the
Felicity<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.080> color<00:01:22.410> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> water

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
Felicity like the color in the water

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.450 
Felicity like the color in the water
and<00:01:25.330> then<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.840> frond<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.560> always<00:01:27.100> got<00:01:27.310> this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
and then the frond is always got this

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.120 
and then the frond is always got this
sort<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.939> pubescent<00:01:28.299> song<00:01:28.720> okay<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:30.009> it's

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
sort of a pubescent song okay so it's

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.590 
sort of a pubescent song okay so it's
always<00:01:30.310> sort<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.700> hairy<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:32.170> particulars

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
always sort of hairy the particulars

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.899 
always sort of hairy the particulars
still<00:01:34.600> on<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.900> fron<00:01:35.430> much<00:01:36.430> Gary<00:01:36.700> are

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
still on the fron much Gary are

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.550 
still on the fron much Gary are
typically<00:01:37.390> down<00:01:37.630> for<00:01:37.899> four<00:01:38.080> days

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
typically down for four days

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.649 
typically down for four days
so<00:01:39.189> I<00:01:39.250> get<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.610> fuzzy<00:01:39.970> appearance<00:01:40.180> whereas

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
so I get that fuzzy appearance whereas

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
so I get that fuzzy appearance whereas
flick<00:01:41.350> this<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:42.009> smooth

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.170 

we<00:01:48.420> don't<00:01:48.630> grow<00:01:48.750> these<00:01:48.990> outside<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:50.180> we

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
we don't grow these outside here we

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.789 
we don't grow these outside here we
always<00:01:51.390> keep<00:01:51.659> them<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.930> containers<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> bring

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
always keep them in containers and bring

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.709 
always keep them in containers and bring
