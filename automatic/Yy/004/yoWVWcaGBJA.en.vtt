00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.690
 Hi, I'm in your Argentina now 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.760
 you know my name nicolÃ¡s in the video and 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.950
 I will tell you what I think about 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.840
 of the gym and alcohol combination 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.100
 good a big question that the 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.610
 people regarding this particular topic 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.260
 is it possible to consume alcohol and to 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.570
 same time get results 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.270
 positive in the gym is to say win 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.680
 muscle and strength and the answer is that 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.039
 Yes, but that is, as long as 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.359
 its framework is not extremely excessive and 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.460
 anyway you have to know that by 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.140
 example if they are from those who take 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.429
 only the weekends of all 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.139
 modes your results are going to see 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:42.309
 affected by alcohol consumption is 

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:43.749
 say they could be doing better with 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.549
 alcohol out of their lives that with the 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:48.309
 alcohol within them or that is a 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.870
 reality and they have to know it well 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.199
 but in the end this video is not only 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.909
 giving an answer to that question 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.249
 but also I would like to be able 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.409
 develop the effects a bit 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.479
 negative and the impact it has with 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.399
 our body that on the one hand and on the 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:07.260
 another side I would also like to give you my 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.480
 most sincere opinion about 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.980
 alcohol consumption in general if of the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.960
 people that being going to start 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.940
 talking about the negative effects 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.470
 what they have with our body is to say 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.710
 in the impact that generates 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.080
 and the first thing would be to talk about him 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.080
 as alcohol decreases our level 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.159
 in testosterone and how this affects 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.770
 our performance in the gym is 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.380
 say low testosterone levels is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.420
 equal to a loss of strength yes and of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369
 resistance that is to say we are waiting 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.930
 our performance already in the gym 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.610
 well clearly and also the low 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.440
 testosterone levels what it generates is 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.080
 a decrease in protein synthesis 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.149
 that is, the body has disadvantages 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.670
 to be able to say beyond that 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.979
 have a high protein diet what 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.160
 what we are doing when consuming alcohol 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.100
 is to decrease the body's ability to 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.910
 take advantage of that high protein intake 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.160
 that is to say in what would be let's say the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.110
 absorption of those proteins and breaking down 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.180
 proteins and transformed into dominance 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.950
 yes that can be observed by our 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.700
 organism and so we can say nurture 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.130
 the muscles good we are hurting 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.530
 highly that function 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.560
 by ingesting good alcohol and consuming 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.020
 alcohol also generates damages in certain 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.180
 organs of the body as for example is 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.600
 the brain 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.800
 causing memory loss 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.840
 difficulties to be able to concentrate on 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.150
 a task is to say that ability to 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.490
 It is focused on something and is also 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.860
 proved that 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.810
 there is a great possibility if 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.050
 developed sleep disorders is 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.620
 tell 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.150
 have difficulties in being able to conceive 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.940
 the dream if to be able to fall asleep 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.740
 and this is really serious because 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.690
 as you know, we explained together 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.210
 also the three pillars to build 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.940
 the muscle mass training 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.580
 nutrition and rest well so 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.280
 we would be failing in this last pillar 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.100
 we would be hurting our 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.810
 idea to recover because maybe 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.910
 we go to sleep and we are going to do it 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.590
 we can do it 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.050
 at the end of the day we are sleeping less 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.410
 hours then clearly impacts this 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.850
 in our muscle gains 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.920
 wang to alcohol also generates damage 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.530
 irreparable in the stomach in the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.510
 kidneys and in the liver and in what 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.980
 Regarding the blood what it does is 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.540
 inhibit the production of blood cells 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.940
 whites and reds 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.710
 the lack of white blood cells makes 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.080
 and we go but one fault in our 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.360
 immune system is to say that 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.250
 we are much more exposed and 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.160
 we are more likely to contract 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.710
 diseases and also infections and the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.420
 lack of red blood cells and whatever it is 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.560
 that transports oxygen so 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.620
 we are let's say 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.750
 very likely to enter a state of 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.970
 good anemia alcohol can cause 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.130
 erectile dysfunction and infertility and 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.950
 in addition to providing empty calories what 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.049
 does is prevent having a diet one 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.889
 optimal nutrition to gain mass 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.300
 muscular 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.610
 Finally, good, you know, I do not know, I've 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.189
 gone if it has happened to go to train 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.159
 hungover say whether the effect of the 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:32.800
 alcohol hangover and well clearly that 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:35.379
 be aware that if you take the previous night 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.439
 and they plan that day was the gym know 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.759
 that your training is going to be or is going to 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.029
 be a disaster if sanz find 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.800
 tired able to wear the head 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:47.590
 take a little the tummy will be 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.680
 dehydrated this even work is 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.689
 distracted yes so know that that day 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.629
 they will not train as they had 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.560
 it was not always about training to the fullest 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.629
 possibly they are lifting less and 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.520
 also have less strength so 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.879
 good look as well as the effect the 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.000
 hangover affects let's say obtaining 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.199
 positive results and in the gym 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.439
 good people I was like this in this is a 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.460
 part of the video what I'm going to do is 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:15.000
 share them as I told them my most 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.610
 Sincere opinion about 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.100
 of consumption in general and of people 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.780
 who decide to take 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.340
 the reality that I was never a person 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.370
 that he likes to talk or do 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.400
 social but what I always liked 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.220
 was to think if in the sense of observing 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.920
 the reality of the world that surrounds me and 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.770
 draw conclusions yes and I tell them this does not 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.360
 just so you can get to know me better 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.920
 but because right then what 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.170
 what I'm going to do is give them say 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.420
 particles and my my conclusions about 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:53.700
 of an analysis that I did of the 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.820
 reasons why a person 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.190
 decide to consume good alcohol in addition 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.310
 is to say that there will only be those 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.610
 do not share 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.280
 my thoughts or who are of 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.560
 agreement if he gives me the reason but good the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.050
 life generates a debate if I simply 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.310
 I pass on my ideas to you if I want 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.370
 that can transmit yours in the 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.560
 comments and ready yes that is 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.120
 simply that is a space for 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.120
 share ideas
