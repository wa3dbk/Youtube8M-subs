here<00:01:38.460> let's<00:01:39.060> go<00:01:39.150> ahead<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.299> look<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.540> some

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
here let's go ahead and look at some

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.240 
here let's go ahead and look at some
other<00:01:39.750> things<00:01:40.020> you'll<00:01:40.439> notice<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.799> we've

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
other things you'll notice that we've

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.700 
other things you'll notice that we've
got<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.880> an<00:01:42.000> integrated<00:01:42.600> whether<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
got kind of an integrated whether with

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399 
got kind of an integrated whether with
current<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.399> clock<00:01:44.930> actually<00:01:45.930> showing<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
time as being zero 559 which means it's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.580 
time as being zero 559 which means it's
5am<00:01:49.500> even<00:01:50.250> though<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.570> 1759<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.439> not

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
5am even though it's 1759 so it's not

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.660 
5am even though it's 1759 so it's not
