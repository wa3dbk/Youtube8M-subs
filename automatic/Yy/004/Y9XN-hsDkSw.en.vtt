00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.330
 Now there are threads in games like this 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:22.310
 and among developers they try new 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:24.740
 themes and styles in particular mob analog 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.750
 wait for you all the time the game is not final 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.550
 point because in many games when 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.130
 get to a specific point and even 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.350
 played well never reward without 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.489
 improve mob skills while doing this 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.489
 as long as you play 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.969
 Russian-speaking community is very unusual 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.249
 they are passionate very educated they 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.249
 understand the game and brings a lot to dota 2 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:55.609
 various communities give me a lot 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:03.949
 enjoy jumping to the east 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:05.750
 Europe and a little pull my Russian for 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.329
 international emerged from a conversation 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.219
 dota 2 development team of term 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:15.560
 thought it would be a great action we 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:18.409
 try we thought how to reward people 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.039
 for what they bring in someone plays 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.509
 someone makes omens for workshop 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.859
 it seemed professional players are making 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.539
 considerable contribution to society 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.880
 international one grew up here 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:39.770
 thank them for what they have already done 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:41.929
 we think of all our games as 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.600
 it would be better for them well, we love the community 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.299
 experiment yourself international 1 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.829
 was an experiment 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.310
 counter strike was an experiment when 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:56.119
 upon a time we thought and what can 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.130
 let's make it online game me still 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.119
 eyeing each game gives us 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.560
 invaluable experience and 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.560
 will be the development of the next 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.730
 the main test for us is exactly 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.849
 determine what name is needed for the community 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.739
 if we made all the decisions even 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.200
 good but this is just our decision 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.099
 here's a compendium is a mechanism for 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.780
 the community express who their favorite players are 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.849
 it gives us a lot of information to 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.280
 think and then improve dota 2 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.280
 competitions and continue in this vein
