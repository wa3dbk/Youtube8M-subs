in<00:01:14.389> the<00:01:14.479> field<00:01:14.749> ah<00:01:15.229> honestly<00:01:16.219> I<00:01:16.670> don't<00:01:16.969> think

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
in the field ah honestly I don't think

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.899 
in the field ah honestly I don't think
it<00:01:17.509> is<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.229> reasons<00:01:18.590> why<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:19.159> you'll<00:01:19.759> see

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
it is the reasons why is you'll see

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.370 
it is the reasons why is you'll see
better<00:01:20.179> in<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.329> second<00:01:20.689> screen<00:01:20.899> shot<00:01:21.109> there's

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
better in the second screen shot there's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.580 
better in the second screen shot there's
no<00:01:21.499> bonus<00:01:22.009> zone<00:01:22.219> so<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:23.569> 92<00:01:24.079> this<00:01:24.200> amount<00:01:24.499> of

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
no bonus zone so in 92 this amount of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.260 
no bonus zone so in 92 this amount of
somewhere<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.130> can<00:01:25.310> extra<00:01:25.670> point<00:01:25.880> if<00:01:25.999> you<00:01:26.119> go

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
somewhere you can extra point if you go

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.510 
somewhere you can extra point if you go
