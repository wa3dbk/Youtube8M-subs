00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.380
 nacho sierra de animales as we are 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.940
 Well, here I bring you this turtle 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.940
 of the country that 's the first thing 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.460
 It's a Mediterranean turtle too 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 known turtle dwells to be as with 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.170
 dust on it is not its color so well not 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 in gardens and then it's usually 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.609
 Well, although he is in danger of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 extinction are very protected but here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 we have brought a group so you can see them 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.070
 very well that is to say that we have to differentiate 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.809
 this is in danger of extinction in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.850
 concrete I have if the turtle all the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.440
 turtles in spain all are all in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.910
 danger of extinction and then those that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.760
 we buy in big this knowledge 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.559
 they are not good there are with cites that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.390
 can sell with special permission 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.739
 with your registration number and then 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.660
 also those that come are from others 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 countries that also have to have the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 most oils that's why at the time of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 acquire a turtle always to trade 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.010
 in which we buy it we have to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.719
 ask if you are subject to the agreement 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.449
 of species traffic there is a 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.039
 record if you have it good but we 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.420
 have to give a paper tells us that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.650
 it has been until one has met in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.280
 captivity 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.280
 cautious 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.290
 of the turtle live many years in 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.510
 general but there are some that live a hundred and 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.630
 peak years not the big turtles like 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.700
 the leatherback turtle for this marina and then 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.190
 there are others who live less but counting 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.430
 about 30-40 years can beat more 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.600
 bigger and bigger giants 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.600
 they usually live more of the year 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:47.540
 male female legs can not be 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.540
 do when they are 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.940
 on the contrary 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.250
 the turtle lives in shell and 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.930
 plastron to the bottom to the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.550
 flat or then there's usually 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.819
 species that are marked a lot 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.209
 for example 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.950
 there is a turtle that is good that has 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.409
 a very large concavity the margin 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.810
 these a little note also say 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.909
 that the male is concave to be able 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.380
 access the copulation then it is clear 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.610
 a little more 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:36.590
 and the females are flatter in this 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:38.660
 case we see that these female flat is a 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.730
 very curious story with a turtle the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.130
 he has a friend and it turns out that I do not 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.140
 I knew but they are territorial if then 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.790
 he has it in a garden and every time 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.230
 you enter the garden the turtle is caught 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.720
 If you take a little force 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.720
 energy against the tree 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.450
 the struggles between turtles are based on 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.000
 shoves of blows of swipes that 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.860
 dan and about the pole and the copulation between 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.560
 turtles is also very striking because 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:15.860
 the sounds that the male throws and that are 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:28.280
 and they make us good because the sound that 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:31.060
 comes someone to this territory in the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.060
 garden and you approach 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.920
 try not but not to step on but 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.890
 the territory we hope they are quite 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 and reproduce reproduce in 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.150
 captivity if you can revolution in 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.590
 captivity in on all nature 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.620
 clear but in captivity also happens 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.250
 that require an adequate environment 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.870
 space 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.549
 tranquility above all the animals are 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.260
 reproduce when there is when there 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.709
 tranquility and tranquility there is no 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.709
 reproduction 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.870
 of reproduction in eggs clear yes clear 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.650
 if then they will need a site to 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.049
 bury the eggs and from there the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.700
 little turtles and then well you can 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.440
 say that life which makes it such 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.359
 if you do this one can still treat a 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.530
 little more but not much more the size 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.959
 bigger there are already some that are a 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.850
 little bit bigger but anyway 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.190
 a a formula to calculate the age 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.330
 but that is not very accurate is would be to catch 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.910
 a plate one of the plates and look 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.520
 the number of rings that are formed in 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.650
 around a plate beads and more or less 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.090
 but neither is there that you think a lot 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.090
 sometimes good 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.240
 and turtles are more or less 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.950
 match but we can fail is not very 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.820
 exact station that is that they are in 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.760
 danger of extinction because what kind of 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.350
 habitats need the turtles so that 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.060
 these in particular are habitat 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.650
 mediterranean why these can be 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.570
 find in the whole area is called 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.800
 also turtle dwells a port to the north 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.030
 of Africa from the peninsula if they are about 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.110
 all in two warm zones more than the 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.570
 peninsular and that I would say the area 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.480
 Mediterranean in particular and then all the 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.550
 part of say of italy sicily islands 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.500
 and you recommend them for example as 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.600
 pets as pets or 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.160
 they need another kind of environment 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.040
 average habitat that a child is all the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.700
 day playing and very clear, I mean 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.240
 I never recommend animal for geos 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.160
 family but but good in principle it 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.570
 can have the most important thing is that the 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.520
 animal have papers 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.410
 of all in any any animal 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.120
 that is subject to what we have said 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.620
 there is from the cites you have to ask 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.639
 because it's the only guarantee we have 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.469
 that are animals bred in captivity 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.389
 I have been extracted from the outside environment 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.050
 because if not what we would be good 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.969
 thus promoting the clandestine sale 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.289
 and poaching 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.550
 is the most important then the 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.020
 obviously suitable treatment 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.430
 allow me a second because there it is 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.860
 our friend enrique hello enrique who 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.069
 You're getting a turtle face 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.229
 such are you enriched with how many turtles 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.150
 you are now because they are 14 and less 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.520
 one that you have there are 13 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.259
 enrique show us to camera now a 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.599
 male so they can see a little 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.229
 concavity of the difference so I've 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.810
 taught the bp boss so that 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.780
 enriches here let's see when when to 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:29.280
 no one's side 8 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:34.400
 why are you going to jump sparks that you see that 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.400
 here there is a concavity and this is flat 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.440
 here if this is the male with this 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.440
 concavity 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:49.889
 and so we are going to fit 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.069
 copulation 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.259
 they are very quiet animals and 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.120
 They are happy and nothing a curiosity that 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:24.460
 we are bringing the Aragonese closer to 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.780
 Mediterranean turtles a lot of kids 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.980
 thank you for these turtles is rich 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.980
 Thank you 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.980
 Thank you 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:38.160
 good and now there are many reptiles and 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.480
 females and now all that always 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.630
 he wanted to know about his animal's 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.630
 company
