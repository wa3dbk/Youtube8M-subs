00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.099
 the labgene in our channel a book in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.109
 three minutes 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.439
 Today's book is the psychology of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.359
 unaware of positions of mironga well 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.180
 because it may be strange because it is 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.300
 a more technical book at the most 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.670
 restricted did not say anything and what is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 aspects that are common to all beings 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.510
 humans 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.390
 the unconscious whether or not we all want 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.420
 We have this small, isolated island 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.030
 of knowledge that makes us 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 be who we are 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.239
 then a guide and psychology of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.379
 unconscious brings light and reflections one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.850
 series of concepts relating to our 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.250
 daily neuroses and how we 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.199
 we live our lives many times without 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.920
 ask ourselves how we act well 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.260
 and I'm going to read a little book from 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 purÃ© program part by piece can cut 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.080
 Dad is interesting how he talks. 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.119
 of neurosis as we perceive that something 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.830
 very common in our daily life 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 so he says when he accompanies 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 carefully the story of how 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 honorable and always faces a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.380
 critical moment of the appearance of a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.409
 problem from which the individual deviated 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.990
 hour and depart is a reaction as 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.930
 natural and constant as the laziness 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.329
 A cowardly fear or not 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.470
 and unconsciousness that are in your 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.079
 base 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.180
 so basically if and what says in 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.860
 Awareness base deviation 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.420
 Every time people deviate from something 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.240
 that we can not face because the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.890
 people are not aware of this and what 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.420
 he does precisely lay the foundations 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.270
 so we can have a little more 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.180
 of conscience and that's what he says 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.040
 therefore the initiation of treatment 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.590
 can no longer be an ordeal to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.890
 many people who have a false image 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 of themselves because applying 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.710
 in an ancient mystic saying gives up the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.280
 that you have received the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.830
 interesting because it uses very 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.930
 is mystics often this saying there 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.540
 a very old saying taken from the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.940
 alchemy and he has the question of intuition 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.870
 it is the way we symbolize the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.870
 things in our day to day 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.610
 Hmm
