00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 of people around the world and that we 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.920
 visit friends today I want to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 tell them about the importance that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.329
 It has the fuel cap 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:44.370
 gas cap this does not end in 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.539
 gentlemen how can you see here this plug 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.539
 you see that 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.879
 the packaging that you have is already 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.110
 with a crack if you can see it is not 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.350
 it can not see very well but 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.140
 this is very important what 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.659
 This is packing well because that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.659
 prevents gasoline 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.600
 or gasoline can be 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.939
 evaporating so not the gas that does not 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.840
 is fine then many times 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.640
 we have fuel losses 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.740
 by the gas cap is very 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.319
 important that this plug is in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.929
 optimal conditions this other thing that 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:37.590
 this plug is wrong and can give me 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.350
 account in this car is that when 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 they finish putting gasoline closes and 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.090
 then anybody opens it any 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.819
 you can remove it whatever you can 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.319
 remove even someone can put you 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:55.000
 something and then they can intentionally 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.119
 put something like that then it's very 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.090
 important that we take care of our vehicle 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.560
 and that if our car is like in this 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.200
 condition let's replace 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.149
 immediately this stage of 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.370
 gasoline or this plug 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:18.210
 and we put a different one in this 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.270
 I already bought the new one that we are going to put 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:26.110
 this also the one that is 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.260
 the damaged packaging causes us to throw a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.740
 error in the engine sometimes comes out check 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.940
 engine and we do not know but this is also 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.070
 ah 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.950
 it throws us an error in the computer 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.740
 when this packaging is damaged because 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.390
 gasoline evaporates although not what 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.580
 create evaporates from a little bit of a 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.030
 little bit because it's not sealing 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.510
 correctly the plug a good this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.400
 here I have the stopper that I'm going to put 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.629
 a new and different cap 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.599
 for this car and very important what 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.400
 I bought with a key what I bought with a key 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.349
 appointment so that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.159
 Well, only when I'm going to put 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:14.370
 gasoline can you can open it really 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.790
 because many times we do all this already 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.799
 after things have happened to us 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.170
 or someone revolt pont and left him without 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.930
 plug or put something on it and broke down the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.659
 car and then we run it to do the 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.079
 things after what happened to us 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:33.599
 so let's be smart and let's see what 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.200
 that we can change the car 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.290
 before something happens we can 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.470
 we change, we're not going to put it, we're going to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.470
 put 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 there you are 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.810
 there is also 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.170
 there you look very well the stopper cited and so 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.400
 He has gone alone when when he needs 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.670
 put on gas no one can take it out when 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.160
 I need to put gas because he used my 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.190
 appointment key 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:13.960
 and I do it 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.450
 simple and very economical as I turn them 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.820
 and I repeat we have to prevent things 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.670
 before it happens to us 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.300
 nobody can touch it like this closes the 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.970
 stopper and after someone opens try 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.090
 take the cap because I'm not going to 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.130
 be able to do because it is with a key 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.790
 after those two little keys we can save 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.400
 one on each keychain and I keep one on 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.300
 a place where we think it is 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.250
 sure safe and this 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.199
 if we can get another copy 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.650
 depending on how many people drive 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:53.970
 the car this is very important as you 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.180
 I repeat elche this is something that is very 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.949
 important to keep it and keep it in 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.490
 optimal conditions the plug of the 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.110
 gasoline are simple things 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.900
 but in truth, if we do not have the 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.789
 knowledge this cause us expenses 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.500
 fuel loss and many times 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.930
 we say because our car will consume 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.150
 more gasoline than before and it's because 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.389
 the gas cap is not sealing 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.659
 correctly be good that has been 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:28.169
 All friends, I hope you serve them this 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:30.300
 tutorial this how I repeat this is for 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.090
 people who have no knowledge in 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.310
 cars that have knowledge by car 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.600
 after that good do not need to look at my 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.230
 videos 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:44.760

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.880
 the people who need help this is
