00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.429
 the Leonardo da Vinci built by the Costa Aldo di Genova for the company 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.709
 Italian was equipped with 11 wharf could accommodate 1360 passengers 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.570
 entered service in June 1960 on the genoa new york line with a 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:33.879
 cruising speed of 25 knots was destroyed by fire in 1980 and 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.670
 demolished 2 years later 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.430
 In 2010 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.350
 I was asked to restore one of his construction models that time had 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.440
 reduced in precarious conditions and on which some details were mounted 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 inhomogeneous with respect to the original ship 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.700
 cooperative of this model is composed of layers of solid wood 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.780
 externally shaped internally discharged 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.280
 the dead work and steel sheet 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.910
 the superstructures are formed by superimposed elements connected to each other 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.570
 by means of rieti 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.750
 this dog has favored disassembly 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.510
 first I fixed the hull by rectifying the living work he 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.340
 aligning as much as possible 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.400
 the dead work 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.820
 then I go out finished hull with several steps of capturing and polishing 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.840
 with application of synthetic base paint 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.050
 oooh completely eliminated the old paint from southern Italy superstructures 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.050
 the hull 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.050
 I applied a first coat of color 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.930
 I then restored the maneuver deck and the bow deck 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.590
 where I have redone the missing accessories can damage 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.190
 the model is illuminated internally 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.830
 I replaced the old incandescent lamps with low-consumption ones 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.540
 I rebuilt the wiring and I mounted a standard cable connector so as to 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.909
 avoid that as already happened 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.189
 the power supply cable is cut when entering the hull 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.840
 for glazing 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.680
 used accepted a quarter of a millimeter thick 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.549
 which I have specified 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.809
 at the bridge walk where hands pass were depicted by painted black lines 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.409
 with appropriately supported steel wires mounted 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.950
 particular attention was paid to the lance bridge where they were installed 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.749
 echourouk mirror pumps with pump unevenness of the original 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.700
 I rebuilt all the resin boats according to the original form 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:00.119
 then it was built you installed the highlights of the gravitational type like those that 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.269
 actually installed on the Leonardo da Vinci 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.519
 I continued with the restoration of the upper bridges up to the counter bridge 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.879
 I have cleaned sanded and varnished every deck covering 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.419
 all glass shredder clean 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:25.049
 I added fixing screws at the points where you raised them in 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.460
 way to prevent 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.460
 the French of the inconvenience 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.129
 on the model two right-hand helix were mounted 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.319
 I replaced them and built some brass axes inserted in boxes 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.319
 so that they can vote freely 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:48.529
 I repaired the stabilizer fins and as for the propellers I replaced the 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.540
 old wooden planks with others in brass by inserting them in the case 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.209
 even the first ones can ruin freely 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.039
 I dismantled repaired the tree 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:04.819
 I reinstalled the different components and I repositioned it on site 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.789
 the names that were composed of plastic letters some of which was 8 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:14.639
 missing flowers made all by cutting them from an aluminum plate 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.299
 half a millimeter thick 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.819
 and after having finished them painted I glued them on site 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.699
 I rebuilt the missing railings I redid all the flower ladders 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.349
 built in brass, the entire pool furniture consisting of chairs and tables 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.270
 I have arranged the three pools to which I have remade at the bottom which simulates 

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:39.069
 water filling 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.890
 leo furnished with the new material except for the umbrellas 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.189
 as it could recover the existing ones 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:51.419
 the model after restoration faces a long journey to return to his 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.220
 seat 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.300
 that socks cannot be excluded because they are moved later 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.440
 I therefore built a robust cushioned structure with slots 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.199
 fastening that ensures my safety during transport 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.610
 have a nice trip 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.680
