00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
right here I've got the box to the jjrc

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.099 
right here I've got the box to the jjrc
H<00:00:04.819> one<00:00:05.819> thing<00:00:06.000> I've<00:00:06.120> noticed<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.720> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
H one thing I've noticed is that the

controls are not labeled properly on

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.650 
controls are not labeled properly on
this<00:00:10.200> box<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:10.920> I'm<00:00:11.250> making<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:11.969> video<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
this box so I'm making this video to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.410 
this box so I'm making this video to
show<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.469> how<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.920> properly<00:00:14.580> use<00:00:15.179> the

show you how to properly use the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.429 
show you how to properly use the
controller<00:00:16.910> with<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.940> quadcopter<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.020> all

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
controller with the quadcopter and all

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.590 
controller with the quadcopter and all
of<00:00:19.560> its<00:00:19.680> features<00:00:21.080> what<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.199> want<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.650> is

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
of its features what you want to do is

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.300 
of its features what you want to do is
go<00:00:24.600> ahead<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:27.109> turn<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> quadcopter<00:00:28.650> I've

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
go ahead and turn on the quadcopter I've

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.709 
go ahead and turn on the quadcopter I've
already<00:00:29.609> got<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> battery<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.700> then

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
already got the battery in it and then

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.490 
already got the battery in it and then
turn<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.170> controller<00:00:35.719> lift<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.170> on

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
turn on the controller lift it up on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.190 
turn on the controller lift it up on
this<00:00:37.829> side<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.579> back<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:39.020> you<00:00:40.020> hear

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
this side and then back down you hear

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.810 
this side and then back down you hear
that<00:00:40.379> beep<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.860> binds<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that beep that binds it to the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.250 
that beep that binds it to the
quadcopter

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.830 

now<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.160> change<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.730> rate<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
now you can change the rate on the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.529 
now you can change the rate on the
controller<00:00:49.320> because<00:00:50.070> 0%<00:00:51.000> isn't<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
controller because 0% isn't going to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
controller because 0% isn't going to
give<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> much<00:00:52.289> pitch<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.760> what<00:00:56.760> you're

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
give you that much pitch so what you're

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
give you that much pitch so what you're
going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> button

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
going to want to do is use this button

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.020 
going to want to do is use this button
right<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.780> to<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:01.370> 50%<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.579> good<00:01:02.850> for

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
right here to go 50% that's good for

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
right here to go 50% that's good for
inside<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> house<00:01:06.380> 75<00:01:07.460> or<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
little video right to stop the video but

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500 
little video right to stop the video but
again<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.049> done

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.540 

to<00:02:02.140> take<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.350> picture<00:02:02.650> push<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.550> push<00:02:04.060> up<00:02:05.550> and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
to take a picture push the push up and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.969 
to take a picture push the push up and
that<00:02:06.700> takes<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.120> picture<00:02:07.300> I'm<00:02:08.050> not<00:02:08.200> sure<00:02:08.410> what

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
that takes a picture I'm not sure what

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.430 
that takes a picture I'm not sure what
these<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.490> do<00:02:11.160> looks<00:02:12.160> like<00:02:12.960> that's<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.140> trim

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
these to do looks like that's a trim

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.390 
these to do looks like that's a trim
button<00:02:14.770> as<00:02:14.860> well

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
button as well

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.620 
button as well
because<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.360> can<00:02:16.570> see<00:02:16.780> changing<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:18.630> long

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
because you can see changing here long

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.570 
because you can see changing here long
beep<00:02:19.930> lets<00:02:20.260> me<00:02:20.410> know<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:21.040> centered<00:02:21.430> out

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
beep lets me know that it's centered out

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.530 
beep lets me know that it's centered out
I<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:23.800> one<00:02:24.130> trimmed<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.330> right

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
I have this one trimmed out to the right

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.540 
I have this one trimmed out to the right
you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.930> see<00:02:26.220> Center<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:30.160> go

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
you can see Center there we go

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.150 
you can see Center there we go
so<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.230> all<00:02:32.790> Center<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:35.110> if<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:35.620> it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
so now it's all Center but if it's it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.460 
so now it's all Center but if it's it
must<00:02:36.430> have<00:02:36.550> been<00:02:36.670> drifting<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.840> battery

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
must have been drifting as the battery

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.680 
must have been drifting as the battery
drains<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.370> will<00:02:39.610> start<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.060> drift<00:02:40.330> sometimes

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
drains it will start to drift sometimes

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.170 
drains it will start to drift sometimes
so<00:02:41.320> that's<00:02:41.530> one<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.670> things<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.030> might

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
so that's one of the things you might

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.620

I'm gonna make sure I'm at a hundred

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.370 
I'm gonna make sure I'm at a hundred
percent<00:03:04.720> rates<00:03:05.260> cuz<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.010> fly<00:03:06.220> fast<00:03:07.380> all

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
percent rates cuz I like to fly fast all

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.060 
percent rates cuz I like to fly fast all
right<00:03:08.440> now<00:03:09.190> I'm<00:03:09.340> gonna<00:03:09.550> start<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.360> video

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
right now I'm gonna start the video

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:22.860 
right now I'm gonna start the video
before<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.280> take<00:03:12.489> off<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:15.459> go

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.550 

looks<00:03:23.200> like<00:03:23.380> it

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
looks like it

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.330 
looks like it
we<00:03:24.950> have<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.100> little<00:03:25.310> bit<00:03:25.490> of<00:03:25.580> wind

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.220 

it's<00:03:30.640> pretty<00:03:30.940> stable<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.480> don't<00:03:31.660> need<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.930> trim

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it's pretty stable I don't need to trim

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.820 
it's pretty stable I don't need to trim
it

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.070 

you<00:03:40.310> have<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.550> do<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.700> flip<00:03:41.030> I'm<00:03:41.720> gonna<00:03:41.900> push

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
you have to do a flip I'm gonna push

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.050 
you have to do a flip I'm gonna push
this<00:03:42.260> button<00:03:42.470> right<00:03:42.620> here

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.050 

I'll<00:03:48.270> do<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.660> again

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:16.460

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.849 

this<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.860> 100%<00:04:17.250> rates

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:31.059 

you<00:04:22.009> can<00:04:22.159> see<00:04:22.460> how<00:04:23.150> much<00:04:23.389> pitch<00:04:23.719> I'm<00:04:23.990> getting

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.320 

I'll<00:04:31.430> go

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
I'll go

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:44.040 
I'll go
25%<00:04:34.330> rates

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:52.719 

not<00:04:44.590> much<00:04:44.800> pitch

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.000 

two<00:04:53.210> beeps

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:07.830 

it's<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.520> little<00:04:58.760> bit<00:04:58.850> better<00:04:59.890> 75

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:21.200 

and<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.380> hundred

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.150 

one<00:05:21.750> thing<00:05:21.960> I've<00:05:22.110> noticed<00:05:22.229> is<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.680> range<00:05:22.919> is

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
one thing I've noticed is the range is

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.640 
one thing I've noticed is the range is
not<00:05:23.310> very<00:05:23.610> good<00:05:23.820> with<00:05:24.060> this<00:05:24.180> controller<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:25.050> can

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
not very good with this controller I can

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.320 
not very good with this controller I can
go<00:05:26.040> about<00:05:26.310> as<00:05:26.639> far<00:05:27.030> as<00:05:27.090> here<00:05:28.669> any<00:05:29.669> further<00:05:30.030> than

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
go about as far as here any further than

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.409 
go about as far as here any further than
this<00:05:30.419> I<00:05:30.690> might<00:05:30.930> lose<00:05:31.169> it<00:05:31.229> because<00:05:31.889> I<00:05:32.430> had<00:05:33.389> a

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
this I might lose it because I had a

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:43.409 
this I might lose it because I had a
flyaway<00:05:33.840> right<00:05:34.650> in<00:05:34.800> that<00:05:34.889> spot<00:05:35.100> already

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:55.110 

bring<00:05:43.960> it<00:05:44.080> in<00:05:44.199> for<00:05:44.379> a<00:05:44.469> landing

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.080 

not<00:05:56.120> a<00:05:56.150> very<00:05:56.330> good<00:05:56.599> landing<00:05:57.130> but<00:05:58.130> I'll<00:05:58.699> shut

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
not a very good landing but I'll shut

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.520 
not a very good landing but I'll shut
off<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.569> video<00:05:59.750> here

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
off the video here
