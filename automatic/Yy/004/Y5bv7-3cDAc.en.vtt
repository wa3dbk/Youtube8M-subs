about very soon you can regenerate

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
about very soon you can regenerate
regenerating<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.109> titanfall<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.949> pretty<00:01:02.280> much

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
regenerating in titanfall is pretty much

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
regenerating in titanfall is pretty much
the<00:01:02.640> same<00:01:02.820> concept<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.619> prestiging<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.799> Call

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the same concept as prestiging in Call

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
the same concept as prestiging in Call
of<00:01:05.100> Duty<00:01:05.549> where<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.479> lose<00:01:06.630> everything

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of Duty where you will lose everything

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140 
of Duty where you will lose everything

gotten over the course of the 50 levels

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
gotten over the course of the 50 levels
and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.390> reset<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and then you will be reset back down to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.499 
and then you will be reset back down to
rank<00:01:13.830> 1<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.790> challenges<00:01:15.330> will

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
be reset as well if you decide to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.300 
be reset as well if you decide to
regenerate<00:01:18.360> however<00:01:19.259> titanfall<00:01:19.680> does<00:01:20.009> take<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
regenerate however titanfall does take a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.770 
regenerate however titanfall does take a
slightly<00:01:20.670> different<00:01:20.850> approach<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.600> this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
slightly different approach with this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840 
slightly different approach with this
feature<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:23.040> allows<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> rank

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
feature and actually allows you to rank

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
feature and actually allows you to rank
up<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.240> gain<00:01:24.420> experience<00:01:24.600> points<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.950> an

accelerated rate every time you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
accelerated rate every time you
regenerate<00:01:29.700> meaning<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.659> rank<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.110> much

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
regenerate meaning you will rank up much

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
regenerate meaning you will rank up much
faster<00:01:31.350> than<00:01:31.979> before<00:01:32.420> every<00:01:33.420> time<00:01:33.630> you

regenerate the rate at which you gain

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.730 
regenerate the rate at which you gain
experience<00:01:35.640> points<00:01:36.329> will<00:01:36.810> continue<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
experience points will continue to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
experience points will continue to
accumulate<00:01:38.189> until<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.180> very<00:01:39.360> end<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.869> the

accumulate until the very end and the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.039 
accumulate until the very end and the
very<00:01:40.229> end<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.700> tenth<00:01:41.970> regeneration<00:01:42.630> so

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
very end is the tenth regeneration so

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
very end is the tenth regeneration so
you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.409> rank<00:01:43.619> up<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.430> way<00:01:44.520> from<00:01:44.579> 1<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> 50

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you can rank up all the way from 1 to 50

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.649 
you can rank up all the way from 1 to 50

regenerations<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.090> DLC<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.200> hard<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
regenerations as DLC but it's hard to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
regenerations as DLC but it's hard to
say<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.280> will<00:01:56.460> ever<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.840> for

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that you have to complete before you

that you have to complete before you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the challenges in the description below

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.550 
the challenges in the description below
but<00:02:18.090> basically<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:18.750> doing<00:02:19.050> things<00:02:19.320> like

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
but basically it's doing things like

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.380 
but basically it's doing things like
killing<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> certain<00:02:20.580> amount<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.820> enemies<00:02:21.180> with

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
killing a certain amount of enemies with

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.600 
killing a certain amount of enemies with
a<00:02:21.420> certain<00:02:21.840> weapon<00:02:22.200> these<00:02:22.800> challenges<00:02:23.430> do

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
a certain weapon these challenges do

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.700 
a certain weapon these challenges do
have<00:02:23.820> five<00:02:24.120> different<00:02:24.540> tiers<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.930> complete<00:02:25.260> so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
have five different tiers to complete so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.590 
have five different tiers to complete so
you<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.100> do<00:02:26.250> those<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:27.060> think

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you have to do those as well I think

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420 
you have to do those as well I think
this<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:27.960> pretty<00:02:28.230> cool<00:02:28.350> because<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.890> may<00:02:29.130> have

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
this is pretty cool because you may have

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.370 
this is pretty cool because you may have
to<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.730> something<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.600> your<00:02:30.960> comfort<00:02:31.140> zone

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
to do something out of your comfort zone

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.440 
to do something out of your comfort zone
to<00:02:31.860> complete<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.490> challenge<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:33.090> order<00:02:33.330> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
to complete a challenge in order to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.290 
to complete a challenge in order to
regenerate<00:02:33.960> making<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> more<00:02:34.860> challenging

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
regenerate making it more challenging

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.270 
regenerate making it more challenging
meaning<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.540> probably<00:02:37.110> won't<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.410> as<00:02:37.590> easy<00:02:37.710> as

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
meaning it probably won't be as easy as

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.880 
meaning it probably won't be as easy as
simply<00:02:39.150> ranking<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.230> would<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.620> call

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
simply ranking up like you would in call

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.980 
simply ranking up like you would in call
of<00:02:40.920> duty<00:02:41.209> also<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.240> did<00:02:42.480> forget<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.870> mention

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
of duty also I did forget to mention

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.470 
of duty also I did forget to mention
that<00:02:43.410> once<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.400> regenerate<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.209> still

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
that once you do regenerate you still

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.720 
that once you do regenerate you still
get<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.750> actually<00:02:45.870> keep<00:02:46.320> your<00:02:46.860> remaining<00:02:47.340> burn
