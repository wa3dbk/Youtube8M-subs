00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 warning in this video criticize the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.500
 fire style so if you are a fan boy of 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.170
 this series and it burns you with ease will be 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.530
 better leave this video hello I'm 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.570
 vehicle not 1993 after having 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.029
 criticized the three marias today I will criticize 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.670
 to fairytale this anime is one of the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 most overrated animes that exist is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.630
 possible that at this point still not 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.300
 exceed the three marias but you're 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.240
 approaching is unanimous that does not contribute anything 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.550
 new to the genre are in not only the genre 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.380
 they are in themselves that anime itself what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.719
 I want to say is that the history of this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.030
 anime already seen too much 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.700
 main character is the typical asshole 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.829
 of animation in with few lights and with a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.809
 power that is already too seen in all 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.180
 the anime that is to control fire 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.579
 I still have not said what's this 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 character he was talking about as 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.059
 many will know it's called natsu that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.160
 it means summer I think a name 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.620
 something childish like the series itself but 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.379
 I'll talk about that later, there are others 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.989
 secondary characters like great and how 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.409
 not with another very original power sarcasm 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.140
 xd xd xd xd which is to control 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.719
 lucy is another character in this anime that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 is a magician who can invoke things and 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.979
 I do not know why they remind me of me 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.420
 Now that's another magician who has a 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.090
 armor that reminds me of those 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.609
 Zodiac knights there are a thousand assholes 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 more in this good anime since I explained 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.140
 the main characters goes from 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 criticize this anime good this anime 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.829
 it seems to me a failed attempt of sonnen 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.569
 since he has no blood or good fights 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.479
 or characters that catch your attention 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.000
 I do not know what kind of assholes 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.890
 You may like that blowjob characters 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.170
 shallow ones attached to a 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.479
 poor history repetitive and vomitive 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.280
 maybe at the beginning this anime was 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.409
 good but as it was advancing the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.869
 Anime series became more boring and 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.729
 repetitive nasu was moving away from his 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.560
 goal that was to find your 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.349
 father who is a dragon until this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.119
 goal became secondary 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.459
 the protagonism is another of many things 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.289
 that fail this anime in the 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.299
 first chapters his characters 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.069
 They seemed strong and promised but to the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.810
 As it progressed, Natsu went 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.569
 taking the lead with steps 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.130
 gigantic and in the end the csu is the one 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.140
 always defeat the baddest 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.630
 that others only defeat the dirty ones 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.340
 that are in the service of the boss that 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.080
 prominence made the story of 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.210
 this anime became a 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.910
 history very repetitive and vomitive as 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.950
 I already highlighted it before anything else is that 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.950
 this anime is diarrheically infantile 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.750
 where is the blood in a chapter 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.000
 makÃ¡rov who is the old man who directs 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.550
 Guild said it has already spilled much 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.460
 blood and I'll finish with that or something 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.980
 xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd blood not 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.720
 there was not a drop of blood I do not know what it is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.360
 what the creator smoked to say 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.430
 things like that I also read his sleeve since 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.860
 I thought it was anime censorship and in 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.990
 the manga there would be blood but nothing 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.600
 nothing but just a droplet maybe but nothing 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.340
 more the villains when they are defeated 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.220
 they magically become 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.350
 little angels and they are no longer bad that lack of 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.780
 seriousness of the villains I never liked 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.210
 a villain that at the minimum is defeated 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.220
 It becomes a little angel I do not want 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.720
 offend anyone but that I only saw 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.460
 in fairy tales by 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.320
 deduction that felipe and read a 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.060
 fairy tale because with a story 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.520
 so childish could not be 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.860
 thing is that he does not die 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.260
 god in this anime neither bad nor 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.440
 good all survive and are made 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.959
 good and live happy I thought that 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.480
 gerard would die but not at all he too 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.269
 he survives and his plagiarisms are good 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.220
 towards other animes like the same gerard 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.640
 It looks like the em walker of the crime and 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.380
 the one with yellow hair looks like ichigo or 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.959
 the earth a dress looks like that of 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.970
 the knights of the zodiac the asshole of 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.830
 main character looks so much like 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.239
 light and that until you come to think it was your 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.880
 beloved copy that until today not 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.760
 discard the fact that it is bad copy 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.370
 of light and explains his penisjez lucy like 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.590
 I said before it looks a lot like origami 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.989
 in some other chapter I saw a 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.599
 technique almost equal to me go zangetsu to 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.360
 of include those who saw inuyasha already 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.610
 they will know what technique I speak the truth is 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.680
 which is an anime that has many plagiarisms 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.540
 hidden but like a lot that does not 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.269
 I see it, I 'm probably reading it 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.639
 they escaped many more the truth that I do not know 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.919
 how they did not accept bridge eye I'm not a 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.480
 hooker and they accepted that thing that plagiarized 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.580
 much more than bridge 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.680
 his fights are very bad with movements 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.440
 very simple and with powers as I said 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.360
 before very little original and finally 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.240
 I say it's the worst anime I've seen 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.280
 I thought I would never find such an anime 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.260
 diarrheic as band pit but look for 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.660
 where I found it and it is this that I just 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.670
 criticize could have said more things 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.220
 but it has been a long time since 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.230
 I saw but with the things that I said it is 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.660
 more than enough to deduce that this 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.550
 anime is liquid shit and I'm not a 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.770
 tared to see it again just for 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.650
 make a good criticism shit 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.040
 greetings to all and I leave with straw and 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.040
 goodbye
