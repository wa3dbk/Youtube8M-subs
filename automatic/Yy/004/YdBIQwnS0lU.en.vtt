00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
down through the bullet weight through

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.390 
down through the bullet weight through
the<00:02:46.750> pointed<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.320> first<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.920> way<00:02:48.100> it's<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the pointed in first that way it's a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.590 
the pointed in first that way it's a
pointed<00:02:48.730> bullet<00:02:48.880> weight<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.239> comes<00:02:49.360> through

the cover good then you're going to
attach<00:02:51.549> your<00:02:51.820> TroKar<00:02:52.330> hook<00:02:52.360> just<00:02:52.840> basically<00:02:53.200> a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
attach your TroKar hook just basically a

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.229 
attach your TroKar hook just basically a
standard<00:02:53.620> Palomar<00:02:54.220> knot<00:02:54.250> works<00:02:54.640> great<00:02:54.970> and
