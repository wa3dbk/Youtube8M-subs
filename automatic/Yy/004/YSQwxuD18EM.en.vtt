00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.200
 - I do not understand... 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.100
 How ... could you ... do this? 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.900
 You shouldn't have ... so much importance. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.700
 And now ... you are going to destroy ... 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.800
 me...? 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.900
 How dare you, insect? 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.700
 How dare you hinder me? 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 You are nothing more than ... 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000
 pathetic bag of flesh. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 What are you compared to my ... greatness? 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.800
 However, it is not too late. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Can't you see the benefits of our friendship? 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.800
 Just imagine the power that I can give you, man. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200
 The cybernetic implants that I gave you are just toys. 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 If I wanted to, I could improve you, transform you ... into something more ... 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 In something more efficient. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.500
 Join me, man. And we can ... rule ... 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.800
 together. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.900
 - Not. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.500
 Rescue Shuttle 0832 700 thousand miles from "Von Brown" 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 - Tommy Suarez Audio Magazine, July 13, 2114. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.100
 We have just received a message from a member of the Von Braun crew. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.500
 They managed to regain control of the ship. 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.500
 We are going to turn around and fly back. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 I'm a little worried about Rebecca. She has been behaving strangely since we are here. 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.000
 She is sleeping now. 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.000
 Maybe when we return to Von Braun, we can ... 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.200
 - Tommy ... 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.800
 What's up, darling? 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.500
 You don't like my ... new look?
