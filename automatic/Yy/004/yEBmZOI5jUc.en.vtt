 and mapped within five minutes immediately took the lead in zwolle 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.280
 I think

 ha that is taken away from a substantial one 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.550
 and that the second option for az there was a lot of little bar 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 it has to be careful for the home team 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.370
 at the start of this competition 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.270
 do not be frightened traveling they are not in the snow 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270

 15 minutes the equalizer 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.669

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.040
 attractive about beer zone between these two not without reason the third set four 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.879
 and five 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.029
 top classer as a train station 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.149

 with luc asselman 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:17.459
 he insists 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.799
 commercial model i have your ideals 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.799
 I got the boys around a bit 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.530
 China is the largest 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.530
 there is intent there too 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.539
 this is one through the action 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.089
 if that can get the ball at what effects towards the goal of trajectory 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.089
 then he makes one of the best chances with the competition 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.999
 doesn't feel good at the end 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.819
 ninth place 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.129

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.779
 whoever lingers by the Alps makes sure nothing is wrong 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.319
 again 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.650
 what top oss 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.220
 and there is also the work of the class, but those actors in the body 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.659
 it looks like it certainly would 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.840
 move which is pushed back further 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.840
 zwolle does exactly that 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:04.680
 let's see if it is in the final phase 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.860

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.419
 great action 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.969
 it sounds crazy but in such a situation if you exist 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.969
 you have to count on it 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.969
 that for your feet 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.279
 rob knox is a long time 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.949
 that will happened approved 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.949
 finish right away 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.249

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.689
 factories 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.689

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.999
 he referred in the 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:09.969
 saying goodbye to each other 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.740
 our municipality is busy 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.090
 have to conclude that it is not quite us in the first fifteen minutes
