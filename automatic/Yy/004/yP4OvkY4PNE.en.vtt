00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hi friends my name giancarlo and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.230
 we draw today we will draw kick 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.120
 buttowski I hope you like it 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.660
 The first thing we are going to do is draw 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.660
 his helmet 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.810
 then we draw a curved line 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.700
 then we will draw two curved lines 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.430
 as well 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.230
 down 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.660
 forming as an elongated ready m 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.660
 and we close his helmet 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.710
 well now we saw the outline of his face 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.629
 the bottom 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.180
 and we already have the head of our ski 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.660
 we will draw the eyes we will draw two 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660
 lines 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.969
 we will talk 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.409
 thus 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.820
 we draw our eyes 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.950
 now we will draw 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.159
 to find our ski car 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.159
 and we're going to start doing the neck 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.250
 d 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.250
 use of our football 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.230
 and we use your body 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.230
 it's an oval 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.450
 we go with your feet 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.990
 three lines in this way 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.830
 and a right in this part and we do 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.070
 the shoes 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.330
 the same 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.330
 three curved lines 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.390
 a right and we make your shoes in 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.009
 we continue with your jacket or your use 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.830
 and now what we need is to make the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.140
 hands of our team 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:30.360

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.360

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.210
