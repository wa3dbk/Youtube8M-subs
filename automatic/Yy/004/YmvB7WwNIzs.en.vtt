drum<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.079> rim<00:00:59.230> in<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.410> bass<00:00:59.559> drum<00:00:59.800> there

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
drum to the rim in the bass drum there

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.459 
drum to the rim in the bass drum there
to<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.820> edge<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.000> my<00:01:01.059> Tom<00:01:01.329> here<00:01:01.629> now<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.170> Tom's

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
to the edge of my Tom here now the Tom's

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.740 
to the edge of my Tom here now the Tom's
that<00:01:02.800> are<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.250> most<00:01:03.460> electric<00:01:03.850> it's<00:01:04.059> on<00:01:04.269> as

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
that are on the most electric it's on as

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.660 
that are on the most electric it's on as
big<00:01:04.930> as<00:01:05.049> these<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.950> what<00:01:06.100> I'm<00:01:06.250> also<00:01:06.460> looking

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
big as these so what I'm also looking

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.980 
big as these so what I'm also looking
for<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.090> distance<00:01:07.210> between<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.780> middle

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
for is the distance between the middle

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.539 
for is the distance between the middle
of<00:01:08.049> this<00:01:08.140> drum<00:01:08.409> in<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.890> middle<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.189> this<00:01:09.280> drum

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
of this drum in the middle of this drum

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.640 
of this drum in the middle of this drum
so<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.180> can<00:01:10.330> see<00:01:10.450> straight<00:01:11.170> across<00:01:11.350> would<00:01:11.560> be

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
so you can see straight across would be

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
so you can see straight across would be
here<00:01:11.860> so<00:01:12.159> it's<00:01:12.310> not<00:01:12.400> quite<00:01:12.580> straight<00:01:12.880> across

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
here so it's not quite straight across

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.570 
here so it's not quite straight across
it's<00:01:14.110> down<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.320> little<00:01:14.560> now<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:15.159> distance

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
it's down a little now that distance

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.039 
it's down a little now that distance
there<00:01:15.760> is<00:01:15.940> probably<00:01:16.180> right<00:01:16.299> 30<00:01:16.600> centimeters

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
there is probably right 30 centimeters

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.120 
there is probably right 30 centimeters
right<00:01:17.080> if<00:01:17.320> you're<00:01:17.440> really<00:01:17.650> anal<00:01:17.799> about<00:01:17.860> this

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
right if you're really anal about this

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.039 
right if you're really anal about this
stuff<00:01:18.340> get<00:01:19.000> a<00:01:19.030> ruler<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.479> measure<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.900> right

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
stuff get a ruler and measure it right

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.410 
stuff get a ruler and measure it right
from<00:01:20.500> here<00:01:20.830> I'm<00:01:21.700> not<00:01:21.850> coming<00:01:22.119> straight<00:01:22.360> back

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
from here I'm not coming straight back

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.020 
from here I'm not coming straight back
I'm<00:01:22.960> going<00:01:23.320> slightly<00:01:24.189> at<00:01:24.280> an<00:01:24.400> angle<00:01:24.729> pretty

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
I'm going slightly at an angle pretty

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.300 
I'm going slightly at an angle pretty
much<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.270> same<00:01:25.420> distance<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.500> maybe<00:01:26.740> 30<00:01:27.040> 40

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
much the same distance so maybe 30 40

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.420 
much the same distance so maybe 30 40
centimeters<00:01:28.000> 30<00:01:28.390> 40<00:01:28.720> centimeters<00:01:29.320> snare<00:01:30.159> drum

little<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.860> probably<00:01:42.040> needs<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> move

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
little so it probably needs to move

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.880 
little so it probably needs to move
across<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:43.030> about<00:01:43.210> there<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:44.560> there<00:01:44.740> means

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
across to about there now there means

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.039 
across to about there now there means
there's<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.040> massive<00:01:45.220> gap<00:01:45.490> well<00:01:45.670> guess<00:01:45.850> what<00:01:46.060> it

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
there's a massive gap well guess what it

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.660 
there's a massive gap well guess what it
doesn't<00:01:47.200> matter<00:01:47.409> because<00:01:47.590> you're<00:01:48.400> used<00:01:48.579> to

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
doesn't matter because you're used to

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.649 
doesn't matter because you're used to
playing<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.939> middle<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.270> drum<00:01:49.479> on<00:01:49.570> your

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
playing the middle of this drum on your

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.880 
playing the middle of this drum on your
acoustic<00:01:50.079> kit<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.439> used<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.619> play<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:50.829> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
acoustic kit and you used to play in the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.800 
acoustic kit and you used to play in the
middle<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.189> drum<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:51.970> would<00:01:52.600> be<00:01:52.689> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
middle of this drum so that would be the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.580 
middle of this drum so that would be the
edge<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.110> Tom<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.380> wouldn't

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
edge of the Tom that you wouldn't

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.050 
edge of the Tom that you wouldn't
normally<00:01:53.650> play<00:01:53.950> anyway<00:01:54.250> okay<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:54.700> that's<00:01:54.939> your

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
normally play anyway okay so that's your

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.660 
normally play anyway okay so that's your
first<00:01:55.210> step<00:01:55.390> your<00:01:56.320> second<00:01:56.650> step<00:01:56.829> so<00:01:57.130> I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
first step your second step so I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.740 
first step your second step so I
probably<00:01:57.880> push<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.210> frame<00:01:58.390> out<00:01:58.540> a<00:01:58.570> little

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
probably push the frame out a little

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.719 
probably push the frame out a little
more<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.530> get<00:01:59.590> down<00:01:59.829> to<00:01:59.950> my<00:02:00.070> third<00:02:00.220> tom<00:02:00.460> here

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
more and I get down to my third tom here

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.490 
more and I get down to my third tom here
now<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.570> is<00:02:01.689> a<00:02:01.720> lot<00:02:01.960> smaller<00:02:02.170> than<00:02:02.259> your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
now this is a lot smaller than your

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.660 
now this is a lot smaller than your
floor<00:02:02.680> tom<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.130> might<00:02:03.280> find<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.549> you

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
floor tom so you might find that you

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.399 
floor tom so you might find that you
have<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.790> push<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.390> bit<00:02:04.659> further<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.229> way

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
have to push it a bit further this way

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.800 
have to push it a bit further this way
and<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.790> earth<00:02:06.909> tour<00:02:07.270> thing<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.659> I<00:02:07.689> do

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
and this the earth tour thing that I do

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.050 
and this the earth tour thing that I do
I<00:02:07.990> normally<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:08.470> snare<00:02:08.860> drum<00:02:08.890> they<00:02:09.849> almost

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
I normally do snare drum they almost

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.380 
I normally do snare drum they almost
always<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:11.879> clamp<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.030> can<00:02:13.150> clamp<00:02:13.329> it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
always have a a clamp you can clamp it

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.179 
always have a a clamp you can clamp it
to<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.599> frame<00:02:13.779> with<00:02:13.809> my<00:02:14.379> first<00:02:14.769> snare<00:02:15.010> stand

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
to the frame with my first snare stand

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.509 
to the frame with my first snare stand
so<00:02:15.579> this<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.849> just<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.299> Yamaha<00:02:17.159> 12<00:02:18.159> inch<00:02:18.309> snare

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
so this is just a Yamaha 12 inch snare

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.200 
so this is just a Yamaha 12 inch snare
stand<00:02:18.730> I'm<00:02:18.909> sure

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
stand I'm sure

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.330 
stand I'm sure
millions<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.900> brands<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.260> do<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.800> you're

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
millions of brands that do it and you're

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.440 
millions of brands that do it and you're
just<00:02:21.520> finding<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.000> gives<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.270> lot<00:02:22.390> more

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
just finding that gives you a lot more

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.880 
just finding that gives you a lot more
maneuverability<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.320> get<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.560> your<00:02:23.680> cakes

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
maneuverability so you get on your cakes

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.230 
maneuverability so you get on your cakes
now<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:24.220> quite<00:02:24.400> not<00:02:24.610> quite<00:02:24.640> right<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.060> just

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
now it's quite not quite right you just

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.940 
now it's quite not quite right you just
move<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.990> other<00:02:26.020> thing<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.440> check<00:02:26.470> out<00:02:26.770> is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
move it the other thing to check out is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.470 
move it the other thing to check out is

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
the height of your snare so my snare

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.750 
the height of your snare so my snare
drum<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.960> put<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:29.830> next<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.550> would<00:02:30.700> be

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
drum I put this next to it this would be

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.580 
drum I put this next to it this would be

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
thing I just got to get this gap here

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.500 
thing I just got to get this gap here
well<00:02:48.460> that's<00:02:48.580> pretty<00:02:48.760> much<00:02:48.940> done<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
well that's pretty much done with the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.360 
well that's pretty much done with the
left<00:02:49.690> for<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.930> throw<00:02:50.110> them<00:02:50.290> hold<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
left for this throw them hold it so I

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.830 
left for this throw them hold it so I
put<00:02:51.460> my<00:02:51.700> phone<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:51.910> my<00:02:52.090> drums<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.630> checked

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
put my phone on my drums and I checked

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.540 
put my phone on my drums and I checked
the<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.260> height<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.250> kind<00:02:54.460> of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
the the height of that I can kind of

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
the the height of that I can kind of
estimate<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.210> angle<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.470> that's<00:02:56.680> my<00:02:56.800> Tom

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
estimate the angle and that's my Tom

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.370 
estimate the angle and that's my Tom
stirrup

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.440 
pretty easy all of all I'm looking for
the<00:03:02.980> very<00:03:03.130> center<00:03:03.490> of<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.610> drum<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.240> right

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.940 
the very center of the drum so right
here<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.200> how<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.470> relates<00:03:05.710> to<00:03:05.770> my<00:03:05.890> two

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
here and how that relates to my two

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.420 
here and how that relates to my two
Tom's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
Tom's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.120 
Tom's
well<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.000> can<00:03:07.120> see<00:03:07.240> it's<00:03:07.360> at<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.540> rim<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.960> my

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
well you can see it's at the rim of my

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.100 
well you can see it's at the rim of my
second<00:03:09.130> Tom<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.970> again<00:03:10.240> I<00:03:10.270> go<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.540> my<00:03:10.720> electric

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
second Tom so again I go to my electric

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.160 
second Tom so again I go to my electric
get<00:03:11.940> my<00:03:12.940> bass<00:03:13.120> drums<00:03:13.360> quite<00:03:13.510> believable<00:03:13.870> here

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
get my bass drums quite believable here

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.010 
get my bass drums quite believable here
so<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.710> find<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.640> second<00:03:16.090> tom<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.540> rim<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.930> I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
so I find the second tom the rim and I

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.720 
so I find the second tom the rim and I
come<00:03:17.200> down<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.380> put<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.710> center<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.460> pad

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
come down and put the center of this pad

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.820 
come down and put the center of this pad
here<00:03:18.970> there<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.170> for<00:03:20.290> me<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.560> gonna<00:03:20.650> move

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
here there so for me it's gonna move

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.340 
here there so for me it's gonna move
across<00:03:21.100> quite<00:03:21.460> a<00:03:21.490> lot<00:03:21.900> okay<00:03:22.900> know<00:03:23.080> what<00:03:23.110> you're

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
across quite a lot okay know what you're

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.350 
across quite a lot okay know what you're
often<00:03:23.470> fine<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.310> your<00:03:24.400> kit<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.880> nice<00:03:25.180> set

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
often fine is that your kit is nice set

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.150 
often fine is that your kit is nice set
up<00:03:25.480> completely<00:03:26.110> different<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.740> how<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.010> looks

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
up completely different to how it looks

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.360 
up completely different to how it looks
maybe<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.550> there<00:03:27.760> in<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.060> drum<00:03:28.270> shop<00:03:28.510> or<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:30.220> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
maybe in there in the drum shop or in a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.890 
maybe in there in the drum shop or in a
picture<00:03:30.760> you've<00:03:30.910> seen<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> bit<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.690> we've<00:03:31.810> got

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
picture you've seen a bit and we've got

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.500 
picture you've seen a bit and we've got
to<00:03:31.990> keep<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.260> mind<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.940> kits<00:03:34.180> set<00:03:34.390> up

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
to keep in mind is that the kits set up

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.290 
to keep in mind is that the kits set up
for<00:03:34.930> photoshoots<00:03:35.860> let's<00:03:36.220> say<00:03:36.370> how<00:03:37.000> often<00:03:37.270> a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
for photoshoots let's say how often a

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.030 
for photoshoots let's say how often a
Serb<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.780> kits<00:03:37.990> look<00:03:38.410> great<00:03:38.680> then<00:03:38.860> don't

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
Serb so the kits look great then don't

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.530 
Serb so the kits look great then don't
care<00:03:39.220> about<00:03:39.280> how<00:03:39.580> they're<00:03:39.820> gonna<00:03:40.030> feel<00:03:40.180> when

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
care about how they're gonna feel when

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.330 
care about how they're gonna feel when
you<00:03:40.600> sit<00:03:40.780> behind<00:03:40.900> them<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.860> often<00:03:42.130> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
you sit behind them and often the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.830 
you sit behind them and often the
connector<00:03:42.700> kiss<00:03:42.880> often<00:03:43.150> where<00:03:43.270> I've<00:03:43.360> cables

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
connector kiss often where I've cables

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.650 
connector kiss often where I've cables
on<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.670> acoustic<00:03:45.670> sick<00:03:45.850> kids<00:03:46.090> will<00:03:46.210> be<00:03:46.300> set<00:03:46.600> up

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
on and acoustic sick kids will be set up

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.350 
on and acoustic sick kids will be set up
in<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.840> way<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.020> you<00:03:47.290> can<00:03:47.440> see<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:48.700> brand<00:03:49.000> that

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
in a way so you can see the brand that

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.730 
in a way so you can see the brand that
are<00:03:49.450> labeling<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.050> kind<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.350> stuff<00:03:50.530> rather

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
are labeling that kind of stuff rather

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.930 
are labeling that kind of stuff rather
than<00:03:50.860> how<00:03:51.010> you're<00:03:51.160> gonna<00:03:51.250> see<00:03:51.460> it<00:03:51.520> on<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.700> kit

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
than how you're gonna see it on the kit

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.450 
than how you're gonna see it on the kit
now<00:03:52.570> what<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.200> want<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.500> try<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.740> do<00:03:53.860> is

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
now what you want to try and do is

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.910 
now what you want to try and do is
mirror<00:03:55.120> your<00:03:55.450> acoustic<00:03:55.750> kick<00:03:56.110> exactly<00:03:56.830> the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
mirror your acoustic kick exactly the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.130 
mirror your acoustic kick exactly the
same<00:03:57.100> on<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.970> electric<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.480> your<00:03:58.600> cue<00:03:58.870> stick

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
same on the electric that your cue stick

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.050 
same on the electric that your cue stick
may<00:03:59.440> be<00:03:59.500> completely<00:04:00.400> different<00:04:00.460> to<00:04:00.700> my<00:04:00.880> right

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
may be completely different to my right

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.090 
may be completely different to my right
you<00:04:01.180> may<00:04:01.330> have<00:04:01.540> 10<00:04:01.840> toms<00:04:02.110> then<00:04:02.950> all<00:04:03.070> around

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
you may have 10 toms then all around

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.070 
you may have 10 toms then all around
here<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:03.760> I'm<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.150> might<00:04:04.300> be<00:04:04.420> your<00:04:04.570> thing<00:04:04.750> if

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
here and I'm it might be your thing if

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.400 
here and I'm it might be your thing if
that's<00:04:05.200> your<00:04:05.410> thing<00:04:05.470> still<00:04:06.370> use<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.640> same

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
that's your thing still use the same

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.810 
that's your thing still use the same
ideas<00:04:08.410> I've<00:04:08.560> given<00:04:08.740> you<00:04:08.800> today<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:09.280> set<00:04:09.760> you

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
ideas I've given you today I set you

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.950 
ideas I've given you today I set you
electric<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.300> like<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:10.690> then<00:04:10.780> when<00:04:10.870> you

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
electric it like that and then when you

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.620 
electric it like that and then when you
go<00:04:11.110> through<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:12.100> -<00:04:12.340> hopefully<00:04:12.970> you'll<00:04:13.300> be<00:04:13.330> a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
go through the - hopefully you'll be a

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:22.030 
go through the - hopefully you'll be a
lot<00:04:13.840> more<00:04:13.960> comfortable<00:04:14.170> for<00:04:14.560> you

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.850 

okay<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.520> just<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.820> got<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.230> td-30<00:04:24.230> kit<00:04:24.560> set<00:04:24.770> up

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
okay I just I got this td-30 kit set up

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.930 
okay I just I got this td-30 kit set up
I<00:04:24.920> just<00:04:25.040> want<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.250> show<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.430> one<00:04:25.580> last<00:04:25.730> thing

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
I just want to show you one last thing

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.310 
I just want to show you one last thing
to<00:04:26.420> do<00:04:26.510> is<00:04:26.540> set<00:04:26.750> Annapolis<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.140> do<00:04:27.230> with

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
to do is set Annapolis to do with

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.100 
to do is set Annapolis to do with
symbols<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.220> often<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:28.850> go<00:04:28.970> on<00:04:29.030> peoples<00:04:29.360> v-jump

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
symbols so often I go on peoples v-jump

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.390 
symbols so often I go on peoples v-jump
kits<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.800> symbols<00:04:31.100> don't<00:04:31.250> trigger

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
kits and the symbols don't trigger

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.370 
kits and the symbols don't trigger
correctly<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.630> more<00:04:32.750> not<00:04:32.960> one<00:04:33.230> of<00:04:33.320> the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
correctly and the more not one of the

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.350 
correctly and the more not one of the
reasons<00:04:34.130> often<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.670> is<00:04:34.940> simply<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
reasons often for that is simply the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.580 
reasons often for that is simply the
placement<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.780> symbol<00:04:36.080> so<00:04:36.200> if<00:04:36.290> I<00:04:36.350> show<00:04:36.380> you

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
placement the symbol so if I show you

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.780 
placement the symbol so if I show you
these<00:04:36.740> symbols<00:04:37.100> now<00:04:38.110> from<00:04:39.110> above<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.500> can<00:04:39.680> see

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
these symbols now from above you can see

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.940 
these symbols now from above you can see
Road<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:40.970> sign<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.450> here<00:04:42.320> where<00:04:42.560> my<00:04:42.680> finger

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
Road and sign and here where my finger

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.170 
Road and sign and here where my finger
is<00:04:42.980> just<00:04:43.280> underneath<00:04:43.490> here<00:04:43.760> has<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> little

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
is just underneath here has a little

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.030 
is just underneath here has a little
triangle<00:04:44.570> pointing<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.020> way<00:04:45.080> well<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.950> is

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
triangle pointing this way well this is

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.530 
triangle pointing this way well this is
kind<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.250> let's<00:04:46.490> call<00:04:46.640> it<00:04:46.700> the<00:04:46.790> sweet<00:04:46.970> spot<00:04:47.300> so

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
kind of let's call it the sweet spot so

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.240 
kind of let's call it the sweet spot so
if<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.020> hit<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.230> symbol<00:04:48.470> here<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.860> picks<00:04:49.100> up

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
if you hit the symbol here it picks up

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.250 
if you hit the symbol here it picks up
clearly<00:04:49.910> off<00:04:50.060> then<00:04:50.630> when<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.780> hit<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.990> symbol

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
clearly off then when you hit the symbol

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.780 
clearly off then when you hit the symbol
around<00:04:51.470> here<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:51.950> further<00:04:52.220> back<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.580> doesn't

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
around here and further back it doesn't

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.430 
around here and further back it doesn't
pick<00:04:52.970> up<00:04:53.060> as<00:04:53.210> well<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.690> still<00:04:53.900> picks<00:04:54.140> up<00:04:54.290> but

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
pick up as well it still picks up but

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.050 
pick up as well it still picks up but
not<00:04:54.590> very<00:04:54.710> well<00:04:54.830> it's<00:04:55.310> often<00:04:55.610> people<00:04:55.700> have<00:04:55.970> the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
not very well it's often people have the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.370 
not very well it's often people have the
symbols<00:04:56.420> this<00:04:56.540> way<00:04:56.690> rather<00:04:56.870> be<00:04:57.080> hitting<00:04:57.320> it

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
symbols this way rather be hitting it

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.870 
symbols this way rather be hitting it
here<00:04:57.620> wondering<00:04:58.040> why<00:04:58.130> they<00:04:58.280> signed<00:04:58.490> all<00:04:58.670> four

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
here wondering why they signed all four

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.370 
here wondering why they signed all four
so<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.630> want<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.840> make<00:04:59.960> sure<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.260> the

so you want to make sure that the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.510 
so you want to make sure that the
rolling<00:05:00.710> sign<00:05:01.060> it's<00:05:02.060> facing<00:05:02.270> away<00:05:02.540> from<00:05:02.660> you

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520

crushed in Bobby here my ride cymbal

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.110 
crushed in Bobby here my ride cymbal
probably<00:05:11.780> here<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.470> here<00:05:13.100> so<00:05:13.880> their<00:05:14.000> view

probably here and here so their view

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.860 
probably here and here so their view
from<00:05:14.240> my<00:05:14.360> kit

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
from my kit

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.670 
from my kit
same<00:05:15.620> with<00:05:15.740> heights<00:05:16.040> as<00:05:16.190> well<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:17.410> play<00:05:18.410> kind<00:05:18.620> of

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
same with heights as well I play kind of

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.130 
same with heights as well I play kind of
here<00:05:18.950> only<00:05:19.160> so<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:19.700> is<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:19.910> sweet<00:05:20.120> spot<00:05:20.240> it's

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.740 
here only so this is the sweet spot it's
in<00:05:21.320> more<00:05:23.200> symbol<00:05:24.730> and<00:05:25.730> ride<00:05:25.940> cymbal<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:26.600> this

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
in more symbol and ride cymbal so this

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.280 
in more symbol and ride cymbal so this
is<00:05:26.900> my<00:05:26.990> final<00:05:27.200> setup<00:05:28.540> I'm<00:05:29.540> tweaking<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.200> over
