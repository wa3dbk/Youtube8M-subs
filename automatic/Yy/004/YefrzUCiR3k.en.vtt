00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
strange because it straightens very very

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.320 
strange because it straightens very very
good<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.870> i<00:02:34.049> said<00:02:34.190> when<00:02:35.190> i<00:02:35.220> had<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.700> way

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
good but like i said when i had it way

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.039 
good but like i said when i had it way
be<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:37.280> looks<00:02:38.280> thick<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.180> when<00:02:40.019> I

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
be it looks thick and when I

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.640 
be it looks thick and when I
straightened<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.400> now<00:02:42.150> looks<00:02:42.450> thin<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.319> it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
straightened it it now looks thin so it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.110 
straightened it it now looks thin so it
also<00:02:44.250> makes<00:02:44.610> my<00:02:44.819> hair<00:02:45.060> look<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.420> lot<00:02:45.629> bigger<00:02:45.900> so

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
also makes my hair look a lot bigger so

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.690 
also makes my hair look a lot bigger so
so<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.840> positive<00:02:49.680> negative<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.430> thinner

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
so it's a positive negative the thinner

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.119 
so it's a positive negative the thinner
it<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.569> know<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.900> also<00:02:52.019> its<00:02:52.319> natural<00:02:52.890> a
