00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.659
 hahaha 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.160
 nooo 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.789
 ahahha 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.129
 okay 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 nooo 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.560
 nice guys here 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.429
 black paul 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.179
 eh here we are for a new video 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.019
 for this hello stuff 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.109
 Facebook 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.349
 a little place will be because I'm running with 96 euros 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.920
 that the sniper 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.740
 censis using variable zoom 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.480
 as is bonos use 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840
 inflexible if 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.860
 the sleight of hand pro en 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.680
 marathon seemed to me 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.820
 and but I must say that I do quite well 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.690
 badoo 30 killer 4 dead 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.740
 here &amp; lt 3 the asshole 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.480
 second chance for the cinema 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.520
 this is the game you see it 4 frame 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.989
 and I'm using 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710
 plot the star streaming 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.190
 that extension of movement and then the rewards 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.360
 I am not using complex realities so we are mostly civilized 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.900
 at the concertino 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.930
 who are like compressed apples are looked at with the shit ball but 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.799
 however I must say that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.620
 4 also a good match 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.920
 to as secondary soo of the 175 unified contribution 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.080
 a good match 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.120
 and but 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.030
 these days he made many matches with sniper 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.170
 and I understood many things about us 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.549
 tg5 are marrying that they get married darkened phantom 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.720
 if I understood a lot of things because it's the check in this game I'm really 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.090
 difficult to use in my opinion 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.350
 because apart from the fact 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.220
 spike 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.010
 but not on human fast winnerland sleight of hand pro 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.339
 no profit no difficult to use 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.349
 and especially 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.099
 there are many maria in my opinion 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.229
 the only two ciccini that 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.469
 I think it's worth it 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.629
 just the clear stools only 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.809
 This 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.149
 ciel l96a1 el psg1 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.409
 I repeat 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.709
 without accessories 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.730
 because psg1 without accessories believe me 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.919
 does more damage 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:40.269
 who is a psg1 with accessories so do not put on and accessories becomes the specy 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.809
 give life to the end 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.989
 then I'm using the variable zoom because I find myself better 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:51.289
 ammmore center caricature increased I don't need it when you play everyone against 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.149
 all 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.200
 so in the cooing I like it 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.779
 I like the one more for the purpose 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.089
 and me 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:04.769
 which you would call assistance with architect 75 for 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.099
 after 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.889
 but the paypal the strongest gun 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.709
 just that I prefer it to drop my body in, don't put the fire on it 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.289
 automatic because it has a truck 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.100
 but 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.490
 is not that it is better because airplay hoping with automatic fire ends 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.679
 precisely so 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.719
 you know where the same thing goes 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.529
 I make myself a little star without a knife 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:39.009
 it was better to make good wishes of the artifacts by making wishes and 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.779
 for the new year I am 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:46.039
 is about to leave and before leaving, however, I wanted you 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:47.900
 here 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.769
 I wanted to name an enemy that you take all you know is called law staelens 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.629
 good for a few days that we play together and very nice and there 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.389
 have fun faxing 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.069
 esse3 also makes video reads sa gallbladder pc even in a short while I will have 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.209
 it's very nice so go sign up 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.209
 you already know the qwerty keyboard 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.009
 that mark us text in all three of the itp 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.459
 of Italy if 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.840
 so I advise you to see our clan channel 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.349
 you write if you want 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.070
 then I don't have that 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.320
 very high level ne klan 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.860
 so ask and you will be 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.310
 snakes on Monday and higher if I have to read or enter but I don't know 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.830
 registrations are not open either 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.529
 however m 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.309
 many people ask me if it was a scrap trap like any other 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.020
 I can't because they have something to do with it 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.770
 and then you asked me how it's done 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.330
 what are the thousand ways 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.310
 so to get up to speed quickly the currency is 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:02.789
 headquarters 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.740
 called search and destroy 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.710
 however I advise you to touch search and destroy if you are good at it 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.050
 because you have special make more points 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.009
 between 6 and 7 players without experience I recommend life play quartier 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.009
 general for you assures you many. 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:26.669
 I take a catastrophe. 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.150
 ak74u popfax 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.229
 with my sparticulo recipes 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.900
 more easily 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 because when you get rid of 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.210
 check in as soon as the card is finished 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.569
 therefore 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.949
 if you know you are looking for the help sniper concepts 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.469
 not all models are costs but 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:52.719
 see way 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.860
 from an average distance 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.309
 fountain in room long enough as I want to do this game. 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.860
 botanical journal always keeping distance 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:04.720
 is 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.389
 what to say 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.419
 the game is almost over even comment this will be the last comment 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:13.699
 of 2010 to me that 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:14.730
 the face 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.210
 a line session and then it loads me all of a shot to the purely 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.809
 comments rooms for the holidays 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.430
 which bath the inter 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.560
 weather 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.469
 I liked this game 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.509
 or at least I hope 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.119
 s ... we'll see this finale in a beautiful film 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.889
 nice good 2010 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.059
 happy New Year
