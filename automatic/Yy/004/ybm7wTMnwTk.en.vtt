 Unfortunately for us it was a little cook Video of me he said «We do one 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.800
 rest day 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
 wished that had the ideology 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.310
 Ellen Ueberschar 1 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.270
 and there the real sticking point in July 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.369
 and now at the end of August 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.060
 but nonetheless, think yummy 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.250
 he wants to get on the tube here with Selim Teber recipe suggestions 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.119
 Employees let and who ever goes 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.009
 Alcoa is aware of it 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.770
 aware of the calories 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.380
 without such complaints 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.309
 Prof, we do not stop today like a motorcycle with a lot of hello 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.469
 he does not taste good and make Feliciano Lopez I pull myself a bit 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.080
 under 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.540
 Dancing on the Ceiling explained role model similar to the last time 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.270
 But everyone had already said Barnes thanked the members of the Dr 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 Starr's in the Dingle 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700
 Danilo today just like that 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.800
 Irena 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.010
 so use 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 to read 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.230
 loud 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.490
 if side since then a little stupid turned on so they do not like that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.370
 clever San Simeon 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.730
 obviously not knowing 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.870
 frustrating 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.870
 that is possible 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.430
 Super RTL's ingredient list percent writes Rech and Andy Borgs 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.530
 and because it was here to stay for the tournament I would be really easy 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.720
 Percent that were accordingly in the closet 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.700
 we were only thinking of a smart metering clues 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.160
 RTL wanted to keep it that way, it's the same in a real life tournament 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.550
 that's the nicest thing on the net 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.220
 Fuck a fuck 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.410
 it will 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.540
 very simple and money since then missing any or a big speech on 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.720
 best 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.470
 happig cut small 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.250
 chronic meats meat only from the region but also happen to mime 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.110
 that's the way it is 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.420
 200 Kontron 50 but carry or so it is this 500 grams of pasta 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.329
 More and more young women are a little relaxed 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.480
 and in that the ard-journalists otherwise determined in both cases as 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.369
 planned 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.369
 and of course not to forget one 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.189
 r 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.219
 Daniel

 the enormous range of an instrument Dieter blessed 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.179
 APA and of course a nice glass one enjoys 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.119
 Complain class itself lamented 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.579
 but there may be a bit more Senta AX percent too 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.459
 m 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.509
 you can see 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.509
 the next 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.229
 yes, already known 30 us dollars 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.649
 and he does not say so rarely used 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:55.810
 MT 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.810
 I 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.569
 100 percent 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.769
 just dissolve a hot water 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.769
 and percent I did that 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.379
 and that could be different or better 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.379
 as the landlady Inge Baecker 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.319
 Pölten 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.930
 APA, of course, the weather 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.559
 remains under 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:42.389
 Stallone but all that beautiful untouched 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.620
 and important is that get through pulls so 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.960
 she recommends that 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.960
 Now every day to prepare valuable 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.889
 Iris is considered relatively fast 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.330
 without a plan 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
 tastes great 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.659
 At present only dancers are planning to go through 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.960
 be more confident and more up through more 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.069
 Well 4 DUP wins 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.409
 unheard 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.569
 No, I'm sure that's the way to go 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.009
 Geely wants Bellamy 9 4 1 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.459
 and then everyone should make out that's not the point 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.400
 Just clean up Resi 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 Dr then different view what you did not look away 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.830
 Werner Wenning mechanical magpies that the sausage just out 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.559
 No you can always talk that 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:11.649
 just like a Ernst Schwitters new one, you do not have to do everything the same way 

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:13.740
 do what can scare you 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.150
 and around 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.779
 yes banks if they go through 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:19.490
