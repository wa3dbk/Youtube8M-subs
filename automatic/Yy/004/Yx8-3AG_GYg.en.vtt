00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Simple and understandable task. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Defend the base for 10 minutes. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Only, or certainly understandable? 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 The eastern flank has been cleaned. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 The enemy does not have a single vehicle there. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 In contrast, the western flank falls. So what to do? 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Return to the base immediately. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Well, unless you're brainless ... 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 ... a red-orange monkey. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 At Dicker Max, KV-1 or M5A1 Stuart. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 This is the way, even if a man would double and fight ... 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 ... by the decision of three idiots, he loses the battle. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 It's now on the other leg. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 It will hurt even more. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Three in the battle of the fours. Standard. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 In the previous battle there were 3 bezmÃ³zgie apes. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 There will be 11 of them. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 The center fell. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 But I do not care about absolutely none ... 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 ... from the remaining 11 monkeys. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 You could see on the minimap ... 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 ... how the T-28 trots to the base. Hetzer is behind him. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 But what is a minimap? 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Well, theoretically. Let's consider options. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Two enemies at the base. What can you do NOW ... 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 ... if the debile missed the last 40 seconds? 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 a) enter 3 into the enemy base 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 b) enter the enemy base in 3, and let the quickest ones return after decap 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 c) there is no option c) 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Monkeys prove that there is option c). 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 This is how serial killers are born.
