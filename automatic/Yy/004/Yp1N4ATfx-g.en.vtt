00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.229
 se 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.090
 still forgot about weekends on the channel 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.780
 NTV and you can watch the sequel 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.460
 series gangster Petersburg 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.500
 music for the film has become so popular 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
 that they began to translate melodies 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 for mobile phones 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.359
 for example this morning we go out on 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.150
 St. Petersburg theme to 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.730
 talk with the author of this music 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.429
 famous composer igor 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.060
 Korneliuk om Igor you do not hear good 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 morning good morning hear you well a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470
 after all, on Petersburg itself came 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 but it has come but winter does not give up its 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.789
 positions and it snows 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.299
 it's snowing gone last night on 

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.080
 match zenith stronger 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.320
 but ovos spirit smells in the spring I 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 I hope that it will come soon 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.889
 full spring 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:48.760
 and most importantly long-awaited 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.900
 but we will not return to music as well as everything for that is from 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.410
 this kind of popularity when 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.800
 your melodies are heard from mobile phones 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.650
 the project started at first 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.940
 then cocktail delivery 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.550
 I think, and probably not the main thing 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.410
 the main thing 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.090
 music cinema project in my opinion is very 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.880
 accurately write music 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.630
 intonation that would fit 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 common vision of the picture to a friend 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.430
 situations if you want 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.220
 and everything else is not so important 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.240
 I allow myself to clarify discharged 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.590
 music in gangster Petersburg from the first 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.460
 the movie 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.500
 yes this percentage 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.840
 first second third and fourth 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.270
 but how many musical themes was 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.510
 written for the show 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.000
 so much music was written 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.130
 that here these are the last gangster 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.700
 Petersburg, frankly speaking 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.230
 I lost my account almost there 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.070
 have worked 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.900
 but because the directors are already 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.250
 the row set up music and winter stuff and 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.510
 all written to this picture that music so 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.040
 much that yes i am even joking like so early i 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.960
 argued with one edge director that i'm from 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.110
 music gangster Petersburg can can 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.569
 voice any picture 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.169
 living according to Kalinin if you want 

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:04.999
 because there is for all occasions 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.039
 to my mind 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.009
 wonderful 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.929
 but what happened your creative tandem 11 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.470
 Eugene Plushenko after all 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.090
 music from gangster petersburg he 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.959
 performed one of his programs 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.579
 really it was 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.070
 hey fly 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.160
 how easy 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.230
 expression he didn't just call 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.669
 a certain Alexey Nikolaevich Mishin 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.069
 percentage of coaches to his wife and said that Libya has 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.249
 us problem 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.719
 how do we make arbitrary 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.630
 the program 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.710
 I did not offer Rakhmaninov and I told him 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.060
 will come offered Palestrina and I 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.980
 wants nothing but you well I was joking 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.909
 which is no longer good taste 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.420
 and that's when I but I had to show them 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.089
 make this program 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.279
 five times since in general my 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:47.990
 mapped out 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.020
 not because there are no checks 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.429
 came 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.290
 n misha jury show 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.010
 wife process 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.500
 and said that in this place and not enough 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.950
 breathing in this place 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.599
 I want to spend more shirshov 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.980
 lengthen for one second and here 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.089
 shorten 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.939
 and it was very funny to watch when 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.099
 I was told that here in this place is double 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.630
 sheepskin coat 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.410
 it is clear or not incomprehensible and then 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.300
 decided not to show 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.990
 and this is the ending when I'm right in 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.940
 the studio shows more among 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.610
 musical instruments it was 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.710
 very funny here but nevertheless after 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.909
 the fifth time the program was already 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.699
 rao absolutely everything is written 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.919
 he was comfortable everything was fine 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.290
 and when did not go to the world championship 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.300
 I told him 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.379
 You owe Kristina gold because 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.359
 and she spent a lot of work and will 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.049
 It is very disappointing if I try and I am very 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.729
 happy 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.889
 so that my wife won the gold 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:46.819
 medal 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.549
 but I thought that the percentage was and still 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:50.879
 to maintain friendship with Plushenko 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.640
 even been at the wedding 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.659
 radar yes 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.489
 there cooperation will continue 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.509
 don't know ohh say the same river don't enter 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.349
 twice 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.249
 although in a river called gangster 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.059
 brought Petersburg entered already in my 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.799
 time 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.589
 with all of this we ask m i am not really 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:10.230
 supporter of this whole thing 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.959
 ii and I don't like replicating any 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:13.649
 form 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.159
 therefore, it does not seem like any 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.419
 the appearance of a trial 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.019
 art but there must be something 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.079
 unique 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.830
 but we live at such a time 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.130
 l when 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.650
 the economy determines a lot to 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.710
 sorry 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.349
 but what affects 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.179
 on your decision to write music to that 

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:34.879
 or another film or not 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:39.520
 much my condition m let's say so 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.739
 momentary and this alien center should 

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:44.259
 be interesting 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.680
 I can say about 500 percent 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.809
 his picture 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.439
 Heaven who wrote music to what I wrote 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.399
 All that I was offered described 

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:54.569
 because i was stuffing my hand i was learning 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.219
 but I am also studying right now so happy 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:58.789
 the fact that I have so life 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:04:59.520
 it turns out 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.620
 that you all the time something happened and this 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.379
 great 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.559
 It seems to me that the percentage of Volsk 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.419
 man especially 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.659
 in the year of his university should 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.509
 pass all my life 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.990
 but such a center now of course for 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.860
 My main point is the subject 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.530
 she should inspire me should be very 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.830
 interesting for me to catch fire I don't 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.939
 I can write music calm state 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.129
 should be in connection with this quickly and 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.110
 fought composer find common language with 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.069
 movie director last words then 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.319
 remains 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.089
 p differently happens differently happens but 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:36.980
 check a person 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.779
 reasonable and flexible and is 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.860
 I can refuse why I am glad 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.000
 oao general idea for the common goal and 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.050
 since the director takes the picture I'm 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.789
 always thought the director thanks 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.440
 thank you, but I remind you that today is different 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.580
 carried out by teleconference petersburg and a 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.070
 our studio ntv and petersburg itself was 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.040
 composer Igor Kornelyuk who 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.560
 wrote a percentage of the music to the series 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.070
 gangster Petersburg thanks we still 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.170
 will be back
