so the idea that somehow hard surfaces
in<00:01:36.240> particular<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:37.020> some<00:01:37.320> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> bug<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> boo

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
in particular are some kind of bug a boo

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.060 
in particular are some kind of bug a boo
that<00:01:38.640> you've<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.119> avoid<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:40.040> although<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that you've got to avoid as although I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
that you've got to avoid as although I
fully<00:01:41.490> admit<00:01:41.670> running<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.299> nature<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
fully admit running in nature and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990 
fully admit running in nature and
running<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.229> soft<00:01:43.530> ground<00:01:43.740> has<00:01:44.009> its<00:01:44.250> beauty<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
running on soft ground has its beauty to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.319 
running on soft ground has its beauty to
the<00:01:45.240> truth<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.590> mind<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.670> need<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the truth is in my mind you need to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.420 
the truth is in my mind you need to
master<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.649> least<00:01:49.860> come<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.340> an

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
master or at least come to an

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.850 
master or at least come to an
understanding<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.270> hard<00:01:51.869> surfaces<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
understanding that hard surfaces in and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.270 
understanding that hard surfaces in and
of<00:01:53.009> themselves<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:55.200> nemesis<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of themselves are not your nemesis and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.760 
of themselves are not your nemesis and
the<00:01:56.820> way<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> find<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.350> by<00:01:58.590> learning

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the way you find that out is by learning

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
the way you find that out is by learning
how<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.070> move<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.490> them<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.479> turns<00:02:00.719> out

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
how to move on them and it turns out

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.109 
how to move on them and it turns out
it's<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.619> easy<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.579> hard<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:03.030> all

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it's really easy it's not hard at all

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.929 
it's really easy it's not hard at all
and<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.960> hints<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.469> very<00:02:04.649> simple<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.579> just

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and the hints are very simple it's just

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
and the hints are very simple it's just
like<00:02:06.119> when<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> ask<00:02:06.600> people<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.990> jump<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.469> at

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
like when I ask people to jump up at

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.460 
like when I ask people to jump up at
land<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.000> land<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.050> land<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
land when they land you can land on a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.510 
land when they land you can land on a
very<00:02:10.739> hard<00:02:10.979> surface<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> way<00:02:11.730> that's<00:02:11.970> not

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
very hard surface in a way that's not

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.490 
very hard surface in a way that's not
hang<00:02:12.610> our<00:02:12.760> pounding<00:02:13.180> by<00:02:13.570> simply<00:02:13.990> bending<00:02:14.410> your

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
hang our pounding by simply bending your

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.990 
hang our pounding by simply bending your
knees<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.740> little<00:02:15.010> bit<00:02:15.160> landing<00:02:15.640> more<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
knees a little bit landing more on the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.490 
knees a little bit landing more on the
forefoot<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.450> allowing<00:02:16.930> yourself<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.290> get

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
forefoot and allowing yourself to get

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.590 
forefoot and allowing yourself to get
into<00:02:17.710> this<00:02:17.830> position<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.760> then<00:02:19.480> you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
into this position here and then you

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600 
into this position here and then you
start<00:02:19.870> thinking<00:02:20.080> what<00:02:20.830> about<00:02:21.040> these<00:02:21.190> guys<00:02:21.400> you

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
start thinking what about these guys you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.670 
start thinking what about these guys you
know<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.880> pretty<00:02:22.150> good<00:02:22.330> example<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.870> what<00:02:23.620> you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
know a pretty good example of what you

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.740 
know a pretty good example of what you
can<00:02:23.920> do<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.490> start<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.000> why<00:02:25.210> that<00:02:25.480> would<00:02:25.630> be

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
can do to start and why that would be

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.600 
can do to start and why that would be
beneficial<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.530> it's<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.280> difference

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
beneficial is it's the difference

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.580 
beneficial is it's the difference
between<00:02:27.670> landing<00:02:28.240> on<00:02:28.330> your<00:02:28.450> heel<00:02:28.590> where

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
between landing on your heel where

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.320 
between landing on your heel where
you're<00:02:29.980> really<00:02:30.160> not<00:02:30.400> loading<00:02:30.970> your<00:02:31.090> body

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
you're really not loading your body

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.240 
you're really not loading your body
whereas<00:02:32.050> when<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.290> jump<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.860> land<00:02:33.040> like

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
whereas when you jump up and land like

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.430 
whereas when you jump up and land like
this<00:02:33.280> you're<00:02:34.090> sort<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.450> loading<00:02:35.110> you're

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
this you're sort of loading you're

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.230 
this you're sort of loading you're
beginning<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.040> sort<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.400> load<00:02:36.700> your<00:02:37.030> body

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
beginning to sort of load your body

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.140 
beginning to sort of load your body
you're<00:02:37.480> preparing<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.320> if<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.010> get<00:02:39.970> into

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
you're preparing it and if you get into

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.660 
you're preparing it and if you get into
a<00:02:40.270> quick<00:02:40.600> enough<00:02:40.870> turnover<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.490> actually

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
a quick enough turnover you can actually

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.850 
a quick enough turnover you can actually
recoil<00:02:43.570> some<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.960> that<00:02:44.140> energy<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.560> your

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
recoil some of that energy that your

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.710 
recoil some of that energy that your
temporary<00:02:45.280> loading<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.240> perfect

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
temporary loading and the perfect

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.510 
temporary loading and the perfect
example<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.950> when<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.730> see<00:02:48.910> those

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
example of that is when you see those

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.130 
example of that is when you see those
boxers<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.670> get<00:02:51.820> into<00:02:52.120> their<00:02:52.270> into<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.900> rhythm

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
boxers to get into their into the rhythm

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.660 
boxers to get into their into the rhythm
when<00:02:53.410> they're<00:02:53.590> doing<00:02:53.770> their<00:02:53.950> jump<00:02:54.220> roping<00:02:54.550> I

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
when they're doing their jump roping I

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.310 
when they're doing their jump roping I
mean<00:02:54.970> they<00:02:55.090> don't<00:02:55.210> do<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:57.630> right<00:02:58.630> they<00:02:59.170> get

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
mean they don't do this right they get

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.040 
mean they don't do this right they get
into<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.710> rhythm<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.540> they<00:03:01.540> get<00:03:01.720> into<00:03:01.870> that

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
into this rhythm and they get into that

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.440 
into this rhythm and they get into that
rhythm<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.500> what's<00:03:02.740> happening<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.400> energy<00:03:04.390> is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
rhythm and what's happening is energy is

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.880 
rhythm and what's happening is energy is
coming<00:03:04.600> into<00:03:04.990> them<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.350> it's<00:03:05.530> coming<00:03:05.710> out

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
coming into them and it's coming out

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.440 
coming into them and it's coming out
it's<00:03:06.040> recoiling<00:03:06.610> they're<00:03:06.940> getting<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.240> chance

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
it's recoiling they're getting a chance

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.260 
it's recoiling they're getting a chance
to<00:03:07.720> sort<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.280> temporarily<00:03:09.280> store<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.910> release

and i really get really get a lot of joy
out<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.920> staying<00:04:47.310> where<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.970> almost

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
out of that staying where it's almost

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.660 
out of that staying where it's almost
like<00:04:48.630> whoa<00:04:49.380> what's<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:50.100> know<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.340> sound<00:04:50.520> of

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
one hand clapping and I want to maintain

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.000 
one hand clapping and I want to maintain
that<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.480> then<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.110> second<00:04:55.440> thing<00:04:55.470> has<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.860> do

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
that and then the second thing has to do

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.770 
that and then the second thing has to do
with<00:04:56.220> being<00:04:56.700> able<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:57.030> keep<00:04:57.210> up<00:04:57.360> at<00:04:57.570> much

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
with being able to keep up at much

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.360 
with being able to keep up at much
quicker<00:04:58.080> cadence<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.800> I've<00:04:58.920> been<00:04:59.070> used<00:04:59.280> to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
quicker cadence that I've been used to

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.850 
quicker cadence that I've been used to
it's<00:04:59.670> much<00:04:59.940> much<00:05:00.600> different<00:05:01.110> than<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.620> kind

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
it's much much different than the kind

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.500 
it's much much different than the kind
of<00:05:01.950> plotting<00:05:02.250> movement<00:05:02.850> pattern<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.300> so

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
of plotting movement pattern that so

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.760 
of plotting movement pattern that so
many<00:05:03.630> people<00:05:03.780> are<00:05:04.080> used<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.410> when<00:05:04.620> they're

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
many people are used to when they're

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.100
