00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.119
 hello to all those we find 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.240
 today for the second episode of 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.890
 creature word guide so this second 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.590
 episode will be devoted to ostriches so 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.720
 the spawn ostriches in the deserts and 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.790
 in the plains 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.650
 if you attack an ostrich if it's 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.230
 an evil so we recognize it by its color 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.930
 the bottom line is that here here it's a 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.840
 female so the evil will attack you that 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.290
 if you type a female like this the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.010
 female without fur to and will put her head 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.949
 in the sand 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:01:00.170
 so we'll see that makes me that's like 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:04.699
 these here after the ostriches 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.280
 so do not tame but do not 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.159
 could somehow 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.580
 taming them by stealing an egg 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.600
 Ostrich because the other us pump 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.880
 having with this offer 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.579
 so we're next to a torch in 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.369
 waiting for it is close tinsel they 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:26.359
 hatch rats he will follow you 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.140
 and then once who will follow us when 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.920
 he will be bigger 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.439
 you can give him a saddle like 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.200
 this one above to mount on 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.630
 knowing that ostriches are going pretty 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.579
 quickly so the males are more 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.369
 faster than females and others 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.939
 bino chains so are pretty rare good 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.979
 much faster 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.820
 I thought I read on sites that 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.609
 ostriches so can wear a helmet 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.689
 or a chest 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.399
 personally I try and come not 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.819
 russia maybe only gmail was 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.560
 so I let myself be discovered so voila 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.299
 it was more for the second episode 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.409
 so on ostriches 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.409
 See you
