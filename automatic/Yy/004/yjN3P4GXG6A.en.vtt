00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.970
 apart from this as I do we have a little bit what is the seafood cube that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730
 we could say an American 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.620
 and a little fumec worth with these two parts was what we use to wet the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
 act 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.990
 putting some oil 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990
 adding a little onion 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.680
 we will let the onion work 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.080
 that I'm going to work softly 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.830
 so that it is curdling 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.000
 and it's like throwing the base the base of a risotto 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 is completely the same only has in this case it will not be a rissoto 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.350
 We will bend with butter or healthy company if we stay looking with 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.350
 the own cube of seafood 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.839
 we do not have public safety for now 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.829
 we add the rice 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.259
 of this amount 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.709
 we let those cold 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.709
 who suffered from dementia 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.579
 at this time we will incorporate the rice before adding the eating 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.579
 the tomato sauce with a focus of apple parsley 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.389
 and then we will incorporate the fumet 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.899
 first eat 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.859
 then we finished by a thousand 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.249
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.249
 the cubes of seafood america 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.499
 and let's cook 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.419
 for four minutes we will incorporate a little more fumec 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.319
 we will vote twice with encouragement 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.159
 three times with American 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.189
 and in this case the rúa has to be a little griñán 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.289
 a little bit al dente 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.519
 and we will accompany with all these seafood gone through the plate very 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.329
 slightly 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.489
 we have the rice as we said 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.109
 donated state because no more or less 1 6 6 7 minutes 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.669
 we will incorporate a little more American 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.699
 we will let the red 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.699
 let's continue being kobe is honest gre-nal 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.709
 the team being slowly 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.729
 if we can start to mark all the seafood 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.839
 to then finish serving 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.649
 we put a little bit of flavor 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.529
 the clam does not 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.529
 a little oil 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.539
 first bull we will start percent by marking 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.439
 the steering wheel post 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.939
 on the part of the skin together with espardeñas 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.829
 with this is enough 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.650
 next the crayfish 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.039
 leaving two cooking points 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.719
 very fair 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.319
 we had the seafood marker 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.319
 together with the clam 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.210
 and the rice almost almost to the point 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.499
 It is important that the rice is not 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.899
 that the seafood is finished sautéing and will be made right at the moment 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:51.819
 we have the rice that they are good I am a little bit with joy to keep their 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.819
 Cube 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.990
 the idea is that that measure you're eating stealing 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.289
 that you go eating seafood and that when you finish closing them you finish the seafood 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.729
 everything ends at once 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.279
 idea that rice 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.539
 this accompanied by navy 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.669
 but there are no flames to roque seafood and not both things equally 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.399
 once the seafood everything placed today we incorporate a little chive 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.690
 in this sense on Tuesday
