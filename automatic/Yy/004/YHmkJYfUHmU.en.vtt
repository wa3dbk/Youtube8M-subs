00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.810
 interest 7 came mercedes with the third 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.810
 generation c-class w204 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.320
 and try-out came and came on the market 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 first only the trunk and year later 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 came the combi or the still was not 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.210
 today and in 2011 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.520
 the other a subtle facelift and then 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 suddenly there was a very nice 2-door 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 p available and we have Mercedes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.420
 huge number of choices really huge number of choices 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.250
 especially in terms of engines 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.220
 beginning with c 180 we now note 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.620
 are on the move and that has 156 hp and that 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.720
 naturally end with the c 63 amg or 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.159
 even c63 amg 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.799
 507 with 500 and zeus bk 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.799
 and that is of course bags best 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.780
 are you going to shop for a c-class on it 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.120
 autoscout24 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.950
 you have this moment of choice too much 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.940
 twelve hundred of them is more than the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.070
 half and then they 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.070
 and a very large part of the rest 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.020
 my still after one in ten or so 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.640
 one in fifteen is a coupÃ© 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.890
 I was just a baby in 2011 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.210
 of course by far the largest part of it 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.300
 that car has an automatic 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.580
 gearbox 62% 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.170
 slightly less than half 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.420
 has a diesel engine we have one 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.729
 gasoline if they c 180 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.740
 and then the entry-level model says 50hp 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.390
 but most cars are 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.500
 quite richly equipped so yes 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390
 entry model 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.310
 sounds a little bit dull but most of them 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.159
 c-class that are for sale are strain it 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.890
 overlooked from airco a whole after four 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.049
 many cars also have leather so yes what 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.759
 that concerns it is not necessarily so if 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.740
 you go find at the bottom that you are there 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.539
 immediately bare cars think that is not too bad 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.880
 prices for 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.780
 c class start around the eleven 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.780
 times a thousand euros 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.950
 are the quality level of this 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.140
 cars just fine now they are from here 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.720
 from say the generations before to 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.890
 the true ones for problems but these 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.200
 cars on especially 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.400
 quite ok of course there are some 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.710
 things you should pay attention to 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.350
 start with boarding 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.780
 now key in that thing refuse still 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.040
 agree so check that it is right there 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.900
 two keys to the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.270
 car and if you go on vacation take it 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 you just might spare key with the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.020
 let's know then we'll look with 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.880
 others generally just keep going 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.800
 furthermore with diesel engines so that the 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.510
 atomizers sometimes you give one 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.800
 but the principle still happens 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.460
 momentarily 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.990
 regarding the c 350 with the m 272 block 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.330
 Sounds very technical this ebay 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.400
 it makes sense again that the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.100
 tensioner timing belt that kind of thing 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.330
 can sometimes develop leeway 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.280
 And you don't want that because if it goes wrong 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.700
 then good person goes and you really have everything 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.890
 so lie in the soup 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.760
 check whether everything is well maintained 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.170
 has been kept up to date 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.239
 what else you should keep an eye on 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.950
 is that art or door handles sometimes 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.170
 well checker off on that still 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.670
 nice and firm to the touch 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.319
 because at moments that had to be replaced then 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.670
 both villages have to get out and more me 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.290
 all agree its precious 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.569
 repair 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.599
 furthermore you were allowed for the fun toy 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.060
 go c63 amg 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.010
 take those cruel rear tires anyway 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.209
 walls subscription with the mercury fit and the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.310
 euromaster 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.650
 and you could only have two tires 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.819
 in your own village 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.530
 then visit something for just outside 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.819
 by on because really that goes very fast and 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.849
 that goes faster than you just expect 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.340
 also check anyway also at all 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.109
 c class is because of this generation or 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.099
 the front tires just neat and tidy 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.069
 equal 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.540
 worn out are worn because the 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.400
 alignment wants to be one more time 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.799
 cause problems 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.420
 yes then a general thing that i do 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.159
 A start already told are very much 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.200
 c-class machines 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.480
 covers 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.980
 yes you know and they just have to be or the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.450
 generally those things are natural 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.340
 fairly flawless but you have to in the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.780
 keep an eye on them that they are well maintained 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.120
 and if you think of houses the 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.740
 beeps and like in hollow tree way 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.210
 are simply replacing it 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.639
 the liquid in the oil for the thing 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.310
 but pay attention to everything there 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.950
 just sounds good and smooth and tasty 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.720
 this copy we are on our way to 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.720
 the c180 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.120
 with 156 hp 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.729
 yes it 's just a pretty nice car 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.360
 silver gray nice fresh car with a 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.580
 manual gearbox 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.040
 what is it if you are still looking there 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.070
 a tricky thing to find then is automatic 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.810
 yes that c180 region is not a rocket this 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.960
 of course, but just goes from good 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.410
 th place and the only one we actually mr 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.220
 learn and I am not so fond of wood but 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.760
 the people there are also those 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.760
 further from it 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.770
 but
