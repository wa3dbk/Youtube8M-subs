00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's got a sensor here it will switch on
with<00:01:32.970> darkness<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> switch<00:01:33.869> off<00:01:34.049> in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
with darkness and at the switch off in

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100 
with darkness and at the switch off in
the<00:01:34.259> morning<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.270> it'll<00:01:36.270> use<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> fraction<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the morning and it'll use a fraction of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
the morning and it'll use a fraction of
the<00:01:37.200> power<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:38.100> 15<00:01:38.430> years<00:01:38.610> ok<00:01:39.479> well

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the power that like 15 years ok well

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.910 
the power that like 15 years ok well
this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:39.990> well<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.200> good<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.619> telling<00:01:40.860> me

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this is all well and good you telling me

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.440 
this is all well and good you telling me
to<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.250> these<00:01:41.369> new<00:01:41.549> bulbs<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.299> my

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to get all these new bulbs but my

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
to get all these new bulbs but my

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
understanding is they're all more

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
understanding is they're all more
expensive<00:01:44.159> than<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> bulbs<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.790> used<00:01:44.970> yeah
