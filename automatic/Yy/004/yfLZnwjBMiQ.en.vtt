00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
exact same process only make it just a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.620 
exact same process only make it just a
tiny<00:02:40.200> bit<00:02:40.440> smaller<00:02:40.680> by<00:02:41.490> overlapping<00:02:42.090> our<00:02:42.390> tape

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
tiny bit smaller by overlapping our tape

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.020 
tiny bit smaller by overlapping our tape
more<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.310> make<00:02:44.490> your<00:02:44.820> first
