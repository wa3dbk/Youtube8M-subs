stiff very shiny and that's typically

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.140 
stiff very shiny and that's typically
how<00:04:03.850> they're<00:04:04.090> supposed<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.420> be<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:06.070> this<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.120> a

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
how they're supposed to be so this is a

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.050 
how they're supposed to be so this is a
good<00:04:07.360> example<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.840> what<00:04:08.489> teens<00:04:09.489> jacket<00:04:09.940> should

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
good example of what teens jacket should

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.400 
good example of what teens jacket should
be<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.270> this<00:04:10.330> one<00:04:10.510> probably<00:04:10.780> took<00:04:10.870> me<00:04:11.020> about<00:04:11.140> a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410

be and this one probably took me about a
month<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> half<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.340> do<00:04:12.459> so<00:04:13.150> that's<00:04:13.450> about

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
month and a half to do so that's about

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.860
