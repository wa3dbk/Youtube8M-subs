00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.089 

I<00:03:01.049> think<00:03:02.049> it's<00:03:02.170> interesting<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.709> ends<00:03:02.980> in

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
I think it's interesting is it ends in

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.339 
I think it's interesting is it ends in
two<00:03:03.340> mono<00:03:03.700> plugs<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.780> they're<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.079> they're

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
two mono plugs and they're and they're

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.289 
two mono plugs and they're and they're
color-coded<00:03:08.799> on<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.099> cord<00:03:09.370> as<00:03:09.579> well<00:03:09.610> as<00:03:09.819> for

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
color-coded on the cord as well as for

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.330 
color-coded on the cord as well as for
each<00:03:10.329> pick<00:03:10.659> up<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.019> microphone<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:15.280> a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
each pick up on the microphone so in a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.619 
each pick up on the microphone so in a
sense<00:03:15.640> they're<00:03:15.819> matching<00:03:16.150> which<00:03:16.299> is<00:03:16.420> kind<00:03:16.599> of

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
sense they're matching which is kind of

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.089 
sense they're matching which is kind of
cool

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
cool

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.350 
cool
now<00:03:18.099> what<00:03:18.220> I've<00:03:18.340> done<00:03:18.549> in<00:03:18.790> order<00:03:18.909> to<00:03:19.060> plug<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
now what I've done in order to plug it

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.149 
now what I've done in order to plug it
into<00:03:19.480> cassette<00:03:19.840> recorders<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.709> computer

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
into cassette recorders and the computer

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.229 
into cassette recorders and the computer
is<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.970> have<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.480> take<00:03:22.629> these<00:03:23.879> plug<00:03:24.879> those<00:03:25.060> into

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
is I have to take these plug those into

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.599 
is I have to take these plug those into
this<00:03:25.540> which<00:03:26.200> converts<00:03:26.620> both<00:03:26.829> signals<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.400> mono

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609

this microphone with the intention of

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.110 
this microphone with the intention of
using<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.830> for<00:04:50.050> recording<00:04:52.090> universally<00:04:53.090> I

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
using it for recording universally I

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.580 
using it for recording universally I
mean<00:04:53.389> I<00:04:53.419> could<00:04:53.660> use<00:04:53.690> this<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> computer<00:04:54.290> I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
mean I could use this on a computer I

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.930 
mean I could use this on a computer I
could<00:04:54.889> use<00:04:55.010> this<00:04:55.130> on<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.340> tape<00:04:55.520> recorder<00:04:55.910> I

could use this on the tape recorder I

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.520 
could use this on the tape recorder I
could<00:04:56.150> use<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.479> on<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.690> reel-to-reel<00:04:57.139> deck

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
could use this on the reel-to-reel deck

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.580 
could use this on the reel-to-reel deck
over<00:04:57.770> there<00:04:58.479> which<00:04:59.479> I<00:04:59.600> tried<00:04:59.870> earlier<00:05:00.260> for

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
over there which I tried earlier for

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.290 
over there which I tried earlier for
this<00:05:00.680> video<00:05:00.979> but<00:05:01.190> unfortunately<00:05:02.000> there's

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
process in that machine and I'll get

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.360 
process in that machine and I'll get
around<00:05:09.229> to<00:05:09.440> working<00:05:09.740> on<00:05:09.830> that<00:05:10.040> at<00:05:10.160> some<00:05:10.340> point

microphone like this and this microphone

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.270 
microphone like this and this microphone
would<00:06:15.199> be<00:06:15.289> perfect<00:06:15.710> for<00:06:15.740> this<00:06:15.949> sort<00:06:16.160> of<00:06:16.190> a

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
would be perfect for this sort of a

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.700 
would be perfect for this sort of a
thing<00:06:16.430> is<00:06:16.580> with<00:06:16.729> a<00:06:16.760> pop<00:06:17.000> filter<00:06:17.210> and<00:06:17.570> could<00:06:18.560> be

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
thing is with a pop filter and could be

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.670 
thing is with a pop filter and could be
great<00:06:18.919> for<00:06:19.099> podcasting<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.840> could<00:06:21.410> also<00:06:21.530> be

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
great for podcasting and could also be

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.640 
great for podcasting and could also be
just<00:06:21.770> great<00:06:22.099> for<00:06:22.370> general<00:06:22.639> recording<00:06:23.389> of

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
just great for general recording of

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.379 
just great for general recording of
music<00:06:24.650> and<00:06:24.860> voices<00:06:25.340> both<00:06:26.150> together

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
music and voices both together

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:32.529 
music and voices both together
considering<00:06:27.020> it<00:06:27.080> has<00:06:27.169> both<00:06:27.380> settings<00:06:31.330> now<00:06:32.330> but

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
considering it has both settings now but

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:33.850 
considering it has both settings now but
the<00:06:32.630> pickups<00:06:32.900> are<00:06:33.020> back<00:06:33.139> at<00:06:33.260> the<00:06:33.320> top<00:06:33.500> because

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
the pickups are back at the top because

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.200 
the pickups are back at the top because
that's<00:06:34.039> where<00:06:34.280> I<00:06:34.310> prefer<00:06:34.580> when<00:06:34.760> I'm<00:06:34.849> holding<00:06:35.030> a

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
that's where I prefer when I'm holding a

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.420 
that's where I prefer when I'm holding a
microphone<00:06:35.570> anyway<00:06:36.039> I'm<00:06:37.039> thinking<00:06:37.130> about

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
microphone anyway I'm thinking about

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.040 
microphone anyway I'm thinking about
getting<00:06:37.550> a<00:06:37.729> pop<00:06:37.940> filter<00:06:38.120> for<00:06:38.479> this<00:06:38.599> thing<00:06:38.780> and

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
getting a pop filter for this thing and

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.140 
getting a pop filter for this thing and
making<00:06:39.380> a<00:06:39.580> really<00:06:40.580> good<00:06:40.729> recording

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
making a really good recording

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.000 
making a really good recording
microphone<00:06:41.270> possibly<00:06:42.139> for<00:06:42.320> screencasts<00:06:42.949> in

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
microphone possibly for screencasts in

microphone possibly for screencasts in
the<00:06:43.099> future<00:06:43.400> or<00:06:43.639> just<00:06:43.669> for<00:06:44.860> simple<00:06:45.860> voiceovers

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
the future or just for simple voiceovers

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.990 
the future or just for simple voiceovers
and<00:06:46.430> videos<00:06:48.250> now<00:06:49.250> I'll<00:06:49.400> switch<00:06:49.640> this<00:06:49.789> to<00:06:49.880> the

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
and videos now I'll switch this to the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.580 
and videos now I'll switch this to the
music<00:06:50.300> setting<00:06:50.479> so<00:06:50.750> you<00:06:50.840> can<00:06:50.990> see<00:06:51.140> what<00:06:51.349> the

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
music setting so you can see what the

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.029 
music setting so you can see what the
preamp<00:06:51.890> does<00:06:52.900> now<00:06:53.900> that<00:06:54.200> I've<00:06:54.289> switched

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
preamp does now that I've switched

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.499 
preamp does now that I've switched
the<00:06:55.159> microphone<00:06:55.550> to<00:06:55.669> the<00:06:55.699> music<00:06:56.059> setting<00:06:56.360> the

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
the microphone to the music setting the

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.909 
the microphone to the music setting the
preamp<00:06:56.839> should<00:06:56.960> be<00:06:57.050> much<00:06:57.199> stronger<00:06:57.589> and<00:06:57.800> my

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
preamp should be much stronger and my

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.959 
preamp should be much stronger and my
voice<00:06:58.159> should<00:06:58.309> be<00:06:58.339> clipping<00:06:58.729> a<00:06:58.789> little<00:06:58.999> bit

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:00.969 
voice should be clipping a little bit

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:03.040 
voice should be clipping a little bit
this<00:07:01.969> is<00:07:02.119> me<00:07:02.240> speaking<00:07:02.389> at<00:07:02.689> a<00:07:02.749> moderate

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
this is me speaking at a moderate

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.389 
this is me speaking at a moderate
distance<00:07:03.139> that<00:07:03.499> I'd<00:07:03.589> normally<00:07:03.770> dictate

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:04.399 
distance that I'd normally dictate

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:09.219 
distance that I'd normally dictate
record<00:07:05.210> music<00:07:05.330> do<00:07:05.689> whatever<00:07:06.069> and<00:07:08.139> let<00:07:09.139> me

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:09.229 
record music do whatever and let me

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.889 
record music do whatever and let me
switch<00:07:09.379> you<00:07:09.469> back<00:07:09.499> to<00:07:09.680> voice<00:07:10.479> that's<00:07:11.479> probably

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:11.899 
switch you back to voice that's probably

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.779 
switch you back to voice that's probably
sounds<00:07:12.080> much<00:07:12.259> better<00:07:12.469> now<00:07:12.649> with<00:07:13.279> a<00:07:13.339> pop<00:07:13.580> filter

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:13.789 
sounds much better now with a pop filter

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.420 
sounds much better now with a pop filter
this<00:07:14.210> thing<00:07:14.389> would<00:07:14.509> sound<00:07:14.719> so<00:07:15.349> good<00:07:15.559> so<00:07:16.249> good

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
this thing would sound so good so good

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.350
