00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
start but that to me that's it's cool

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.080 
start but that to me that's it's cool
but<00:04:19.040> it's<00:04:19.100> kind<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.430> born<00:04:19.640> at<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:19.790> same<00:04:19.910> time

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
but it's kind of born at the same time

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.930

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
guys seen a multiplayer trailer I think

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.070 
guys seen a multiplayer trailer I think
it<00:04:25.040> was<00:04:25.160> not<00:04:25.760> know<00:04:26.060> was<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.510> was<00:04:26.660> staged

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
it was not know was it was staged

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.050 
it was not know was it was staged
military<00:04:27.590> but<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.340> wasn't<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.640> much<00:04:28.790> better

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
military but it wasn't a much better

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.660 
military but it wasn't a much better
Charlie<00:04:29.570> too<00:04:29.920> they<00:04:30.920> were<00:04:31.010> showing<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:31.400> car

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
Charlie too they were showing this car

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.840 
Charlie too they were showing this car
and<00:04:31.850> I<00:04:31.940> was<00:04:31.970> like<00:04:32.240> well<00:04:32.870> maybe<00:04:33.290> has<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.560> time<00:04:33.860> but

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
and I was like well maybe has a time but

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.970 
and I was like well maybe has a time but
this<00:04:35.060> thing<00:04:35.390> actually<00:04:35.630> lasts<00:04:36.320> for<00:04:36.560> quite<00:04:36.590> a

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
this thing actually lasts for quite a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.620 
this thing actually lasts for quite a
long<00:04:37.220> time<00:04:38.080> surprisingly<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:40.520> like<00:04:41.420> I

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
long time surprisingly so it like I

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.600 
long time surprisingly so it like I
think<00:04:42.050> he<00:04:42.170> classes<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.740> few<00:04:42.920> walls<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.370> little

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610
