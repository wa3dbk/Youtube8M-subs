00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.000
 Do you have time tomorrow...? 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.370
 I have to be long. 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.390
 If you want to read this book, 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.050
 Please treat guests and drinks 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.750
 What are you thinking about? 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.060
 Oh, it won’t be... waiting for this man. 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.970
 Don’t forget him. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.050
 Delete this photo 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 what is this 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.890
 What do you want to drink? 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.730
 Ice chocolate or American coffee? 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.350
 I prefer this 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.260
 This is too bitter 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.620
 Give this to you today. 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.050
 Isn't it a bad mood? 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.770
 when you're down 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.150
 It’s the best to eat sweet. 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.140
 Lend me this. 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.300
 What is justice? 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.970
 I really read it. 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.550
 Don't doubt me 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.630
 That one... 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.630
 Do you have time tomorrow? 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.210
 I know there is a good shop. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.060
 go together 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.530
 Ah, something is going on tomorrow. 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.410
 Then there's no way 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 Then go next time. 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.750
 Still... some ninth nostalgia
