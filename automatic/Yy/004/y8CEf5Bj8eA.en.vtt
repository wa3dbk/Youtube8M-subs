00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 faye the nuggets so today a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.609
 pretty special video because it's 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.540
 when kind of videos I'm 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.220
 often on my channel 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 in fact I made you a beauty 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.059
 makeup go to test the products the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.040
 blow clubs I did with that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 so I had if you want to reproduce 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.180
 this makeup simply have my 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.800
 notice about some products i have 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.030
 used we wanted it broken and the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.180
 video says that the big up make a fluid 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.420
 mix them in fact with the bottom of 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.920
 dyed laura sims in cinnamon hues 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.510
 but frankly to tell you I 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.670
 mix this foundation with a lot 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.310
 other foundations and there I find 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.090
 that it's a super- matifying effect like 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.210
 you can see it 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.920
 I love the foundation of wheat cup 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.850
 that's for oily skin finds that 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.190
 it will be perfect so here I applied in 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.540
 twice to have a super 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.970
 recovering I yearned 1,2 and the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.269
 girls you know it's essential 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.440
 for me favorite and I apply them with 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.930
 beef or spindle 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.580
 even if it's less covering since 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.290
 audois it's more covering but it me 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.310
 go 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 I apply the flower perfection of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.600
 bourgeois and yes it looks like talc but 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.960
 believe me if you have never tested 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.659
 try it great and I put it in 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.909
 center of the face because I have skin 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.310
 fat that is 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.750
 I apply a magic mousse of nocibÃ© I 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.770
 had to do you journals because 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.219
 I bought four different shades 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.500
 I have not done the review here is good 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:39.040
 I find that intensity and average 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.560
 so I had to put it back three times 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.329
 but hey I'm gonna take another 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.850
 shade a bit brighter to brighten 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.869
 the inner corner of the eye 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.829
 here he is to make some kind of 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.729
 degrade inward and I find 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.729
 it's very nice month 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.660
 here 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.400
 see it's very light it's not very 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.650
 pigmented so if you want a review 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.010
 so you tell me there I take the lighthouse 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.450
 not been dubbed cup because bah I 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.830
 wanted to see what it really gave 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.470
 I was afraid it was a little too much 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.710
 Too much charge a little too flashy but 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.890
 as you can see them as we 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.780
 will say it's really not been actually 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.160
 as we say it's not very pigmented 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.630
 there are more sequins glitter 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.610
 it falls so it really takes a good 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.120
 base I have not put any base for this 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.610
 makeup 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.709
 So here we have to go back to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.900
 many times but that's fine then 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.370
 put the magic foam of nocibÃ© for 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.530
 play a little game a little game in the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.170
 outer corner 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.430
 So much for a little give more 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.850
 of intensity we look and I apply 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.470
 mascara benefit push up liner so I 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.360
 reviewed recently 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.750
 so if you want the review at leobard 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.580
 information has it so you can see 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.590
 that I did two very niner and I 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.650
 actually applied the blush to the corner 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.989
 external and I apply the pencil 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.959
 marc jacobs plays the board he is hyper 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.420
 fat frankly super and more practical 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.790
 it is retractable so that's great 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.170
 after I put the blush this is it is 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.099
 not its primary function but I apply 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.470
 blush because I would love 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.680
 the color you take me several times 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.060
 to make a little gradient because 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.459
 otherwise I'm scared it's too much 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.709
 packet package so voila and I find 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.870
 this color very nice I think that 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.269
 is very beautiful actually so that's the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.190
 monopura mascara make up that is supposed 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.330
 do the fossil effect so what I like 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.610
 it's a lot of material 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.060
 that's all but if you put the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.920
 benefit from April before it's a killing 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.530
 so here we go to the lips I put my 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.140
 lip contour can apply the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.720
 lipstick that is sublime this is the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.480
 wheat cup number 13 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.510
 I love the color it and iridescent and 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.400
 look a little it has a luminous effect 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.410
 he is too beautiful too I love it so 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.690
 I will apply the gloss my recipes 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.459
 of wheat cup at the outer corner of my lips 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.130
 so if I do that in fact it's for 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.019
 give some depth to my 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.400
 lips here to not make an effect 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.859
 short because I like to 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.039
 to do a answered what and in the center of 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.419
 my lips I put the gloss 14 that has to 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.130
 about the same color as the red to 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.229
 lips and so it's to give a little 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.450
 more light in the center of my lips 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.210
 in fact and I find that with the gloss and 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.370
 outside the brown I think it 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.039
 does a nice effect so there I do a 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.479
 seeming to contouring because I do not 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.490
 do not often contouring and I 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.950
 wanted to see what that was so I 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.020
 do them very very light then 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.020
 the dye of wheat cup complexion 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.520
 I love them so I have for a whole 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.550
 life because they formed very very 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.520
 very little I put on top of 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.320
 cheekbones by tapping with my 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.110
 hands and in the center of the nose 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.390
 to give some light to the face 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.340
 and on Cupid's bow you know that 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.800
 it's very nice and finally the blush 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.540
 use it for benchmarks I do not 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.040
 go on my cheeks he's very very very 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.990
 pretty i love the blush so it is 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.650
 matched with my eyes of the blow 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.640
 Well, that's the tilt or what I did 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.320
 do not hesitate to tell me if you want 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.700
 makeup videos a little bit more 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.930
 often because I never do 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.930
 bayer flirt
