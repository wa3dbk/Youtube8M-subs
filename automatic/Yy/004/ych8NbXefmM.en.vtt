3:16<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.750> whoever<00:01:58.440> believes<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.220> Him<00:01:59.460> should

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
3:16 that whoever believes in Him should

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
3:16 that whoever believes in Him should
not<00:02:00.270> perish<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.780> has<00:02:01.050> everlasting<00:02:01.350> life

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
not perish but has everlasting life

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.930 
not perish but has everlasting life
I<00:02:02.990> too<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> Baptist<00:02:05.130> background<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.850> we

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
I too have a Baptist background and we

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.630 
I too have a Baptist background and we
used<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.300> sing<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.810> song<00:02:07.080> whosoever<00:02:08.069> surely

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

meaneth me

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.320 
meaneth me
right<00:02:09.750> based<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.530> John<00:02:10.800> 3:16<00:02:11.430> well<00:02:12.150> these

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
right based on John 3:16 well these

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.120 
right based on John 3:16 well these
people<00:02:12.570> believed<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.320> him<00:02:13.500> therefore<00:02:13.770> they're

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
people believed in him therefore they're

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.690 
people believed in him therefore they're
born<00:02:14.370> again

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
born again

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.760 
born again
and<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.599> don't<00:02:15.780> guess<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.290> believed<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.740> him

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and we don't guess they believed in him

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.070 
and we don't guess they believed in him
John<00:02:17.069> tells<00:02:17.430> us<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.840> inspired

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
John tells us and this is inspired

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.979 
John tells us and this is inspired
Scripture<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.250> Jesus<00:02:21.090> says<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.840> those

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
Scripture and then Jesus says to those

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.140 
Scripture and then Jesus says to those
Jews<00:02:22.349> who<00:02:22.380> believed<00:02:22.890> him<00:02:23.099> again<00:02:23.520> John<00:02:23.849> says

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
Jews who believed him again John says

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.540 
Jews who believed him again John says
they<00:02:24.360> believed<00:02:24.750> him<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.980> abide<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.280> my

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
they believed him if you abide in my

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.850 
they believed him if you abide in my
word<00:02:26.580> you're<00:02:26.940> my<00:02:27.120> disciples<00:02:27.720> indeed<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.349> think

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
word you're my disciples indeed I think

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.620 
word you're my disciples indeed I think
one<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.459> things<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:29.790> need<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.000> understand

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
one of the things we need to understand

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.500 
one of the things we need to understand
is<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.069> discipleship<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.910> same<00:02:33.180> as

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
is that discipleship is not the same as

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.500 
is that discipleship is not the same as
the<00:02:33.930> new<00:02:34.080> birth<00:02:34.550> Jesus<00:02:35.550> had<00:02:36.000> unsaved

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
the new birth Jesus had unsaved

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.460 
the new birth Jesus had unsaved
disciples<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.500> John<00:02:38.280> chapter<00:02:38.340> 6<00:02:39.209> were<00:02:40.080> told

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
disciples in John chapter 6 were told

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.600 
disciples in John chapter 6 were told
that<00:02:41.959> some<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.140> some<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.860> do<00:02:44.069> not<00:02:44.220> believe

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
that some of some of you do not believe

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.170 
that some of some of you do not believe
in<00:02:44.819> me<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:46.380> then<00:02:46.680> many<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.069> them<00:02:47.370> departed<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
in me and then many of them departed so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.870 
in me and then many of them departed so
at<00:02:48.360> least<00:02:48.660> some<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.890> his<00:02:50.010> disciples<00:02:50.580> were

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
at least some of his disciples were

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.610 
at least some of his disciples were
unbelieving<00:02:51.510> Judas<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.440> inner

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620

unbelieving Judas one of the inner
circle<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.549> twelve<00:02:53.850> didn't<00:02:54.269> believe

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
circle one of the twelve didn't believe

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.830 
circle one of the twelve didn't believe
in<00:02:54.780> him<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:56.190> being<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.120> disciple<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.810> not

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
in him and so being a disciple is not

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.930 
in him and so being a disciple is not
the<00:02:58.200> same<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.590> believe<00:02:58.950> being<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.370> believer<00:02:59.519> our

born<00:05:47.280> of<00:05:47.430> fornication<00:05:48.050> which<00:05:49.050> shows<00:05:49.409> that<00:05:49.740> the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
born of fornication which shows that the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.969 
born of fornication which shows that the
the<00:05:50.849> rumor<00:05:51.180> circulated<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.199> there<00:05:52.530> was<00:05:52.710> no

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
the rumor circulated that there was no

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.399 
the rumor circulated that there was no
virgin<00:05:53.490> birth<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:54.060> Jesus<00:05:54.570> was<00:05:54.810> born<00:05:55.080> due<00:05:55.380> to

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
virgin birth that Jesus was born due to

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.350 
virgin birth that Jesus was born due to
immorality<00:05:55.800> that<00:05:56.280> his<00:05:56.460> mother<00:05:56.729> was<00:05:56.970> immoral

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
immorality that his mother was immoral

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.310 
immorality that his mother was immoral
and<00:05:58.400> so<00:05:59.400> they're<00:05:59.580> insulting<00:06:00.150> Jesus<00:06:00.750> they're

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
and so they're insulting Jesus they're

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.070 
and so they're insulting Jesus they're
doing<00:06:01.620> all<00:06:01.830> these<00:06:02.099> things<00:06:02.159> and<00:06:02.940> he's<00:06:03.870> saying

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
doing all these things and he's saying

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.270 
doing all these things and he's saying
well<00:06:04.289> you<00:06:04.380> don't<00:06:04.470> believe<00:06:04.620> me<00:06:04.919> but<00:06:05.070> these

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.610 
well you don't believe me but these
people<00:06:05.580> Jesus<00:06:06.270> does<00:06:06.509> stop<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.050> talk<00:06:07.199> to<00:06:07.440> them

so<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:08.070> hope<00:06:08.370> that<00:06:08.610> makes<00:06:08.820> sense<00:06:08.970> but<00:06:09.389> people

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
so I hope that makes sense but people

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.620 
so I hope that makes sense but people
make<00:06:10.409> mountains<00:06:10.830> out<00:06:11.009> of<00:06:11.070> mole<00:06:11.340> hills<00:06:11.370> I<00:06:11.940> mean

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.390 
make mountains out of mole hills I mean
something<00:06:12.930> is<00:06:13.050> real<00:06:13.259> obvious<00:06:13.530> in<00:06:13.979> Scripture

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
something is real obvious in Scripture

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.260 
something is real obvious in Scripture
and<00:06:14.580> somehow<00:06:15.380> because<00:06:16.380> you<00:06:17.310> know<00:06:17.460> they're

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
and somehow because you know they're

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.180 
and somehow because you know they're
looking<00:06:18.720> for<00:06:18.960> ways<00:06:19.169> to<00:06:19.409> have<00:06:19.560> substandard
