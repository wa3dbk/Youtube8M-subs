00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and I've got this a few months ago and I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.510 
and I've got this a few months ago and I
haven't<00:00:48.600> thought<00:00:49.469> about<00:00:49.710> another<00:00:50.010> tripod

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
haven't thought about another tripod

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.049 
haven't thought about another tripod
since<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:52.170> basically<00:00:52.649> has<00:00:53.100> taken

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
since because this basically has taken

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
since because this basically has taken
care<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.629> tripod<00:00:54.989> needs<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
care of my tripod needs I'm not going to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
care of my tripod needs I'm not going to
bring<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.370> any<00:00:56.550> higher<00:00:56.670> than<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
bring it up any higher than this but it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.150 
bring it up any higher than this but it
does<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:58.020> fairly<00:00:58.469> high<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.280> drag<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.910> is

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
does go fairly high the drag on it is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.719 
does go fairly high the drag on it is
okay<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.120> perfect<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> drag<00:01:05.250> control

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
okay it's not perfect the drag control

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450 
okay it's not perfect the drag control
here<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> basically<00:01:07.170> none<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.040> you've<00:01:08.159> got

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
here is basically none so you've got

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.090 
here is basically none so you've got
this<00:01:09.180> drag<00:01:09.540> control<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.380> locked<00:01:10.710> drag

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
this drag control and then locked drag

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
this drag control and then locked drag
control<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> tighten<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.140> up<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.439> lot

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
control and if you tighten it up a lot

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.450 
control and if you tighten it up a lot
then<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.340> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> semi<00:01:15.210> locked<00:01:16.460> but

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
then it's kind of semi locked but

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.070 
then it's kind of semi locked but
there's<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.360> either<00:01:18.570> here

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
there's not really it's either here

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.760 
there's not really it's either here
there's<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.439> much<00:01:19.590> choice<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:21.770> drag

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
there's not really much choice for drag

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.280 
there's not really much choice for drag
control<00:01:23.750> but<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.320> panning<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
control but for panning there is and you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
control but for panning there is and you
can<00:01:28.439> tighten<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.909> give

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
can tighten that up and that will give

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.030 
can tighten that up and that will give
you<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> nice<00:01:30.360> drag<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.500> perfect<00:01:31.920> if

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you a nice drag it's not perfect if

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
you a nice drag it's not perfect if
you're<00:01:32.130> zoomed<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> at<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.880> 200<00:01:33.299> millimeter

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
you're zoomed in at like 200 millimeter

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.819 
you're zoomed in at like 200 millimeter
the<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.770> thing<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.610> love<00:01:35.820> about<00:01:35.850> this

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
the one thing I really love about this

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.789 
the one thing I really love about this
is<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:40.040> fact<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> has<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.970> longest<00:01:42.799> arm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
is the fact that it has the longest arm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.600 
is the fact that it has the longest arm
that<00:01:44.640> I've<00:01:44.759> ever<00:01:44.939> seen<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> tripod<00:01:46.610> without

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that I've ever seen on a tripod without

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.389 
that I've ever seen on a tripod without
I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.360> some<00:01:48.659> really<00:01:48.930> expensive<00:01:49.170> ones<00:01:49.590> have

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
I think some really expensive ones have

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.630 
I think some really expensive ones have
arms<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.979> called<00:01:53.189> an<00:01:53.280> arm<00:01:53.430> you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
nice because they reach the end position

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
nice because they reach the end position
and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.090> locked<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.840> not

one of those knobs where you kind of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.270 
one of those knobs where you kind of
continue<00:02:09.929> tightening<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:11.250> not

continue tightening it and you're not

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.710 
continue tightening it and you're not
really<00:02:11.580> sure<00:02:11.640> how<00:02:11.970> much<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.270> should<00:02:12.300> tighten

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
really sure how much you should tighten

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.220

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
gonna break it it just stops at the

gonna break it it just stops at the
right<00:02:16.440> point<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.069> lot<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.909> head<00:02:18.060> of

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
without playing about with the legs

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.460 
without playing about with the legs
which<00:02:26.549> is<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:26.909> nice<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.290> got<00:02:28.349> a

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
which is really nice and it's got a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.380 
which is really nice and it's got a
little<00:02:28.590> level<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:30.000> actually<00:02:30.209> really

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
little level here it's actually really

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.970 
little level here it's actually really
tiny<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.019> not<00:02:31.260> really<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.590> easy<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
tiny and it's not really that easy to

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.740 
tiny and it's not really that easy to
see<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.459> useful<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.510> quick-release

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
see but it's useful it's a quick-release

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.890 
see but it's useful it's a quick-release
plate<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.310> quite<00:02:36.090> nice<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.660> comes

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
plate on this is quite nice it comes

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.280 
plate on this is quite nice it comes
away<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.200> both<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.879> quarter<00:02:38.879> inch<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.360> a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
away with both a quarter inch and a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.009 
away with both a quarter inch and a
three<00:02:40.560> eighths<00:02:40.709> inch<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.150> will<00:02:42.239> fit<00:02:42.510> any

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
three eighths inch so it will fit any

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.319 
three eighths inch so it will fit any
camera<00:02:43.530> or<00:02:44.010> whatever<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.849> want<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.060> mount<00:02:45.239> to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
camera or whatever you want to mount to

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.009 
camera or whatever you want to mount to
it<00:02:45.540> you've<00:02:46.319> got<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.650> little<00:02:46.860> clip<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.870> make

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
it you've got this little clip to make

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.720 
it you've got this little clip to make
sure<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> doesn't<00:02:49.620> once<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.549> it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
sure that it doesn't once it's on it

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.050 
sure that it doesn't once it's on it
doesn't<00:02:50.910> come<00:02:51.150> off<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.690> that's<00:02:52.650> very<00:02:52.859> useful

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
doesn't come off and that's very useful

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.780 
doesn't come off and that's very useful
but<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.359> annoying<00:02:55.250> because<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.430> need<00:02:56.579> both

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
but it's annoying because you need both

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
but it's annoying because you need both
hands<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:58.079> do<00:02:58.230> everything<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.680> kind<00:02:58.829> of<00:02:58.859> have

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
hands to do everything you kind of have

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710 
hands to do everything you kind of have
to<00:02:59.010> hold<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.609> do<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.390> undo<00:03:00.629> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
to hold it and do that and then undo the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.780 
to hold it and do that and then undo the
other<00:03:00.750> side<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.829> a<00:03:01.890> decent<00:03:02.250> size<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.700> it's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
other side it's a decent size and it's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.130 
other side it's a decent size and it's
not<00:03:02.970> too<00:03:03.150> much<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.510> hassle<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.900> carry

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
not too much of a hassle to carry

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.170 
not too much of a hassle to carry
especially<00:03:04.920> with<00:03:05.069> with<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.670> bag<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.030> comes

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
especially with with the bag that comes

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.080 
especially with with the bag that comes
with<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.450> which<00:03:06.569> is<00:03:06.690> quite<00:03:06.780> comfortable<00:03:07.079> and

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
with it which is quite comfortable and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.819 
with it which is quite comfortable and
that's<00:03:09.090> pretty<00:03:09.660> much<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:10.049> conclusion<00:03:10.620> for

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
that's pretty much my conclusion for

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.949 
that's pretty much my conclusion for
