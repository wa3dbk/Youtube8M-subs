00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.549
 Today we continue with the done 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.690
 which now with deviations 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.370
 have been added 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.920
 luckily, that was no longer possible 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.710
 too many at the decay described 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.929
 We're back in a separate video for 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.359
 later and today we can look to the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.170
 I think four successes are pretty 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.630
 go fast 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.910
 Let's start by putting this here 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.710
 lama we are just looking to catch 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 This way, Brand Renewal Resort 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.359
 off and walk between them 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.329
 Cliffs straight through the track 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.070
 I take this and this time is the lama 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.410
 not too tricky to find if you are 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.480
 wander around here a bit 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 new section of this card then finds 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.129
 you probably do it but already 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 I'll show you where it is exactly 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.170
 is and already from us here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.800
 then turn right the air bath then left 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.270
 on these small cliffs and can us 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.160
 here the air can freshen up here 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.610
 you can orient yourself on this score here 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 above 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.780
 there you can jump pretty well 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.049
 and then we continue to jump first 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 walk up the cliffs 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.630
 then look here this little stretch 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 best down 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.820
 because as soon as you do not get down here like that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 here too on this small route 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.060
 Just run down and down 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.950
 then look best with a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.229
 speedboat four jump up 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.650
 and there the lama has again 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.409
 always hiding this legendary letting 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.950
 for the second success here in the new one 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.740
 section you have a chicken nato yes that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 is a tornado then locate 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.210
 make this event always starts like this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.450
 during the sandstorm here also in 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.340
 this cliff and that will too 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.020
 indicated that it is there and I believe 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.939
 that it is always here in this area 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.520
 As you can see I just jump in 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.170
 and beat the success a bit 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.909
 If you get from then actually 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.560
 such a good hit is what counts 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.610
 then, as it were, as a rescued chicken 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.700
 as far as I know 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.770
 otherwise just put it there 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.300
 holds some of this chicken ado and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 then it works 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.530
 next successes are again with this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.240
 the lost locked chest 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 Three of them would have to be in the highlands 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.440
 to find, so to speak 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.660
 I have this near here 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.850
 one brand found this is the waymarker 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.100
 Just bridge with the bridge again 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.990
 go through the control button and then 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.790
 You can also find them pretty fast 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.440
 here under the cliff, I also 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.210
 we did not find one again 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.550
 too far away you can see the track now 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.350
 I've been running here pretty much 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.180
 easy and then I again the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.250
 cliff back towards lama 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 run and have behind this one 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.830
 Rock found my third gate and you 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.860
 See, that was the first one 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.450
 Mourning party here is the second thing there 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.820
 this cliff up there and you see the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.290
 stretch that I ran and here 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.180
 we are third over there too 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.830
 pretty easy to find i would too 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.080
 suggest this area here 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.440
 to run because that's pretty easy 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.210
 and there are some do last there 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.860
 success is a little more difficult because 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.140
 it would have to be able to do it before 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.600
 Sandstorm the favor of contented 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.580
 Rank 4 or higher only then 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.140
 the script queen appears and the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.680
 You have to defeat script 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.390
 which had her palace cliffs face palace 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.820
 simply from the off brand entwine pressure 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.730
 run out of underneath 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.070
 and yes that can be a bit tricky 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.900
 if you 're on a random mega 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.030
 server is not landing from your home 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.850
 server or on an organized 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.310
 lands i was lucky they have it here 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.780
 managed to get rank four and 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.270
 then he gets the message once 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.720
 it then goes off easy here to run purely 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.370
 and the queen has various subjects and 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.560
 always makes this cyclone 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.300
 Attack of this cyclone attack 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.739
 pretty thick then replaces all yours 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.390
 skills to cool about it is that you 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.280
 can not do anything but yours 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.230
 Utility skills use that pretty much 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.000
 stupid so I recommend you here 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.130
 also to take something with stability 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.920
 because you see I have her on 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.080
 start a few problems and it is 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.110
 pretty hard but after the 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.950
 are subjects then defeated the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.630
 easier the queen to bed and me 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.060
 I recommend you if you do not succeed 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.520
 on a server to come the ts 3 ip 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.390
 as it stands here ds point gw2 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.280
 player.de simply enter this in ps3 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.890
 and there are always organized 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.720
 groups then extra on it 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.540
 work towards that the favor betrayed them 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.200
 on rank 4 and higher and extra for 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.790
 this success 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.890
 if that's the case and you do that 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.920
 At the end you just did it 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.720
 knock the script queen and 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.550
 in the end, you will also be successful 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.580
 that was one of the more difficult ones 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.169
 follow because of this condition 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.660
 it is tied that one pretty much the rank 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.640
 far high gets in my opinion 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.040
 a little unfair just by the mega 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.630
 server because you can not handle it anymore 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.540
 people from his server together 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.130
 can work or not so easily 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.750
 if you are thrown somewhere on it 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.160
 especially when everything is overcrowded and you 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.720
 never know who you are on the server 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.850
 comes and if there are none the events 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.770
 doing to increase art then that is 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.320
 pretty tricky on everyone 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.630
 In that case we have the last success 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.580
 now synonymous first clicked and how 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.130
 said that with the in we do 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.500
 then in another video has become 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.040
 all successes fairly easy fairly 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.600
 short to the here but everything feasible 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.430
 thank you for watching it 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.790
 and we're looking up to the next video 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.790
 then stop
