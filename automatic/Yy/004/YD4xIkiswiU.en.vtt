to be talking about how to determine
what<00:00:07.890> type<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.130> break<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:10.309> before

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
what type of break you have before

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.580 
what type of break you have before
beginning<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.910> repair<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.420> want<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.049> clean

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
beginning the repair you want to clean

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.330 
beginning the repair you want to clean
and<00:00:13.889> inspect<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.120> whole<00:00:15.299> windshield<00:00:16.340> because

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and inspect the whole windshield because

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.279 
and inspect the whole windshield because
you<00:00:17.490> might<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.970> some<00:00:18.240> other<00:00:18.449> stone<00:00:19.020> bricks

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
you might have some other stone bricks

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
you might have some other stone bricks
that<00:00:19.439> are<00:00:19.529> hidden<00:00:19.770> maybe<00:00:20.340> under<00:00:20.760> your

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that are hidden maybe under your

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.390 
that are hidden maybe under your
windshield<00:00:21.390> wiper<00:00:21.840> that's<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.890> good<00:00:23.130> place<00:00:23.369> for

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
windshield wiper that's a good place for

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.429 
windshield wiper that's a good place for
them<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.699> usually<00:00:24.119> hide<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.260> make<00:00:25.410> sure

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
them to usually hide and just make sure

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.400 
them to usually hide and just make sure
that<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:25.890> around<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.250> whole<00:00:26.430> edging

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
that you go around the whole edging

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.509 
that you go around the whole edging
because<00:00:28.410> those<00:00:28.619> ones<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:28.980> actually<00:00:29.130> more

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
because those ones are actually more

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.630 
because those ones are actually more
prime<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.359> cracking<00:00:31.109> out<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.160> also<00:00:32.340> help

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
prime for cracking out it can also help

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
prime for cracking out it can also help
you<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> look<00:00:33.270> from<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> inside<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you if you look from the inside of the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.690 
you if you look from the inside of the
windshield<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.820> look<00:00:36.059> from<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.450> angles

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
windshield so just look from all angles

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
windshield so just look from all angles
after<00:00:38.700> wiping<00:00:38.969> down<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.809> inspecting<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
after wiping down and inspecting the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.650 
after wiping down and inspecting the
whole<00:00:40.680> windshield<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.700> found<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.390> stone

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
whole windshield you found some stone

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.720 
whole windshield you found some stone
breaks<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.770> need<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.040> determine<00:00:44.340> what

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
breaks now you need to determine what

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459 
breaks now you need to determine what
type<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> break<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> know

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
type of break they are so that you know

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.200 
type of break they are so that you know
how<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> prepare<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> before<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
how to prepare it before you do the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.560 
how to prepare it before you do the
repair<00:00:49.010> right<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.430> found<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.120> clamshell

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
repair right here we found a clamshell

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.869 
repair right here we found a clamshell
which<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.559> glass<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.250> nicked<00:00:53.670> out

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
which is the glass that's got nicked out

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.290 
which is the glass that's got nicked out
just<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.930> an<00:00:55.050> angle<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.090> we've<00:00:57.090> also

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
just kind of at an angle and we've also

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900 
just kind of at an angle and we've also
got<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> star<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.460> caused<00:00:59.670> by<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
got a star which is just caused by a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.430 
got a star which is just caused by a
regular<00:01:00.270> rock<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.719> that's<00:01:00.840> usually<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.289> an

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
regular rock and that's usually like an

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.579 
regular rock and that's usually like an
X<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.730> sliver<00:01:03.140> we've<00:01:04.140> also<00:01:04.290> got<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
X or just a sliver we've also got a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.620 
X or just a sliver we've also got a
bull's-eye<00:01:04.890> which<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> perfect<00:01:06.090> circle<00:01:06.330> now

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
bull's-eye which is a perfect circle now

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.020 
bull's-eye which is a perfect circle now
these<00:01:06.810> ones<00:01:07.110> you'll<00:01:07.290> usually<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:08.640> often

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
these ones you'll usually see more often

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
these ones you'll usually see more often
than<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.740> then<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> combination

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
than not then we have a combination

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600 
than not then we have a combination
break<00:01:12.240> which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.110> combination<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
break which is a combination of a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.600 
break which is a combination of a
bull's-eye<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:16.020> star<00:01:16.350> put<00:01:16.740> into<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.250> break

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
bull's-eye and a star put into one break

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.050 
bull's-eye and a star put into one break
so<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.549> potential

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
so all of these actually have potential

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.380 
so all of these actually have potential
of<00:01:21.180> cracking<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.880> also<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
of cracking out and we also have a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
of cracking out and we also have a
pressure<00:01:24.780> ring<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.220> hit<00:01:26.700> by<00:01:26.850> more

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
pressure ring which is hit by more

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
pressure ring which is hit by more
something<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> golf<00:01:28.470> ball<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> lug<00:01:29.640> nut

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
something like a golf ball or a lug nut

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.060 
something like a golf ball or a lug nut
off<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> card<00:01:30.600> something<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.290> blunt<00:01:31.710> force

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
off of a card something with blunt force

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.230 
off of a card something with blunt force
blood<00:01:32.400> pressure<00:01:34.340> besides<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:35.850> have

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
blood pressure besides that we also have

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.260 
blood pressure besides that we also have
a<00:01:36.270> crack<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.610> over<00:01:38.640> here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
a crack that we're going to go over here

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.700 
a crack that we're going to go over here
pretty<00:01:39.540> soon<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.350> one's<00:01:40.560> probably

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pretty soon and this one's probably

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.859 
pretty soon and this one's probably
about<00:01:41.040> eight<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.000> ten<00:01:42.210> inches<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
about eight to ten inches now you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.830 
about eight to ten inches now you
usually<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.950> fix<00:01:44.280> cracks<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.540> want<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
usually can fix cracks but you want to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
usually can fix cracks but you want to
keep<00:01:45.899> them<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> single<00:01:47.399> crack<00:01:47.790> just

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
keep them just like a single crack just

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.969 
keep them just like a single crack just
one<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.570> mean<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> start<00:01:49.439> getting<00:01:49.530> cracks

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
one I mean if you start getting cracks

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
one I mean if you start getting cracks
clear<00:01:50.399> across<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.700> windshield<00:01:51.149> that's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
clear across the windshield that's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.870
