procedure<00:00:28.450> is<00:00:28.540> pretty<00:00:28.720> much<00:00:28.960> same<00:00:29.170> on<00:00:29.380> on<00:00:29.590> all

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
procedure is pretty much same on on all

procedure is pretty much same on on all
laptops<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.400> have<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.790> DC<00:00:31.240> jack<00:00:31.480> hardwired

into<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.410> motherboard<00:00:32.800> there<00:00:33.550> are<00:00:33.670> other

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
into the motherboard there are other

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.209 
into the motherboard there are other
types<00:00:34.180> of<00:00:34.300> DC<00:00:35.110> jacks<00:00:35.379> there's<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.980> type<00:00:36.190> that

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
types of DC jacks there's the type that

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.490 
types of DC jacks there's the type that
comes<00:00:36.579> connected<00:00:37.420> via<00:00:37.510> cable<00:00:37.900> they're<00:00:38.470> a

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
comes connected via cable they're a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.810 
comes connected via cable they're a
slightly<00:00:38.800> different<00:00:38.950> way<00:00:39.190> of<00:00:39.310> testing<00:00:39.520> that

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
slightly different way of testing that

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.550 
slightly different way of testing that
but<00:00:40.120> we<00:00:40.270> will<00:00:40.420> be<00:00:40.840> focusing<00:00:41.230> on<00:00:41.350> the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
but we will be focusing on the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.540 
but we will be focusing on the
bog-standard<00:00:42.100> motherboard<00:00:43.000> DC<00:00:43.960> jack<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.460> the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
bog-standard motherboard DC jack so the

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.010 
bog-standard motherboard DC jack so the
customers<00:00:45.940> brought<00:00:46.120> this<00:00:46.270> laptop<00:00:46.540> into<00:00:46.930> me

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
customers brought this laptop into me

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.200 
customers brought this laptop into me
and<00:00:47.140> said<00:00:47.380> that<00:00:47.650> they<00:00:47.890> suspect<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.820> DC

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
and said that they suspect is the DC

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.330 
and said that they suspect is the DC
jack<00:00:49.420> because<00:00:49.600> it's<00:00:49.870> quite<00:00:50.079> loose<00:00:50.260> when<00:00:50.560> when

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
jack because it's quite loose when when

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.490 
jack because it's quite loose when when
wiggled<00:00:51.730> around<00:00:52.030> I've<00:00:52.750> already<00:00:53.020> tested<00:00:53.200> this

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
wiggled around I've already tested this

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.560 
wiggled around I've already tested this
no<00:00:54.160> it's<00:00:54.340> not<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.670> DC<00:00:54.940> jack<00:00:55.149> but<00:00:55.270> I'm<00:00:55.390> going<00:00:55.540> to

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
no it's not the DC jack but I'm going to

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.290 
no it's not the DC jack but I'm going to
show<00:00:55.720> you<00:00:55.780> how<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:55.989> came<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.290> that<00:00:56.440> conclusion

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
show you how I came to that conclusion

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.979 
show you how I came to that conclusion
first<00:00:58.300> thing<00:00:58.480> you're<00:00:58.570> going<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.720> need<00:00:58.840> is

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
first thing you're going to need is

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.250 
first thing you're going to need is
obviously<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.320> multimeter<00:01:00.720> for<00:01:01.720> testing<00:01:02.110> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
obviously a multimeter for testing the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.789 
obviously a multimeter for testing the
the<00:01:02.620> voltage<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:05.259> that's<00:01:05.409> pretty<00:01:05.680> much

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
the voltage and and that's pretty much

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.440 
the voltage and and that's pretty much
it<00:01:06.189> you<00:01:06.430> need<00:01:06.579> a<00:01:06.610> little<00:01:06.790> bit<00:01:06.969> knowledge<00:01:07.299> on

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
it you need a little bit knowledge on

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.080 
it you need a little bit knowledge on
how<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.600> disassemble<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.740> laptop<00:01:09.310> I'm<00:01:09.850> going<00:01:10.030> to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
how to disassemble a laptop I'm going to

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.289 
how to disassemble a laptop I'm going to
assume<00:01:10.299> that<00:01:10.420> you<00:01:10.540> have<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.900> knowledge<00:01:11.049> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
assume that you have that knowledge and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.270 
assume that you have that knowledge and
that<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.570> do<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.840> quite<00:01:14.080> confidently<00:01:14.710> I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
that you can do that quite confidently I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.640 
that you can do that quite confidently I
may<00:01:15.850> put<00:01:16.060> another<00:01:16.270> video<00:01:16.570> up<00:01:16.750> on<00:01:16.900> how<00:01:17.140> how<00:01:17.590> we

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
may put another video up on how how we

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.070 
may put another video up on how how we
go<00:01:17.920> about<00:01:18.100> doing<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.549> but<00:01:18.870> essentially<00:01:19.870> it's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
go about doing that but essentially it's

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.990 
go about doing that but essentially it's
something<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.890> you<00:01:21.010> should<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.610> should<00:01:21.850> be

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
something that you should you should be

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.969 
something that you should you should be
able<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.210> do<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:23.170> I'm<00:01:23.320> going<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.470> start<00:01:23.740> by

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
able to do so I'm going to start by

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.800 
able to do so I'm going to start by
removing<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.850> cover<00:01:25.060> on<00:01:25.210> this<00:01:25.360> particular

the actual motherboard itself before a
test<00:01:47.380> for<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.740> test<00:01:47.979> that<00:01:48.070> actually<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:49.299> can<00:01:49.390> do

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
test for a test that actually you can do

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.090 
test for a test that actually you can do
a<00:01:49.509> quick<00:01:49.720> test<00:01:49.930> on<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.200> actual<00:01:50.439> DC<00:01:50.830> jack

red<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.170> on<00:01:56.290> this<00:01:56.439> side<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.040> I<00:01:57.250> can<00:01:57.310> see

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
red one on this side and I can see

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.170 
red one on this side and I can see
perfect<00:01:58.299> 19<00:01:59.189> 19<00:02:00.189> volts<00:02:00.460> coming<00:02:00.700> out<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:01.030> there

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
perfect 19 19 volts coming out of there

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.120 
perfect 19 19 volts coming out of there
which<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.170> healthy<00:02:02.470> so<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.619> shows<00:02:02.920> me<00:02:03.100> that

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
which is healthy so that shows me that

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.130 
which is healthy so that shows me that
the<00:02:03.369> power<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.909> coming<00:02:04.329> through<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.630> DC

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
the power is coming through the DC

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.509 
the power is coming through the DC
adapter<00:02:06.030> properly<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.840> not<00:02:08.049> 40<00:02:08.519> this

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
adapter properly and it's not 40 this

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:10.800 
adapter properly and it's not 40 this
particular<00:02:09.909> one<00:02:10.000> I'm<00:02:10.090> using<00:02:10.269> is<00:02:10.450> actually<00:02:10.569> a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
particular one I'm using is actually a

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.600 
particular one I'm using is actually a
universal<00:02:11.590> power<00:02:11.769> supply<00:02:12.189> and<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.459> was

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
universal power supply and it was

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.920 
universal power supply and it was
working<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.299> just<00:02:13.569> for<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.810> video

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
working but that's just for the video

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.320 
working but that's just for the video
just<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.709> let<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.160> how<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.970> would<00:02:16.150> go

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
just to let you see how you would go

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.610 
just to let you see how you would go
ahead<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.599> test<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.050> there's<00:02:17.290> plenty<00:02:17.590> other

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
ahead and test that there's plenty other

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.780 
ahead and test that there's plenty other
videos<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.130> YouTube<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.489> you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
videos on YouTube that you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.559 
videos on YouTube that you
you<00:02:18.909> that<00:02:19.090> one<00:02:19.959> task<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.489> what<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.120> need<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.360> do

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
you that one task so what I need to do

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.319 
you that one task so what I need to do
is<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:22.989> plug<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.349> DC<00:02:23.650> jack<00:02:23.920> into<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.489> DC

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
is just plug the DC jack into the DC

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.709 
is just plug the DC jack into the DC
adapter<00:02:26.260> into<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.560> DC<00:02:27.129> jack<00:02:27.579> so<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.540> can

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
adapter into the DC jack so that I can

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.970 
adapter into the DC jack so that I can
then<00:02:28.750> test<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.319> see<00:02:29.530> if<00:02:29.590> there's<00:02:29.769> power

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
then test to see if there's power

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.160 
then test to see if there's power
getting<00:02:30.280> through<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.480> jack<00:02:31.719> into<00:02:32.049> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
getting through the the jack into the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.140 
getting through the the jack into the
motherboard<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.430> very<00:02:33.609> simple<00:02:33.969> process

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
motherboard and it's very simple process

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.839 
motherboard and it's very simple process
of<00:02:35.670> again

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
of again

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.420 
of again
should<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.299> zoom<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.629> so<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:38.109> see<00:02:38.140> this

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
should just zoom in so you can see this

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:49.280 
should just zoom in so you can see this
and<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:40.709> these<00:02:41.709> two<00:02:42.010> here

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.620 

and<00:02:49.980> what<00:02:50.099> I'm<00:02:50.220> looking<00:02:50.489> for<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.879> see

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and what I'm looking for is to see

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.750 
and what I'm looking for is to see
Vox<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.080> transferring<00:02:52.680> through<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
Vox is transferring through to the to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280 
Vox is transferring through to the to
the<00:02:53.850> motherboard<00:02:54.120> which<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.050> I'll<00:02:55.140> zoom

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the motherboard which is and I'll zoom

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.390 
the motherboard which is and I'll zoom
out<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.800> show<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:58.280> touching<00:02:59.280> these

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
out just to show you that touching these

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.610 
out just to show you that touching these
two<00:02:59.610> points<00:03:01.130> straight<00:03:02.130> away<00:03:02.340> up<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.320> 19<00:03:04.320> volts

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
two points straight away up to 19 volts

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.250 
two points straight away up to 19 volts
so<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.370> know<00:03:05.520> at<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:05.760> stage<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.780> power<00:03:06.990> is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
so I know at this stage the the power is

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.750 
so I know at this stage the the power is
getting<00:03:07.560> through<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.890> DC<00:03:08.220> jack<00:03:08.430> into<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
getting through that DC jack into the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.170 
getting through that DC jack into the
motherboard<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.170> DC<00:03:10.350> jack<00:03:10.710> is<00:03:11.010> not<00:03:11.550> faulty

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
motherboard so the DC jack is not faulty

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.860 
motherboard so the DC jack is not faulty
the<00:03:13.110> other<00:03:13.230> thing<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.710> test<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
the other thing we can test is the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.650 
the other thing we can test is the
actual<00:03:16.170> battery<00:03:16.680> mechanism<00:03:17.420> we<00:03:18.420> want<00:03:18.600> to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
actual battery mechanism we want to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.030 
actual battery mechanism we want to
check<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.960> see<00:03:18.990> if<00:03:19.170> power<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.530> getting<00:03:19.710> from

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
check to see if power is getting from

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.520 
check to see if power is getting from
the<00:03:20.250> DC<00:03:20.640> jack<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.150> battery<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.230> again

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
the DC jack to the battery and again

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.010 
the DC jack to the battery and again
that's<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.830> very<00:03:22.860> simple<00:03:23.310> test<00:03:23.810> zoom<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.930> again

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
that's a very simple test zoom in again

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:32.080 
that's a very simple test zoom in again
so<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.650> see<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:28.080> red<00:03:28.230> note<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.540> large

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
so you can see the red note on the large

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.210 
so you can see the red note on the large
pin<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.780> doing<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.110> little<00:03:34.230> bit<00:03:34.350> further<00:03:37.220> and

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
pin is doing a little bit further and

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.750 
pin is doing a little bit further and
the<00:03:38.820> black<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.210> any<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.200> these<00:03:40.260> are<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.500> ones

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the black on any of these are the ones

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.740 
the black on any of these are the ones
and<00:03:41.760> what<00:03:41.910> I'm<00:03:42.000> looking<00:03:42.150> for<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.600> I'm<00:03:42.720> looking

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
and what I'm looking for is I'm looking

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.170 
and what I'm looking for is I'm looking
to<00:03:43.110> see<00:03:43.290> if<00:03:43.410> there's<00:03:43.650> any<00:03:43.850> reading<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
to see if there's any reading on the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.560 
to see if there's any reading on the
multimeter<00:03:45.690> which<00:03:46.080> there<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:47.210> I'm<00:03:48.210> getting

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
multimeter which there is I'm getting

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.820 
multimeter which there is I'm getting
103<00:03:49.140> which<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.740> which<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.340> fine<00:03:51.740> obviously<00:03:52.740> if

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
103 which is which is fine obviously if

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.230 
103 which is which is fine obviously if
there<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.010> no<00:03:53.100> power<00:03:53.280> coming<00:03:53.550> through<00:03:53.820> there<00:03:54.000> I

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
there is no power coming through there I

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.490 
there is no power coming through there I
wouldn't<00:03:54.660> be<00:03:54.720> getting<00:03:54.840> anything<00:03:55.200> I'll<00:03:55.470> just

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
wouldn't be getting anything I'll just

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.900 
wouldn't be getting anything I'll just
do<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:55.920> again<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.460> can<00:03:56.670> see<00:03:56.820> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
do that again so you can see the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:06.320 
do that again so you can see the
multimeter

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.530 

so<00:04:07.330> again<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.780> know<00:04:07.960> that<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.230> DC<00:04:08.560> jet<00:04:08.800> is<00:04:09.010> fine

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
so again I know that the DC jet is fine

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.820 
so again I know that the DC jet is fine
and<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.630> is<00:04:10.870> basically<00:04:11.260> how<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.500> would

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
and that is basically how I would

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.620 
and that is basically how I would
determine<00:04:12.160> whether<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.670> DC<00:04:12.970> jack<00:04:13.150> is<00:04:13.300> working

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
determine whether the DC jack is working

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.700 
determine whether the DC jack is working
or<00:04:13.780> whether<00:04:13.930> it's<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.230> fault<00:04:14.440> with<00:04:14.590> the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
or whether it's a fault with the
