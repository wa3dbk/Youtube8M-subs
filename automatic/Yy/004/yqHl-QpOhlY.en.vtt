00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.820 
bleach blonde and the bundle deal that I
got<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.490> 18<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.420> 20<00:01:15.750> inch<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> 22

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
got was the 18 the 20 inch and the 22

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.810 
got was the 18 the 20 inch and the 22
inch<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.390> more<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.560> guess<00:01:19.920> 18<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.490> 20

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
inch now it's more like I guess 18 to 20

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.490 
inch now it's more like I guess 18 to 20
20<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> 22<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.500> 20<00:01:23.130> 22<00:01:23.369> 24<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.720> like

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
20 to 22 and 20 22 24 so there are like

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
20 to 22 and 20 22 24 so there are like
when<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> look<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> hair<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:27.119> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
when you look at the hair it's not just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.910 
when you look at the hair it's not just
a<00:01:27.630> strict<00:01:27.930> length<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> lot<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.829> people

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
a strict length I know a lot of people

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.410 
a strict length I know a lot of people
think<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.670> gonna<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.119> flat

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
think that it's just gonna be like flat

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
think that it's just gonna be like flat
out<00:01:30.570> 18<00:01:30.930> inches<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> has<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.310> bit

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
out 18 inches but it has a little bit

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.350 
out 18 inches but it has a little bit
extra<00:01:32.759> length<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:36.030> way<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
extra length to it and the way that I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.020 
extra length to it and the way that I
did<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.259> opened<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> wefts<00:01:38.430> each

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
did it is I opened up the wefts each

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.990 
did it is I opened up the wefts each
weft<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.439> length<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.549> cut<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.880> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
weft for the length and I cut them in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
weft for the length and I cut them in
half<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.630> reason<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.020> did<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.770> my

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
half the reason I did that is because my

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.910 
half the reason I did that is because my
hair<00:01:44.430> color<00:01:44.700> isn't<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.720> color<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.740> what

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
hair color isn't just one color so what

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.249 
hair color isn't just one color so what
I<00:01:46.950> did<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.610> did<00:01:48.090> half<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
I did was I did half of the here and the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.969 
I did was I did half of the here and the
Capac<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.829> joint<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.159> cape<00:01:53.369> half<00:01:53.610> 9a<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
Capac the joint go cape half 9a and

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.620 
Capac the joint go cape half 9a and
which<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> permanent<00:01:56.610> hair<00:01:56.939> color<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
which is a permanent hair color and I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.260 
which is a permanent hair color and I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
use that with my six percent 20 volume

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.719 
use that with my six percent 20 volume
goldwell<00:02:01.170> peroxide<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.399> next<00:02:02.610> thing<00:02:02.670> about

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
pretty much a general thing so even if

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
pretty much a general thing so even if
you<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.160> color<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:08.759> from<00:02:09.360> another

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
which is typically a peroxide developer

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.490 
which is typically a peroxide developer
and<00:02:23.090> then<00:02:24.090> there's<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.840> demi<00:02:25.260> or<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and then there's a demi or a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.470 
and then there's a demi or a
semi-permanent<00:02:26.040> what<00:02:26.370> usually<00:02:26.550> use<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.209> kind

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
semi-permanent what usually use is kind

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.130 
semi-permanent what usually use is kind
of<00:02:27.569> like<00:02:27.660> an<00:02:27.840> acid<00:02:28.019> based<00:02:28.760> developer<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.930> just

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
of like an acid based developer so just

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.240 
of like an acid based developer so just
make<00:02:31.260> sure<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> you're<00:02:31.709> using<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.040> right

the way that you're going to get the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.559 
the way that you're going to get the
least<00:02:47.640> amount<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.910> friction<00:02:48.060> you're<00:02:48.450> not

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
least amount of friction you're not

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.830

rubbing<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.049> hair<00:02:49.410> you're<00:02:49.799> not<00:02:50.040> like

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
rubbing the hair you're not like

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.970 
rubbing the hair you're not like
submersion<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> die<00:02:52.290> or<00:02:52.349> anything<00:02:52.500> like

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
submersion going to die or anything like

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.199 
submersion going to die or anything like
that<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:54.090> used<00:02:54.630> my<00:02:54.930> 9a<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.099> conditioner<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
that so I used my 9a and conditioner and

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.990 
that so I used my 9a and conditioner and
the<00:02:57.360> top<00:02:57.569> chic<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.140> color<00:02:58.410> my<00:02:58.700> part<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.849> that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the top chic to color my part of that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 
the top chic to color my part of that
portion<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.780> hair<00:03:00.930> extensions<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.590> then

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
portion of the hair extensions and then

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.420 
portion of the hair extensions and then
for<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> other<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.670> i<00:03:02.880> used<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:04.250> silver<00:03:05.250> one

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
for the other one i used a silver one

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.069 
for the other one i used a silver one
tonner<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.209> reason<00:03:06.360> i<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:06.569> used<00:03:06.989> to

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
tonner and the reason i just used to

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.449 
tonner and the reason i just used to
toner<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.530> because<00:03:07.799> i<00:03:07.920> didn't<00:03:08.130> want<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.370> alter

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
toner is because i didn't want to alter

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.059 
toner is because i didn't want to alter
the<00:03:08.760> level<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.239> color<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:10.230> i<00:03:10.260> did<00:03:10.590> want<00:03:10.620> to

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the level of the color but i did want to

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.160 
the level of the color but i did want to
change<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.640> base<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.420> color<00:03:12.630> i<00:03:12.720> wanted<00:03:13.019> it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
change the base of the color i wanted it

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
change the base of the color i wanted it
to<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.380> more<00:03:13.530> silver<00:03:13.980> i<00:03:14.010> wanted<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.670> be<00:03:14.760> more

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
to be more silver i wanted it to be more

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.160 
to be more silver i wanted it to be more
ashy<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.769> how<00:03:16.950> i<00:03:17.390> did<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.930> other

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
ashy so that is how i did the other

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.590 
ashy so that is how i did the other
section<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.250> once<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.850> color<00:03:21.090> had<00:03:21.359> sit

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
section of it so once the color had sit

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.530 
section of it so once the color had sit
on<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.290> about<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:23.370> believe<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.090> left<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.420> for

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
on for about I believe I left it for

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.110 
on for about I believe I left it for
half<00:03:24.750> an<00:03:24.900> hour<00:03:24.959> each<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.519> rinsed<00:03:27.030> it

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
half an hour each and then I rinsed it

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.970 
half an hour each and then I rinsed it
off<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.630> then<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.840> did<00:03:28.230> another<00:03:28.260> round<00:03:28.799> of

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
off and then I did another round of

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.370 
off and then I did another round of
co-washing<00:03:29.489> which<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.239> basically<00:03:30.359> cover<00:03:31.049> the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
co-washing which you basically cover the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.259 
co-washing which you basically cover the
hair<00:03:31.859> extensions<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.340> conditioner<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.090> then

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
hair extensions of conditioner and then

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.660

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
them more platinum which was perfect now

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.410

something<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.430> always<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> good<00:04:17.180> option

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
something that is always a good option

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.130 
something that is always a good option
is<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.050> do<00:04:18.640> with<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:20.120> color<00:04:20.360> hair<00:04:20.600> extensions

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
is to do with the color hair extensions

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.250 
is to do with the color hair extensions
is<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.530> use<00:04:21.680> deposit<00:04:22.370> only<00:04:22.490> color<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.260> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
is to use deposit only color and the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.710 
is to use deposit only color and the
reason<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.590> is<00:04:24.890> good<00:04:25.190> is<00:04:25.400> because<00:04:25.610> often<00:04:26.480> if

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
reason that is good is because often if

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.210 
reason that is good is because often if
it's<00:04:26.900> deposit<00:04:27.380> only<00:04:27.500> especially<00:04:28.070> like

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
it's deposit only especially like

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.770 
it's deposit only especially like
something<00:04:28.580> like<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.820> Manic<00:04:29.120> Panic<00:04:29.330> where

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
something like the Manic Panic where

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.990 
something like the Manic Panic where
it's<00:04:29.900> vegan<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.530> deposit<00:04:30.950> only<00:04:31.070> you're<00:04:31.880> not

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
it's vegan and deposit only you're not

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.900 
it's vegan and deposit only you're not
going<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.210> have<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.480> use<00:04:32.690> any<00:04:32.870> peroxide<00:04:33.910> so
