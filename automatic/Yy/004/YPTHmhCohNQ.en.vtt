and support some very bad ideas I think
it's<00:01:58.740> exactly<00:01:58.889> right<00:01:59.310> Tommy<00:02:00.149> smothers<00:02:00.389> is<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it's exactly right Tommy smothers is a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.209 
it's exactly right Tommy smothers is a
hero<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.109> mine<00:02:01.319> I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:01.859> he's<00:02:02.039> completely

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
hero of mine I think he's completely

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.669 
hero of mine I think he's completely
right<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.880> bust<00:02:03.060> me<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.389> and<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.409> I'm

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
right to bust me on that and I think I'm

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.309 
right to bust me on that and I think I'm
also<00:02:04.859> completely<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.880> say<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
also completely right to say but you

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.109 
also completely right to say but you
should<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.709> on<00:02:07.889> shows<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:08.610> agree<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
should go on shows you don't agree and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.820 
should go on shows you don't agree and
tell<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> truth<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.229> see<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.680> I<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
tell the truth as you see it I think

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.220 
tell the truth as you see it I think
that's<00:02:11.100> also<00:02:11.550> completely<00:02:11.910> right

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that's also completely right

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.080 
that's also completely right

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.890 
you understand that the rage is also
tempered<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.760> outrageous<00:04:06.420> things<00:04:06.450> are

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
tempered the outrageous things are

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.500 
tempered the outrageous things are
tempered<00:04:07.350> with<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.500> certain<00:04:07.920> kind<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.510> humanity

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
but I'm just saying that there's a full

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.210 
but I'm just saying that there's a full
person<00:04:15.600> there<00:04:15.960> and<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:16.410> think<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:16.980> often

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
you pick up a paper and read this is

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.870 
you pick up a paper and read this is
what<00:04:21.600> Obama<00:04:21.900> said<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.320> up<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.370> forget

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
what Obama said it up that you forget

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.560 
what Obama said it up that you forget
that<00:04:24.570> there<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.410> not<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.640> context<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:27.479> the
