00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.910
 good morning, let's go with a new revision 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.050
 of trail shoes in this case the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.599
 newest new balance 910 version 1 as 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.590
 you can see is the first iteration of 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.629
 this model with which new balance 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.640
 It aims to squeeze everything that has 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.390
 learned on the one hand as to 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 slippers pisteras with its very successful 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.400
 my balance last year's let bill 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.780
 we can see it here is how you see the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.180
 profile 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.040
 has changed a lot if the new led 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.180
 bill was a machine to roll by tracks 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:58.129
 is with a chassis asphalteters you set 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.440
 pretty classic in this new 910 we see 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.710
 and a lot of reinforcements and designs 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.540
 very specific trail is both in 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.810
 how the chassis is mounted with 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.930
 reinforcements everywhere 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.420
 the midsole and also on the soles 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.479
 yes in the leb and the hearth one of those 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.310
 strengths and it responded pretty well 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.200
 when you led out trails and terrain 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.830
 technical taking into account that it was a 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.140
 roll in the new in 910 has not been 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.229
 resorted to rubber vibrate but if it's still 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 that at the most pronounced and this you 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.399
 ensures more short-term traction in 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.590
 all the grounds will have to be seen in 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.539
 our test thoroughly if that is that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.630
 ado really behaves in the field 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.659
 wet wet rock and long term like 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.319
 They tend to make the rubber vibrate as much 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.890
 highlighted are the series of reinforcements that 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:54.670
 has is everywhere in your chassis 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.520
 the new 910 with the aim that at 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.679
 work in steep technical terrain 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 and such and for many and many hours 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.689
 which is what they are designed these 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.189
 slippers go well technically 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.099
 they are slippers that we will find 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.110
 between 120 and 130 euros with a drop of 8 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.840
 millimeters 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.560
 and with a weight that is the highlight in 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.450
 them extremely light is 290 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.700
 grams is even below what 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.890
 the led bill weighs and is its main 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.420
 advantage for who has been 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.060
 traditionally the queen of the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.390
 category the saga of the abrupt kharja 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.670
 let's take some cascadia brooks for 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.520
 that you can compose where the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.970
 inspiration of evolution here you have 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.380
 my cascadia 8 with already about 800 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.620
 kilometers and several laps to their 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.350
 back and as you can see it is undeniable that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.360
 there is a direct inspiration perhaps where 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.340
 easier to see it is not only in the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 cover on the upper but above all 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.300
 You see in the sole and in the midsole and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.550
 midsole is and then how are they 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.160
 willing reinforcements such 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.489
 longitudinal to hold the foot well 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.070
 more obvious in the waterfall you know 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.890
 but also very present in 910 in 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.560
 the new balance 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.930
 and we can see that in its geometry there 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.490
 very similar similarities but the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.880
 main difference as we comment is 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.430
 the weight with the same chassis or the same 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.550
 concept of design last and similar 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.570
 and aim to roll however new 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.240
 balance have achieved a shoe that is 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.020
 approximately 40 50 grams lighter 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.220
 on each foot part of this lightness is 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.720
 owes to the compound used in the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.840
 sole and new midsole which is the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.280
 replay that probably as we saw in 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.430
 the netbook that was the first 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.950
 sneakers in getting it out is contributing today 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.890
 day a buffer capacity is 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.640
 very very prominent with respect to the limited 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.510
 weight that you have as you see we have 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.769
 stabilizers everywhere a 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.080
 heel very firm behind we have different 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.110
 densities and adjustments as we go to 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.800
 load the weight for heel we look for 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.510
 also have different fasteners and 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.540
 prisoners to walk to the foot 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.150
 and maybe another difference with other 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.580
 slippers is that even having a bridge 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.220
 in a relatively flat and straight way 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.610
 down in the case of new balance if 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.250
 we have a straighter shoe and 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.039
 elongated is that the traditional 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.650
 waterfalls that are wider is this 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.430
 it also comes from how it has gone 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.410
 developing and evolving and 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.330
 evolving to new balance 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.830
 sneakers from what he learned 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.600
 with the minibus project that he has follows 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.320
 having as the main icon to the new 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.970
 balance 110 that he developed and with which 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.760
 he keeps running very often in front of a 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.270
 Well, as you can see, it's a very 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.320
 similar to the foot although the new balance 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.570
 minimum 110 demands a lot from the corridor 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.750
 It's symmetrical shape barely carries lightness 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.000
 and if you look at the sole and the chassis 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.950
 are completely designed following 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.310
 what is the sole of the foot in the case 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.650
 of the 910 because it has that tendency is 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.050
 undeniable but everything is done in a way 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.590
 more straight so we can run with 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.810
 her for 10 15 20 hours and eat us 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.470
 all types of land 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.150
 where it will work best is 910 then in 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.419
 great ultra trailers where they alternate 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.210
 tracks and technical terrain because we are 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.400
 talking about careers like they can be 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.490
 Most of the Spanish ultra- fishing 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.669
 you will find very comfortable in races like 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:51.000
 transgrancanaria penyagolosa gran trail 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.650
 peÃ±alara ultra trail guara is what is it 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.530
 most characteristic of our careers 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.690
 is that they have more or less half and half 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.419
 of time we will be going by land 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.840
 technical rocks and trails and half by 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.840
 tracks and glens good without a big 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.010
 first step that sure that new balance 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.080
 will continue to evolve and improve 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.710
 even more to the future the more 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.130
 highlighted as we have already told you with a 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.419
 chassis and a sole that give confidence to 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.630
 when putting them in front of 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.120
 protection and getting off tracks 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.880
 they maintain an extraordinary lightness 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.220
 magnificent so it seems predictable that 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.680
 we see them very often in the player 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.660
 Spanish throughout this 2014 thanks 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.660
 for your attention and until next time 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.660
 one
