00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.370
 let's expand 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.580
 the case number 3 conversion in which 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.739
 by the way there is reference to us to go from a system 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.700
 of numbering not that bad 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.099
 to the numbering system there is no obvious week the second different from the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.419
 First 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.419
 to veto the next case happen 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.470
 the number 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.900
 one 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.940
 0 1 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.190
 1 0 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 expressed on the basis of two 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.430
 To the system 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.430
 number 3 base 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.840
 to a numbering system in phase 3 that goal so 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.390
 well what we have to do here first 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.650
 you say as the conjugation of the two previous cases that we have seen 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.990
 then we go first to apply case 2 in which we then take the fibers 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.750
 as we did previously 1 0 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.860
 one 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.110
 one 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.340
 we go 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.340
 after corroborating that a little bit is zero so we have 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.160
 let's multiply the by the value of the base 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.340
 by two 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 by two 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.610
 and for 200 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340
 after having done that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.430
 we throw exponents to studies starting right-left between both 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.610
 by zero 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 smoke 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.649
 the 2 the 3 and the 4 until exhausting each one is circulating 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.730
 then we would have to add 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.000
 and we send you 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.370
 2 at 0 some workouts to do or for one 2 Aragon or 2 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.820
 donostia one for you all sides 4 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 we are left with four 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 two to 3 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.010
 what to do or by 8 2/4 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.360
 16 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.830
 then we have an eye for 16 sep 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.160
 then we will solve the products in this case one for 16 16 0 for 8 and 0 one 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.909
 for 4 4 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.909
 out by 2 2 irises 0 by 1 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.269
 we look at what we find that the results have not been correct 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.789
 it looks like it is 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:32.049
 three after suffering let's add then 16-0 +4 command to make a 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:32.479
 transit 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.779
 the same as if we have four full-length handbags 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:41.749
 percent no true value then we would have expressed that equal to 22 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
 efe stop this value understood 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.159
 is going to proceed 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.650
 as we are here in base 10 aquino explained the father and I hope good 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.240
 it is assumed that this entity is more than 10 kilograms of base paste 3 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:02.339
 we apply the case again a document from the 1st case when reviewing 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.119
 a division in your gums of euros for the value of the most indicated 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.660
 then 7 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.389
 7 for 3 21 22% 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.399
 we can make a division between 3 and 3 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.399
 in this case 2 for 3 6 to 7 euros 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.629
 the edition ends remember when the quotient is lower than the base of this case 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.999
 two years younger than 13 aces then already 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.999
 as an answer we can say 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.219
 cited as sixth 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.539
 this quotient and then received 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.539
 then spoils 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.279
 in base 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.510
 and that is the case number 3
