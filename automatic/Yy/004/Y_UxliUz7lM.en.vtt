00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
of its movement phase add an extra base

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.389 
of its movement phase add an extra base
to<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:58.180> swarm<00:00:58.420> of<00:00:58.510> scarabs<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.170> the<00:01:00.129> way<00:01:00.219> this

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
to a swarm of scarabs and the way this

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.000 
to a swarm of scarabs and the way this
model<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:00.760> set<00:01:01.000> up<00:01:01.180> is<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:01.690> is<00:01:02.020> normally<00:01:02.649> a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
model is set up is that is normally a

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.240 
model is set up is that is normally a
ball<00:01:03.489> joint<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:04.780> should<00:01:05.080> go<00:01:05.289> to<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.740> top<00:01:06.070> of

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
ball joint which should go to the top of

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.029 
ball joint which should go to the top of
the<00:01:06.789> flying<00:01:07.240> stand<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:08.350> was<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.500> very<00:01:08.710> very

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
the flying stand that was a very very

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.150 
the flying stand that was a very very
loose<00:01:09.220> connection<00:01:09.759> so<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.950> introduced<00:01:11.950> some

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
loose connection so I introduced some

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.389 
loose connection so I introduced some
magnets<00:01:12.610> because<00:01:13.539> it<00:01:13.750> just<00:01:13.869> works<00:01:14.399> much

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
magnets because it just works much

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.770 
magnets because it just works much
easier<00:01:15.430> now<00:01:16.289> I've<00:01:17.289> also<00:01:17.530> magnetized<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.780> base

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
easier now I've also magnetized the base

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.589 
easier now I've also magnetized the base
slightly<00:01:20.259> to<00:01:20.380> keep<00:01:20.530> this<00:01:20.709> safe<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:22.420> you

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:22.599 
slightly to keep this safe because you

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.210 
slightly to keep this safe because you
can<00:01:22.780> set<00:01:22.990> these<00:01:23.140> up<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:24.220> as<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.580> basic<00:01:25.119> spider

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
can set these up just as a basic spider

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.540 
can set these up just as a basic spider
you<00:01:27.220> can<00:01:27.399> also<00:01:27.580> give<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.069> could<00:01:30.280> if<00:01:30.459> I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
you can also give it or you could if I

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.830 
you can also give it or you could if I
hadn't<00:01:30.819> just<00:01:31.000> lost<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:31.270> magnet<00:01:31.569> on<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.720> back

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
hadn't just lost the magnet on the back

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.859 
hadn't just lost the magnet on the back
of<00:01:31.959> that<00:01:33.149> that's<00:01:34.149> going<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.360> need<00:01:34.509> some<00:01:34.690> more

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
of that that's going to need some more

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.389 
of that that's going to need some more
glue<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.099> also<00:01:36.310> give<00:01:36.700> it<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:38.399> particle

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
glue you can also give it a particle

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.350 
glue you can also give it a particle
weapon<00:01:39.940> on<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.270> top

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
weapon on the top

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.360 
weapon on the top
just<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.200> make<00:01:42.230> it<00:01:43.120> slightly<00:01:44.120> nastya<00:01:45.370> so

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
just to make it slightly nastya so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.630 
just to make it slightly nastya so
monstrous<00:01:46.850> creature<00:01:47.140> three<00:01:48.140> wounds<00:01:48.640> produces

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
monstrous creature three wounds produces

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.280 
monstrous creature three wounds produces
more<00:01:49.790> scarabs<00:01:50.470> repairs<00:01:51.470> vehicles<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:53.170> if<00:01:54.170> you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
more scarabs repairs vehicles and if you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.610 
more scarabs repairs vehicles and if you
put<00:01:54.500> three<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.950> these<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:56.510> a<00:01:56.930> scarab<00:01:57.320> swarm

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
put three of these on and a scarab swarm

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.960 
put three of these on and a scarab swarm
it's<00:01:58.040> quite<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.670> nasty<00:01:59.060> quite<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> nasty<00:02:00.290> list<00:02:00.970> we

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
it's quite a nasty quite a nasty list we

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.660 
it's quite a nasty quite a nasty list we
had<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.120> lot<00:02:02.180> of<00:02:02.300> panicky<00:02:02.750> people<00:02:03.340> I'm<00:02:04.340> thinking

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
had a lot of panicky people I'm thinking

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.690 
had a lot of panicky people I'm thinking
when<00:02:05.660> we<00:02:05.780> get<00:02:05.900> these<00:02:06.050> on<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.320> field<00:02:06.700> anyway

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
when we get these on the field anyway

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.760 
when we get these on the field anyway
