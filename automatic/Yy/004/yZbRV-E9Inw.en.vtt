overall<00:00:31.349> okay<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:31.769> progressing<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.759> on

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
overall okay we're progressing but on

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
overall okay we're progressing but on
the<00:00:33.000> other<00:00:33.090> half<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.600> episode<00:00:33.989> definitely

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the other half this episode definitely

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.410 
the other half this episode definitely
felt<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.010> pacing<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.090> getting

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
felt like the pacing is just getting

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.959 
felt like the pacing is just getting
rapidly<00:00:37.350> faster<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.040> starting<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.520> notice<00:00:38.670> as

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
rapidly faster I'm starting to notice as

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.459 
rapidly faster I'm starting to notice as
each<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.510> every<00:00:39.719> episode<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> series

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
each and every episode of the series

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
each and every episode of the series
goes<00:00:40.739> by<00:00:41.010> they're<00:00:41.520> starting<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> lot

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
goes by they're starting to go a lot

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
goes by they're starting to go a lot
quicker<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.170> honestly<00:00:43.710> wouldn't<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
quicker like I honestly wouldn't be

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
quicker like I honestly wouldn't be
surprised<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.399> initially<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:45.510> had<00:00:45.690> plans<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
surprised if initially they had plans to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.350 
surprised if initially they had plans to
probably<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.340> 9<00:00:47.550> volumes<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.210> they

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
probably just do the 9 volumes that they

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.340 
probably just do the 9 volumes that they
said<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> believe<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:48.960> said<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.170> were<00:00:49.260> gonna

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
said I believe they said they were gonna

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
said I believe they said they were gonna
do<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.920> first<00:00:50.129> nine<00:00:50.399> volumes<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.390> then

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
do the first nine volumes but then

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
do the first nine volumes but then
ultimately<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.230> Monica<00:00:52.680> wrapped<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
ultimately the Monica wrapped up this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
ultimately the Monica wrapped up this
major<00:00:53.910> arc<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.539> everything<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.050> 100

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
major arc and everything with 100

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
major arc and everything with 100
chapters<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.399> wouldn't<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.940> surprised<00:00:57.270> if

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
chapters so I wouldn't be surprised if

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
chapters so I wouldn't be surprised if
they're<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.469> first<00:00:58.649> 100

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
they're just gonna do the first 100

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.380 
they're just gonna do the first 100
chapters<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.760> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> threw<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
chapters and they kind of threw out the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
chapters and they kind of threw out the
initial<00:01:00.600> plan<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.590> why<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.070> going

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
initial plan and that's why it's going

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
initial plan and that's why it's going
super<00:01:02.670> fast<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:03.329> even<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.199> episode

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
super fast because even in this episode

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
super fast because even in this episode
some<00:01:05.280> events<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.360> remember

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
some events that I don't remember

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 
some events that I don't remember
necessarily<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.250> were<00:01:08.310> foreshadowed

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
necessarily if they were foreshadowed

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
necessarily if they were foreshadowed
and<00:01:09.270> had<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.840> pieces<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and had these little pieces in it in the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.280 
and had these little pieces in it in the
manga<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> particular<00:01:11.729> point<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.960> yeah

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
manga at this particular point but yeah

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.630 
manga at this particular point but yeah
it's<00:01:13.470> definitely<00:01:13.710> starting<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:14.460> like

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's definitely starting to look like

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
it's definitely starting to look like
it's<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:14.939> very<00:01:15.299> fast<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.140> really

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it's going very fast and I'm really

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
it's going very fast and I'm really
hoping<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.119> anime

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
hoping that we don't go like an anime

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.330 
hoping that we don't go like an anime
only<00:01:18.810> route<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.259> sometimes<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
only route because sometimes you know it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.770 
only route because sometimes you know it
still<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.880> entertaining<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> still

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
still can be entertaining and it still

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020 
still can be entertaining and it still
could<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.080> good<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.650> within<00:01:23.280> particular<00:01:23.820> ties

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
could be good but within particular ties

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
could be good but within particular ties
I<00:01:24.299> honestly<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.140> hoping<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.070> know

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I honestly was hoping for like you know

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.859 
I honestly was hoping for like you know
we<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> keep<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.360> eventually<00:01:27.420> get

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
we can keep on going and eventually get

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080 
we can keep on going and eventually get
another<00:01:28.080> season<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.650> another<00:01:28.950> season<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.610> it's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
another season in another season so it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.030 
another season in another season so it's
getting<00:01:30.360> me<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.630> bit<00:01:31.020> worried<00:01:31.650> what's

ultimately that fight was awesome you
can<00:02:33.360> argue<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.690> maybe<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.080> fast<00:02:34.410> pace<00:02:34.620> I

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
can argue that maybe a fast pace I

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.380 
can argue that maybe a fast pace I
personally<00:02:35.250> think<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.519> was<00:02:35.700> fast<00:02:35.940> pace<00:02:36.209> I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
personally think it was fast pace I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.030 
personally think it was fast pace I
think<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.989> we<00:02:37.080> should<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.319> had<00:02:37.440> another

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
think that we should have had another

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.979 
think that we should have had another
maybe<00:02:38.459> fine<00:02:38.849> make<00:02:39.209> possibly<00:02:39.630> even<00:02:39.810> ten

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
maybe fine make possibly even ten

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.479 
maybe fine make possibly even ten
minutes<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.410> fight<00:02:40.680> making<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.370> little

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
minutes of that fight making it a little

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.160 
minutes of that fight making it a little
bit<00:02:41.700> slower<00:02:41.819> because<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:42.840> epic<00:02:43.050> as

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170

but<00:02:55.170> then<00:02:55.260> he<00:02:55.319> threw<00:02:55.500> him<00:02:55.620> out<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.709> ring<00:02:55.950> as

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
but then he threw him out the ring as

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.430 
but then he threw him out the ring as
well<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.400> I'm<00:02:56.610> head<00:02:57.209> honcho<00:02:57.690> here<00:02:57.720> remember

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
well like I'm head honcho here remember

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.990 
well like I'm head honcho here remember
but<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:58.950> after<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.760> started

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
but then after that one we started

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.250 
but then after that one we started
getting<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.269> little<00:03:00.360> bit<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.660> foreshadowing<00:03:00.840> of

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
getting a little bit of foreshadowing of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
getting a little bit of foreshadowing of
things<00:03:01.319> person<00:03:01.769> what<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:01.950> see<00:03:02.130> Jericho<00:03:02.910> and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
things person what we see Jericho and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.610 
things person what we see Jericho and
gear<00:03:03.480> de<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.110> kind<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.319> giving<00:03:04.410> us

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
gear de so it's kind of giving us

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.930 
gear de so it's kind of giving us
foreshadowing<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> something<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.730> might

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
foreshadowing of something that might

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.490 
foreshadowing of something that might
happen<00:03:06.180> maybe<00:03:06.690> they're<00:03:06.930> gonna<00:03:07.019> come<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.319> and

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
happen maybe they're gonna come in and

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.170 
happen maybe they're gonna come in and
interrupt<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:07.980> tournament<00:03:08.489> or<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.060> know<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
interrupt this tournament or you know a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.000 
interrupt this tournament or you know a
big<00:03:09.420> battle<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> protein<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.620> little<00:03:10.890> bit

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
big battle as a protein so a little bit

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.100 
big battle as a protein so a little bit
of<00:03:11.069> setup<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.489> there<00:03:11.670> cool<00:03:12.120> stuff<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:12.900> then

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
of setup right there cool stuff but then

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.110 
of setup right there cool stuff but then
when<00:03:13.319> we<00:03:13.349> get<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.590> Diane's<00:03:14.130> fight<00:03:14.519> that's<00:03:14.940> when

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
when we get to Diane's fight that's when

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.850 
when we get to Diane's fight that's when
I<00:03:15.150> started<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.540> notice<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.870> things<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.680> going

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
I started to notice that things is going

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.340 
I started to notice that things is going
real<00:03:17.069> fast<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:17.700> was<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.060> Diane<00:03:18.959> versus

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
real fast it was like Diane versus

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.930 
real fast it was like Diane versus
Hauser<00:03:19.560> could<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:20.010> been<00:03:20.100> half<00:03:20.370> an<00:03:20.549> episode

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
Hauser could have been half an episode

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.699 
Hauser could have been half an episode
or<00:03:21.090> more<00:03:21.329> because<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:22.019> was<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.590> know

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
or more because that was you know

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.110 
or more because that was you know
supposed<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.220> be<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> manga<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> remember<00:03:24.090> I

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
supposed to be in the manga I remember I

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.849 
supposed to be in the manga I remember I
think<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.390> was<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.630> chapter<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.350> two<00:03:25.680> or

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
think that was like a chapter or two or

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.319 
think that was like a chapter or two or
chapter<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.340> half<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.609> can't<00:03:26.820> really<00:03:26.910> quite

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
chapter and a half I can't really quite

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.520 
chapter and a half I can't really quite
remember<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.780> remember<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.200> having<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
decent amount and yeah it was kind of

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.870 
decent amount and yeah it was kind of
very<00:03:31.230> quick<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.829> then<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> fight<00:03:32.549> we<00:03:32.760> get

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.550 
apparently has history and we got a
little<00:03:53.639> bit<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.910> foreshadowing<00:03:54.269> into<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.260> sin

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
little bit of foreshadowing into the sin

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.590 
little bit of foreshadowing into the sin
that<00:03:55.769> basically<00:03:56.190> Mellie<00:03:56.549> Otis<00:03:56.850> committed<00:03:57.389> and

that basically Mellie Otis committed and

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.379 
that basically Mellie Otis committed and
it's<00:03:58.079> like<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:58.980> going<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.519> fast<00:03:59.819> now<00:04:00.150> what

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
it's like it's going so fast now what

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.030 
it's like it's going so fast now what
happened<00:04:00.840> we<00:04:00.900> had<00:04:01.079> some<00:04:01.260> really<00:04:01.470> good<00:04:01.709> pacing

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
happened we had some really good pacing

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.740 
happened we had some really good pacing
yeah<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.430> was<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.579> little<00:04:02.850> bit<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.329> know<00:04:03.450> kind

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
yeah it was a little bit you know kind

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.030 
yeah it was a little bit you know kind
of<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.019> up-and-up<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> wasn't<00:04:04.980> like

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
of on the up-and-up but it wasn't like

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.220 
of on the up-and-up but it wasn't like
this<00:04:05.100> like<00:04:05.489> we're<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.910> going<00:04:06.150> very<00:04:06.420> fast<00:04:06.840> and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
this like we're just going very fast and

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.349 
this like we're just going very fast and
it's<00:04:07.350> like<00:04:07.470> yeah<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.010> my<00:04:08.400> fast<00:04:08.790> pacing<00:04:09.239> but

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
it's like yeah I like my fast pacing but

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.640 
it's like yeah I like my fast pacing but
not<00:04:09.510> too<00:04:09.720> fast<00:04:09.989> where<00:04:10.260> you're<00:04:10.380> just<00:04:10.590> like

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
not too fast where you're just like

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.129 
not too fast where you're just like
glossing<00:04:11.549> over<00:04:11.670> everything<00:04:12.269> also<00:04:12.569> got<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.930> note

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
glossing over everything also got a note

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.569 
glossing over everything also got a note
that<00:04:13.319> they<00:04:13.530> are<00:04:13.680> definitely<00:04:14.010> doing<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
that they are definitely doing the

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.180 
that they are definitely doing the
fanservice<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.389> mean<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:15.810> wasn't<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.620> manga<00:04:17.039> but

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
I like how they kind of threw in a

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.320 
I like how they kind of threw in a
little<00:04:36.010> bit<00:04:36.220> of<00:04:36.250> comedy<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.790> actually<00:04:36.940> was

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
little bit of comedy and I actually was

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.150 
little bit of comedy and I actually was
genuinely<00:04:37.780> funny<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:38.380> also<00:04:38.830> at<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:39.010> same

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
genuinely funny and also at the same

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.590 
genuinely funny and also at the same
time<00:04:39.220> has<00:04:39.520> served<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:40.180> plot

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
time has served the plot

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.270 
time has served the plot
I<00:04:40.630> like<00:04:40.810> when<00:04:40.990> comedy<00:04:41.530> can<00:04:41.710> actually<00:04:42.100> serve

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
I like when comedy can actually serve

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.190 
I like when comedy can actually serve
the<00:04:42.310> plot<00:04:42.700> where<00:04:43.030> Baum<00:04:43.270> was<00:04:43.300> like<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:43.780> want<00:04:44.140> to

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
the plot where Baum was like I want to

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.960 
the plot where Baum was like I want to
see<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:44.380> serious<00:04:44.770> fight<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:45.340> he<00:04:45.490> paid<00:04:45.730> those

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
see a serious fight so he paid those

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.730 
see a serious fight so he paid those
bitches<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.690> basically<00:04:47.020> pretend<00:04:47.440> like<00:04:47.560> they

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
bitches to basically pretend like they

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.600 
bitches to basically pretend like they
liked<00:04:47.920> Mellie<00:04:48.130> Otis

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
liked Mellie Otis

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.340 
liked Mellie Otis
so<00:04:48.790> that<00:04:48.940> way<00:04:49.120> Diane<00:04:49.330> would<00:04:49.690> get<00:04:49.810> upset<00:04:50.140> and

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
so that way Diane would get upset and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.380 
so that way Diane would get upset and
we'd<00:04:50.590> have<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.800> proper<00:04:51.250> match<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:51.700> while<00:04:52.180> you're

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
we'd have a proper match so while you're

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.910 
we'd have a proper match so while you're
throwing<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:52.780> comedy<00:04:53.200> you're<00:04:53.380> connecting<00:04:53.830> it

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
throwing in comedy you're connecting it

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.350 
throwing in comedy you're connecting it
to<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.160> plot<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:54.580> it's<00:04:54.700> not<00:04:54.790> just<00:04:54.850> senseless

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
to the plot so it's not just senseless

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.510

ultimately<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.340> just<00:05:42.550> seems<00:05:42.700> like<00:05:42.790> they're

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
ultimately it just seems like they're

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.720 
ultimately it just seems like they're
possibly<00:05:43.870> going<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.560> be<00:05:44.650> rearranging<00:05:45.370> events

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
possibly going to be rearranging events

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.400 
possibly going to be rearranging events
and<00:05:45.880> moving<00:05:46.180> things<00:05:46.390> around<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:46.750> I<00:05:46.840> really

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
and moving things around and I really

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.810 
and moving things around and I really
hope<00:05:47.530> that's<00:05:47.740> not<00:05:47.950> the<00:05:48.040> case<00:05:48.190> I<00:05:48.370> honestly

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
hope that's not the case I honestly

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.060 
hope that's not the case I honestly
don't<00:05:49.060> want<00:05:49.300> for<00:05:49.750> seven<00:05:50.020> deadly<00:05:50.230> sins<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.920> go

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
don't want for seven deadly sins to go

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.860 
don't want for seven deadly sins to go
anime<00:05:51.460> only<00:05:51.760> like<00:05:51.880> I<00:05:52.030> honestly<00:05:52.420> was<00:05:52.570> hoping

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
anime only like I honestly was hoping

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.870 
anime only like I honestly was hoping
that<00:05:52.930> we<00:05:53.140> could<00:05:53.260> go<00:05:53.440> possibly<00:05:54.250> even<00:05:54.400> weekly

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
that we could go possibly even weekly

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.400 
that we could go possibly even weekly
with<00:05:55.060> this<00:05:55.210> or<00:05:55.390> definitely<00:05:56.020> have<00:05:56.200> you<00:05:56.290> know

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
the increase in pacing the speed and

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.940

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.859 
episode Diane right
was<00:06:39.799> like<00:06:39.919> the<00:06:40.069> poster<00:06:40.489> child<00:06:40.519> for<00:06:40.909> boobies

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:41.869 
was like the poster child for boobies

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.659 
was like the poster child for boobies
here<00:06:42.499> were<00:06:42.679> close<00:06:42.889> to<00:06:42.979> this<00:06:43.069> episode<00:06:43.489> I

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
here were close to this episode I

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:44.859 
here were close to this episode I
personally<00:06:44.059> thought<00:06:44.209> again<00:06:44.419> it<00:06:44.539> was<00:06:44.629> very

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:44.869 
personally thought again it was very

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:46.839 
personally thought again it was very
good<00:06:45.109> but<00:06:45.439> it's<00:06:45.919> getting<00:06:46.279> me<00:06:46.369> scared<00:06:46.699> the

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
good but it's getting me scared the

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.939 
good but it's getting me scared the
pacing<00:06:47.299> needs<00:06:47.599> to<00:06:47.839> slow<00:06:48.079> down<00:06:48.289> and<00:06:48.589> they<00:06:48.709> need

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
pacing needs to slow down and they need

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.829 
pacing needs to slow down and they need
to<00:06:49.159> not<00:06:49.369> switch<00:06:49.759> events<00:06:50.149> around<00:06:50.359> that's<00:06:50.749> all

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:50.839 
to not switch events around that's all

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.089 
to not switch events around that's all
