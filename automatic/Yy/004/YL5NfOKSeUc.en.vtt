reason I like this one the brutal

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.230 
reason I like this one the brutal
talisman<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:09.370> because<00:01:09.610> you<00:01:09.700> get<00:01:09.820> secondary

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
talisman is because you get secondary

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.780 
talisman is because you get secondary
stats<00:01:10.570> like<00:01:10.690> a<00:01:10.750> lot<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.229> crit<00:01:11.530> but<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.640> reason

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
stats like a lot of crit but the reason

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.670 
stats like a lot of crit but the reason
why<00:01:13.000> I'm<00:01:13.150> deciding<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.690> use<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:13.990> one<00:01:14.170> more<00:01:14.440> is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
why I'm deciding to use this one more is

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.840 
why I'm deciding to use this one more is
because<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:16.060> like<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.960> flat<00:01:17.680> 1000<00:01:18.520> strength

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
because I like a flat 1000 strength

sounds so good to me like it affects

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
sounds so good to me like it affects
every<00:01:22.450> hit<00:01:22.660> every<00:01:22.869> bleep<00:01:23.530> tick<00:01:23.800> I<00:01:23.920> ever<00:01:24.070> do<00:01:24.369> and

second you get fourth we just take for

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.710 
second you get fourth we just take for
granted<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:48.910> get<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.090> four<00:01:49.330> thousand

worries really fighting and you get
critical<00:02:09.580> strike<00:02:09.850> which<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.119> really<00:02:10.330> nice

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
critical strike which is really nice

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.979 
critical strike which is really nice
just<00:02:10.750> have<00:02:11.140> because<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:12.239> more<00:02:13.239> crib<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.810> it

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
just have because if more crib I like it

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.229 
just have because if more crib I like it
now<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.680> reason<00:02:14.980> why<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.250> think<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.060> best

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
now the reason why I think that the best

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.780 
now the reason why I think that the best
thing<00:02:16.390> for<00:02:16.510> me<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.810> use<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.320> because<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.580> one

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
thing for me to use is because this one

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.810 
thing for me to use is because this one
it<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.570> procs<00:02:20.049> for<00:02:20.739> 4000<00:02:21.370> strength<00:02:21.640> all

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
it it procs for 4000 strength all

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.880 
it it procs for 4000 strength all
together<00:02:22.209> when<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:22.989> whenever<00:02:23.200> your<00:02:23.470> proc<00:02:23.709> is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
together when up whenever your proc is

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.740 
together when up whenever your proc is
up<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.160> have<00:02:24.280> 4000<00:02:25.030> strength<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.420> little<00:02:25.600> bit

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
up you have 4000 strength a little bit

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.020 
up you have 4000 strength a little bit
over<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> 4200<00:02:26.560> strength<00:02:26.829> now<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.790> difference

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
over a 4200 strength now the difference

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.050 
over a 4200 strength now the difference
is<00:02:28.920> 1000<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.160> strength<00:02:30.549> that<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.760> have

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
is 1000 of that strength that you have

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.090 
is 1000 of that strength that you have
every<00:02:31.540> 30<00:02:31.780> seconds<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.320> built<00:02:32.650> into<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
every 30 seconds is built into the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.470 
every 30 seconds is built into the
trinket<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.910> all<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.450> time

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
trinket that you have it all the time

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.900 
trinket that you have it all the time
and<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.049> don't<00:02:35.950> get<00:02:36.010> any<00:02:36.190> secondary<00:02:36.640> stats

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
and you don't get any secondary stats

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.530 
and you don't get any secondary stats
but<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.180> get<00:02:37.299> 1000<00:02:38.110> strength<00:02:38.380> all<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> time

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
but you get 1000 strength all the time

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.580 
but you get 1000 strength all the time
and<00:02:40.540> that's<00:02:40.660> why<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:40.930> think<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.440> one

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
and that's why I think I like this one

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.319 
and that's why I think I like this one
better<00:02:42.329> yeah<00:02:44.220> 4300<00:02:45.220> strength<00:02:45.489> or<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.970> little

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
better yeah 4300 strength or a little

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.190 
better yeah 4300 strength or a little
bit<00:02:46.420> less<00:02:46.510> than<00:02:46.690> that

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
bit less than that

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.660 
bit less than that
not<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.160> think<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.520> that<00:02:48.550> one<00:02:48.790> better

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
not so I think I like that one better

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.770 
not so I think I like that one better
not<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.819> think

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.490 

but<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:58.010> being<00:02:58.190> said<00:02:59.050> this<00:03:00.050> trinket<00:03:00.319> is

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
but that being said this trinket is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.910 
but that being said this trinket is
pretty<00:03:00.709> badass<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:03.560> think<00:03:03.740> that<00:03:03.770> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
pretty badass I just think that the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.410 
pretty badass I just think that the
static<00:03:04.220> strength<00:03:04.459> on<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.730> one<00:03:04.910> is<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.180> little

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
static strength on this one is a little

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.360 
static strength on this one is a little
bit<00:03:05.660> better<00:03:07.120> old<00:03:08.120> okay<00:03:08.900> let's<00:03:09.140> say<00:03:09.380> like<00:03:10.250> if

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
bit better old okay let's say like if

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.620 
bit better old okay let's say like if
it's<00:03:10.550> not<00:03:10.700> unique<00:03:10.850> equipped<00:03:11.270> I'm<00:03:11.420> about<00:03:11.480> to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
it's not unique equipped I'm about to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.370 
it's not unique equipped I'm about to
cook<00:03:11.750> through<00:03:11.930> them<00:03:12.080> bitches<00:03:13.300> yeah<00:03:14.300> oh<00:03:14.600> no<00:03:15.020> its

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
you can use whatever trinket you prefer

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.420 
you can use whatever trinket you prefer
like<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.140> might<00:03:24.290> prefer<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.530> longer<00:03:24.890> Prague<00:03:25.160> I

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
like you might prefer a longer Prague I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.940 
like you might prefer a longer Prague I
prefer<00:03:25.970> like<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.270> static<00:03:26.780> strength<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.739> proc

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
prefer like a static strength and a proc

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.360 
prefer like a static strength and a proc
that<00:03:28.130> occurs<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.940> know<00:03:29.030> plenty<00:03:29.239> often<00:03:30.370> but

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
that occurs you know plenty often but

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.729 
that occurs you know plenty often but
for<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:31.820> if<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.870> like<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.080> longer<00:03:33.290> practical

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
for you if you like the longer practical

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.870 
for you if you like the longer practical
I<00:03:33.890> was<00:03:34.010> just<00:03:34.100> explaining<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:34.580> why<00:03:34.730> I'm

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
I was just explaining to you why I'm

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.009 
I was just explaining to you why I'm
using<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.390> because<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:35.690> I've<00:03:35.810> got<00:03:35.930> my

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
using it because like I've got my

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.320 
using it because like I've got my
warrior<00:03:36.290> set<00:03:36.530> up<00:03:36.650> for<00:03:36.890> strength<00:03:37.550> optimization

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
warrior set up for strength optimization

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.390 
warrior set up for strength optimization
if<00:03:38.780> somebody<00:03:39.050> was<00:03:39.140> up<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.440> crit<00:03:39.680> optimization

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
if somebody was up for crit optimization

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.430 
if somebody was up for crit optimization
i<00:03:40.580> might<00:03:40.790> go<00:03:41.060> towards<00:03:41.330> this<00:03:41.480> one<00:03:41.720> because<00:03:42.200> you

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
i might go towards this one because you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.750 
i might go towards this one because you
get<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> lot<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.830> crit<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.580> know<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.700> mean<00:03:44.530> yeah

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
get a lot of crit you know I mean yeah

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.070 
get a lot of crit you know I mean yeah
yeah

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.980 

so<00:03:52.040> I'll<00:03:52.400> protest<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:53.270> silent<00:03:53.570> tears<00:03:53.660> at<00:03:53.840> some

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
so I'll protest the silent tears at some

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.820 
so I'll protest the silent tears at some
point<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.770> got<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.400> got<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.790> trinket<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.830> it

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
point I got I got this trinket and it

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.800 
point I got I got this trinket and it
might<00:03:58.340> be<00:03:58.370> good<00:03:58.580> for<00:03:58.640> PVE<00:03:59.210> I'm<00:04:00.170> not<00:04:00.380> sure<00:04:01.810> this

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
might be good for PVE I'm not sure this

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.240 
might be good for PVE I'm not sure this
I<00:04:03.020> think<00:04:03.080> I'm<00:04:03.320> this<00:04:03.530> one<00:04:03.680> might<00:04:03.800> be<00:04:03.830> more<00:04:04.040> fun

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
I think I'm this one might be more fun

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.550 
I think I'm this one might be more fun
but<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:04.610> one<00:04:04.790> like<00:04:05.600> my<00:04:05.750> auto<00:04:05.990> attacks<00:04:06.380> for

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
but this one like my auto attacks for

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.620
