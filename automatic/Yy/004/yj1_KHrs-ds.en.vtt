"Speaker 1: I'm Katie Wagner, I'm an intern
from Germany, I'm a pharmacy student and as

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.199
I said I'm doing an internship here at UCSF
at the Bioengineering and Pharmaceutical department.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:42.800
My project is on HIV drugs, I'm interested
in special transporter and the liver, it's

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.000
like a protein which transports different
substrates or different molecules into the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.430
liver cells where they get metabolized so
the body can get rid of it.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.120
Because some of the HIV drugs inhibit the
transporter and HIV patients get a lot of

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.750
different drugs so that's a big field for
working with the transporters in the liver.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.420
I'm a rock climber so most of the time that
I'm not in the lab I'll be either in a gym

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.710
or more or less outdoors rock climbing, hiking,
backpacking.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.830
What I like about rock climbing is there's
also a trial and error, there's always getting

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.350
something new out of the whole experience
and maybe it's not working, maybe it is working.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.940
I've been doing pharmacy for four years now
and I wanted to see something different than

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:49.420
just ordinary pharmacy so I thought research
would be a good thing.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.930
I have cells growing so I'm tending to my
cells everyday.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.170
I have cells which express my transporter
that I'm interested in.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.900
The transporter is called OATP1B1, it's like
a special transporter which transports a lot

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.800
of drugs which then leads me to the field
of research that I'm doing because I'm trying

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:22.200
to find out the amount of some drugs which
inhibit the transporter so which stop the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.260
transporter working.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.731
So other subsets cannot get into the cell
and the body cannot get rid of them so they

00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.870
will get a high concentration in the body
and the people get more sick than they were

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.870
before.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.810
I did not know that research was not always
about getting good results but about getting

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.390
bad results to or none results at all.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.430
Are you sure I should transfer it because
I think I cannot get everything out of it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.430
when it's.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.430
Speaker 2: That's fine.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.569
Then yeah I would add in the original, so
add in an equal volume to this and try to

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.569
get it to go into solution.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.569
Speaker 1: Okay.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.610
But I guess that's, like everyone has to find
that out.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.960
Just you have to like what you do.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.600
I think that's the most important thing.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:35.040
Be interested in what you do."
