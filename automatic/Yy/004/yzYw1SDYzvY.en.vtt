added the little light strobing things
on<00:00:38.440> purpose<00:00:39.129> and<00:00:39.309> wanted<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.640> show<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.820> that

basically<00:00:44.590> how<00:00:44.830> it<00:00:44.949> works<00:00:44.980> is<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.340> move<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
basically how it works is you move the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.420 
basically how it works is you move the
iron<00:00:45.940> golems<00:00:46.330> around<00:00:46.830> along<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.720> they<00:00:50.430> able

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
iron golems around along and they able

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.600 
iron golems around along and they able
to<00:00:52.470> kick<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.620> ball<00:00:53.800> when<00:00:54.040> it<00:00:54.159> gets<00:00:54.280> near<00:00:54.460> them

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
to kick the ball when it gets near them

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.160 
to kick the ball when it gets near them
as<00:00:54.729> you<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:54.970> see<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.269> balls<00:00:55.449> affected<00:00:55.989> by

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
as you can see the balls affected by

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.649 
as you can see the balls affected by
them<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:57.040> ball<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:57.970> made<00:00:58.239> up<00:00:58.390> of<00:00:58.540> a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
them the ball of this is made up of a

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.390 
them the ball of this is made up of a
number<00:00:58.809> of<00:00:58.960> mine<00:00:59.199> cups<00:00:59.500> inspiration<00:01:00.309> of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
number of mine cups inspiration of

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.149 
number of mine cups inspiration of
course<00:01:00.610> by<00:01:00.820> sethbling<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:02.140> I'm<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.409> very

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
course by sethbling so I'm a very

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.160 
course by sethbling so I'm a very
brilliant<00:01:03.430> idea<00:01:03.970> it<00:01:04.390> took<00:01:04.510> me<00:01:04.690> a<00:01:04.720> lot<00:01:04.870> of<00:01:04.900> time

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
brilliant idea it took me a lot of time

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.660 
brilliant idea it took me a lot of time
to<00:01:05.470> harness<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:05.920> ability<00:01:06.430> I've<00:01:06.549> got

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
to harness that ability I've got

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.660 
to harness that ability I've got
eighteen<00:01:07.060> line<00:01:07.330> cuts<00:01:07.600> there<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.430> they<00:01:09.610> do

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
eighteen line cuts there and and they do

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.120 
eighteen line cuts there and and they do
whatever<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.270> hell<00:01:10.390> they<00:01:10.570> want<00:01:10.750> really<00:01:11.130> I'm

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
whatever the hell they want really I'm

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.780 
whatever the hell they want really I'm
just<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.820> uh<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:13.799> guess<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.010> God's<00:01:15.220> messenger

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
just a uh I guess the God's messenger

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.890 
just a uh I guess the God's messenger
really<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:18.130> um<00:01:18.400> yeah<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:19.060> basically<00:01:19.360> stem<00:01:19.630> on

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
really so um yeah you basically stem on

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.330 
really so um yeah you basically stem on
the<00:01:20.230> other<00:01:20.410> side<00:01:20.650> of<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.800> glass<00:01:21.010> but<00:01:21.220> I'm

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
the other side of the glass but I'm

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.710 
the other side of the glass but I'm
gonna<00:01:21.460> get<00:01:21.700> down<00:01:21.850> here<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.270> kick<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.570> go

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
gonna get down here and kick it go

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.250 
gonna get down here and kick it go
because<00:01:23.290> I<00:01:23.950> need<00:01:24.160> have<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.790> need<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.200> I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
because I need have this need to so I

because I need have this need to so I
can<00:01:26.380> kind<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.620> show<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.980> bit<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.310> ropes

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
can kind of show you a bit of the ropes

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.760 
can kind of show you a bit of the ropes
and<00:01:27.790> how<00:01:27.880> things<00:01:28.060> work<00:01:28.330> unfortunately<00:01:29.320> for<00:01:29.680> me

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
and how things work unfortunately for me

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.340 
and how things work unfortunately for me
the<00:01:29.920> ball<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.220> moving<00:01:30.430> arbitrarily<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.480> very

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the ball is moving arbitrarily and very

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.010 
the ball is moving arbitrarily and very
quickly<00:01:32.650> so<00:01:33.490> I'm<00:01:33.670> not<00:01:33.880> able<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.270> trace<00:01:34.810> its

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
quickly so I'm not able to trace its

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.480 
quickly so I'm not able to trace its
movements<00:01:35.440> well<00:01:35.620> enough<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.980> kick<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.190> golf

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
movements well enough to kick a golf

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.150 
movements well enough to kick a golf
well<00:01:36.820> there<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:37.180> go<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.510> kick<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.900> go<00:01:38.050> yeah<00:01:38.950> about

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
well there we go I kick to go yeah about

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.000 
well there we go I kick to go yeah about
that<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.180> goes<00:01:40.690> when<00:01:40.960> they<00:01:41.050> come<00:01:41.260> in<00:01:41.440> that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
that so it goes when they come in that

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.430 
that so it goes when they come in that
will<00:01:42.160> go<00:01:42.310> on<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.910> notification<00:01:43.690> will<00:01:44.110> come<00:01:44.260> up

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
will go on a notification will come up

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.830 
will go on a notification will come up
and<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.770> will<00:01:44.860> go<00:01:45.070> for<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.730> side<00:01:46.030> opposite<00:01:46.720> of

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
and it will go for the side opposite of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.190 
and it will go for the side opposite of
the<00:01:46.960> one<00:01:47.580> where<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.700> went<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.750> if<00:01:49.930> if

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
the one where it went in so like if if

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200 
the one where it went in so like if if
it<00:01:50.680> went<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.010> blue<00:01:51.160> goes<00:01:51.400> it's<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.850> goal<00:01:52.060> for

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
it went in the blue goes it's a goal for

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.960 
it went in the blue goes it's a goal for
the<00:01:52.300> red<00:01:52.480> team<00:01:52.750> something<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:54.550> ball<00:01:54.760> should

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
the red team something the ball should

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.520 
the red team something the ball should
have<00:01:55.090> come<00:01:55.210> up<00:01:55.360> by<00:01:55.510> now<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:55.990> obviously<00:01:56.140> it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
have come up by now but obviously it's

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
have come up by now but obviously it's
taking<00:01:56.860> its<00:01:56.980> time<00:01:57.100> because<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:57.580> recording

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
taking its time because I'm recording

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.460 
taking its time because I'm recording
there<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:58.870> go<00:01:59.020> visible<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:01.170> comes<00:02:02.170> out<00:02:02.350> at

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
there we go visible it comes out at

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.730 
there we go visible it comes out at
arbitrary<00:02:02.710> timing<00:02:03.370> because<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.810> has<00:02:05.560> this

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
arbitrary timing because it has this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.130 
arbitrary timing because it has this
issue<00:02:05.980> with<00:02:06.550> corners<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:07.330> minecart<00:02:07.870> tracks

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
issue with corners on minecart tracks

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.660 
issue with corners on minecart tracks
because<00:02:08.409> there<00:02:08.709> are<00:02:08.800> eight<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.069> mine<00:02:09.310> carts

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
because there are eight a mine carts

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.160 
because there are eight a mine carts
like<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:09.970> said<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.330> does<00:02:10.479> whatever<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.929> hell<00:02:10.989> at

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
like I said it does whatever the hell at

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.170 
like I said it does whatever the hell at
once<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.040> it'll<00:02:12.190> flutter<00:02:12.550> for<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.849> minute

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
once so it'll flutter for a minute

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.390 
once so it'll flutter for a minute
bounce<00:02:13.840> around<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.530> then<00:02:14.709> finally<00:02:15.220> come<00:02:15.370> up

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
bounce around and then finally come up

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.910 
bounce around and then finally come up
to<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> surface<00:02:15.909> to<00:02:16.200> her<00:02:17.200> breath<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.680> fresh

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
to the surface to her breath of fresh

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.690 
to the surface to her breath of fresh
air<00:02:18.269> kick<00:02:19.269> another<00:02:19.480> go<00:02:19.659> because<00:02:20.319> we<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.709> ah

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
air kick another go because we can ah

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.130 
air kick another go because we can ah
go<00:02:22.239> in<00:02:22.390> now<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.409> game<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.680> over

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
go in now the game is over

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.920 
go in now the game is over
when<00:02:25.560> one<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.580> teams<00:02:26.820> reaches<00:02:27.420> seven

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
when one of the teams reaches seven

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.230 
when one of the teams reaches seven
goals<00:02:28.140> that's<00:02:29.010> basically<00:02:29.370> how<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.580> win<00:02:29.850> so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
goals that's basically how you win so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.300 
goals that's basically how you win so
now<00:02:30.360> both<00:02:30.510> teams<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:31.200> goal<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.160> said

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
now both teams have one goal like I said

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.860 
now both teams have one goal like I said
you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.520> move<00:02:32.640> these<00:02:32.850> guys<00:02:32.910> by<00:02:33.390> stepping<00:02:33.780> on

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you can move these guys by stepping on

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.240 
you can move these guys by stepping on
their<00:02:34.050> pressure<00:02:34.260> plate<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.710> can<00:02:34.890> only<00:02:35.010> move

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
their pressure plate so I can only move

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.690 
their pressure plate so I can only move
the<00:02:35.460> blue<00:02:35.670> guys<00:02:35.910> being<00:02:36.240> on<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> blue<00:02:36.750> side<00:02:37.700> as

the blue guys being on the blue side as

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.050 
the blue guys being on the blue side as
you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.090> see<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.600> blue<00:02:39.780> side<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
you can see on the blue side and the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.390 
you can see on the blue side and the
right<00:02:42.240> guy<00:02:42.620> behind<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.770> red<00:02:43.890> side<00:02:44.070> can<00:02:44.280> only

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
right guy behind the red side can only

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370 
right guy behind the red side can only
move<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:45.120> red<00:02:45.600> guys<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.050> there's<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> ball

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
move the red guys and there's the ball

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.800 
move the red guys and there's the ball
again<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.130> game<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.460> on<00:02:47.550> again<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.690> this

again and the game is on again so this

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.660 
again and the game is on again so this
will<00:02:48.990> go<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.650> said<00:02:49.860> until<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.400> team

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
will go on like I said until one team

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.930 
will go on like I said until one team
reaches<00:02:51.290> seven<00:02:52.290> goals<00:02:52.530> or<00:02:52.980> until<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.730> turn

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
reaches seven goals or until you turn

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.910 
reaches seven goals or until you turn
the<00:02:53.970> game<00:02:54.209> off<00:02:54.390> manually<00:02:54.900> over<00:02:55.140> here<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.770> an

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
the game off manually over here it's an

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
the game off manually over here it's an
manual<00:02:56.490> off<00:02:56.670> switch<00:02:57.000> which<00:02:57.300> I've<00:02:57.570> just<00:02:57.720> done

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
manual off switch which I've just done

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.010 
manual off switch which I've just done
and<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:59.130> if<00:02:59.250> someone<00:02:59.430> kicks<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.790> goal<00:03:00.000> when<00:03:00.990> the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
and so if someone kicks a goal when the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.110 
and so if someone kicks a goal when the
power<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.770> off<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.250> ball<00:03:02.459> will<00:03:02.670> stay<00:03:02.910> down

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
power is off the ball will stay down

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120 
power is off the ball will stay down
there<00:03:03.390> until<00:03:03.570> someone<00:03:04.170> presses<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.860> green

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
button both sides on both sides so you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.410 
button both sides on both sides so you
can<00:03:07.709> access<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.760> from<00:03:08.850> either<00:03:09.120> side<00:03:09.300> and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
can access that from either side and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.479 
can access that from either side and

when the ball goes in but the ball will
stay<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.330> chill<00:03:24.570> underneath<00:03:25.440> until<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
stay and just chill underneath until the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.930 
stay and just chill underneath until the
game<00:03:27.930> has<00:03:28.140> begun<00:03:28.350> again<00:03:28.739> get<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.220> there<00:03:29.370> yes

silly thing oh yeah

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.580 
silly thing oh yeah
so<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.700> say<00:03:32.970> go<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> ball<00:03:34.110> won't<00:03:34.290> come<00:03:34.470> up

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
so I say go but the ball won't come up

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.410 
so I say go but the ball won't come up
again<00:03:34.680> until<00:03:35.070> someone<00:03:35.730> presses<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> green

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
again until someone presses is a green

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.830 
again until someone presses is a green
button<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.380> initiates<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.010> start<00:03:38.840> so

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
button and that initiates the start so

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.750 
button and that initiates the start so
basically<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.470> works<00:03:40.590> off<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.160> hitboxes

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
basically it works off of the hitboxes

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.759 
basically it works off of the hitboxes
of<00:03:42.120> some<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.480> these<00:03:42.540> mobs<00:03:42.840> cows<00:03:43.230> have<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.530> small

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
of some of these mobs cows have a small

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.920 
of some of these mobs cows have a small
head<00:03:43.980> boxes<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.519> iron<00:03:44.670> golems<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.840> I've

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
head boxes and iron golems and so I've

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.930 
head boxes and iron golems and so I've
used<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.350> cows<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.950> side<00:03:47.220> fenders<00:03:47.700> if<00:03:47.820> I'd

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
used the cows for side fenders if I'd

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.310 
used the cows for side fenders if I'd
use<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.269> iron<00:03:48.390> golems<00:03:48.750> there<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.049> ball<00:03:49.230> would

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
use the iron golems there the ball would

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.259 
use the iron golems there the ball would
hit<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.950> then<00:03:50.459> come<00:03:50.670> right<00:03:50.700> back<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
hit that and then come right back the

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.660 
hit that and then come right back the
way<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.510> came<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:53.040> problem<00:03:53.340> with<00:03:53.519> having

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
way it came and the problem with having

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.550 
way it came and the problem with having
mallets<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.330> had<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.510> 9<00:03:54.690> go<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.049> there<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.350> I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
mallets if I had a 9 go on there and I

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.380 
mallets if I had a 9 go on there and I
go<00:03:55.799> on<00:03:55.950> there<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.220> then<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.820> other<00:03:56.850> dude<00:03:57.180> says

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
go on there and then the other dude says

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.509 
go on there and then the other dude says
they<00:03:57.540> normally<00:03:57.900> are<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.739> ball<00:03:58.920> would<00:03:59.100> come<00:03:59.370> up

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
they normally are the ball would come up

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.090 
they normally are the ball would come up
hit<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.030> guy<00:04:00.239> go<00:04:01.200> all<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.500> way<00:04:01.530> down<00:04:01.769> here

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
hit that guy go all the way down here

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.520 
hit that guy go all the way down here
hit<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> guy<00:04:02.850> over<00:04:03.030> there<00:04:03.390> go<00:04:03.989> all<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> way<00:04:04.230> back

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
hit a guy over there go all the way back

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.130 
hit a guy over there go all the way back
hit<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.519> guy<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.360> would<00:04:06.480> just<00:04:06.510> repeat

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
hit that guy and it would just repeat

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.320 
hit that guy and it would just repeat
over<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.709> over<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.610> had<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.820> make<00:04:09.000> smaller

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
over and over so I had to make smaller

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.400 
over and over so I had to make smaller
hitbox<00:04:09.780> guys<00:04:10.080> namely<00:04:11.390> cows<00:04:12.390> have<00:04:12.930> an<00:04:13.140> extra

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
hitbox guys namely cows have an extra

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.600 
hitbox guys namely cows have an extra
one<00:04:13.530> therefore<00:04:13.920> when<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.130> ball<00:04:14.280> comes<00:04:14.459> out

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
one therefore when the ball comes out

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.990 
one therefore when the ball comes out
there<00:04:14.870> for<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.959> ball<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.410> hit<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:17.729> that's

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
there for the ball to hit so that's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.610 
there for the ball to hit so that's
basically<00:04:18.299> how<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.570> works<00:04:18.630> now<00:04:19.229> these<00:04:19.410> guys

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
basically how it works now these guys

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.240 
basically how it works now these guys
here

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
here

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.030 
here
I<00:04:20.280> pushed<00:04:21.239> by<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.510> piston<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.200> then<00:04:22.380> there's<00:04:22.680> a

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
I pushed by a piston and then there's a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.010 
I pushed by a piston and then there's a
-<00:04:23.550> double<00:04:23.850> circuit<00:04:24.240> which<00:04:24.360> comes<00:04:24.660> on<00:04:24.870> the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
- double circuit which comes on the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.570 
- double circuit which comes on the
closing<00:04:25.470> edge<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.950> push<00:04:26.220> back<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.270> it's<00:04:28.020> really

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
closing edge to push back so it's really

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.330 
closing edge to push back so it's really
simple<00:04:29.580> redstone<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:31.410> I'm<00:04:31.860> gonna<00:04:32.040> show<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.250> to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
simple redstone and I'm gonna show it to

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.730 
simple redstone and I'm gonna show it to
you<00:04:32.430> real<00:04:32.640> quick<00:04:32.669> this<00:04:33.599> is<00:04:33.810> where<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.380> the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
you real quick this is where the the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.950 
you real quick this is where the the
ball<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.610> stuff<00:04:35.849> I<00:04:36.180> kept<00:04:36.419> it's<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.690> really

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
ball and stuff I kept it's a really

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.480 
ball and stuff I kept it's a really
simple<00:04:37.200> way<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.590> get<00:04:37.830> them<00:04:37.950> all<00:04:38.070> up

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
simple way to get them all up

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.129 
simple way to get them all up
I<00:04:38.580> originally<00:04:38.940> had<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> really<00:04:39.810> complicated

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
I originally had a really complicated

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.809 
I originally had a really complicated
way<00:04:40.560> which<00:04:40.770> went<00:04:41.009> up<00:04:41.099> through<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.400> middle<00:04:41.729> it

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
way which went up through the middle it

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.089 
way which went up through the middle it
was<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.970> sand<00:04:42.270> elevator<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.229> that<00:04:43.710> works<00:04:43.919> for

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
was a sand elevator and that works for

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.860 
was a sand elevator and that works for
individual<00:04:44.580> mine<00:04:44.759> cuts<00:04:45.060> for<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.449> way<00:04:45.569> I<00:04:45.599> had

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
individual mine cuts for the way I had

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.170 
individual mine cuts for the way I had
it<00:04:45.990> but<00:04:46.500> not<00:04:46.770> for<00:04:46.949> 18<00:04:47.280> minecarts<00:04:47.849> it<00:04:48.000> just

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
it but not for 18 minecarts it just

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.629 
it but not for 18 minecarts it just
fades<00:04:48.419> right<00:04:48.720> through<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.020> sand<00:04:49.259> so<00:04:49.770> my<00:04:50.430> big

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
fades right through the sand so my big

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.520 
fades right through the sand so my big
complicated<00:04:51.240> system<00:04:51.569> which<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.900> could<00:04:52.349> show

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
complicated system which I could show

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.740 
complicated system which I could show
you<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.889> really<00:04:53.160> wanted<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.400> see<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.750> ended

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
you if you really wanted to see it ended

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.059 
you if you really wanted to see it ended
up<00:04:54.870> not<00:04:55.050> working<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:55.650> went<00:04:55.919> off<00:04:55.949> a

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
up not working and I just went off a

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.499 
up not working and I just went off a
very<00:04:56.280> simple<00:04:56.669> alternative<00:04:57.180> which<00:04:57.330> is<00:04:57.479> a

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
very simple alternative which is a

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.629 
very simple alternative which is a
minecart<00:04:58.110> track<00:04:58.169> now<00:04:58.919> these<00:04:59.069> are<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.280> corners

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
minecart track now these are the corners

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.129 
minecart track now these are the corners
I<00:04:59.729> was<00:04:59.819> talking<00:05:00.120> about<00:05:00.150> sometimes<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.960> mind

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
I was talking about sometimes the mind

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.200 
I was talking about sometimes the mind
of<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:02.009> minecart<00:05:02.460> will<00:05:02.669> get<00:05:02.789> caught<00:05:03.030> either

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
of the minecart will get caught either

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.219 
of the minecart will get caught either
here<00:05:03.660> or<00:05:03.870> on<00:05:04.080> another<00:05:04.949> corner<00:05:05.460> up<00:05:05.580> there<00:05:06.229> just

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
here or on another corner up there just

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.450 
here or on another corner up there just
because<00:05:07.470> they<00:05:07.590> can't<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:07.979> it<00:05:08.099> will<00:05:08.250> bounce

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
because they can't and it will bounce

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.120 
because they can't and it will bounce
between<00:05:09.180> there<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.750> there<00:05:10.380> so<00:05:10.740> if<00:05:10.860> you're<00:05:11.009> on

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
between there and there so if you're on

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.649 
between there and there so if you're on
the<00:05:11.220> red<00:05:11.400> side<00:05:11.780> brake<00:05:12.780> like<00:05:13.560> this<00:05:13.800> block<00:05:14.039> here

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
the red side brake like this block here

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.909 
the red side brake like this block here
go<00:05:15.659> down<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:16.229> give<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.409> a<00:05:16.500> quick<00:05:16.590> nudge

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
go down and just give it a quick nudge

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.529 
go down and just give it a quick nudge
so<00:05:17.880> if<00:05:18.479> it<00:05:18.599> jams<00:05:19.139> up<00:05:19.409> that's<00:05:19.590> how<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:19.740> fix<00:05:19.979> it

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
so if it jams up that's how you fix it

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.450 
so if it jams up that's how you fix it
what<00:05:21.539> shouldn't<00:05:21.810> happen<00:05:22.250> I've<00:05:23.250> done

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
what shouldn't happen I've done

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.070 
what shouldn't happen I've done
everything<00:05:23.909> in<00:05:24.030> my<00:05:24.060> power<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.569> make<00:05:24.720> sure<00:05:24.870> it

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
everything in my power to make sure it

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.350 
everything in my power to make sure it
doesn't<00:05:25.259> happen<00:05:25.669> but<00:05:26.669> it<00:05:26.819> has<00:05:26.940> been<00:05:27.150> known<00:05:27.330> to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
doesn't happen but it has been known to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.120 
doesn't happen but it has been known to
happen<00:05:27.780> so<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:28.139> you<00:05:28.229> have<00:05:28.319> that<00:05:28.409> problem<00:05:28.590> do

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
happen so if you have that problem do

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.790 
happen so if you have that problem do
