 little more than 2 liters per 100 km 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.010

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 remember that the previous generation 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.009
 suffering from overweight which generated 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.369
 consumption too high for the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.909

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.290
 new GT that Ford had revealed in 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.720
 beginning of the year at strait in addition to a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.560
 manly look dictated by aerodynamics to 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.660
 US 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.520
 made the choice of lightweight materials like 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.730
 carbon fiber and aluminum 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.130
 under the hood the v6 ecoboost biturbo and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.170
 bill injection offers more than 600 horses 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.300
 ford teams have been working in the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.670
 secret to realize the one who embodies 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.010
 the giant's innovation policy 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.099
 as we explained jean-eric to raul 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.180
 editor of the auto legs we 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.239
 have been very lucky to be able to 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.599
 go see to say good the secret room 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.880
 the basement where was designed this ford gt 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.959
 because that's also part of what 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.580
 made this car extraordinary 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.440
 when she was introduced to the show 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.640
 strait the car in itself but 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.260
 especially the conditions of its realization 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.560
 and the secret was kept until 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.640
 last moment and to succeed his strong 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.650
 still a very big company 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.440
 they put together a secret room 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.069
 whose basement the building of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.780
 research 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.940
 before this form and there was 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.549
 only two keys that were made 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.500
 for for this piece a key that was 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.180
 entrusted to rejuvenate that is the boss of the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.769
 development of the Ford group and the other 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.150
 key that has been entrusted to death and callum 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.920
 the boss of the world design 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.410
 so obviously there were people who 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.640
 worked all day but in 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.540
 the members of the team that works 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.489
 on this car 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.310
 others only went so 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.870
 intermittent and this is particularly the case 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.700
 dan colen art who was who the boss 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.079
 him of the interior style he had 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.730
 members of his team that was in the 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.730
 need who was working in this dance is 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.000
 in this basement but he officially 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.200
 was not there and when a season one of 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.299
 his collaborators told him listening 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.350
 I need to talk to you about budgets 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.700
 would be nice if you pretended to go to 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.870
 toilet because we do not have to 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.400
 know where you're going here that's when 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.910
 even funny enough but for the moment it has 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.889
 worked 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.450
 the secret was kept up to the day 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.609
 of revelation at the Straits Lounge in 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.400
 January serial production will begin 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.650
 when she in 2016 you find the 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.350
 subject complete ford gt 2015
