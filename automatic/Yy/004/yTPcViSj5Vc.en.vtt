00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello here i'm going to do a little life 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.309
 small video screen test yamaha 24 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:16.279
 inches b 24 81 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:20.580
 so first of all I am globally disappointed 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.859
 of this screen actually who I find them 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.890
 dairies are I really do not find 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.650
 terrible so we're going to see this here 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 on bastian goes on a black screen 6 1 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.440
 to start it's a good idea so 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.710
 already there is a problem I would like them 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:48.690
 lighting is not how to say is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.140
 not constant I do not buy if it is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.320
 see well here but clearly we see 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.930
 that it comes from the ball leaks 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 light down and we're on 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.399
 dark images 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.100
 sorry but it shows what and I 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.570
 manages screen old 10 to 10 years old next eh 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 Well, it's all black and we're not replacing 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.890
 black this porridge is over and that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 comes underneath so I do not know if 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.159
 maybe it's the led it's like that in 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.259
 any case cb at level both at the level 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.650
 grids especially so here we go 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.030
 see him so proud in tomb raider good the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.290
 resolution here is where she is perfect 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.869
 she's the good one for that it's a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.380
 little stretched 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.579
 bah actually the monkey or very dark and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.390
 what will happen is that it's a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.810
 can for example see the state this is here 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.000
 that's what's going to happen is that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.070
 it's just a dark game that's not going well 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.119
 give it really well that gives a lot 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.500
 better be in old screens ten years ago 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.130
 because the flaws is much more 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 dark and is much less bright 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 vhc spent a lot more bull images 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.670
 are good I do not know if we see it well 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 here I went by lara 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.490
 croft the a1 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:15.330
 I'm doing a jump that's good we'll say that 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.760
 Well, it's better I do not know it's 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.070
 weird it's the writing it's really the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.170
 high school in a game his bath dassasgho 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.870
 what then finally if not brightness 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.370
 clearly I could even create during the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.610
 fasting we know it's you what the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.390
 brightness gelac saw vi that is stuck 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.700
 in fact in the game 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.100
 I thought to reduce the game is not 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.070
 true so here we will put in another 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.050
 game for example in our game we're going 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.959
 see 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.100
 it's not the top that changed 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.110
 the screen with a 19 inch screen in 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.700
 1280 have what is good it's when you 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.700
 have the secret because the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.790
 Bordelais front border are very thin 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.410
 it really is really good 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.440
 see there are not a lot of spaces between 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.390
 two are actually the Turkish bank of 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.870
 my 19 inch is really bigger 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.250
 that of my 24 what so we see 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.570
 here it helps to have things that give 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.540
 pretty good in dual screen makes it a 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.549
 so obviously it's not the same 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.930
 screen resolution of which here is one 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:37.860
 see we do not see we do not see it 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.250
 really here be the camera but actually 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.989
 here if you wanted to say describes there 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.010
 and there we see it like halos 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.049
 blow tasks here and there in fact there ' 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.489
 nothing good I do not know if it's because 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.340
 that she did not hesitate good on my 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.470
 old screens do not good ben voila me I 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.050
 I'm a little disappointed here on the level of 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:04.730
 colors at the color level 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.730
 what are you going to complain about 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.770
 finally on the digital that say that 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.900
 it's not just that but hey we'll say 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.100
 that puts him under the sun god screen 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.440
 it's even worse 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.060
 wow I thought that you're disappointed her 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.430
 ranks at screams and nails 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.710
 actually I got to play by 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.530
 example or new tomb raider I play 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.910
 on my old screen the oath that have 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:37.050
 So here is a level of the little 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.730
 if I have the type you so at the level of 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.350
 the thickness we see at the level of 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.590
 the thickness at the level of the worst one is 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.810
 well at the level of the foot ben frankly has 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.520
 nothing wrong it is set to the millimeter 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.370
 the height to make it coincide that 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.240
 our screen the god the scrill 1 which has 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:59.090
 serves the most we can move 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.580
 like that it does not move these goods 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.680
 it is good when it is well done here 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.640
 so the little one does not even have voice editing 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.650
 this is a crime face to face on 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.180
 So here sees that this is 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:19.530
 exactly as we normally see 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:22.140
 here we see that here is for example 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.810
 this is an example that I give you and there 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.110
 we see we can not see anything 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.840
 weird 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.310
 I try to quibble in the rails 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.740
 we advance change the brightness of 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.300
 drivers his rule by lowering the 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.760
 brightness die still worth nothing 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:41.000
 between those completely concerns more 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:50.990
 nothing so here is a little rendering otherwise 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.990
 here is what good
