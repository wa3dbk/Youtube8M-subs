00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.670
 left 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:03.880
 after we destroy we take a point you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.590
 open but opposite we do the same 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.789
 thing 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:14.800
 vega after we all have high schools we must 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:22.239
 leave a little 90 degrees that too he 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:26.650
 must there be here it is good 90 ° 90 2 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.220
 and now the itie is the point of 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.940
 box 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.340
 you must not pray here but you do not 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.970
 must bend next to it ie 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.650
 now 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:47.590
 here there was a folding understands like 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:51.360
 that and like that but now 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.190
 work another side the same thing 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.239
 so we could like that it's more 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.269
 like that all conflicts and put a 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.470
 10 hours now it takes you Libyan 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:16.360
 published in the bo is much higher point 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:20.290
 it's now removing the lid I 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.340
 take on friends I tell you how 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.780
 just now we are prayed have made the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:33.310
 same thing another sense and tip 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.110
 now could the lid need to 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.739
 do bigger than just now 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.989
 so maintenance and tape a little bit 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.610
 different than earlier must 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:48.569
 look good have taken a little bit more 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.590
 small than a quarter 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:56.670
 peeled now remove another meaning on 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:02.010
 held back called one could like everything 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.569
 teen could maybe a quarter on 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.019
 unfolds called in one job and another 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.769
 meaning 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:14.939
 like earlier but not a car 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:20.000
 for the little ones that a quarter during boil 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:24.889
 point peeled now we will strip 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.440
 and we worked like twitter like that 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:34.380
 and when you take them inside 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.960
 another protégé like you like that and 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.560
 like that gives a bigger box than 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.570
 see you later 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:51.919
 so yes here there is a body spaces like 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.919
 just now a polite edge is what 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.900
 now I'm taking it all the way to 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.300
 ie of origami new box like the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.580
 Russian dolls 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.150
 now I'm doing just like now 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.449
 but one step is different than 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:20.120
 everything has a half price point and tip 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:23.930
 middle of the water to the rock in prices 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.150
 could give a conflict 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.289
 now this step is a jeans time 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.139
 only the difference that the others 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:37.080
 could do it to kick him 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.590
 we must not forget one because we must not 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.169
 for the little ones than a heart 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.600
 now you have to pay more than 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.140
 a quarter 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.650
 we do like that while paying like that 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:58.560
 but you have to be careful always 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:02.460
 same width here and that too a price 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.640
 always well kept it's everyone 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.270
 he should call sided as 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:14.130
 that and like that and now box for 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:18.150
 there are roofs or friends 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:24.740
 it's for mine second largest 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.740
 roof gm smaller and veron thickness 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.290
 now you have the boxes as in 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:43.760
 Russian dolls 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.760
