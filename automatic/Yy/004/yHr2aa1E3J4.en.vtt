video<00:00:04.940> so<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.089> time<00:00:06.270> I'm<00:00:06.450> talking<00:00:06.779> again

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
video so this time I'm talking again

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.890 
video so this time I'm talking again
more<00:00:07.410> about<00:00:07.589> maps<00:00:08.059> I've<00:00:09.059> previously<00:00:09.389> said

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
more about maps I've previously said

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.379 
more about maps I've previously said
about<00:00:10.110> time<00:00:10.410> travel<00:00:10.860> IP<00:00:11.280> previously<00:00:12.120> showing

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
about time travel IP previously showing

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
about time travel IP previously showing
you<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.809> maps<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.740> believe<00:00:14.040> they<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:16.340> but

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you what maps I believe they are but

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.109 
you what maps I believe they are but
this<00:00:17.609> time<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.119> am<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:18.690> talking<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:20.060> how<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
this time I am now talking about how the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.460 
this time I am now talking about how the
maps<00:00:21.769> interact<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.550> example<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:25.199> yeah<00:00:25.350> I'm

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
maps interact for example so yeah I'm

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.250 
maps interact for example so yeah I'm
gonna<00:00:25.619> play<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> clip<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.160> little<00:00:26.609> while<00:00:27.260> just

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
gonna play a clip in a little while just

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.419 
gonna play a clip in a little while just
going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> quickly<00:00:28.529> tell<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.250> it's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
going to quickly tell you what it's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.589 
going to quickly tell you what it's
going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> save<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.150> case<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.359> can't

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
going to save this in case you can't

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.410 
going to save this in case you can't
pick<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:32.040> basically<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.969> maps<00:00:33.329> are

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
pick it up so basically the maps are

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.940 
pick it up so basically the maps are
going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.719> environmental<00:00:34.050> based<00:00:34.680> or

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
going to be environmental based or

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
going to be environmental based or
hazardous<00:00:35.399> base<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.420> means<00:00:36.690> for

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
hazardous base so what that means for

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.260 
hazardous base so what that means for
example<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.610> giant<00:00:38.940> robot

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
example is like the the giant robot

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
example is like the the giant robot
which<00:00:39.420> mean<00:00:39.629> I've<00:00:40.200> found<00:00:40.620> another<00:00:40.890> interview

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
which mean I've found another interview

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.639 
which mean I've found another interview
somewhere<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:42.960> you're<00:00:43.079> underneath<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
somewhere when if you're underneath it

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.190 
somewhere when if you're underneath it
that<00:00:44.489> fires<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:46.079> get

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that fires up and you can actually get

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.650 
that fires up and you can actually get
vanquished<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.670> map<00:00:47.879> interacts<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
vanquished so the map interacts with the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
vanquished so the map interacts with the
gameplay<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.950> easy<00:00:50.190> example<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
gameplay and an easy example of what I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360 
gameplay and an easy example of what I
think<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:53.010> big<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
think they really are going big on this

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.590 
think they really are going big on this
this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:53.969> how<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:56.600> he

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this is what how they want it to be he

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
this is what how they want it to be he
actually<00:00:57.719> mentions<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> time<00:00:58.590> fall<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
actually mentions the time fall and the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
actually mentions the time fall and the
interactive<00:00:59.640> pneus<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.000> their<00:01:00.210> maps<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
interactive pneus of their maps in the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.070 
interactive pneus of their maps in the
clip<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.969> example<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.629> bees<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
clip but for example the bees way I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
clip but for example the bees way I
could<00:01:04.379> relate<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> maps

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
could relate to it is in one of the maps

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.109 
could relate to it is in one of the maps
in<00:01:06.299> battlefield<00:01:06.930> 4<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:08.189> example<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
in battlefield 4 for example there's the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.690 
in battlefield 4 for example there's the
massive<00:01:09.540> giant<00:01:09.900> tower<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:11.100> once<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.460> blow

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
massive giant tower and once you blow

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
massive giant tower and once you blow
the<00:01:11.850> bottom<00:01:12.119> down<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.810> whole<00:01:13.049> thing<00:01:13.290> comes

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the bottom down the whole thing comes

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
the bottom down the whole thing comes
down<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.100> completely<00:01:14.970> changes<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.450> way<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
down and completely changes the way the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
down and completely changes the way the
environment<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> game<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
environment is and how the game is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399 
environment is and how the game is
they're<00:01:17.909> looking<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:19.170> so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
they're looking to do that I think so

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950 
they're looking to do that I think so
we've<00:01:19.650> seen<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> diner<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
we've seen like a diner and I think is a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
we've seen like a diner and I think is a
diner<00:01:22.470> land<00:01:22.799> where<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.250> goes<00:01:23.369> through<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
diner land where it goes through and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
diner land where it goes through and
it's<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.270> volcano<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.200> example<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
it's a volcano so for example the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
it's a volcano so for example the
volcano<00:01:26.220> could<00:01:26.460> erupt<00:01:26.520> half<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> map

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
volcano could erupt half of the map

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.840 
volcano could erupt half of the map
could<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.530> accessible<00:01:29.070> you've<00:01:29.700> got

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
could be not accessible you've got

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.630 
could be not accessible you've got
change<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.299> strategy<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
change of strategy so on and so on and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670 
change of strategy so on and so on and
so<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.720> environmental

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so what do you think about environmental

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.700 
so what do you think about environmental
maps<00:01:35.720> interactive<00:01:36.720> maps<00:01:36.960> let<00:01:37.439> me<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
maps interactive maps let me know in the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.230 
maps interactive maps let me know in the
comments<00:01:38.100> section<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.520> I'll<00:01:38.610> play<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.000> kid

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
comments section and I'll play that kid

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.190 
comments section and I'll play that kid
a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:40.009> just<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:42.000> probably<00:01:42.420> leave

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a little now just to get probably leave

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.630 
a little now just to get probably leave
it<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> best<00:01:43.710> people<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> job<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it to the best people in the job to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.730 
it to the best people in the job to
actually<00:01:44.939> tell<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.110> let's<00:01:46.290> move

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
actually tell you about it so let's move

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.950 
actually tell you about it so let's move
on<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> things<00:01:48.509> for

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
our maps to life you know to almost make

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.889 
our maps to life you know to almost make
them<00:02:09.840> feel<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.470> map

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
them feel like the map

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.110 
them feel like the map
is<00:02:10.959> an<00:02:11.079> extra<00:02:11.379> character<00:02:11.829> so<00:02:12.459> with<00:02:12.670> every<00:02:12.879> map

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
