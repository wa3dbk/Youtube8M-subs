00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.090

 crazy the same door sentences 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.060
 I passed the ball like 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.060
 a solid offer so that also 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 in the first part 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.380
 is that it shortens life 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.890
 and comment 7 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.200
 one of the serious videos 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.160
 Well, very easy to live 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.030
 you know 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 equine valcke has seen 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.320

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.640
 although so far I had no one has any of this 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.580
 jámison to a new world 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.360
 in the same way it can be done 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 few months I am 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.770
 that's why I started with 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.940
 with the books 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.760
 the how of a set ball I went first 10 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.050
 and with what 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.050
 it was the second time that happens 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.829
 well because in the cinema simply nobody 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.250
 next 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.150
 stressed that there are Libyans 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.570
 well, not even 19 years old 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.620

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.729
 the third one that I do feel a personal satisfaction according to the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.120
 videoblog 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.800
 the only personal satisfaction of knowing his assiduous games 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.029
 and this time the page 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.839
 activism has friends who follow me 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.839
 the cnt with those who visit

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.020
 the fourth 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.749
 which was the main reason 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.970
 and values ​​that is completely what I think I've always been like that 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.339
 of everything I feel 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:33.709
 so tell us 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.869

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.979

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.479
 when in principle I can tell you that if sides 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.889
 argibay 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.619
 Thank God 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:59.749

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.739
 and then to preservation 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.989
 is the history of costa rica and cartagena 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.899
 the consistory 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.239
 I'm every three people seven of them year 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.729
 the same fact with 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.729
 in simple just a committee that relevant 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.859
 good the sixth 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.859
 and if you wanted to 2001 for supposeísimo yes 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.609
 in 2002 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.269
 where friends 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.549

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.549
 Of course yes 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:32.669
 and so he thinks yes 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.659
 I think that if the pdi participation motion in full 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.659
 contributes an important company of the social or cultural world 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.719
 that's one thing that should go to others 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.339
 and what you have to say that makes you feel 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:46.710
 everything I feel does not 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.929
 since Saturday 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.729
 if that helps us 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.059
 usually not 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.860
 the rest 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.860
 it's a scandalous thing for example life 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.909
 honestly it's one thing that you got yourself to answer 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.379
 cousins ​​younger than most 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.599
 they were pointed 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.599
 and a little bit of experiences 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.279
 and if I ever fell in love with a videoblog etc not for nothing are we going to 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.699
 feel admiration 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.379
 the service 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.509
 people will sing giuliano 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.059
 thanks to them 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:24.729
 the pupils comments 1 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.809
 and other types of videos that also make possible 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.090
 I think they're going to mark something for the house 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.529
 therefore the service 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.600
 what we are doing and the morning 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.550

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.620
 for each one of us 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.880
 then once it does not matter that people from other countries recognize me 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.759
 what criticizes me is not easy at all 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.069
 the heart of sunk prices says so 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.979
 I do not care if they are from the country 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.740
 are from another country of which 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.830
 without light what he valued that is the heart 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.620
 people will come closer 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.830
 let's make them commit 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.969
 final would like 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:06.569

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.409
 and when I've ever gone to other places 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.370

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.449
 those who work at night 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.979
 dreamlike 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.249
 the questions and at the end 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.520
