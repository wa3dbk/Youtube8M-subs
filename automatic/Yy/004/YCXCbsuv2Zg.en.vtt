 Hello, this is Haha Kizu Toy. 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.690
 Today's toys are DX Land Dragon Wizard Ring. 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.270
 Following the Hurricane Dragon, the Land Wizard Ring and Gravity Wizards Ring 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.700
 We're going to listen to the voice gimmick with a weed driver and a weaver sword. 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 You will hear the sound of the voice as it is. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.509
 So let's look at the appearance of the package. 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.020
 The front has the name of the product and the magic ring. 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.020
 The ring appearance is visible right away. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.020
 Includes one Land Dragon Collection card. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.320
 The back side shows the interlocking method, and the voice gimmick comes out as 'Dendendon'. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.100
 I do not have much else, so I will be opening it. 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.620
 Be careful when using a knife. 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.020
 So far you've looked at the DX Land Dragon Wizard Ring together. 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.320
 Thanks to the popularity of Kamen Rider Wizard 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.140
 The movies are also on the Anny Box and Aniwon channels. 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.580
 Please check it out and check out the dubbed voice gimmick. 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.900
