00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
thing about the older model is it only

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.390 
thing about the older model is it only
has<00:02:45.189> a<00:02:45.900> 3/32<00:02:46.900> time<00:02:47.139> delay<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.129> it's<00:02:48.250> one

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
has a 3/32 time delay so it's one

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.069 
has a 3/32 time delay so it's one
picture<00:02:48.790> every<00:02:48.819> thirty<00:02:49.180> seconds<00:02:49.599> compared<00:02:49.989> to

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
this where you can set it to whatever

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.879 
this where you can set it to whatever
you<00:02:52.150> want<00:02:52.389> and<00:02:52.629> it's<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.870> three<00:02:53.139> round<00:02:53.319> burst<00:02:53.680> so

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.589 
recommend it Walmart for 50 bucks I
don't<00:03:15.370> think<00:03:15.759> you<00:03:15.879> can<00:03:16.030> beat<00:03:16.209> that

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
don't think you can beat that

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.309 
don't think you can beat that
it's<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.729> I've<00:03:18.729> seen<00:03:18.790> some<00:03:19.359> other<00:03:19.689> cameras

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
it's the I've seen some other cameras

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.229 
it's the I've seen some other cameras
that<00:03:20.439> are<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.620> little<00:03:20.799> cheaper<00:03:21.069> than<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.609> but

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
that are a little cheaper than this but

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.939 
that are a little cheaper than this but
this<00:03:22.389> is<00:03:22.569> probably<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.930> best<00:03:23.169> camera<00:03:23.590> can<00:03:23.799> get

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
this is probably the best camera can get

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.840 
this is probably the best camera can get
from<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.189> money<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:25.090> thanks<00:03:25.359> for<00:03:25.509> watching
