00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.970
 Hello, how are you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.350
 giving sequence to the videos of the series 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.430
 basics of table tennis basics 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 fundamental 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.039
 today we will talk about how to strike a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:35.130
 ball on the right or line ok 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:40.079
 first you'll play your 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.050
 weight on your right leg without taking your 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.350
 arm behind you will spin your 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.649
 quadrio turn your hips 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 notice that your arm is going 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:59.039
 follow and you will thrash the ball in a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 forward motion from right to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.320
 left to right 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.630
 throw all your weight on the right leg 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.939
 then I took the ball and played his 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.010
 weight on left leg 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:18.299
 Ok, let's do this in practice. 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.759
 movement runs right left 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 right left right left 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:30.409
 right and left do not stand still 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.920
 move your body right to the left 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.920
 right and left 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.390
 Are you playing in the pen grip 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.600
 fountain pen hit side 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.840
 forrÃ³ rendered on the right side is the same 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.840
 thing 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:13.489
 watch hip turn from back to front 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 without taking off my back arm 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.840
 front and back to front 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.340
 this is the slap-stroke movement of 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.250
 backwards and backwards 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.390
 the movement advocates 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.280
 I hope you have learned 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.530
 enough with this video lesson 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.530
 Until then, a good workout.
