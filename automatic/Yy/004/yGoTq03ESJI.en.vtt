00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
it took him like six years to create

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800 
it took him like six years to create
just<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.519> make<00:03:15.760> new<00:03:16.000> worlds<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.450> new<00:03:16.540> levels

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
just to make new worlds and new levels

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.900 
just to make new worlds and new levels
which<00:03:17.109> is<00:03:17.200> absolutely<00:03:17.680> insane<00:03:17.910> considering

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
which is absolutely insane considering

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.789 
which is absolutely insane considering
like<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.209> just<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.450> one<00:03:19.660> guy<00:03:19.900> thing<00:03:20.530> or<00:03:20.769> just

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
like it's just a one guy thing or just

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.500 
like it's just a one guy thing or just
maybe<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> small<00:03:21.640> group<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:22.000> people<00:03:22.150> doing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
maybe like a small group of people doing

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.390 
maybe like a small group of people doing
it<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.750> working<00:03:23.109> on<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.260> together<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:24.280> feel

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
it and working on it together and I feel

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.560 
it and working on it together and I feel
like<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.640> would<00:03:24.760> be<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.850> same<00:03:25.090> way<00:03:25.209> with<00:03:25.420> this

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
like it would be the same way with this

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.750 
like it would be the same way with this
like<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.959> wouldn't<00:03:26.230> really<00:03:26.739> be<00:03:26.890> done<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.700> a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
like it wouldn't really be done in a

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.550

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
like compared to Super Mario 64 the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.240 
like compared to Super Mario 64 the
original<00:03:53.079> this<00:03:53.170> definitely<00:03:53.709> feels<00:03:53.920> better

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
original this definitely feels better

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.620 
original this definitely feels better

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.050 
just because everything is just so much
more<00:03:55.840> responsive<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:56.859> way<00:03:57.730> better

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
more responsive and you have way better

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.720 
more responsive and you have way better
control<00:03:58.600> for<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.500> camera<00:03:59.980> then<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.489> didn't

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
control for the camera then you didn't
