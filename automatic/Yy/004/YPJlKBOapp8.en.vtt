00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.099
 there are people in our lives 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.949
 and if it is by the mere chance snows and that it is our 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.739
 customs go the way expected 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.759
 watching many more 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.640
 Athens others between one step 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.060
 until then we call friends and in many kinds of them 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.670
 each leaf of a tree characterize 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 the quilmeño that is born of the bud is our friend papa 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.120
 that show us what is the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 although the three sisters continue to divide in this space 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.970
 were happy as 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 thousands of leaves who we respect 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 celestino the presented 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580
 We did not know who started 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.680
 we call many of them granma roads 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
 they are sincere 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 when we are not 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 the soul up here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.110
 and to our eyes nósik in these lares 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730
 Kikillo his friends 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.840
 maybe a vacation to a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.440
 the days a few hours 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.630
 It is a custom to place stations on our face during the time 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090
 be 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.950
 both close 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.260
 we can not forget 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.980
 distant friends 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.240
 those that are on the tip of the branches 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.890
 due to illegal immigration 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.890
 they always appear between a 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:11.939
 It is perceived 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.939
 and we lost some of our leaves 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.359
 they stay for nights 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.439
 I think in this semester 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.359
 that those that fell 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.379
 our root conade 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.259
 They are memories 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.259
 which the 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.119
 right from the start 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.019
 and prosperity 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:42.999
 and always 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.119
 simply 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.229
 because every person that goes through our life 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.869
 it always leaves a little of itself 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.229
 and it was arrived 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.239
 is that they love each other 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.239
 but never 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.829
 It is the biggest responsibility 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.119
 following 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.999
 If you want more
