00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.770
 hello everybody knows how to handle 6 is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 from today we are on modern 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 warfare 3 in team death match on 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.580
 resistance and in this part I 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.210
 played with line 4-1 charge big 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 ability and secondary weapons 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.469
 the scorpions to kibo so that's going to be a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.870
 very big part a perfect so the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.290
 first big part that we 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 will prevail on the chain you to you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.260
 see when it was going so in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.899
 asset I had undetectable that allows me 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.539
 to be invisible to aerial turrets 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.860
 and predators et cetera in second 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.750
 Assassin's asset is about the same 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.940
 sports is invisible to the back rhÃ´ne and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.260
 it's all about hits like you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.180
 could see I drink the names of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.180
 people from very far away so here I 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.400
 just just unlock rhone world and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.450
 my soul is by the way so who are 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 in the category 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.490
 aso because there are three categories and 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.240
 reminds me very quickly 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.790
 specialist who allows to launch 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.460
 assets as and when kills and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.500
 supports Syria even if we die 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.990
 so go on there I put my idea but 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.020
 this in a passage it was a little bit 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.670
 stupid to put it there since it's in 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.840
 the party no enemy who passed here 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.189
 little bit silly 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.250
 but it's okay I'm developing 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:42.399
 my first and vico so I'm going to 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.469
 throw is in the game you go 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.299
 see that still who would be that 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.439
 I chose them because the 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.799
 helicopters yes because jean having 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.009
 several have done at least one 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.500
 fifteen or so frags that it's not no 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.380
 plus a big performance is true to 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.560
 34.0 this is impressive but my 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.280
 helicopter anyway have killed a good 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.190
 big part so here I raise a 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.140
 drone yes because the steel mill recounts 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.310
 Innu even if we do not die once 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.700
 that we unblocked his last he 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.519
 would it start all over again so in the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.769
 part of it was as much telling you that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.079
 drones absolutely all the time in the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.890
 sky and you see there is seen 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.180
 exactly where is their sport and it has me 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.930
 really paris that's why I 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.769
 rush also a maximum he was of all 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.170
 the sides of the map 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.350
 we know of the match to death at the same time 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.620
 so here's low score already three thousand 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.970
 six cents to 5 cents is not bad here 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.260
 So the obloquy and Metz and I will 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.459
 pose at a very strategic place of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.410
 the mob I strongly advise you 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.150
 it is to master it if in mode 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.519
 objective do not know if in demolition 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.099
 this is the case nantes caen dominating the b 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.139
 he exactly this place there and as 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.459
 it's a small passage the enemies are 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.370
 obliged to go in if they want 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.709
 go through there and beg him but that's 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.470
 like free by the wall so does very 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.930
 often frags will come away that's it 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.500
 I think I had a lot 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.560
 as a bad example but good luck 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.060
 why I had the 45 keine ump always 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280
 he does not have mobility either as 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.090
 an assault rifle 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.799
 I tried to do my best to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.709
 eliminate them from afar it's true that I 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.109
 I do not have the melee either 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.739
 I am very very nil and in addition I had 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.359
 not want to die 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:36.450
 so here we are very careful I was 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.920
 very careful to kill him and then that's it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.340
 so he also did not know what he 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.510
 was doing escor 4600 to 900 I the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.069
 remind one because it's important 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.459
 because you will see the end of the 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:51.150
 part 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.720
 my performance was really 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.269
 not bad 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.840
 so illico here wave always 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.459
 always said he put them in front 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.889
 if if the drones are they 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.810
 could die with a helicopter him he has 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.500
 wanted to eliminate me it's a shame because 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.060
 that tubes before I am I them 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.250
 leaves here so here you see I 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.200
 I am very nil with that the pistols 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.130
 machine gunners unfortunately it's 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.750
 pity so here I am rock and there I 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.209
 go to the aisle which as I have them 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.099
 said earlier a fairly busy focus 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.590
 he gets into the barrier or behind 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.830
 the wall so I wanted to ask my im / s 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.849
 but my opinion really sin and then I 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.440
 could not either east in the heap 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.159
 because I would not have done enough 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.449
 quickly 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.050
 it would be a shame to break series 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.130
 like this and so here I am at 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.699
 best of the map and as 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.789
 at this place defines it a party here it 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.229
 is a lot of people this is the point of 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.820
 pass the map if you want 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.280
 to really do frag but to do 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.590
 very careful if you do not die there I'm 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.470
 I am told I have keys killed it irritates 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.330
 here it is actually the zorro had 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.159
 to launch a drone because I was playing 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.099
 also with my team and my teammate 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.509
 forgiveness aura who told me where were the 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.979
 enemies 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.569
 finally the end of the game actually at 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.789
 early I was not expecting to do that so 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.319
 I said go ahead demo is this 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.400
 that they are and he told me exactly 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.770
 their positioning 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.530
 so here it is I saw them and file to 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.210
 throw also I believe yes during the 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.889
 more is a big part you go 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.520
 see but he sent me two or three 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.810
 drones and it helped me a lot and that's it 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.419
 so she had them all on this side 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.180
 finally a spot still pretty deadly 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.180
 we're behind the wall that's just for 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.800
 to kill us you really have to read in 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.370
 want because of art the little wall we 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.349
 sees that the head and in addition there was 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.960
 meaning of words to protect me from 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.580
 opponents she arrived behind 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:51.219
 good here I am with a score of 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.810
 7500 to 2000 so they did that 20 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.930
 elimination I remind him 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.990
 in front and I made 34 so I 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.240
 did me more than e mail sent them 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.490
 dead so is the score of zoran end he 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.319
 helped me anyway so that's so 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.520
 I hope you enjoyed these videos and 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:11.740
 what to leave a gem et cetera et cetera 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.090
 and we find ourselves for a next 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.090
 video hi everyone
