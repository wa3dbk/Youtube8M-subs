00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.610 
device that you can shoot from the rifle
of<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:32.099> standard<00:00:33.090> military<00:00:33.270> rifle<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.260> slide

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of a standard military rifle you slide

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.920 
of a standard military rifle you slide
this<00:00:35.010> over<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> barrel<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> rifle<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this over the barrel of the rifle and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.220 
this over the barrel of the rifle and
inside<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.879> bullet<00:00:39.300> trap<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
inside of this we have a bullet trap so

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
inside of this we have a bullet trap so
as<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.920> trigger<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> pulled<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> bullet

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
as the trigger is pulled and the bullet

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
as the trigger is pulled and the bullet
is<00:00:42.690> launched<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.290> gets<00:00:43.469> lodged<00:00:43.739> into<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
forward the object can fly over 90 feet

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
forward the object can fly over 90 feet
and<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:57.000> attach<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> surface<00:00:57.899> we've

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and then attach to the surface we've

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.500 
and then attach to the surface we've
prototyped<00:00:58.829> ahead<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.699> will<00:00:59.850> allow<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.359> to

always going to be a solution for you to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
always going to be a solution for you to
get<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> wall<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.390> call<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> Batman

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
get up the wall we call it a Batman

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
get up the wall we call it a Batman
device<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:16.860> Batman<00:01:17.159> has<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> utility<00:01:18.270> belt

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
device because Batman has a utility belt

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
device because Batman has a utility belt
and<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:18.780> has<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> device<00:01:19.320> that's<00:01:19.560> very<00:01:19.890> similar

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and he has a device that's very similar

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
and he has a device that's very similar
to<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to this but we just don't see it in the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
to this but we just don't see it in the
real<00:01:22.290> world<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.860> we're<00:01:23.610> trying<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
real world right we're trying to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.999 
real world right we're trying to
replicate<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.509> technology<00:01:25.320> once<00:01:25.830> we've

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
replicate that technology once we've

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 
replicate that technology once we've
launched<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.790> we've<00:01:26.909> attached<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
launched up and we've attached to the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.929 
launched up and we've attached to the
surface<00:01:28.130> we're<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> climb<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> rope

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
surface we're going to climb up the rope

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.020 
surface we're going to climb up the rope
and<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.470> an<00:01:32.030> electric

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and so what we have here is an electric

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.370 
and so what we have here is an electric
winch<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.360> runs<00:01:33.659> off<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> battery<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
winch that runs off a battery in my

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.730 
winch that runs off a battery in my
backpack<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.869> winch<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
backpack and all it is is a a winch that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.120 
backpack and all it is is a a winch that
you'd<00:01:37.979> hook<00:01:38.159> onto<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> truck<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.060> ATV<00:01:40.130> we

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you'd hook onto a truck or an ATV we

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.440 
you'd hook onto a truck or an ATV we
kind<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.430> stripped<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> down<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.090> took<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> lot

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
kind of stripped it down we took a lot

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.389 
kind of stripped it down we took a lot
of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> parts<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.290> replaced<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.369> with

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
of the parts off and replaced it with

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.270 
of the parts off and replaced it with
this<00:01:44.640> friction<00:01:45.060> polite<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.189> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
this friction polite here and so it's a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
this friction polite here and so it's a
pulley<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> has<00:01:47.909> deep<00:01:48.329> grooves<00:01:48.659> cut<00:01:48.869> into<00:01:49.140> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
pulley that has deep grooves cut into it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.010 
pulley that has deep grooves cut into it
and<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.130> teeth<00:01:50.340> around<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and it's got some teeth around it and so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
and it's got some teeth around it and so
as<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.380> feed<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.829> rope<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:53.430> through<00:01:53.820> it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
as we feed this rope down through it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
as we feed this rope down through it
and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.990> more<00:01:55.170> weight<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and the more weight that you have on the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.850 
and the more weight that you have on the
pulley<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:57.719> more<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.079> digs<00:01:58.320> down<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.770> the
