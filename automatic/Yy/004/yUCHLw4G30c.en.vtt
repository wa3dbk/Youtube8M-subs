00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.600 
game the Leafs have played in a while
and<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.680> felt<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.340> said

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and you know what I felt like we said

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.429 
and you know what I felt like we said
this<00:01:41.790> under<00:01:42.060> Carlisle<00:01:42.540> quite<00:01:42.869> often<00:01:43.049> too

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
this under Carlisle quite often too

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.200 
this under Carlisle quite often too
because<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.009> would<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.490> shot<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.060> all

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
because they would get out shot to all

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.780 
because they would get out shot to all
hell<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.840> play<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.590> hell<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.610> would

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
hell out play to all hell and they would

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.670 
hell out play to all hell and they would
still<00:01:48.119> find<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> win<00:01:49.140> some<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.500> lose

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
still find a way to win some and lose

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
still find a way to win some and lose
some<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> games<00:01:50.579> were<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.820> least

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
some but then the games were at least

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.700 
some but then the games were at least
really<00:01:51.210> showed<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.079> sure<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> other

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
really showed up really sure the other

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.870 
really showed up really sure the other
opponent<00:01:53.040> what's<00:01:53.430> up

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
opponent what's up

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.609

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
was having such a good season let's

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.540 
was having such a good season let's
admit<00:02:19.310> it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
admit it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.940 
admit it
probably<00:02:20.120> an<00:02:20.270> unsustainably<00:02:21.170> good<00:02:21.470> start<00:02:21.830> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
probably an unsustainably good start to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.380 
probably an unsustainably good start to
the<00:02:22.069> season<00:02:22.099> but<00:02:22.580> then<00:02:22.730> he<00:02:22.790> gets<00:02:22.970> clocked<00:02:23.239> by

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the season but then he gets clocked by

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.880 
the season but then he gets clocked by
Ovechkin<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:23.930> he<00:02:24.050> has<00:02:24.140> not<00:02:24.319> really<00:02:24.650> been<00:02:24.680> able

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
Ovechkin and he has not really been able

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.740 
Ovechkin and he has not really been able
to<00:02:25.040> be<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> same<00:02:25.550> player<00:02:25.760> since<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.540> Leafs

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
to be the same player since if the Leafs

can get something in the middle out of

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.160 
can get something in the middle out of
Komarov<00:02:28.819> hopefully<00:02:29.239> something<00:02:29.480> towards<00:02:30.019> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
Komarov hopefully something towards the

better<00:02:30.500> side<00:02:30.890> next<00:02:31.250> season<00:02:31.760> he<00:02:32.150> could<00:02:32.300> be<00:02:32.420> a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
better side next season he could be a
