after all whilst no one likes criticism
ours<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.840> mild<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> why<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> energetic

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
ours was very mild so why the energetic

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.359 
ours was very mild so why the energetic
attacking<00:01:33.299> response<00:01:34.110> adopted<00:01:36.860> well<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.070> has

attacking response adopted well this has
led<00:01:38.549> us<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.909> research<00:01:39.210> further<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
led us to research further and this is
