00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.760
 8 apologize offer for difficult August 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.149
 because I still have the strength to fight for the title 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.550
 cralt be if the title 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.800
 always remains our fimo we know that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.489
 we had to recover so many points on the second part of the championship but 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.699
 with the new score I saw that two races that are good snow come on 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.730
 so we have to fight for the championship 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.160
 just make 2 2 perfect weekends without mistakes 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.070
 and by doing two to two quite a bit we will definitely come back to 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.510
 championship very soon 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.120
 you finish it off 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.829
 to emigrate because to deny 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.610
 also at silverstone 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.420
 movie 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.780
 it was wonderful 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.290
 this makes you be more text 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.620
 if I think optimism a team remains is 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.990
 enough handle 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.220
 important after seeing the performance of the machine 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.060
 ah silveston after opening from a car valencia two circuits a lot 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.970
 different 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.840
 we were in a position just fashion attack on the normal reconnection podium 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.700
 then 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.480
 I think now all the circuits they had 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.390
 i can fit for the f10 we have even more developments that are 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.620
 arriving then 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 everything is a fairly optimistic position and remain confident to do b 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.230
 for a nice job 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.480
 the different ones 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.330
 the black eyes were the characteristics circuit 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.180
 can be competitive 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.950
 but I really think sleep 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.560
 all our data all ours 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 these web parts are positive we think of a circuit 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.060
 rexhep fit our car we know a circuit where the times 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.050
 they are very close they will say 1 15 15 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.810
 we look forward to the competitiveness but in qualifying in the race so we know 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.860
 take a tenth member 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.120
 can make the difference between being and second sending eighth therefore 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.740
 however, it will be ours in the morning 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.170
 in our potential to do a good job and then 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.059
 I think that pander motoman 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:14.329
 if I'm fighting a few things done last week with driving school 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.989
 I have been to Maranello 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.739
 4 days I think I work 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.939
 with the technicians try some new things also on the simulator 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.719
 I think it was a great job of preparation for me and for the next ones 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.519
 races 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.729
 what a very motivated team after i 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.600
 the non-ideal results of the last races 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.579
 in the whole world 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.390
 because promptly tell surprising next three or four prizes for 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.359
 then returning to the fight 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.359
 this pie park 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.859
 it begins 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.730
 antilazio is definitely not 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.319
 in the budget that I wanted in the lancet that that was also the team 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.509
 He wanted 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.509
 watching the first two races who did it 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.789
 we made two podiums 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.789
 and then we had results 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.359
 insults say that there 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.759
 CD 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.449
 it was hoped 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:30.559
 especially the last three races where it was important to tie inside 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:31.180
 where is it 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.779
 we said to make good points and we were not able to do 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:38.099
 and why every tender pampering happens then 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.489
 now is 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.499
 I really am 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.319
 I'm looking forward to 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.179
 to do the take the first good gabon enhancer to continue making one 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.909
 second part of the championship 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.989
 since it is different from what was final 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.909
 to pray 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.759
 tiscali suppositories 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.869
 java 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.779
 post morality novara 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.759
 certainly 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:09.239
 this is not the first time that this happens if you photograph if you know that 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.699
 sometimes there are also different times every now and then 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.939
 to send a detail to another 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.229
 it may be that you can't get to the end of the date 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.699
 later when something strange happens 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.669
 this is what happened in the last three races, therefore, morale e 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.300
 even higher dvd make a nice frog from the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.340
 go on the fact 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.200
 we also know that delta also leads others 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.479
 high morale 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.979
 returned 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.319
 via wikipedia 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.319
 so italy 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.940
 but the news 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.510
 and we have had must novelties in the last two races we have heard 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.029
 improvement of fortune 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.379
 unified wolf 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.830
 important technician 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.860
 and we have so many other things coming for the next races then 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.439
 vuoisi wolves 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.000
 and also gods 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.809
 improvements 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.009
 of the car of the car 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:19.009
 so I look absolutely positive for the next races and I hope to have a 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.979
 moment nannini a car even more 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.990
 competitive read 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.130
 they say they have had until now is also let sky voted the victory and 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.130
 star the fastest car on the track 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.759
 the fact 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.999
 ii 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:40.089
 why 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.199
 w 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.309

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.930
 spinach calories 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.969
 but it's a problem I had another time I had this year or 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.639
 the barcelona race where it was cool 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.110
 adelaide australia where the temperature is also enough 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.330
 party 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.419
 is 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.229
 and also to superstock 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.409
 where you put the tracks where you do not use much rubber 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.169
 r as they are very hard 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.250
 that I had difficulty making good ones work 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.089
 especially in qualifying 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.669
 you make me work like having id 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.020
 necessary and for the first round of the tire this is the reality la 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.949
 biggest difficulty I had 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.819
 in these circuits where we have always had the same woman 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.800
 and therefore 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.360
 they are real 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.169
 of the problems I had this year 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.589
 especially I look at the clean 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.419
 Earone 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.419
 let's go back to the kit 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.939
 features 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.589
 man 500 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:55.580
 Ecche 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.210
 is the only one that I don't even know there is the lake maine he did I never had 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.589
 guided 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.099
 I've never driven 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.729
 so he is the only one I don't even know who has a eheh circuit 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.000
 not very fast circuit of more curves 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.949
 towards second third gear 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:17.840
 that 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.360
 and there are 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.419
 two fast curves 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.419
 however it is a circuit more related to 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.819
 towards Hungary a higher double disney circuit by a strong need for one 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:30.490
 machine 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.050
 and that keiichi

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:41.070
 we bring 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.169
 a more adverse machine 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.180
 hungary a little bit more towards monk than the verse 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:49.889
