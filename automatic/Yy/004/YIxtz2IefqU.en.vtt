at night when you're camping and running
and<00:02:30.660> they<00:02:30.810> will<00:02:30.930> also<00:02:31.110> run<00:02:31.470> extended<00:02:32.130> hours<00:02:32.490> on

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
and they will also run extended hours on

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
and they will also run extended hours on
a<00:02:32.760> tank<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.360> gas<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.870> model<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.500> will<00:02:34.710> run

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
a tank of gas this model here will run

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.360 
a tank of gas this model here will run
about<00:02:35.280> eight<00:02:35.580> hours<00:02:35.850> at<00:02:36.420> full<00:02:36.930> power<00:02:37.370> most

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
about eight hours at full power most

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.310 
about eight hours at full power most
people<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:38.910> keep<00:02:39.270> them<00:02:39.480> using<00:02:39.870> full<00:02:40.050> power

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
people do not keep them using full power

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.230 
people do not keep them using full power
so<00:02:40.500> somewhere<00:02:41.130> around<00:02:41.220> twelve<00:02:41.670> hours<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.210> a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
so somewhere around twelve hours is a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.460 
so somewhere around twelve hours is a
good<00:02:42.420> average<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.960> can<00:02:43.080> sleep<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:43.410> night

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
good average so you can sleep all night

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.870 
good average so you can sleep all night
know<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.670> your<00:02:46.310> generators<00:02:47.310> keeping<00:02:47.670> things

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
know that your generators keeping things

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.690 
know that your generators keeping things
running<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.570> need<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.840> keep<00:02:48.990> running

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700

model<00:02:52.830> again<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.520> asked<00:02:53.790> will<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> run<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
model again I get asked will it run a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.420 
model again I get asked will it run a
refrigerator<00:02:54.930> yes<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.380> will<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.130> have

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
refrigerator yes it will but if you have

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.640 
refrigerator yes it will but if you have
more<00:02:56.760> things<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.240> run<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.870> need<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.290> manage

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
more things to run and need to manage

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.760 
more things to run and need to manage
more<00:02:58.890> pieces<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.450> our<00:03:00.450> items<00:03:00.960> in<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.320> home<00:03:01.500> or

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
more pieces of our items in your home or

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.580 
more pieces of our items in your home or
camper<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.090> see<00:03:03.300> here<00:03:03.720> I've<00:03:04.290> got<00:03:04.410> a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
camper as you can see here I've got a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.200 
camper as you can see here I've got a
little<00:03:04.830> wire<00:03:05.040> that's<00:03:05.460> connecting<00:03:06.000> these<00:03:06.150> two

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
little wire that's connecting these two

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.630 
little wire that's connecting these two
generators<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.380> call<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.770> paralleling

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
generators and we call this paralleling

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.850 
generators and we call this paralleling
and<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.300> allows<00:03:09.570> both<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.990> these<00:03:10.260> generators

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
and that allows both of these generators

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.520 
and that allows both of these generators
to<00:03:11.220> double<00:03:11.760> their<00:03:11.970> power<00:03:12.210> output<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.380> of

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
to double their power output so one of

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.860 
to double their power output so one of
one<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.070> generators<00:03:14.490> sort<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.450> sits<00:03:15.690> in

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
one of the generators sort of sits in

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.460 
one of the generators sort of sits in
the<00:03:15.960> background<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.680> runs<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.880> now<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.600> have<00:03:19.110> a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
the background and runs and now I have a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.090 
the background and runs and now I have a
very<00:03:19.709> portable<00:03:20.420> 4000<00:03:21.420> watt<00:03:21.570> generator<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
very portable 4000 watt generator and it

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.340 
very portable 4000 watt generator and it
allows<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.970> run<00:03:24.270> as<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.900> numbers<00:03:25.230> would

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
allows you to run as the numbers would

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.949 
allows you to run as the numbers would
indicate<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:26.040> doubling<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.270> amount<00:03:27.720> of

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
indicate a doubling of the amount of

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.130 
equipment you're trying to keep running
so<00:03:29.490> maybe<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.910> have<00:03:29.940> three<00:03:30.360> or<00:03:30.420> four<00:03:30.600> freezers

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
so maybe you have three or four freezers

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.199 
so maybe you have three or four freezers
and<00:03:31.320> refrigerators<00:03:31.820> maybe<00:03:32.820> you'd<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:33.150> to

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
and refrigerators maybe you'd like to

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.990 
and refrigerators maybe you'd like to
keep<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.080> microwave<00:03:34.620> up<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.040> going<00:03:35.310> perhaps

these are I'm going to crank this model

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.920 
these are I'm going to crank this model
which<00:05:42.130> is<00:05:42.280> actually<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.640> 3,000<00:05:43.330> watt<00:05:43.420> generator

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
which is actually a 3,000 watt generator

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.730 
which is actually a 3,000 watt generator
and<00:05:44.170> you<00:05:44.260> will<00:05:44.380> see<00:05:44.590> how<00:05:44.740> quiet<00:05:45.040> they<00:05:45.400> stay

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.430 

this<00:05:50.740> is<00:05:50.950> with<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.250> e<00:05:51.280> Co<00:05:51.730> button<00:05:52.210> on<00:05:52.390> and<00:05:53.140> I'm

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
this is with the e Co button on and I'm

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.780 
this is with the e Co button on and I'm
going<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:53.620> turn<00:05:53.860> that<00:05:54.040> off<00:05:54.280> so<00:05:54.490> that<00:05:54.520> you<00:05:54.640> can

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
going to turn that off so that you can

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.580 
going to turn that off so that you can
actually<00:05:54.970> hear<00:05:55.360> the<00:05:55.390> loudest<00:05:55.720> this<00:05:56.080> unit<00:05:56.440> will

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
actually hear the loudest this unit will

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.570 
actually hear the loudest this unit will
run

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.879 

now<00:06:00.180> this<00:06:00.599> unit<00:06:00.870> believe<00:06:01.349> it<00:06:01.439> or<00:06:01.530> not<00:06:01.650> is

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
now this unit believe it or not is

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.240 
now this unit believe it or not is
actually<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.729> couple<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.330> DB<00:06:03.750> quieter<00:06:04.349> than<00:06:04.949> the

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
actually a couple of DB quieter than the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.189 
actually a couple of DB quieter than the
2000<00:06:05.909> watt<00:06:06.030> unit<00:06:06.270> we<00:06:06.479> were<00:06:06.599> just<00:06:06.780> talking

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
2000 watt unit we were just talking

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.300 
2000 watt unit we were just talking
about<00:06:07.259> so<00:06:08.159> again<00:06:08.490> very<00:06:09.139> quiet<00:06:10.139> power<00:06:10.530> very

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
about so again very quiet power very

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.909 
about so again very quiet power very
clean<00:06:11.699> power<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.900> ability<00:06:13.289> to<00:06:13.319> run<00:06:13.620> during

clean power the ability to run during
the<00:06:14.129> night<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:14.639> respond<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.479> the<00:06:15.659> low<00:06:15.840> demand

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
the night and respond to the low demand

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.610 
the night and respond to the low demand
it<00:06:16.770> means<00:06:16.949> less<00:06:17.219> fuel<00:06:17.550> used<00:06:18.020> again<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.319> best
