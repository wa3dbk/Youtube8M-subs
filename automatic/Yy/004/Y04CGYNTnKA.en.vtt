00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.410
 welcome back 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.269
 high level and still is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.100
 promised 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.410
 let's face it let's face it 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.810
 more important than jazz then the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.230
 real danger then real danger of the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.619
 jazz is very simple causes of 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.130
 mental imbalance to musicians in 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.739
 your case then the drummers what 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.480
 it happens it's a problem we say 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.590
 psychological a problem that in 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.590
 psychiatry is called 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.840
 personality bipolar personality 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.310
 what bipolar means practically there is 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.360
 a split personality e 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.160
 as you can see this phenomenon can be seen from 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.720
 during before jazz concerts 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.880
 holds jazz concerts that come 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.700
 broadcast on television I noticed 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.980
 I studied psychology what happens 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.930
 it happens that before the jazz concert e 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.030
 when he is the leading drummer in the group 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.040
 he is very nice because he is a drummer 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.900
 composer you because you know that there is 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.540
 inside this thing you know very well 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.570
 that there is ok then the drummer and leader 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.400
 no and also to be transmitted on TV a 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.500
 jazz concert 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.390
 clearly in times from da jazz then 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.979
 it's two in the morning three in the morning, that is 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.440
 those times linen is not standing 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.670
 no one except those passionate 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.160
 I want to break the balls I have 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.150
 spoken from the previous episode 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.770
 and then there are trans e 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.030
 drug dealers many times are the same 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.540
 person and for what there really is 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.580
 public 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.890
 so what happens before the concert 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.530
 jazz there is an interviewer who invites to 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.700
 famous drummer of a famous drummer 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.110
 you and then say good you want to talk to us 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.400
 of this musical project and the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.580
 drummer part part that the drummer 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.650
 jazz is always half- pissed too 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.200
 But right, that's how it goes with things 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.600
 Italian then begins to say they are 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.220
 a project I care about musicians 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.630
 of the highest level 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.830
 pity that in italy the spaces for 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.100
 these types of initiatives are 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.239
 very few that there are not many 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.280
 all openings are so many openings 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.080
 these things people are not polite 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.480
 musically untrained people a 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.549
 point between other things even night 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.799
 there is a whole mind they were the first 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.750
 time one hears the pistolotto of 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.709
 jazz jesus disappointed because this is 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.690
 he speaks and says we see that he has noticed 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.750
 so just before going to play no 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.820
 then when parking intini dyed times if 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.130
 he noticed it a little earlier but this is true 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.959
 the first time but I the gun for the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.900
 pistolotto need for use lotito 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.370
 had expected 70 80 times not me 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.070
 I do n't even remember Fr. 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.420
 and always the same and always like that never goes 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.980
 well, but in fact the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.730
 generally the center has it from the center not 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.459
 like a shot of 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.170
 if you want to propose projects, you can't do it 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.629
 to convince them 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.090
 it seems to be at school ie little thing e 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.430
 women at school 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.260
 you understand no don't say you understand 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.239
 when you didn't understand if you didn't 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.239
 understood you, I don't understand 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.099
 all understood everything and then how and the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:16.120
 people just want to listen to 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:18.610
 catchphrases and then summer hits 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.810
 what spoiled the music well 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.829
 the last one with jazz risks dying 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.819
 of hunger 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:30.459
 perfect plays a little bit you'll have it 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.069
 we are always there if you do not convince yourself 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.140
 it goes without saying that there is a good company 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.640
 as they say preach well and scratch around 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.560
 bad it is useless to insist jazz cost 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.170
 maybe do some discs for friends 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.359
 you have to call door to door not 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.280
 come to hear jazz and music 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.470
 nobody wants to hear it but then 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.359
 nowadays in Italy 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.739
 another sentence we are more appreciated 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.530
 abroad than in Italy as ever 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.280
 italy you are still there ie i am 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.840
 gurus are not in Italy guys there is 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.060
 you also need to be aware of the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.370
 things i'm not looking for 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.049
 but help if you don't put it too 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.299
 a little effort is nothing but the master 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.349
 the great master but no there is a guru less 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.389
 I follow him badly 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.980
 yes but followed him if it is not enough to see 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.260
 the video is also a bit necessary 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.700
 apply and you'll mean of intent 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.190
 let's be careful it's ok now 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.210
 calm calm that you make it then you to 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.770
 Next appointment

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.539
 on the battery own battery 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.860
 in the sense the physical instrument 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.710

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.130
