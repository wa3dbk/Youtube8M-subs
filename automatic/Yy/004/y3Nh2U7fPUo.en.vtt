you're<00:06:36.950> not<00:06:36.980> a<00:06:37.130> hophead<00:06:37.400> I<00:06:37.640> think<00:06:37.940> you<00:06:38.030> might

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
you're not a hophead I think you might

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.840 
you're not a hophead I think you might
get<00:06:38.330> something<00:06:38.540> out<00:06:38.750> of<00:06:38.810> this<00:06:38.960> I<00:06:39.170> think<00:06:39.410> um

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
get something out of this I think um

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.790 
get something out of this I think um
even<00:06:40.850> as<00:06:40.970> big<00:06:41.180> as<00:06:41.360> aggressive<00:06:42.170> as<00:06:42.260> it<00:06:42.410> is<00:06:42.560> i

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
even as big as aggressive as it is i

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.800 
even as big as aggressive as it is i
think<00:06:43.040> that<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:43.520> cause<00:06:43.850> of<00:06:43.880> the<00:06:44.240> guys<00:06:44.360> citrus

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
think that the cause of the guys citrus

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.930 
think that the cause of the guys citrus
notes<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.290> stuff<00:06:45.500> i<00:06:45.710> think<00:06:46.460> this<00:06:46.580> could<00:06:46.910> be

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
notes and stuff i think this could be

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.880 
notes and stuff i think this could be
because<00:06:47.330> i<00:06:47.720> think<00:06:47.780> that<00:06:48.020> this<00:06:48.170> can<00:06:48.410> be<00:06:48.500> enjoyed

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890
