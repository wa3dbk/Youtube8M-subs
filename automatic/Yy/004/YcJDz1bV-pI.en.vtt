 sweet potato soup with mangold and 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.960
 that's why it looks so nice 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 monochrome and homogeneous but I have 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 left a few pieces in it and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.730

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.030
 Polonaise where I still have ground 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.949
 just have to go and there are 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.420
 same as a gym but yes anyway 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.890

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.310

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.200
 Today there are ordered food in the evening

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 before that, because it really sheep I believe and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.229
 I do not usually do it though 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.920
 Today I solved it that way and today 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 finished on it , I notice more and more 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.320

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 body and digestion 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.070

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.150
 I do not like bread easy and yes 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.790

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.110
 all the way open 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.880
 it does not feel that bad to me 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.750
 skeptical cash for me 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.490
 barely measurable and I try 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.360
 now mitigate today in which I still 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.870

 the leftovers of my honey mustard dressing 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.640

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.380
 I will finally get well again 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.450
 voice normalizes slowly 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.580

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.840
 salad becomes balsamic and pumpkin seed oil 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.560
