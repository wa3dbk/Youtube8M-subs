00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.479 
so I tried to approach as much like that
as<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.390> could<00:01:57.599> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.590> different<00:01:58.890> though

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
as I could this is so different though

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.639 
as I could this is so different though
because<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.689> hands<00:02:00.929> have<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> work<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
because your hands have to work a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
because your hands have to work a
certain<00:02:01.829> way<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.459> you<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.239> we've

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
certain way and you know you're we've

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.199 
certain way and you know you're we've
got<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.959> be<00:02:04.049> locked<00:02:04.319> on<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.129> lot<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:05.819> things

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
got to be locked on to a lot of things

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.779 
got to be locked on to a lot of things
you<00:02:06.479> don't<00:02:06.629> maybe<00:02:07.409> normally<00:02:07.829> think<00:02:08.069> about<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you don't maybe normally think about the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
you don't maybe normally think about the
Kyoto<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.239> perfect<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.720> my<00:02:09.810> drink<00:02:10.139> because

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
Kyoto is perfect for my drink because

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.819 
Kyoto is perfect for my drink because
when<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.100> drop<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.389> the<00:02:13.200> chocolate

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
when you drop that in the the chocolate

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.920 
when you drop that in the the chocolate
heel<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.400> spreads<00:02:14.880> out<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.329> really<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
heel just spreads out and really the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.390 
heel just spreads out and really the
last<00:02:16.109> thing<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.500> tongue<00:02:16.829> is<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.160> kind

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
last thing on your tongue is this kind

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.430 
last thing on your tongue is this kind

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
of smoldering spice of chocolate I knew

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.809 
of smoldering spice of chocolate I knew
I<00:02:19.500> wanted<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.889> use<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.130> coffee<00:02:20.340> before<00:02:20.609> I

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
I wanted to use this coffee before I

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.790 
I wanted to use this coffee before I
taste<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800

the transparency and in working through
that<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.800> realizing<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.670> takes<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:26.060> lot

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
that and realizing that it takes a lot
