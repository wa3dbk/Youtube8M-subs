00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
think she does and I thought about it

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.240 
think she does and I thought about it
for<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.540> long<00:00:15.690> time<00:00:15.719> what<00:00:16.230> type<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.590> makeup<00:00:16.980> look

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
for a long time what type of makeup look

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.590 
for a long time what type of makeup look
that<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.430> want<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> go<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.240> last<00:00:18.420> time

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that I want to go for and last time
