00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.980

 You can put any xix you want

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.079
 free curd and bacon but can put 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.520
 palmito chicken anything you want 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.680
 and also the first step of our 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.500
 recipe of course we pick up the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.840
 Parmesan cheese put here at the first 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.840
 already hot right just get a little 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.060
 She is a china and now she leaves like this until 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.340
 formal because now we have to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.280
 turn not to burn from the side understood 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 ask for a bridge to do so would not be a 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.009
 pancake and turn turned around I'm watching is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.259
 this here 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.020
 stay here till the other side is 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.759
 selfishness and if we have done several before 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.600
 now we are going to fill that finally the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.600
 people show on video 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.340
 then the playoffs are cottage cheese and 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.469
 bacon rb now have to do is if 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:48.039
 put the grated cheese on top 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:49.990
 to give us a cross that here we 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.509
 It refers to the preheated oven at 180 degrees 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.819
 until gratinar that takes around five 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.069
 ten minutes and saw in his house how 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.069
 stay, now take the phone 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.959
 Obviously only now it comes now 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:10.229
 it was good here 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.229
 the basket that's a little hot 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.250
 so it 's very hot 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.780
 so now we're going to try to get here 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.780
 watching the one that is frequent 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.819
 a taste can use whatever you want 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:41.230
 remembering in which he sealed the palm heart 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.230
 right I think he did not want me well 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:52.280

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.410

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.099
 because those who are not easy to do either 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.200

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.780
