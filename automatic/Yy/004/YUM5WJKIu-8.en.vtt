 so let's go guys lets go one more 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.149
 a tip of 400 styles that hake in 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.680
 balcony right 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.170
 as we had fish on the porch is the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.979
 hake best option with display 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.700
 via 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.020
 the galley is as follows this small 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 balcony how does it actually work is 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.520
 I need to be a player only to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 to fish but actually needs two 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.650
 players for you all of a sudden 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 most accurate kill type completion in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.299
 The balcony is the thing when you enter. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.369
 here you always stay connected because you can 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.170
 have understood that much 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.790
 cute little girl who walks on the porch here 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.530
 people around here have a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
 Technician linked in grenade on top 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.820
 also in relation to fish the galley 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 always breaks the glass here this first 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.299
 wood first sting a search 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.290
 here or at the post 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.729
 sometimes the guy can not and this one is 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.060
 ideal for those who are in this first 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.500
 bite and you have to connect is okay 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.689
 another kind of entrance to the balcony 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.600
 ideal would be what it is 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.610
 before striking back as much as 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 and it would be ideal if you make a 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.629
 that he would have to take the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.390
 positioning it can not be done 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.170
 Here you are. Come here. Look at that. 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.599
 type 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.910
 if a window everything all the way 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.849
 to amir there coming soon 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.290
 table and kayali behind trash 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 so if the guy suddenly makes a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.920
 tagging behind the trash 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.900
 You'll be able to get this guy and get 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.900
 the guy is suddenly here on the pole 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.680
 Can you get that pixel there? 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.910
 before entering 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.489
 suddenly she will make an entrance 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.580
 Let's do a research here. 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.519
 this grenade understood that face behind 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.290
 you are putting so much trash and then you 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.970
 so take the guy out of the comfort zone 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.790
 them here on the porch for example cito 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.569
 here in the trash the guy is here in 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.880
 casemate 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.680
 with this money you are going to push back or 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.049
 This guy in the bin will jump and you will 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.989
 is already the advantage of entering concluded 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.390
 macchio here then is this entry 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.700
 suddenly and is not one of the two together here 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.260
 ahead is one ahead and one for 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.319
 behind him and always giving the face together 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.630
 with it makes the grenade it enters and 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.190
 okazaki from behind and enter with him 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.910
 doing this practice here 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.860
 suddenly it is until it occurs because it is 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.470
 I got the guy from the house and killed this guy here. 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.170
 suddenly invaded the track did not catch the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.810
 face of the right that can or is 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.170
 there for bob then okay when guys 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.910
 you went in do not forget enter together 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.730
 do not forget the grenade has this 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.519
 research here is also very good and the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.739
 focus is this guys so it's kind of like 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.170
 fish is there I hope it is 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.480
 helping you that sometimes a lot of people 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.109
 do not know what to do a lot of tr here 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.820
 nothing 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.560
 suddenly gives one applied somewhere 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.440
 So I'm passing on a tip to 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.720

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.720
