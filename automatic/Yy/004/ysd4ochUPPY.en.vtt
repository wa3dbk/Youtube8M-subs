00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.600 
where my own Sheldon system I could only
get<00:02:06.299> one<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> these<00:02:06.630> trays<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:08.160> deal<00:02:08.580> with

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
get one of these trays on it I deal with

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
get one of these trays on it I deal with
just<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.110> having<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
just a little bit of not having the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
just a little bit of not having the
flight<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.920> ends

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
flight on the ends

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.140 
flight on the ends
but<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.830> far<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.190> seems<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.580> it's<00:02:15.760> worked<00:02:15.970> I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
but so far it seems like it's worked I

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.750 
but so far it seems like it's worked I
haven't<00:02:16.450> dealt<00:02:16.600> with<00:02:16.780> too<00:02:16.930> much<00:02:17.730> too<00:02:18.730> much

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
haven't dealt with too much too much

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
assured that the germination is pretty

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.570 
assured that the germination is pretty
pretty<00:03:39.940> good<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.390> on<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:41.019> stock<00:03:41.350> of<00:03:41.560> seed

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.780 

one<00:03:47.580> good<00:03:47.790> sign<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:49.220> we've<00:03:50.220> gotten<00:03:50.610> recently

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
one good sign that we've gotten recently

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.640 
one good sign that we've gotten recently
as<00:03:51.210> our<00:03:51.360> daffodils<00:03:51.930> are<00:03:52.080> starting<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.440> come<00:03:52.590> up

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
as our daffodils are starting to come up

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.820 
as our daffodils are starting to come up
out<00:03:53.040> here<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.390> garden<00:03:57.620> winter<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.770> year
