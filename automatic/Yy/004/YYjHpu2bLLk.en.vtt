00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
that's not a lot that's why it looks a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.809 
that's not a lot that's why it looks a

it and then you have to actually click
on<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.470> thing<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.920> want<00:03:54.130> to<00:03:54.190> scale<00:03:54.489> in

this case it's going to be my head make

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.240 
this case it's going to be my head make
sure<00:03:58.239> your<00:03:58.570> chain<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.079> together<00:03:59.410> see<00:04:00.130> the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
sure your chain is together see the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.349 
sure your chain is together see the
difference<00:04:00.609> between<00:04:00.790> being<00:04:00.940> separated

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
difference between being separated

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.720 
difference between being separated
together<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:02.230> means<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.560> keeps<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.920> in<00:04:03.040> ratio

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
together that means it keeps it in ratio

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.020 
together that means it keeps it in ratio
