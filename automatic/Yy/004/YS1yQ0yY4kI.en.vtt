00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
only problem that I see with the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.960 
only problem that I see with the
color-changing<00:03:12.170> thing<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.490> gotta<00:03:13.640> do<00:03:13.850> it

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
color-changing thing is you gotta do it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.850 
color-changing thing is you gotta do it
manually<00:03:15.850> with<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.510> mouse<00:03:18.260> think<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.590> do<00:03:18.650> that

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
manually with the mouse think I do that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.500 
manually with the mouse think I do that
manually<00:03:19.160> too<00:03:19.520> they<00:03:19.820> don't<00:03:19.970> change<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.390> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
manually too they don't change at the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.500 
manually too they don't change at the
same<00:03:20.720> time<00:03:21.020> as<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.320> thought<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.770> would<00:03:22.510> well

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
