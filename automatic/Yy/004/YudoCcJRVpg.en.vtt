room I think some of the designs are a

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.270 
room I think some of the designs are a
little<00:05:19.240> bit<00:05:19.330> different<00:05:19.690> but<00:05:19.840> overall<00:05:20.650> this<00:05:21.130> is

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
little bit different but overall this is

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.780 
little bit different but overall this is
what<00:05:21.430> a<00:05:21.460> single<00:05:21.760> room<00:05:22.060> looks<00:05:22.270> like<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.650> if<00:05:24.610> you
