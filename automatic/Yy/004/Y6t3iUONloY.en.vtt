Sony's PlayStation 3 anymore which is in
third<00:03:41.880> place<00:03:42.120> behind<00:03:42.390> these<00:03:42.690> two<00:03:42.810> other<00:03:42.959> guys

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
third place behind these two other guys

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.960 
third place behind these two other guys
me<00:03:43.590> what's<00:03:43.799> up<00:03:43.920> with<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.459> did<00:03:44.760> they<00:03:44.850> have

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
me what's up with that is did they have

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.729 
me what's up with that is did they have
a<00:03:45.000> chance<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.390> catching<00:03:45.510> up<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.959> it'll<00:03:46.379> it'll

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
a chance of catching up and it'll it'll

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.290 
a chance of catching up and it'll it'll
seem<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.280> stay<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.640> way<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:47.849> mean<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.180> think

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
seem to be stay that way I mean I think

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.970 
seem to be stay that way I mean I think
they're<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.080> probably<00:03:49.319> make<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.709> big

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
they're going to probably make a big

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.320 
they're going to probably make a big
play

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
play

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.430 
play
when<00:03:50.420> they<00:03:50.510> come<00:03:50.660> out<00:03:50.750> with<00:03:50.810> Grand<00:03:51.140> Theft<00:03:51.200> Auto

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
when they come out with Grand Theft Auto

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.590 
when they come out with Grand Theft Auto
right<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.460> that's<00:03:52.850> all<00:03:53.000> we<00:03:53.060> kind<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.420> their

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
right so that's all we kind of their

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.300 
right so that's all we kind of their
halo<00:03:53.930> that'll<00:03:54.170> be<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> my<00:03:54.470> spy<00:03:54.650> game<00:03:54.920> right

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
halo that'll be the my spy game right

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.270 
halo that'll be the my spy game right
right<00:03:55.580> but<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:56.570> think<00:03:56.930> halo<00:03:57.200> tackles<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.680> wider

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
right but I think halo tackles a wider

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.220 
right but I think halo tackles a wider
audience<00:03:58.400> because<00:03:59.120> it's<00:03:59.270> not<00:03:59.480> as<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.990> mean<00:04:00.110> it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
audience because it's not as I mean it

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.180 
audience because it's not as I mean it
there's<00:04:00.350> always<00:04:00.530> been<00:04:00.620> an<00:04:00.740> issue<00:04:00.830> of<00:04:00.950> violence

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
there's always been an issue of violence

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.510 
there's always been an issue of violence
with<00:04:01.520> grand<00:04:01.730> theft<00:04:01.790> auto<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.780> but<00:04:03.740> there's<00:04:04.310> you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
with grand theft auto so but there's you

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.950 
with grand theft auto so but there's you
know<00:04:04.550> there<00:04:05.000> was<00:04:05.060> never<00:04:05.240> an<00:04:05.390> online<00:04:05.720> play

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.900 
know there was never an online play
component<00:04:06.710> and<00:04:06.830> that's<00:04:07.190> why<00:04:07.340> hallo<00:04:07.580> as<00:04:07.880> a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
component and that's why hallo as a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.790 
component and that's why hallo as a
first<00:04:08.150> person<00:04:08.300> shooter<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.930> pretty<00:04:09.710> much
