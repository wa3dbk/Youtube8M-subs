00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.250 

now<00:02:01.800> we<00:02:01.860> put<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> bolts<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.330> tighten<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
now we put the bolts in and tighten it

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.640 
now we put the bolts in and tighten it
up<00:02:04.440> as<00:02:05.040> quickly<00:02:05.580> as<00:02:05.790> possible<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.510> bolts<00:02:07.410> on

up as quickly as possible the bolts on

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.650 
up as quickly as possible the bolts on

the race wheels going from the backside
I've<00:02:10.140> already<00:02:10.440> put<00:02:10.590> most<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:10.920> them<00:02:11.040> in<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.460> put

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
I've already put most of them in and put

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.310 
I've already put most of them in and put
the<00:02:11.730> nuts<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.120> them<00:02:14.720> stick<00:02:15.720> them<00:02:15.840> through<00:02:18.320> the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
the nuts on them stick them through the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.440 
the nuts on them stick them through the
nuts<00:02:19.500> by<00:02:19.620> hand<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:23.580> want<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> try<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.330> it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
nuts by hand you want to try to get it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.850 
nuts by hand you want to try to get it
together<00:02:24.780> before<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.320> silicone<00:02:26.090> sets<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.860> so

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
together before the silicone sets up so

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.350 
together before the silicone sets up so
you<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.160> smooth<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:29.610> again<00:02:30.030> after<00:02:30.300> you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you can smooth it down again after you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.210 
you can smooth it down again after you
get<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> wheel<00:02:30.810> clamp<00:02:31.500> together<00:02:31.800> or

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
get the wheel clamp together or

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.800 
get the wheel clamp together or
tightened<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:34.350> helps<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:35.720> before<00:02:36.720> you

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
tightened up it helps to before you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.840 
tightened up it helps to before you
start<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.200> already<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> washers<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
start I already have the washers on the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.540 
start I already have the washers on the
bolts<00:02:39.380> or<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:40.680> you're<00:02:40.830> doing<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.130> street<00:02:41.370> wheel

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
bolts or if you're doing a street wheel

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.370 
bolts or if you're doing a street wheel
you<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.940> put<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.210> bolts<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.080> center

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
you can put the bolts in the center

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.110 
you can put the bolts in the center
before<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.770> drop<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.700> speeds

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
before you drop it in and that speeds

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.260 
before you drop it in and that speeds
things<00:02:45.270> up<00:02:45.510> quite<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> bit<00:02:46.730> when<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.790> tighten<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
things up quite a bit when I tighten the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.490 
things up quite a bit when I tighten the
nuts

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
nuts

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.760 
nuts
I<00:02:49.560> usually<00:02:49.920> tighten<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:52.020> they<00:02:52.110> go<00:02:52.260> 180

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
I usually tighten one and they go 180

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.520 
I usually tighten one and they go 180
degrees<00:02:53.220> tight<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> other<00:02:54.180> one<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.930> come

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
degrees tight the other one then come

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.230 
degrees tight the other one then come
back<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.800> 90<00:02:56.040> degrees<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.340> go<00:02:56.700> across<00:02:56.940> from

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
back to 90 degrees and go across from

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.720 
back to 90 degrees and go across from
there<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.690> across<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.170> pattern<00:02:58.530> after<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.610> get

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
there and across the pattern after I get
