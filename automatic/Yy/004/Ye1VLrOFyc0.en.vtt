PT Cruiser and first what we found was
this<00:00:14.009> metal<00:00:16.700> laid<00:00:17.700> it<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.970> pan<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:19.250> what

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
this metal laid it in the pan and what

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.550 
this metal laid it in the pan and what
actually<00:00:20.760> calls<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.449> low<00:00:21.630> fluid<00:00:21.930> damage

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
actually calls it was low fluid damage

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.279 
actually calls it was low fluid damage
exactly<00:00:23.460> what's<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.510> these

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
exactly what's going on with it these

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.359 
exactly what's going on with it these
clutches<00:00:25.680> are<00:00:26.010> dark<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:27.710> also<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> questions

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
clutches are dark and also the questions

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.630 
clutches are dark and also the questions
had<00:00:29.490> nibbled<00:00:29.730> into<00:00:30.179> these<00:00:30.330> tubes<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:32.099> under

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
had nibbled into these tubes the under

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.710 
had nibbled into these tubes the under
drive<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:35.040> overdrive<00:00:35.489> clutch<00:00:36.089> hub<00:00:36.360> had

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
drive and the overdrive clutch hub had

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.640 
drive and the overdrive clutch hub had
been<00:00:36.930> nibbled<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> month<00:00:39.930> where<00:00:40.379> is

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
been nibbled into and the month where is

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.350 
been nibbled into and the month where is
there<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.040> well<00:00:41.250> these<00:00:41.460> clutches<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:42.089> burn

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
there as well these clutches are burn

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.030 
there as well these clutches are burn
but<00:00:44.449> there's<00:00:45.449> really<00:00:45.720> no<00:00:46.019> place<00:00:46.229> we<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
but there's really no place we see the

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.770 
but there's really no place we see the
metal<00:00:47.400> coming<00:00:47.790> from<00:00:48.000> inside<00:00:48.540> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
transmission itself the only other place

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
transmission itself the only other place
that<00:00:51.780> could<00:00:51.839> be<00:00:51.930> coming<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.589> inside<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that could be coming from is inside the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
that could be coming from is inside the
converter<00:00:53.519> this<00:00:54.150> torque<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.659> murders

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
converter this torque for murders

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
converter this torque for murders
between<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.589> transmission<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.750> engine

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
between the transmission and engine

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.600 
between the transmission and engine
takes<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.379> place<00:00:58.589> of<00:00:58.619> a<00:00:58.860> clutch<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.400> you<00:00:59.460> had<00:00:59.580> a

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
takes the place of a clutch if you had a

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.969 
takes the place of a clutch if you had a
stick<00:00:59.909> shift<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.470> going<00:01:01.650> to<00:01:01.739> take

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
stick shift so what it's going to take

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.880 
stick shift so what it's going to take
to<00:01:02.189> fix<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.850> fix<00:01:02.909> it<00:01:03.239> correctly<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
to fix this and fix it correctly is a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.330 
to fix this and fix it correctly is a
rebuild<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:07.200> includes<00:01:07.650> replacing<00:01:08.190> all

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
rebuild and that includes replacing all

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.990 
rebuild and that includes replacing all
the<00:01:08.490> clutches<00:01:09.170> gaskets<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.260> seals<00:01:10.790> do<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the clutches gaskets and seals do that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.660 
the clutches gaskets and seals do that
also<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.630> keep<00:01:12.870> this<00:01:13.050> from<00:01:13.290> happening<00:01:13.860> again

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
also to keep this from happening again

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.660 
also to keep this from happening again
which<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.390> improve<00:01:15.630> things<00:01:16.520> we're<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
which will improve things we're going to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.000 
which will improve things we're going to
install<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.390> recalibration<00:01:18.870> an<00:01:19.380> upgrade<00:01:19.710> kit

in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> valve<00:01:20.430> body<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.240> brain<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
in the valve body this is the brain of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.220 
in the valve body this is the brain of
the<00:01:21.900> transmission<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.690> we're<00:01:24.690> gonna<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
the transmission and we're gonna do that

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.590 
the transmission and we're gonna do that
also<00:01:25.470> they've<00:01:26.100> upgraded<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.940> rubber<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.480> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
also they've upgraded the rubber on the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
also they've upgraded the rubber on the
seals<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.410> make<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.190> last<00:01:29.430> longer<00:01:29.580> where<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
seals to make them last longer where you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.820 
seals to make them last longer where you
won't<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.480> deal<00:01:30.660> with<00:01:30.690> that<00:01:30.900> again<00:01:31.230> also

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
won't have to deal with that again also

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.290 
won't have to deal with that again also
something<00:01:32.340> else<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.790> later<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
something else it was later it was a

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.000 
something else it was later it was a
solenoid<00:01:33.810> pack<00:01:34.230> that's<00:01:34.470> bolts<00:01:34.800> on<00:01:34.920> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.180 
up and you can see the lines come out
then<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> fluids<00:02:18.780> going<00:02:19.620> through<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.160> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
then the fluids going through here and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.710 
then the fluids going through here and
where<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.580> connected<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.360> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
where it's connected here this is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.449 
where it's connected here this is
actually<00:02:21.870> connected<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> cooling<00:02:23.069> system

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
actually connected to the cooling system

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.210 
actually connected to the cooling system
portion<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.940> your<00:02:24.030> transmission<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:25.980> see

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
portion of your transmission you can see

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
portion of your transmission you can see
where<00:02:26.430> we've<00:02:27.180> attached<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.110> it's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
where we've attached it here and it's

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.770 
where we've attached it here and it's
going<00:02:28.410> through<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.830> lines<00:02:29.450> right<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.600> through

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
going through the lines right up through

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.190 
going through the lines right up through
here<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.819> it's<00:02:33.000> flushing<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.599> bad<00:02:33.810> fluid

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
here so it's flushing all that bad fluid

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.290 
here so it's flushing all that bad fluid
out<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.470> there<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.800> when<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.209> put<00:02:36.209> your

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
out of there so when we put your

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.820 
out of there so when we put your
transmission<00:02:36.930> back<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.319> there's<00:02:37.500> no<00:02:37.650> more

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
transmission back in there's no more

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.110 
transmission back in there's no more
contamination<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.380> that's<00:02:40.590> how<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.910> clean<00:02:41.910> out

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
contamination so that's how we clean out

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.540 
contamination so that's how we clean out
the<00:02:42.709> cooling<00:02:43.709> system<00:02:44.069> portion<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.459> your

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
the cooling system portion of your

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.880 
the cooling system portion of your
transmission
