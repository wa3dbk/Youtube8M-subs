00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 I am looking for a car 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.030
 That is bitter 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030

 the informant should 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.090
 the excitement 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.180
 I did not even score for the results presented 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.030

 I'm just 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.910
 this summer 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.590
 - 11 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.729

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.450

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.450

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 I have to wait 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.490
 boat 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.970
 of course received 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.080
 on 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.080

 ca 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.030
 ddp 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.730
 that's not funny 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.380
 the 2nd 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.880
