makes this one of the best one of the
only<00:01:24.700> fusion<00:01:25.209> rifles<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.840> would<00:01:26.020> advise<00:01:26.319> in

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
only fusion rifles I would advise in

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.620 
only fusion rifles I would advise in
situations<00:01:27.340> like<00:01:27.459> the<00:01:27.789> first<00:01:28.060> part<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
situations like the first part of the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.289 
situations like the first part of the
cruda<00:01:28.869> rates<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:30.340> also<00:01:30.520> has<00:01:30.999> the<00:01:31.179> hive

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
cruda rates it also has the hive

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.330 
cruda rates it also has the hive
disruptor<00:01:31.869> perk<00:01:32.109> so<00:01:32.350> this<00:01:32.560> weapon<00:01:32.859> basically

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
disruptor perk so this weapon basically

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.550 
disruptor perk so this weapon basically
evaporates<00:01:33.939> everything<00:01:34.630> that's<00:01:34.899> Haifa<00:01:35.350> leads

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
evaporates everything that's Haifa leads

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.099 
evaporates everything that's Haifa leads
in<00:01:35.859> a<00:01:35.950> couple<00:01:36.219> of<00:01:36.310> shots<00:01:36.609> and<00:01:36.850> all<00:01:37.509> around<00:01:37.869> if

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
in a couple of shots and all around if

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.629 
in a couple of shots and all around if
you<00:01:38.200> don't<00:01:38.229> like<00:01:38.619> snapping<00:01:39.069> too<00:01:39.219> much<00:01:39.399> and

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
you don't like snapping too much and

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.550 
you don't like snapping too much and
you're<00:01:39.729> more<00:01:39.939> frontliner<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:41.079> is<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.259> great

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
you're more frontliner this is a great

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.789 
you're more frontliner this is a great
choice<00:01:41.799> for<00:01:41.859> both<00:01:42.310> PVE<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.060> pvp<00:01:43.799> it's

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
choice for both PVE and pvp it's

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.589 
choice for both PVE and pvp it's
actually<00:01:45.249> comparable<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.060> murmur<00:01:46.299> in

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
actually comparable to the murmur in

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.389 
actually comparable to the murmur in
base<00:01:46.810> stats<00:01:47.079> when<00:01:47.289> you<00:01:47.349> put<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.649> on<00:01:47.740> arc<00:01:48.069> but

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
base stats when you put it on arc but

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.949 
base stats when you put it on arc but
the<00:01:48.549> murmur<00:01:48.729> has<00:01:48.999> a<00:01:49.029> little<00:01:49.270> less<00:01:49.539> Emmaline

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
the murmur has a little less Emmaline

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.399 
the murmur has a little less Emmaline
accuracy<00:01:50.529> I<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:52.329> one<00:01:52.359> really<00:01:52.929> like<00:01:53.109> fusion

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
accuracy I for one really like fusion

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.609 
accuracy I for one really like fusion
rifles<00:01:53.999> especially<00:01:54.999> in<00:01:55.119> PvE<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.259> I'm<00:01:56.380> really

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
rifles especially in PvE so I'm really

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.559 
rifles especially in PvE so I'm really
happy<00:01:56.919> with<00:01:57.039> this<00:01:57.279> weapon<00:01:57.490> because<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.299> one

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
happy with this weapon because it is one

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.480 
happy with this weapon because it is one
of<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.840> best<00:01:59.049> fusion<00:01:59.439> rifles<00:01:59.799> out<00:02:00.009> there<00:02:00.249> and

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
of the best fusion rifles out there and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.459 
of the best fusion rifles out there and
the<00:02:00.609> arc<00:02:00.819> makes<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.299> interesting<00:02:01.689> too<00:02:02.439> because

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
the arc makes it interesting too because

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.769 
the arc makes it interesting too because
all<00:02:03.039> my<00:02:03.249> good<00:02:03.459> weapons<00:02:03.789> are<00:02:03.999> solar<00:02:04.299> for<00:02:04.659> the
