today's quick tip is brought to you by

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.090 
today's quick tip is brought to you by
nobody<00:00:03.300> because<00:00:04.080> nobody<00:00:04.410> does<00:00:04.650> it<00:00:04.680> like<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.040> do

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
nobody because nobody does it like I do

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.490 
nobody because nobody does it like I do
all<00:00:06.089> right<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.720> what<00:00:06.930> happened

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
all right so this is what happened

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.980 
all right so this is what happened
I<00:00:07.529> got<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.790> tires<00:00:09.000> replaced<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.570> other<00:00:09.690> day

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
I got a my tires replaced the other day

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.490 
I got a my tires replaced the other day
and<00:00:10.290> they<00:00:11.040> came<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.690> these<00:00:12.690> metal<00:00:13.170> valve

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and they came with these metal valve

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.530 
and they came with these metal valve
stem<00:00:13.860> caps<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:15.000> I'm<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.269> take<00:00:15.420> this

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
stem caps so I'm going to take this

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.390 
stem caps so I'm going to take this
opportunity<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> quick<00:00:16.859> tip<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.250> these

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.050 
opportunity for a quick tip on these

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.170 

now<00:00:18.960> I'm<00:00:19.350> no<00:00:19.680> scientist<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.730> I'm<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:20.939> going<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
now I'm no scientist so I'm not going to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.970 
now I'm no scientist so I'm not going to
break<00:00:21.330> down<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.779> exactly<00:00:22.260> happens<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:22.830> what

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
break down what exactly happens but what

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.189 
break down what exactly happens but what
I<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.279> happen<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.240> vehicle<00:00:24.720> comes<00:00:24.960> in

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
I see happen is is a vehicle comes in

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.060 
I see happen is is a vehicle comes in
and<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.070> these<00:00:26.310> caps<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:28.080> cannot

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and it has these caps on and I cannot

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.279 
and it has these caps on and I cannot
get<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.460> off<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.970> mean<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.750> take<00:00:30.929> pliers

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
get them off I mean I can take pliers

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.010 
get them off I mean I can take pliers
and<00:00:31.769> grip<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.640> put<00:00:33.120> pliers<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.719> here

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
and grip it here and put pliers on here

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.950 
and grip it here and put pliers on here
but<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.500> can't<00:00:34.829> break<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.280> bond<00:00:35.520> between<00:00:35.960> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
but I can't break the bond between the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.700 
but I can't break the bond between the
metal<00:00:37.290> cap<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.879> stem<00:00:39.210> itself<00:00:39.530> now<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
metal cap and the stem itself now what I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
metal cap and the stem itself now what I
believe<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> metal<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.300> this

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
believe is is that the metal of this

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.690 
believe is is that the metal of this
stem<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.320> metal<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.800> cap<00:00:44.070> are

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
stem and the metal of this cap are

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.479 
stem and the metal of this cap are
different<00:00:45.149> metals<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:47.219> they're

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
different metals and when they're

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.139 
different metals and when they're
threaded<00:00:47.879> together<00:00:49.100> hot<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> cold<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
threaded together hot and cold and you

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.490 
threaded together hot and cold and you
know<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> brakes<00:00:51.750> getting<00:00:52.050> hot<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
know the brakes getting hot and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
know the brakes getting hot and
everything<00:00:52.710> getting<00:00:53.160> cold<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.120> actually

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
everything getting cold and actually

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.610 
everything getting cold and actually
fused<00:00:54.840> together<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> best<00:00:58.140> solution

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
fused together so the best solution

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
fused together so the best solution
would<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> take<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.730> cap<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.270> throw

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
would be just to take this cap and throw

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.630 
would be just to take this cap and throw
out<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> timbuktu<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:04.339> what<00:01:05.339> we're<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
out the timbuktu but what we're going to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.730 
out the timbuktu but what we're going to
do<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.820> something<00:01:06.090> different<00:01:07.460> we<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.700> some

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
do is something different we have some

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
do is something different we have some
ABCs<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:12.750> q-tip

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.649 

we're<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:18.210> put<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> little

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
we're just going to go and put a little

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.319 
we're just going to go and put a little
dab<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> run<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:20.880> around<00:01:21.149> the

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
dab and run this thing around the

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:31.359 
dab and run this thing around the
threads<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> stem<00:01:22.229> itself

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.099 

and<00:01:31.850> then<00:01:32.000> I'll<00:01:32.090> go<00:01:32.240> ahead<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.539> put<00:01:32.719> this<00:01:32.840> cap

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
and then I'll go ahead and put this cap

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.590 
and then I'll go ahead and put this cap
off<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.039> what<00:01:34.219> that's<00:01:34.369> going<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.670> do<00:01:34.820> is

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
off and what that's going to do is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.289 
off and what that's going to do is
that's<00:01:35.780> going<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.990> make<00:01:36.109> it<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.380> that<00:01:36.609> this<00:01:37.609> cat

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
that's going to make it to that this cat

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.480 
that's going to make it to that this cat
will<00:01:38.630> never<00:01:38.810> fuse<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.439> this<00:01:39.590> step<00:01:39.950> see<00:01:40.460> a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
will never fuse to this step see a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.240 
will never fuse to this step see a
problem<00:01:40.939> is<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.590> know<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.189> know

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
problem is is that you know you know

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.399 
problem is is that you know you know
this<00:01:43.460> is<00:01:43.609> a<00:01:43.640> 2003<00:01:44.420> Trailblazer<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.350> it

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
this is a 2003 Trailblazer and it

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.840 
this is a 2003 Trailblazer and it
doesn't<00:01:45.710> have<00:01:45.829> that<00:01:45.859> stupid<00:01:46.219> tire<00:01:46.549> pressure

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
doesn't have that stupid tire pressure

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.300 
doesn't have that stupid tire pressure
monitor<00:01:47.329> a<00:01:47.479> lot<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:48.079> vehicles<00:01:48.619> have<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.039> where

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
monitor a lot of vehicles have it where

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.330 
monitor a lot of vehicles have it where
the<00:01:49.909> stem<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.539> part<00:01:51.079> of<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.860> tire<00:01:52.069> pressure

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
the stem is part of the tire pressure

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.099 
the stem is part of the tire pressure
monitor<00:01:52.819> so<00:01:53.030> actually<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> other<00:01:53.630> side<00:01:54.079> of

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
monitor so actually on the other side of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.740 
monitor so actually on the other side of
this<00:01:54.439> there's<00:01:54.920> actually<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.310> sensor<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.969> it<00:01:56.149> so

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
this there's actually a sensor to it so

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.050 
this there's actually a sensor to it so
what<00:01:56.869> happens<00:01:56.899> is<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.409> when<00:01:57.859> this<00:01:57.979> cap<00:01:58.280> fuses

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
what happens is that when this cap fuses

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.639 
what happens is that when this cap fuses
to<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.420> stem<00:01:59.750> and<00:01:59.929> you<00:01:59.990> can't<00:02:00.259> get<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.500> off

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
to this stem and you can't get it off

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.160 
to this stem and you can't get it off
you<00:02:01.159> have<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.459> replace<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.939> whole<00:02:02.090> thing

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
you have to replace the whole thing

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.779 
you have to replace the whole thing
number<00:02:03.170> one<00:02:03.380> these<00:02:03.890> sensors<00:02:04.310> aren't<00:02:04.520> cheap

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
number one these sensors aren't cheap

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.490 
number one these sensors aren't cheap
and<00:02:05.060> number<00:02:05.450> two<00:02:05.659> they<00:02:06.110> have<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.380> be

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
and number two they have to be

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.080 
and number two they have to be
programmed<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.369> truck<00:02:07.610> once<00:02:07.849> they're

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
programmed to the truck once they're

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.199 
programmed to the truck once they're
installed<00:02:08.329> in<00:02:08.860> many<00:02:09.860> vehicles<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:10.729> not<00:02:10.940> all

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
installed in many vehicles but not all

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.990 
installed in many vehicles but not all
while<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.440> refuse<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.099> buy<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> vehicle<00:02:13.549> that<00:02:13.849> has

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
while I refuse to buy a vehicle that has

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.720 
while I refuse to buy a vehicle that has
tire<00:02:14.269> pressure<00:02:14.599> monitors<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.530> will<00:02:15.739> try<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
tire pressure monitors and I will try to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.940 
tire pressure monitors and I will try to
avoid<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.390> at<00:02:17.569> all<00:02:17.660> cost<00:02:18.019> when<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.739> time

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
avoid that at all cost when the time

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.069 
avoid that at all cost when the time
comes<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.549> if<00:02:20.000> they<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.329> these<00:02:20.510> metal<00:02:20.720> stems

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
comes and if they have these metal stems

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.270 
comes and if they have these metal stems
the<00:02:21.319> first<00:02:21.530> thing<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:21.739> going<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.920> do<00:02:22.069> is

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the first thing I'm going to do is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520 
the first thing I'm going to do is
either<00:02:22.849> throw<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.390> metal<00:02:23.629> caps<00:02:23.840> away<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.349> put

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
either throw the metal caps away and put

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.460 
either throw the metal caps away and put
the<00:02:24.680> traditional<00:02:25.430> rubber<00:02:25.549> caps<00:02:25.879> on<00:02:26.120> or<00:02:26.720> put

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the traditional rubber caps on or put

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.410 
the traditional rubber caps on or put
some<00:02:27.650> anti-seize<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.099> it<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.579> that<00:02:29.030> way<00:02:29.209> I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
some anti-seize on it and that way I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.210 
some anti-seize on it and that way I
have<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> pretty<00:02:30.170> good<00:02:30.349> chance<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.890> never

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
have a pretty good chance of it never

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.690 
have a pretty good chance of it never
fusing<00:02:31.879> to<00:02:32.060> itself<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.980> that's<00:02:33.980> today's<00:02:34.190> quick

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
fusing to itself so that's today's quick

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.030 
fusing to itself so that's today's quick
