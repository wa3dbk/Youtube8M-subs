advantage<00:01:44.400> with<00:01:44.700> having<00:01:45.540> something<00:01:45.900> like

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
advantage with having something like

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.149 
advantage with having something like
this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.400> will<00:01:47.520> keep<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.210> card<00:01:48.600> cool<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
this is it will keep the card cool the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
this is it will keep the card cool the
disadvantage<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> will<00:01:51.150> take<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.570> PCI

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
disadvantage is it will take up a PCI

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
disadvantage is it will take up a PCI
slot<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.100> might<00:01:53.280> interfere<00:01:53.520> with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
slot and it might interfere with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
slot and it might interfere with
anything<00:01:54.439> that's<00:01:55.439> over<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.189> hard

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
anything that's over here like hard

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.200 
anything that's over here like hard
drives<00:01:56.700> etc<00:01:57.890> however<00:01:58.890> products<00:01:59.790> like<00:01:59.970> these

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
drives etc however products like these

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880

especially<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:00.960> you're<00:02:01.079> overclocking<00:02:01.470> them

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
especially if you're overclocking them

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.149 
especially if you're overclocking them
do<00:02:02.399> need<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.420> coolers<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.890> on

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
do need to have coolers like this on

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.219 
do need to have coolers like this on
them<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.700> order<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.600> keep<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:07.140> cool<00:02:07.860> and
