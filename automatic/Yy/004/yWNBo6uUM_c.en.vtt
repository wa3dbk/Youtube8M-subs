with<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:50.900> phone<00:00:53.650> actually<00:00:54.650> I<00:00:54.860> think<00:00:55.040> the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
with this phone actually I think the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.079 
with this phone actually I think the
biggest<00:00:55.640> difference<00:00:56.619> is<00:00:57.619> the<00:00:58.280> look<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:58.850> feel

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
biggest difference is the look and feel

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.890 
biggest difference is the look and feel
of<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.510> phone<00:00:59.750> as<00:01:00.409> you<00:01:00.650> might<00:01:01.580> known<00:01:01.850> no<00:01:02.600> this

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
of the phone as you might known no this

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.700 
of the phone as you might known no this
is<00:01:03.049> a<00:01:03.879> symbian<00:01:05.380> phone<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.070> same<00:01:07.310> software

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
is a symbian phone so the same software

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.980 
is a symbian phone so the same software
can<00:01:09.710> be<00:01:09.740> used<00:01:09.950> as<00:01:10.520> some<00:01:10.790> other<00:01:11.240> nokia<00:01:11.510> phones

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
