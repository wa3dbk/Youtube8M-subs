00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
we have just me and go I think he's one

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650

of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.730> underrated<00:00:38.730> goalkeepers<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
of the underrated goalkeepers in the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.260 
of the underrated goalkeepers in the
Premier<00:00:40.050> League<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:41.010> he<00:00:41.160> should<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.550> Bell

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
Premier League I think he should be Bell

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.260 
Premier League I think he should be Bell
in<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.750> game<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.559> let's<00:00:44.430> move<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.149> our

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
in this game so let's move on to our

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.540 
in this game so let's move on to our
center<00:00:46.079> back<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.739> wanted<00:00:47.129> cash<00:00:47.340> only

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
center back which I wanted cash only

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
center back which I wanted cash only
like<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> upgraded<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> dome<00:00:49.260> upgraded

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
like the upgraded on the dome upgraded

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.959 
like the upgraded on the dome upgraded
but<00:00:49.860> he<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.070> already<00:00:50.219> pic<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> had<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
but he was already pic so I had to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.389 
but he was already pic so I had to
settle<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.510> less<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.770> never<00:00:53.039> tried

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
settle for less and I've never tried

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.689 
settle for less and I've never tried
this<00:00:53.579> guy<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.570> gonna<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.780> very<00:00:54.930> very

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
this guy so it's gonna be very very

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.860 
this guy so it's gonna be very very
interesting<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.030> he's<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
interesting to see if he's good but I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
interesting to see if he's good but I
haven't<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.410> seen<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.980> many<00:00:59.309> squads

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
haven't really seen them in many squads

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
haven't really seen them in many squads
so<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:00.870> very<00:01:01.260> interesting

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
so this could be very very interesting

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.619 
so this could be very very interesting
there's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> reason<00:01:02.550> why<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.760> guy<00:01:03.149> isn't<00:01:03.390> in

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
there's a reason why this guy isn't in

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.960 
there's a reason why this guy isn't in
many<00:01:03.870> squads<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.920> hoping<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
many squads and I'm hoping not to see it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780 
many squads and I'm hoping not to see it
to<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> non-paying<00:01:06.720> Bates<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.229> 87<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.580> right

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
to a non-paying Bates in 87 now my right

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.870 
to a non-paying Bates in 87 now my right
back<00:01:08.970> um<00:01:09.240> I've<00:01:09.570> tried<00:01:09.930> him<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.409> many<00:01:10.680> times

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
back um I've tried him so many times

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.039 
back um I've tried him so many times
really<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.030> happy<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> got<00:01:12.780> Kyle

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
really really happy that I got Kyle

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
really really happy that I got Kyle
Walker<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.310> stop<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.610> crossing

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
Walker so this will stop the crossing

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.200 
Walker so this will stop the crossing
abuse<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.530> Bateson<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.340> they're<00:01:17.759> moving<00:01:17.880> on

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
abuse from Bateson and they're moving on

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.499 
abuse from Bateson and they're moving on
to<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:19.130> centre-back<00:01:20.130> sorry<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.670> I've<00:01:20.759> haven't

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to a centre-back sorry that I've haven't

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.440 
to a centre-back sorry that I've haven't
tried<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.330> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
tried out at all I think so this will be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.469 
tried out at all I think so this will be
interesting<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:25.020> well<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.500> defenders

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
interesting as well because my defenders

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.510 
interesting as well because my defenders

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
squads and I think he's one of the best

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
squads and I think he's one of the best
left-backs<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.110> don't<00:01:58.290> even<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.710> clichy
