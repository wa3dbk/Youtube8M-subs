 Hi guys! 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.960
 I am now in Kabukicho, in Shinjuku 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.700
 and we are on our way to the Robot Restaurant 

00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:15.263
 Most of you probably already know what it is 

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:16.683
 You have probably already seen videos on YouTube 

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:21.502
 But I thought that every channel about Japan needs a Robot Restaurant video 

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:25.682
 Chris is now in Tokyo! Hi Chris, say hello ~ 

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:27.462
 How are you? 

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.431
 So it seemed like the perfect time to go 

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.305
 Are we there? This must be it 

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:34.047
 Is this it? Yeah ... this will be it. 

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:40.624
 Well it's easy to find! 

00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:43.673
 Here we go ~ Do you feel like it !? 

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:45.193
 I can hardly restrain myself! 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.430
 Epic waiting room 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.940
 You can't enjoy the Robot Restaurant without some Chuhi 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.780
 Chuhi is a popular carbonated alcoholic drink 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.180
 ... and the show starts! 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.800
 Their costumes used to be much more "daring" 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.700
 But now they have watered it down a bit, making it relatively child-friendly 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.600
 It became stranger as the evening passed 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.920
 In the name of the moon, I will punish you! 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.960
 I feel like I've heard that sentence somewhere&gt; _&gt; 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.140
 Oh that's just a dragonfly that wears a gorilla. Nothing to see here. 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.860
 ROBOT SHARK FTW 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.900
 The robot snakes were probably my favorite 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.640
 DINOSAURS 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.320
 We all have to stoop to avoid being hit in the face 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.580
 Is it not beautiful? 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.160
 WTF IS GOING ON 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.200
 Dancing robots: D 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.620
 Ok, so that was the Robot Restaurant! 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.740
 Awesome! 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.940
 That was pretty cool 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.821
 It was better than I expected 

00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.004
 Everyone was so talented 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.880
 Yeah, it was fun! 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.300
 It is quite expensive 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.207
 I think it's 7000 yen if you buy the tickets at the door 

00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:49.421
 But apparently they are cheaper if you order them online! 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.240
 5500 yen online! 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.140
 You can save some money 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.220
 Japanican.com 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.840
 I will search for a link and share it below 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.920
