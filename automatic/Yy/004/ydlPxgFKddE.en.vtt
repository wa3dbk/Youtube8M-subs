00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this right now like I said I just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.999 
this right now like I said I just
restored<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.600> go<00:02:06.810> ahead<00:02:06.899> into<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.619> weather

restored it so go ahead into the weather

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.119 
restored it so go ahead into the weather
so<00:02:08.369> again<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.869> really<00:02:10.590> everything

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
so again so you know really everything

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.040 
so again so you know really everything
is<00:02:11.280> kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.180> you'd<00:02:12.510> expect<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.900> be

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
is kind of what you'd expect to be

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.760 
is kind of what you'd expect to be
skinny<00:02:13.290> skin

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
skinny skin

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.530 
skinny skin
you've<00:02:13.980> got<00:02:14.190> custom<00:02:14.610> load<00:02:14.790> screens<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.330> well

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
you've got custom load screens as well

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.780 
you've got custom load screens as well
so<00:02:16.080> that's<00:02:16.350> all<00:02:16.590> really<00:02:16.860> good<00:02:17.130> we'll<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.670> go

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
so that's all really good we'll just go

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.890 
so that's all really good we'll just go
ahead<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.030> show<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.330> lock<00:02:18.480> screen<00:02:18.600> which

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
ahead and show you the lock screen which

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
ahead and show you the lock screen which
is<00:02:18.930> almost<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:20.010> think<00:02:20.040> my<00:02:20.280> favorite<00:02:20.490> part<00:02:20.670> of

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
is almost I think my favorite part of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.310 
is almost I think my favorite part of
this<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.870> say<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
this so like I say this is the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320 
this so like I say this is the
minimalistic<00:02:23.070> one<00:02:23.280> you've<00:02:23.490> got<00:02:23.520> still<00:02:24.240> got

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
minimalistic one you've got still got

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.970 
minimalistic one you've got still got
your<00:02:24.390> clock<00:02:24.720> there<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.560> obviously<00:02:25.650> got

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
your clock there but you obviously got

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.830 
your clock there but you obviously got
the<00:02:26.040> background<00:02:26.520> missing<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.450> cool

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the background missing but the cool

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.540 
the background missing but the cool
thing<00:02:27.870> at<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> bottom<00:02:28.380> here<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:28.950> slider

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
thing at the bottom here is this slider

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.550 
thing at the bottom here is this slider
so<00:02:29.970> really<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.390> minimalistic<00:02:30.750> there's<00:02:31.470> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
so really it's minimalistic there's a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.960 
so really it's minimalistic there's a
really<00:02:31.710> small<00:02:32.040> slider<00:02:32.310> at<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.520> bottom<00:02:32.580> there

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
really small slider at the bottom there

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.070 
really small slider at the bottom there
and<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> still<00:02:33.300> have<00:02:33.420> your<00:02:33.540> camera<00:02:33.720> grabber

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
and you still have your camera grabber

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.540 
and you still have your camera grabber
so<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.380> can<00:02:34.500> still<00:02:34.650> use<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.100> stuff<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so you can still use that and stuff and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.240 
so you can still use that and stuff and
but<00:02:36.330> yeah<00:02:36.510> really<00:02:36.780> nice<00:02:36.990> little<00:02:37.590> slide<00:02:38.130> to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
but yeah really nice little slide to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.400 
but yeah really nice little slide to
unlock<00:02:38.340> there<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.110> lives<00:02:40.260> up<00:02:40.350> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
unlock there and I think it lives up to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.010 
unlock there and I think it lives up to
its<00:02:40.650> minimalistic<00:02:40.950> name<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:42.570> last<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:42.870> not

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
its minimalistic name and last but not

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.360 
its minimalistic name and last but not
least<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:43.560> walked<00:02:43.740> got<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> status<00:02:44.310> bar

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
least we just walked got the status bar

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.190 
least we just walked got the status bar
so<00:02:44.700> you've<00:02:44.820> got<00:02:44.940> some<00:02:45.150> custom<00:02:45.510> icons<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.020> that

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
so you've got some custom icons for that

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.560
