they weigh much more than when you were
to<00:02:07.420> measure<00:02:07.570> them<00:02:07.929> out<00:02:08.050> at<00:02:08.200> home<00:02:08.410> which<00:02:08.950> we

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
to measure them out at home which we

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.380 
to measure them out at home which we
always<00:02:09.310> use<00:02:09.670> dry<00:02:10.090> uncooked<00:02:11.050> weight<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:12.390> here's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
always use dry uncooked weight so here's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.870 
always use dry uncooked weight so here's
how<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:13.600> get<00:02:13.810> started<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:15.160> typically<00:02:15.580> when<00:02:15.790> we

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
how we get started so typically when we

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.270 
how we get started so typically when we
cook<00:02:16.480> brown<00:02:16.930> rice<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.590> weigh<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.070> we

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
cook brown rice we weigh it out we

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.940 
cook brown rice we weigh it out we
measure<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.940> typical<00:02:19.780> meal<00:02:20.140> would<00:02:20.500> probably

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
measure it a typical meal would probably

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.390 
measure it a typical meal would probably
get<00:02:21.130> between<00:02:21.460> 40<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.060> 50<00:02:22.360> grams<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:23.400> uncooked

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
get between 40 to 50 grams of uncooked

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.059 
get between 40 to 50 grams of uncooked
brown<00:02:24.670> rice<00:02:24.880> therefore<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.510> would<00:02:25.630> give<00:02:25.780> us

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
brown rice therefore that would give us

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.339 
brown rice therefore that would give us
about<00:02:27.069> 40<00:02:27.640> grams<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.300> carbohydrate<00:02:28.959> which<00:02:29.110> for

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
about 40 grams of carbohydrate which for

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.559 
about 40 grams of carbohydrate which for
typical<00:02:29.739> day's<00:02:30.340> meal<00:02:30.730> especially<00:02:31.030> if<00:02:31.480> you're

that<00:03:03.640> let's<00:03:03.910> assume<00:03:04.210> this<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.420> our<00:03:04.720> dinner

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
that let's assume this is our dinner

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.380 
that let's assume this is our dinner
plate<00:03:05.230> here<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:08.590> would<00:03:08.770> be<00:03:08.920> about<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.580> serving

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
plate here that would be about a serving

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.380 
plate here that would be about a serving
size<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:10.960> would<00:03:11.080> get<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.920> restaurant

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
size that you would get in a restaurant

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.790 
size that you would get in a restaurant
so<00:03:13.390> about<00:03:13.600> just<00:03:13.960> under<00:03:14.140> 50<00:03:14.440> grams<00:03:14.620> of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
so about just under 50 grams of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.100 
so about just under 50 grams of
carbohydrates<00:03:15.370> there<00:03:15.610> this<00:03:16.240> is<00:03:16.450> also<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.810> great

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
carbohydrates there this is also a great

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.230 
carbohydrates there this is also a great
way<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.410> as<00:03:17.830> you're<00:03:18.130> preparing<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.790> typical

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
way that as you're preparing a typical

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.410 
way that as you're preparing a typical
meal<00:03:19.420> use<00:03:20.320> something<00:03:20.800> around<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.550> bowl<00:03:22.120> a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
meal use something around you a bowl a

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.170 
meal use something around you a bowl a
plate<00:03:22.830> your<00:03:23.830> fist<00:03:24.160> for<00:03:24.310> example<00:03:24.760> when<00:03:24.880> cooking

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
plate your fist for example when cooking

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.510 
plate your fist for example when cooking
protein<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.840> something<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:26.800> regular<00:03:27.310> cup

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
protein and something like a regular cup

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.850 
protein and something like a regular cup
and<00:03:28.300> if<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.480> were<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.690> weigh<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.290> dry<00:03:29.620> weight

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
and if you were to weigh the dry weight

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.980 
and if you were to weigh the dry weight
out<00:03:30.100> of<00:03:30.310> brown<00:03:30.760> rice<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.270> see<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.810> comes

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
out of brown rice and see that it comes

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.410 
out of brown rice and see that it comes
up<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.260> here<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.740> weighs<00:03:32.920> 40<00:03:33.250> grams<00:03:33.490> cook

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
up to here and it weighs 40 grams cook

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.960 
up to here and it weighs 40 grams cook
that<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:35.290> soon<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.740> our<00:03:36.040> cooked<00:03:36.340> brown

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
that so soon this is our cooked brown

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.650 
that so soon this is our cooked brown
rice<00:03:37.470> find<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.800> unit<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.760> measure<00:03:40.000> whether<00:03:40.420> it's

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
rice find a unit of measure whether it's

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.240 
rice find a unit of measure whether it's
about<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.170> size<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.560> your<00:03:41.620> hand<00:03:41.980> with<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
about the size of your hand with the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.220 
about the size of your hand with the
thumb<00:03:42.370> tucked<00:03:42.760> under<00:03:43.120> whether<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.960> would<00:03:44.110> be

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
thumb tucked under whether it would be

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.650 
thumb tucked under whether it would be
about<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.590> size<00:03:44.800> of<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.340> cup<00:03:45.820> full<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.300> that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
about the size of a cup full of that

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.660 
about the size of a cup full of that
cooked<00:03:46.990> brown<00:03:47.200> rice<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:48.160> gives<00:03:48.460> you<00:03:48.610> a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
cooked brown rice this gives you a

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.750 
cooked brown rice this gives you a
really<00:03:49.150> good<00:03:49.180> kind<00:03:49.660> of<00:03:50.400> point<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.550> reference

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
really good kind of point of reference

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.670 
really good kind of point of reference
to<00:03:52.120> then<00:03:52.330> if<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.630> see<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.960> on<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.110> plate<00:03:53.410> you

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
to then if you see that on a plate you

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.120 
to then if you see that on a plate you
know<00:03:54.580> that's<00:03:54.820> about<00:03:55.030> right<00:03:55.390> for<00:03:55.570> your<00:03:55.690> portion

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
know that's about right for your portion

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.650 
know that's about right for your portion
obviously<00:03:57.130> if<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.370> was<00:03:57.490> half<00:03:57.700> that<00:03:57.910> or<00:03:58.150> more

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
obviously if it was half that or more

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.720 
obviously if it was half that or more
you<00:03:59.230> can<00:03:59.380> kind<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.680> get<00:03:59.800> a<00:03:59.830> feel<00:04:00.070> for<00:04:00.100> with<00:04:00.490> all

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
you can kind of get a feel for with all

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.400 
you can kind of get a feel for with all
of<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:00.970> fit<00:04:01.300> in<00:04:01.450> this<00:04:01.630> cup<00:04:01.960> would<00:04:02.230> there<00:04:02.380> be

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
of that fit in this cup would there be

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.890 
of that fit in this cup would there be
some<00:04:02.740> left<00:04:02.950> over<00:04:03.280> not<00:04:03.850> enough<00:04:04.120> therefore<00:04:04.630> you

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
some left over not enough therefore you

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.740 
some left over not enough therefore you
can<00:04:05.190> work<00:04:06.190> backwards<00:04:06.760> or<00:04:06.940> forwards<00:04:07.360> based<00:04:07.570> on

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
can work backwards or forwards based on

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.920 
can work backwards or forwards based on
a<00:04:07.930> typical<00:04:08.170> serving<00:04:09.240> so<00:04:10.240> that's<00:04:10.450> brown<00:04:10.690> rice

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930

light for me I probably want an extra
50%<00:04:44.050> but<00:04:44.620> if<00:04:44.710> we<00:04:44.830> put<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.130> on<00:04:45.370> our<00:04:45.520> plate

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
50% but if we put this on our plate

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.270 
50% but if we put this on our plate
again<00:04:46.810> as<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.080> point<00:04:47.350> of<00:04:47.440> reference<00:04:50.130> us<00:04:51.130> it

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
again as a point of reference us it

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.740 
again as a point of reference us it
actually<00:04:51.400> loses<00:04:51.820> some<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.300> weight<00:04:52.450> once

it's<00:04:52.960> cooked<00:04:53.340> we<00:04:54.340> can<00:04:54.490> see<00:04:54.670> that<00:04:54.850> if<00:04:54.940> this<00:04:55.060> were

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
it's cooked we can see that if this were

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
of fat's in there it's not necessary so

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.870 
of fat's in there it's not necessary so
we<00:05:11.470> have<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.620> couple<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:12.100> brown<00:05:12.250> rice<00:05:12.460> there<00:05:12.700> we

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
we have a couple of brown rice there we

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.150 
we have a couple of brown rice there we
have<00:05:13.030> about<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.270> handful<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:13.990> our<00:05:14.680> protein

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
have about a handful of our protein

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.390 
have about a handful of our protein
there<00:05:15.400> when<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.120> comes<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.540> veg<00:05:16.890> this<00:05:17.890> one's<00:05:18.130> a

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
there when it comes to veg this one's a

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.750 
there when it comes to veg this one's a
no-brainer<00:05:19.860> basically<00:05:20.860> load<00:05:21.190> your<00:05:21.340> plate<00:05:21.550> up

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
no-brainer basically load your plate up

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.180 
no-brainer basically load your plate up
on<00:05:21.910> this<00:05:22.060> my<00:05:22.750> rule<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:22.990> thumb<00:05:23.290> is<00:05:23.560> always<00:05:24.010> make

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
on this my rule of thumb is always make

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.780 
on this my rule of thumb is always make
sure<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.580> have<00:05:24.790> a<00:05:25.090> good<00:05:25.750> bowl<00:05:26.200> full<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.790> either

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
sure you have a good bowl full of either

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.740 
sure you have a good bowl full of either
cooked<00:05:28.210> greens<00:05:28.540> salad<00:05:29.440> anything<00:05:30.340> green<00:05:30.750> but

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
cooked greens salad anything green but

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.750 
cooked greens salad anything green but
unless<00:05:32.020> your<00:05:32.200> plate<00:05:32.500> has<00:05:32.740> got<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.040> hefty<00:05:33.580> load

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
of greens on it it's not going to have

of greens there that's our ball for can

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.270 
of greens there that's our ball for can
see<00:05:41.440> our<00:05:41.560> plate<00:05:41.800> is<00:05:42.040> loaded<00:05:42.790> up<00:05:42.910> with<00:05:43.450> greens

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
see our plate is loaded up with greens

one<00:05:45.280> thing<00:05:45.520> this<00:05:45.790> really<00:05:46.300> does<00:05:46.680> first<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.860> all

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950

that extra roughage the extra bulk there

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.710 
that extra roughage the extra bulk there
is<00:05:50.830> low<00:05:51.250> calorie<00:05:51.700> it's<00:05:51.910> also<00:05:52.060> going<00:05:52.390> to<00:05:52.450> slow

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
is low calorie it's also going to slow

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.410 
is low calorie it's also going to slow
down<00:05:52.750> any<00:05:53.170> of<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.590> let's<00:05:54.340> say<00:05:54.520> unhealthy<00:05:55.120> fats
