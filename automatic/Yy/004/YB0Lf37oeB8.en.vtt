00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
existing wires got the hole cut dry

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.450 
existing wires got the hole cut dry
fitted<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.199> panel<00:04:47.650> made<00:04:47.860> sure<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.100> was<00:04:48.310> going

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
fitted the panel made sure it was going

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.900 
fitted the panel made sure it was going
to<00:04:48.550> fit<00:04:50.100> fit<00:04:51.100> perfectly

thanks<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.449> my<00:04:52.600> template<00:04:53.400> then<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.430> did<00:04:54.669> a

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
thanks to my template then I did a

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.150 
thanks to my template then I did a
little<00:04:54.970> cleanup<00:04:55.210> work<00:04:55.599> next<00:04:56.349> I<00:04:56.590> prepared<00:04:57.009> the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
little cleanup work next I prepared the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.520 
little cleanup work next I prepared the
wires<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.820> attach<00:04:58.150> them<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.750> new<00:04:58.900> panel<00:04:59.349> I

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
wires to attach them to the new panel I

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.310 
wires to attach them to the new panel I
like<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.490> use<00:05:00.639> these<00:05:00.849> eye<00:05:00.910> inlets<00:05:01.660> rather<00:05:02.020> than

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
like to use these eye inlets rather than

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.839 
like to use these eye inlets rather than
just<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.949> open<00:05:03.340> end<00:05:03.550> one<00:05:03.759> here<00:05:05.610> sure<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.729> get

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
just the open end one here sure you get

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.930 
just the open end one here sure you get
the<00:05:06.970> wires<00:05:07.180> twisted<00:05:07.539> I<00:05:08.729> added<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:10.590> eyelet<00:05:11.940> and

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
the wires twisted I added the eyelet and

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.189 
the wires twisted I added the eyelet and
I<00:05:13.060> could<00:05:13.270> have<00:05:13.360> used<00:05:13.509> a<00:05:13.690> little<00:05:13.720> better

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
I could have used a little better

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.159 
I could have used a little better
crimper<00:05:15.160> here<00:05:15.400> but<00:05:15.550> give<00:05:15.970> this<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.360> good<00:05:16.660> solid

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
crimper here but give this a good solid

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.600 
crimper here but give this a good solid
crimp<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:19.620> test<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.860> make<00:05:21.070> sure<00:05:21.099> it's<00:05:21.490> going

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
crimp and test it make sure it's going

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.430 
crimp and test it make sure it's going
to<00:05:21.699> state<00:05:22.030> see<00:05:22.780> look<00:05:22.990> at<00:05:23.080> this

to state see look at this

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.860 
to state see look at this
I<00:05:23.470> didn't<00:05:24.160> crimp<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.550> tight<00:05:24.759> enough<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.750> don't

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
I didn't crimp it tight enough you don't

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.689 
I didn't crimp it tight enough you don't
want<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.470> happen<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.919> your<00:05:27.039> wires<00:05:27.340> while

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
want that to happen to your wires while

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.279 
want that to happen to your wires while
you're<00:05:27.880> out<00:05:28.000> sailing<00:05:28.360> around<00:05:28.870> or<00:05:29.080> boating

now it's nice about this as you'll see
that<00:06:04.399> the<00:06:05.050> breakers<00:06:06.050> all<00:06:06.349> come<00:06:06.649> pre-wired<00:06:07.009> to

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
that the breakers all come pre-wired to

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.570 
that the breakers all come pre-wired to
the<00:06:08.089> main<00:06:08.409> so<00:06:09.409> you<00:06:09.469> really<00:06:09.949> you<00:06:09.979> just<00:06:10.189> have<00:06:10.309> to

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
the main so you really you just have to

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.939 
the main so you really you just have to
hook<00:06:10.729> up<00:06:10.909> the<00:06:11.089> main<00:06:11.300> wires<00:06:11.659> the<00:06:12.289> black<00:06:12.559> and<00:06:12.860> the
