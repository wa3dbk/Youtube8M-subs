00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello cool people I hope you know 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.520
 find very well on this occasion 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 let's talk about a new movie of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.460
 Adam Sandler is about shoemaker to your 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.700
 shoes I wish he did this 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700
 as well 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.450
 in this movie the reader adam sandler 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.970
 interprets the role of a shoemaker who 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.529
 lives in a neighborhood which is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.930
 point of disappearing because it's going to be 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.199
 acquired by a corporation for 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.550
 build there are luxury buildings and it's going to 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.379
 be in this situation when it's going to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.449
 run into the character of Carmen who 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.400
 is fighting for the rights of 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.129
 neighborhood so they do not destroy that 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.989
 place and then this shoemaker is going to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.150
 realize that he has the ability to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 every time he wears the shoes of another 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.710
 person becomes this other 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 person which supposedly should 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.620
 start developing situations 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 comical and in fact there are many 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 situations there are many scenarios in the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.900
 which could have been used to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.180
 that the thing really was fun and 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.350
 it was funny but what happens here is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 that situations return 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 so outrageously predictable 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 when we already know what is going to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.190
 spend what is channeled the characters 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.020
 what is going to happen to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.450
 continuation as it is ruined the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 thing and it's not funny at all 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 truth I'm not exaggerating but linking 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.420
 in which I was in which I saw this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.189
 movie 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.270
 the people around me it was 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.159
 laughing at the things that were happening 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.860
 and it happens also because the characters 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.119
 they are excessively stereotyped is 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.600
 say that they are awarded 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.180
 personalities too clichés things and 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.009
 they always follow that same line 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.110
 always the same character is always 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.899
 the same stereotype have no more tones 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.970
 but it's always green and green it 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.710
 it remains and it is not green it is a green one of 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.689
 soon it even gives the feeling that the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.789
 same adam sandler had as a pre 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.729
 Lazy to record the movie or something 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.170
 since things just happen and they happen 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.909
 like the character does not really know 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.130
 motivated but that nothing else 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.259
 are happening like this on the other hand in the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.060
 dessert appears the actor dustin hoffman 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.700
 which is one of the biggest lies 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.619
 of 2015 as he is an actor only 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.539
 appears as 5 minutes in the movie 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.069
 so if you like them a lot 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.650
 they inform them and they create to see that movie 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.940
 for this actor better not see it because 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.440
 really nothing comes out of the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.940
 movie and what is very strange is that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.980
 It also seems that he wanted to give a 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.490
 ambience and a musicalization to 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.100
 style of the french movie of amélie 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.990
 but as I say try really 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.030
 it did not work very well and good basically 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.920
 for this reason it results only in being 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.870
 a movie to watch while one is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.850
 ironing or listening while you're 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.690
 bathing or when you're doing homework 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.400
 or something like that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.350
 and it really does not cost me any attention and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.060
 only suddenly you want to laugh 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.400
 some other moment that gave me 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.610
 it's fun and that's why this 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.360
 movie I give a star and a half 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.280
 tenth 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.230
 if you take a plane or you thought of going to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.150
 see tell me what the price is and if they have 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.980
 one which survives the actor's favorite 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.810
 adam sandler from hama that low in the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.550
