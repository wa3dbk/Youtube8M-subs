exactly<00:00:12.870> does<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.469> well<00:00:14.160> let's<00:00:14.610> actually

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
exactly does it do well let's actually

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.529 
exactly does it do well let's actually
take<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> look<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.960> gizmo<00:00:16.289> itself<00:00:20.449> on<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
take a look at the gizmo itself on the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.179 
take a look at the gizmo itself on the
surface<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:22.140> doesn't<00:00:22.289> really<00:00:22.529> look<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:22.800> much

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
surface it doesn't really look like much

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.029 
surface it doesn't really look like much
it's<00:00:23.609> basically<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.600> black<00:00:25.320> plastic

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it's basically this little black plastic

it's basically this little black plastic
geodesic<00:00:26.970> sphere<00:00:27.380> it<00:00:28.380> does<00:00:28.710> work<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
geodesic sphere it does work as a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
geodesic sphere it does work as a
charging<00:00:30.060> dock<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.750> hook<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
charging dock you can hook it up to a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
charging dock you can hook it up to a
power<00:00:31.890> supply<00:00:32.009> or<00:00:32.640> your<00:00:33.090> computer<00:00:33.600> via<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.899> USB

power supply or your computer via a USB
cable<00:00:34.850> but<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.180> real<00:00:36.630> magic<00:00:37.140> occurs<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
cable but the real magic occurs with the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.450 
cable but the real magic occurs with the
free<00:00:39.270> app<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.870> comes<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.129> we're

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
free app that comes with this and we're

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.209 
free app that comes with this and we're
going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> demonstrate<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> app<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.809> now

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
going to demonstrate that app right now

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.490 
going to demonstrate that app right now
the<00:00:44.219> app<00:00:44.399> itself<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.270> pretty<00:00:45.840> basic

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the app itself is pretty basic

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.049 
the app itself is pretty basic
if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.890> hit<00:00:47.100> play<00:00:49.309> what<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> nice

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if you hit play what you get is a nice

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.369 
if you hit play what you get is a nice
little<00:00:51.120> psychedelic<00:00:51.989> light<00:00:52.170> show<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:54.379> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
little psychedelic light show and the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.569 
little psychedelic light show and the
psychedelic<00:00:55.710> light<00:00:55.949> show

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
psychedelic light show

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
psychedelic light show
as<00:00:56.640> you'll<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.270> later<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:58.680> respond

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
as you'll see later actually can respond

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
as you'll see later actually can respond
to<00:00:59.750> voice<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.079> also<00:01:02.090> physical<00:01:03.090> impact<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to voice and also physical impact on the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.179 
to voice and also physical impact on the
sphere<00:01:06.439> so<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> variety<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sphere so you have a variety of

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.530 
sphere so you have a variety of
different<00:01:08.400> effects<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.330> play

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
different effects that you can play

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.649 
different effects that you can play
around<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:10.490> there's<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.000> sleep<00:01:12.360> mode

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
around with there's also a sleep mode

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
around with there's also a sleep mode
that<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.950> sleep<00:01:14.520> with

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that you can actually go to sleep with

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.870 
that you can actually go to sleep with
this<00:01:14.939> effect<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.830> there's<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.100> wake<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.700> mode

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this effect going there's a wake up mode

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080 
this effect going there's a wake up mode
available<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.130> add<00:01:20.549> IM

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
available and you can also add IM

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.600 
available and you can also add IM
account<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.750> it'll<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.110> creat<00:01:22.920> start

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
account so it'll actually creat start

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.820 
account so it'll actually creat start
playing<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> different<00:01:24.450> effect<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.049> somebody

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
playing a different effect if somebody

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.240 
playing a different effect if somebody
sends<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> message<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.200> itself<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sends you a message so in of itself the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.020 
sends you a message so in of itself the
app<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.380> fantastic<00:01:32.100> but

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
app is really not that fantastic but

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
app is really not that fantastic but
this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:33.990> where<00:01:34.320> we're<00:01:34.500> gonna<00:01:34.590> actually

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this is now where we're gonna actually

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.590 
this is now where we're gonna actually
put<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.250> together<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> sphere<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
put it together with the sphere and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.800 
put it together with the sphere and
you'll<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.829> entire<00:01:38.220> effect<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.659> it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you'll see the entire effect so it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.140 
you'll see the entire effect so it's
ready<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> play<00:01:40.320> we're<00:01:40.829> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.310> plug<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
ready to play we're going to plug the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
ready to play we're going to plug the
unit<00:01:42.329> into<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> dock<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.610> now<00:01:44.610> we're<00:01:44.729> going

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
unit into the dock and now we're going

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
unit into the dock and now we're going
to<00:01:44.880> start<00:01:45.090> turning<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:45.659> lights<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to start turning out our lights and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:55.830 
to start turning out our lights and
we'll<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.700> effect<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.270> motion

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.440 

change

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.590 

change

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 

as<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.530> every<00:02:07.830> time<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.190> speak<00:02:08.340> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
as you can see every time we speak it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.990 
as you can see every time we speak it
changes<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.720> pattern<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:13.550> also<00:02:14.550> every<00:02:14.970> time

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
changes the pattern and also every time

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.449 
changes the pattern and also every time
we<00:02:15.569> strike<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.739> patterns<00:02:20.100> going<00:02:20.340> to

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
we strike it the patterns going to

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:36.870 
we strike it the patterns going to
change

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.010 

so<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.540> question<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.350> this<00:02:38.920> really<00:02:39.370> worth

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
so the question is is this really worth

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.340 
so the question is is this really worth
$79<00:02:42.390> something<00:02:43.390> like<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.110> kind

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
$79 something like this is really kind

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.780 
$79 something like this is really kind
of<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.590> rudimentary<00:02:45.570> approach<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:47.460> this<00:02:48.460> kind

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
of a rudimentary approach to this kind

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.160 
of a rudimentary approach to this kind
of<00:02:48.880> visual<00:02:50.250> ambient<00:02:51.250> effect<00:02:51.990> what<00:02:52.990> we're

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
of visual ambient effect what we're

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.600 
of visual ambient effect what we're
hoping<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.890> somewhere<00:02:54.190> down<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.580> line

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
hoping is that somewhere down the line

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.910 
hoping is that somewhere down the line
people<00:02:55.060> will<00:02:55.300> be<00:02:55.450> able<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.840> do<00:02:55.930> more<00:02:56.350> with<00:02:56.740> this

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
people will be able to do more with this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.900 
people will be able to do more with this
type<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.250> program<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.900> type<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.550> dock<00:03:00.550> this

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
type of program this type of dock this

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.540 
type of program this type of dock this
type<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.210> environment<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.560> but<00:03:03.100> we<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
type of environment so but we like the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.640 
type of environment so but we like the
idea<00:03:03.580> of<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:04.090> there's<00:03:04.300> definitely<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.050> cool

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
idea of it there's definitely a cool

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.580 
idea of it there's definitely a cool
factor<00:03:06.250> involved<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.330> goes<00:03:07.690> beyond<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
factor involved that goes beyond the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.720 
factor involved that goes beyond the
cost<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.780> know<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.260> rudimentary

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
cost and the you know the rudimentary

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.190 
cost and the you know the rudimentary
design<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> as<00:03:15.070> far<00:03:15.310> as<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:16.060> rating<00:03:16.750> goes<00:03:16.930> we

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
design so as far as a rating goes we

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.860 
design so as far as a rating goes we
just<00:03:17.560> have<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.040> give<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.520> five<00:03:18.970> based<00:03:19.600> on

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
just have to give it a five based on

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.570 
just have to give it a five based on
cool<00:03:20.350> alone<00:03:21.660> price<00:03:22.660> mash<00:03:22.960> phone<00:03:23.260> comm<00:03:23.830> I'm<00:03:24.010> dr.
