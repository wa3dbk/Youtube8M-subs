platform that being said this time

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.090 
platform that being said this time
around<00:00:59.460> they've<00:00:59.580> also<00:00:59.880> added<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.830> DSD<00:01:01.830> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
around they've also added on DSD and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.719 
around they've also added on DSD and
double<00:01:02.550> D<00:01:02.700> STD<00:01:03.500> decoding<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:05.129> computer

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
double D STD decoding from your computer

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
double D STD decoding from your computer
so<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.509> have<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> computer<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.530> a

so if you have a computer and you have a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.670 
so if you have a computer and you have a
DSD<00:01:08.130> collection<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:08.759> is<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> very<00:01:09.240> typical

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
DSD collection which is a very typical

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.880

like<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.670> use<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.120> products

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
like to see and use it in the products

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
like to see and use it in the products
it's<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.290> typical<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.160> files

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it's not so typical in that the files

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's not so typical in that the files
are<00:01:17.580> actually<00:01:17.760> quite<00:01:18.090> hard<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> find<00:01:18.780> very<00:01:19.560> few

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
are actually quite hard to find very few

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
are actually quite hard to find very few
tracks<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.460> actually<00:01:20.760> offered<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.270> DSD<00:01:21.810> but

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
tracks are actually offered in DSD but

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
tracks are actually offered in DSD but
it's<00:01:23.370> something<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> guys

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
stuff set out there but you might not

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.650

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
follow as far as the way this particular

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.930 
follow as far as the way this particular
device<00:03:49.329> sounds<00:03:50.200> it's<00:03:50.950> not<00:03:51.130> bad<00:03:51.519> at<00:03:51.730> all

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
device sounds it's not bad at all

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.449 
device sounds it's not bad at all
actually<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.660> found<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.200> be<00:03:53.230> very<00:03:53.709> nice<00:03:54.220> and

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
actually I found it to be very nice and

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.130 
actually I found it to be very nice and
even<00:03:54.850> through<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.090> frequency<00:03:55.690> range

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
even through the frequency range

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.080 
even through the frequency range
there's<00:03:56.410> no<00:03:56.709> bloated<00:03:57.130> bass<00:03:57.280> there<00:03:57.519> is<00:03:57.610> not<00:03:57.850> an

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
there's no bloated bass there is not an

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.680 
there's no bloated bass there is not an
external<00:03:58.480> bass<00:03:59.140> booster<00:03:59.620> or<00:03:59.980> or<00:04:00.489> treble<00:04:01.450> boost

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
external bass booster or or treble boost

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.569 
external bass booster or or treble boost
in<00:04:01.900> this<00:04:02.110> case<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.829> also<00:04:03.100> there<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.370> not<00:04:03.549> a

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
in this case and also there is not a

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.280 
in this case and also there is not a
gain<00:04:03.940> switch<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:04.510> those<00:04:04.690> looking<00:04:04.959> for<00:04:04.989> really

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
gain switch so those looking for really

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.930 
gain switch so those looking for really
hard<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.590> drive<00:04:05.709> headphones<00:04:06.130> this<00:04:06.519> one<00:04:06.760> might

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
hard to drive headphones this one might

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.580 
hard to drive headphones this one might
not<00:04:07.090> work<00:04:07.269> out<00:04:07.480> but<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.750> did<00:04:08.049> get<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.380> work

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
not work out but I did get it to work

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.949 
not work out but I did get it to work
fine<00:04:08.890> within<00:04:09.280> your<00:04:09.459> monitors<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.120> regular

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
fine within your monitors and regular

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.259 
fine within your monitors and regular
I'd<00:04:11.500> say<00:04:11.709> regular<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:12.370> average<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:13.000> drive

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
I'd say regular but average to drive

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.219 
I'd say regular but average to drive
headphones<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:17.019> situation

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
headphones so and that in that situation

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.230 
headphones so and that in that situation
it's<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.950> kind<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.190> works<00:04:18.400> well<00:04:19.739> but<00:04:20.739> just<00:04:21.519> back

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
it's it kind of works well but just back

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.700 
it's it kind of works well but just back
to<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.419> general<00:04:22.900> south<00:04:23.140> so<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.500> frequency

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
to the general south so the frequency

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.370 
to the general south so the frequency
range<00:04:24.220> kind<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.120> nice<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.690> even<00:04:25.840> across

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
range kind of is nice and even across
