00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 nice guys like minchione here we are again 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.819
 here today with this new video on one 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.350
 mod 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.469
 today we're going to talk about the element 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.170
 to the rus for the 1.3.2 then 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.779
 the elementary in Rome goes to add this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.960
 new type of bow that you do with 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.990
 diamond is practically this bow 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.970
 even if I get back to any part 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.579
 andrea facco to practically take the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.820
 mob closer to us for example the se 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.980
 let me see if I look down there look 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.989
 now heaven and chicken if even less go 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.030
 down the arrow will go to the chicken 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.219
 because I told you I can do the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.579
 360 degree turn however it will take 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 always the closest animal here is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.820
 you have seen very useful this year is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.480
 a lot we say for the aim 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.280
 in case 1 is wrong to admire 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.940
 practically the arrow will go on the web from 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.489
 one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.470
 works on poles on any type of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.290
 fashion even on clipper skeletons 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.820
 andermann etc. ok then we have 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.450
 from the arc this fashion adds to us 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.619
 types of lees we have an explosive to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 because that practically by nine I believe 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.430
 you understand what it does practically if we 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.700
 let's go without the turn with this arc 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.829
 here you have been able to see but it doesn't make it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.140
 made team then we do it is rare 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:45.570
 that makes you catch fire 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.430
 we have liza rom that serves ice 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.590
 we can use both to extinguish the fire 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.119
 both to freeze the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.259
 the sea here is what is double then we have 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.090
 the garros not only if I know that though 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.649
 I do n't think it's big crap 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.880
 this is physically 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:11.129
 virtually every arrow we visco 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.970
 that oar will give birth to a chicken well 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.920
 well wish guys will 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.440
 ok then we have the last arrow that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.209
 light ict line 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.569
 I don't know how the kids say in 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.599
 English is really worth the pain 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.120
 same utility practically as you do 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.310
 rom 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.950
 here is just that it will do more than a fire 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:40.230
 will hit virtually all the mobs 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.489
 surrounding well there is nothing else to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.120
 say now I'll show you 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.640
 practically how to install this mod 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.700
 ok raga allow the elementary harold e 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.540
 maude we need fashion in 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.709
 module of the 3 2 zip files in the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.180

 that we have entered this folder 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.580
 you'll have to practically eliminate the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.760
