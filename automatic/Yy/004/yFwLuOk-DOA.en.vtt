00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the legend back to our tip of 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.870
 workshop that makes you save a lot on 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.240
 change of tires in the maintenance of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:21.050
 light bulbs and also the system of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 brakes alignment balancing on it one 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.880
 relatively simple service which can be 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.490
 mean a lot to your vehicle 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 we are talking about alignment and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 balancing 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.680
 But let's take it slow and by stages. 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.379
 Let's first explain what each 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.540
 procedure to begin alignment 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.450
 alignment would check 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.230
 geometry will check for wear on the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 tire 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 - he is positive negative is 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 convergent emergency 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.180
 now yes we are going to balancing a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.250
 balancing, he distributed weight of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.489
 wheel / tire set distribute 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.549
 it evenly when the state and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.869
 balanced it tends to also harm 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.500
 the tire life 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.570
 he wore the uniform the weight of the set 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.450
 these two services are always in 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.490
 and in most cases one and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.640
 defend from the other 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.909
 the mere fact of falling into a hole in the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 for example can bring 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.619
 consequences for the car and it is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.439
 always be aware when the car 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.930
 to show signs of stopping 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.110
 to perform the service balancing 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.049
 it would be vibration in the steering wheel you sit 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.659
 finished speeds that it vibrates right 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.130
 and the alignment understand the pull to a 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.159
 side or other 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.500
 there would have to check these expenses worth 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.960
 also remember that in some cases the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 driver can not identify the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.570
 problem in the car being so ideal 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.189
 always and prevent every 10,000 km 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.320
 would be interested in a verification 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.780
 preventive since we have a lot of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.070
 many situations that can 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.509
 to draw the car 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.450
 the price of these services vary more 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.879
 costs on average 30 reais each 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.370
 to perform the alignment and 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:20.299
 balance of the car costs about 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.890
 $ 60 a small course to maintain a good 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.890
 your vehicle
