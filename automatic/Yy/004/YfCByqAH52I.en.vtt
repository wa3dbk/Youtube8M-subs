00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
itself is not very sweet looking but who

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.400 
itself is not very sweet looking but who
cares<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> box<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.290> probably<00:00:34.290> most

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
cares about the box right probably most

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.540 
cares about the box right probably most
of<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.649> probably<00:00:34.739> picking<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.340> online

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
of you probably picking this up online

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.400 
of you probably picking this up online
anyway<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.809> doesn't<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.140> matter

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
anyway so it doesn't really matter

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.660 
anyway so it doesn't really matter
although<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.370> lots<00:00:38.520> of

although I think there's lots of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
although I think there's lots of
information<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> product<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.590> box

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it into fans if you can see here they

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.399 
it into fans if you can see here they
have<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.570> two<00:01:25.290> pin<00:01:26.220> connections<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
have these two pin connections on the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
of connections on the inside which is

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
of connections on the inside which is
fine<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.479> typical<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.170> fan

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
fine that's very typical for fan

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.660 
fine that's very typical for fan
controllers<00:01:35.400> these<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:37.140> fit<00:01:37.409> three<00:01:38.100> pin

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
controllers these actually fit three pin

controllers these actually fit three pin
fans<00:01:39.119> you've<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.930> black<00:01:40.229> mesh<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
fans you've got black mesh here on the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.690 
fans you've got black mesh here on the
front<00:01:41.850> most<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> though<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.340> plastic<00:01:44.340> again

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
front most of it though is plastic again

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.260 
front most of it though is plastic again
you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.030> control<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.750> five<00:01:46.500> fans<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.670> note

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you can control up to five fans and note

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.130 
you can control up to five fans and note
the<00:01:48.899> easy<00:01:49.520> sliders<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.329> really

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the easy sliders that they have really

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
the easy sliders that they have really
good<00:01:52.350> control<00:01:52.740> over<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> fan<00:01:53.520> using<00:01:53.970> these

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
good control over the fan using these

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.999 
good control over the fan using these
sliders<00:01:54.570> instead<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> knobs<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.890> be

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
sliders instead of knobs and to be

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.950 
sliders instead of knobs and to be
honest<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.240> sliders<00:01:57.630> look

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
honest I think of these sliders look

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.020 
honest I think of these sliders look
much<00:01:58.530> cooler<00:01:58.979> than<00:01:59.310> having<00:01:59.610> these<00:01:59.729> large

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
much cooler than having these large

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
much cooler than having these large
knobs<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.380> front<00:02:01.619> which<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.920> will<00:02:02.070> find

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
knobs on the front which you will find

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.020 
knobs on the front which you will find
on<00:02:02.549> most<00:02:03.240> fan<00:02:04.009> controllers<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.219> by<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> way

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
on most fan controllers and by the way

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
on most fan controllers and by the way
each<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.200> these<00:02:07.320> fan<00:02:07.770> controllers<00:02:08.429> can

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
each one of these fan controllers can

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.359 
each one of these fan controllers can
handle

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
handle

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.940 
handle
30<00:02:09.519> watts<00:02:10.450> now<00:02:10.599> this<00:02:10.869> stand<00:02:11.170> controller<00:02:11.590> fits

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
30 watts now this stand controller fits

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.979 
30 watts now this stand controller fits
in<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.250> five<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.849> quarter<00:02:13.090> inch<00:02:13.269> drive<00:02:13.720> bay

in a five and a quarter inch drive bay

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.170 
in a five and a quarter inch drive bay
and<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.650> fine<00:02:15.010> because<00:02:15.220> most<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.849> today's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and that's fine because most of today's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.050 
and that's fine because most of today's
cases<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.170> lots<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.920> five<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.849> quarter

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
cases have lots of five and a quarter

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.320 
cases have lots of five and a quarter
inch<00:02:19.450> drive<00:02:19.750> bays<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.709> days<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.489> many<00:02:21.909> three

and a half inch drive bays well it's

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.770 
and a half inch drive bays well it's
kind<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:24.909> a<00:02:24.940> thing<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.299> past

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780
