directed<00:00:09.719> solar<00:00:09.900> storms<00:00:10.349> now<00:00:10.920> when<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.160> look

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
directed solar storms now when we look

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.400 
directed solar storms now when we look
more<00:00:11.519> closely<00:00:11.670> at<00:00:11.969> those<00:00:12.179> M<00:00:12.389> flares<00:00:12.690> BAM<00:00:13.170> right

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
more closely at those M flares BAM right

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.410 
more closely at those M flares BAM right
there<00:00:13.740> there's<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> m1<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.940> happened<00:00:15.240> late

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
there there's the m1 that happened late

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.560 
there there's the m1 that happened late
on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> 16th<00:00:16.080> from<00:00:16.230> region<00:00:16.500> 20<00:00:16.800> 35<00:00:17.240> now<00:00:18.240> region

on the 16th from region 20 35 now region
2036<00:00:19.199> started<00:00:19.590> becoming<00:00:19.859> more<00:00:20.039> active<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
2036 started becoming more active you

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.740 
2036 started becoming more active you
start<00:00:20.670> seeing<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> flaring<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> little<00:00:21.630> bit

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
start seeing it flaring a little bit

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.509 
start seeing it flaring a little bit
more<00:00:21.900> boom<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> lets<00:00:22.740> off<00:00:22.890> an<00:00:23.010> ejection<00:00:23.310> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
more boom that lets off an ejection and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.700 
more boom that lets off an ejection and
then<00:00:23.640> another<00:00:23.820> BAM<00:00:24.269> right<00:00:24.600> there<00:00:24.990> there's<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
then another BAM right there there's the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.099 
then another BAM right there there's the
7.3<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.880> thing<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.240> huge<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:27.990> in

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
7.3 the thing was huge you can see in

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
7.3 the thing was huge you can see in
the<00:00:28.230> close-up<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> dimming<00:00:29.400> region

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the close-up there is a dimming region

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.880 
the close-up there is a dimming region
as<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:29.970> thing<00:00:30.179> ejection<00:00:30.929> lifts<00:00:31.380> off<00:00:31.500> so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
as this thing ejection lifts off so

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.260 
as this thing ejection lifts off so
there<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.189> an<00:00:32.340> earth<00:00:32.489> word<00:00:32.669> directed<00:00:33.059> solar

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
there is an earth word directed solar

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.389 
there is an earth word directed solar
storm<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:34.530> switching<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.130> flare

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
storm now switching to our flare

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.740 
storm now switching to our flare
indicator<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:36.450> really

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
indicator you can see there really

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
indicator you can see there really
hasn't<00:00:36.960> been<00:00:37.140> much<00:00:37.260> M<00:00:37.620> Flare<00:00:37.950> activity<00:00:37.980> until

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
hasn't been much M Flare activity until

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.389 
hasn't been much M Flare activity until
let<00:00:39.210> em<00:00:39.390> 7.3<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.070> this

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
let em 7.3 and that's because this

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.209 
let em 7.3 and that's because this
region<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.910> growing<00:00:42.480> incredibly<00:00:42.899> rapidly<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
region is growing incredibly rapidly and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.799 
region is growing incredibly rapidly and
when<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.489> actually<00:00:44.670> look<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> blast<00:00:45.510> waves

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
when we actually look at the blast waves

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
when we actually look at the blast waves
coming<00:00:46.050> off<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> Sun<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.579> this

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
coming off of the Sun you can see this

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.459 
coming off of the Sun you can see this
thing<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.969> huge<00:00:48.270> its<00:00:48.510> massive<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.020> live<00:00:49.200> wave

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
thing is huge its massive and live wave

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
thing is huge its massive and live wave
propagates<00:00:50.129> literally<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.969> way<00:00:51.059> across

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
propagates literally all the way across

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.000 
propagates literally all the way across
the<00:00:51.390> surface<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> Sun<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> southern

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the surface of the Sun on the southern

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
the surface of the Sun on the southern
hemisphere<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.059> makes<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
hemisphere so it makes you think that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.000 
hemisphere so it makes you think that
this<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.050> big<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.860> probably

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
this thing is big but that is probably

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
this thing is big but that is probably
going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.579> south<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:57.030> us<00:00:57.149> switching<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
going to go south of us switching to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
going to go south of us switching to
coronagraphs<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.829> see<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.190> solar

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
coronagraphs you can see that solar

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.069 
coronagraphs you can see that solar
storm<00:00:59.789> being<00:01:00.030> blown<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.629> three<00:01:00.840> solar

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
storm being blown out the three solar

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.330 
storm being blown out the three solar
radii<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> looks<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.039> pretty<00:01:02.219> much

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
radii it looks like it's pretty much

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.670 
radii it looks like it's pretty much
going<00:01:02.579> south<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> us<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.570> halo<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.049> marked<00:01:04.589> in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
going south of us the halo is marked in

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.530 
going south of us the halo is marked in
red<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.610> really<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:06.060> much<00:01:06.210> going

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
red here you don't really see much going

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
red here you don't really see much going
to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> north<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.380> here's<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.860> halo<00:01:08.159> again

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to the north now here's that halo again

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
to the north now here's that halo again
but<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.180> switch<00:01:09.450> out<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> 15<00:01:10.229> solar<00:01:10.530> radii

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
but when we switch out to 15 solar radii

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
but when we switch out to 15 solar radii
you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> lot<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you can see there really is a lot of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
you can see there really is a lot of
material<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.049> both<00:01:13.260> north<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.770> south<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
material going both north and south of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
material going both north and south of
us<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.000> looks<00:01:15.150> more<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> direct<00:01:15.900> hit

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
us so this looks more like a direct hit

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
us so this looks more like a direct hit
than<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.470> thought<00:01:16.860> before<00:01:17.210> now

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
than we actually thought before now

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
than we actually thought before now

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
second of which is actually two solar

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
second of which is actually two solar
storms<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.540> merged<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.500> plan<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
storms that have merged so we plan to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.410 
storms that have merged so we plan to
get<00:01:28.979> hit<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.250> three<00:01:29.490> solar<00:01:29.729> storms<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.210> kind

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
get hit by three solar storms and kind

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
get hit by three solar storms and kind
of<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> rapid<00:01:30.930> bubble<00:01:31.229> my<00:01:31.320> muffin<00:01:31.590> succession

of a rapid bubble my muffin succession

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.980 
of a rapid bubble my muffin succession
so<00:01:32.640> expecting<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> hit<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.600> start<00:01:33.869> around

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so expecting the hit to start around

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.469 
so expecting the hit to start around
with<00:01:34.380> Layton<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> 19th<00:01:35.340> into<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> 20th<00:01:36.150> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
with Layton on the 19th into the 20th so

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.960 
with Layton on the 19th into the 20th so
expect<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.049> GPS<00:01:37.670> units<00:01:38.670> will<00:01:38.790> give<00:01:38.880> you

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
see some really new growth that's where

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.699 
see some really new growth that's where
that<00:02:44.220> m<00:02:44.670> 7.3<00:02:45.480> flare<00:02:45.750> occurred<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.290> that's

that m 7.3 flare occurred and that's

that m 7.3 flare occurred and that's
going<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.950> continue<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.430> grow<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.790> probably

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
going to continue to grow and probably

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.539 
going to continue to grow and probably
give<00:02:48.330> us<00:02:48.420> more<00:02:48.599> activity<00:02:49.019> also<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.069> east

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.190 
give us more activity also on the east

with<00:03:13.620> these<00:03:13.799> M<00:03:13.950> flares<00:03:14.250> no<00:03:14.760> one's<00:03:14.970> giving<00:03:15.209> us

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
with these M flares no one's giving us

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.970 
with these M flares no one's giving us
about<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.540> sixty<00:03:15.959> percent<00:03:16.110> chance<00:03:16.500> over<00:03:16.889> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
about a sixty percent chance over the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.500 
about a sixty percent chance over the
next<00:03:17.100> three<00:03:17.340> days<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.700> get<00:03:17.790> em<00:03:18.000> flares<00:03:18.299> and

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
next three days to get em flares and

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270 
next three days to get em flares and
then<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.989> course<00:03:19.230> we've<00:03:19.440> got<00:03:19.590> two<00:03:19.799> new<00:03:19.950> regions

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
then of course we've got two new regions

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.430 
then of course we've got two new regions
that<00:03:20.400> are<00:03:20.459> rotating<00:03:20.940> interview<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.260> those

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
that are rotating interview so those

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.960 
that are rotating interview so those
could<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.650> back<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:23.040> players<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.700> coming

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
could be back to players in the coming

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.879 
could be back to players in the coming
days<00:03:24.090> as<00:03:24.269> well<00:03:24.299> now<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.079> just<00:03:25.109> wanted<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.620> show

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
days as well now I just wanted to show

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.680 
days as well now I just wanted to show
you<00:03:25.950> how<00:03:26.430> fast<00:03:26.880> these<00:03:27.090> regions<00:03:27.540> have<00:03:27.660> been

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
you how fast these regions have been

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.270 
you how fast these regions have been
growing<00:03:28.049> over<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.319> earth<00:03:28.530> disk<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.069> week

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
growing over the earth disk this week

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.610 
growing over the earth disk this week
you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.880> see<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.359> region<00:03:30.630> 20<00:03:30.900> 35<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.560> you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
you can see this is region 20 35 and you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830 
you can see this is region 20 35 and you
can<00:03:31.769> see<00:03:31.920> 23-6<00:03:32.579> beginning<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.970> pop<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.450> all<00:03:33.720> of

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
can see 23-6 beginning to pop and all of

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.030 
can see 23-6 beginning to pop and all of
these<00:03:33.930> little<00:03:34.200> white<00:03:34.380> lightning<00:03:34.889> that's

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
these little white lightning that's

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.280 
these little white lightning that's
electromagnetic<00:03:35.970> energy<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:36.630> feeding<00:03:36.989> back

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
electromagnetic energy it's feeding back

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.289 
electromagnetic energy it's feeding back
and<00:03:37.530> causing<00:03:38.069> these<00:03:38.190> M<00:03:38.430> flares<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.269> is

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
and causing these M flares so this is

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.120 
and causing these M flares so this is
why<00:03:39.540> we're<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.989> have<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.500> sixty<00:03:41.010> percent

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
why we're going to have a sixty percent

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.280 
why we're going to have a sixty percent
chance<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.760> em<00:03:41.940> flares<00:03:42.209> even<00:03:42.840> over<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.049> coming

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
chance of em flares even over the coming

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.750 
chance of em flares even over the coming
days<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.709> as<00:03:43.889> these<00:03:44.069> things<00:03:44.310> continue<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
days and as these things continue to

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.520 
days and as these things continue to
rotate<00:03:45.000> off<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.450> less<00:03:45.600> level<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.380> week

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
rotate off the less level so this week

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.809 
rotate off the less level so this week
looks<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.829> be<00:03:46.920> pretty<00:03:46.950> exciting<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.730> have

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
looks to be pretty exciting we have

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.190 
looks to be pretty exciting we have
multiple<00:03:48.329> solar<00:03:48.569> storms<00:03:48.959> on<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.109> way
