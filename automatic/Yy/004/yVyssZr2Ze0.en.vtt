00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.400
 yes yes here is fishy again and again today 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.840
 a new gameplay here on my channel 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.310
 and in this case it is not a heat or duty 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.779
 for what your genius Jew is the ground 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.820
 of course for most people who have it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.539
 just there I think I recognize 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 of course 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.670
 beds or held three and wanted a paddle 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.570
 I will be sorry your help is going 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.790
 explain of course well as we know 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.630
 we are a bit tired of it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.460
 case with on on call or duty black 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.210
 or two actually sir I would like that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.320
 say 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.060
 of course he plays 3 but 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.920
 We will of course we at a large 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.120
 rejoice missing we rejoice 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.410
 on of course on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.360
 yes the new battlefield game 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.250
 battlefield 4 hence we 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.750
 last night an in between 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.640
 in a small group it was rather first 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.559
 with a robin double start to road here 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.320
 that was already gone here but here of the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.199
 play this for a while with paul gins fr 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 nl and the talking sausage and army 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.960
 Chris too and I'll give you your best 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.369
 nice actually 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 I just have to admit that I am there 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.300
 of course never on commentary 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.560
 made this part 3 so it is lopez 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.630
 I actually help that for one 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.740
 make a commentary but it doesn't matter 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.080
 everything is a first time and why 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.670
 you 're already 3 so once I would 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.020
 you good at just and yes I will too 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.200
 of course just go the new penalty 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.729
 just upload on my channel and so and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.440
 then there you have to be a bit one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.300
 income in the game again because I have it 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.130
 so well i think then look occasionally 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.690
 played Roma Let me just say that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.470
 really not played for more than a year 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.500
 and yes so rates without us would 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.729
 watching the game and yesterday too 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.560
 fun had a day at will correct 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.130
 because I don't really have much anymore 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.390
 I played battlefield 3 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.950
 of course there is also because we just 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.470
 even here 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.909
 calf that are the comet eaters and then yes 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.610
 then you just play alone 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.840
 coffee games and so on 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.659
 a little bit more 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.700
 just a little bit by on you see 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.110
 just a bit more random game 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.329
 so from later also hear so and so 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.160
 Upload I just want something more needed 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.230
 which i also just like to 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.910
 play say 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.709
 well i try to say everything right because i do 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.390
 am a little again and I'm so 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.620
 new in so i am playing hundreds here 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.150
 apk 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.590
 for me it is completely bald 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.720
 because I first had a light could 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.490
 call as it is called such a lamp that is one 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.530
 tree 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.660
 because then they say so hence 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.910
 I just took it off for a while 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.220
 play completely bald and play here 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.290
 that is simply called congrÃ¨s domme nations 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 real pastors and cells as with buy 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.500
 u the game of course just three flags 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.690
 catcher 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.850
 and it is the siba tower folders and that is 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.800
 one of the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.270
 had fun but I think yes I am not 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.410
 so from the very large folders with which you 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.090
 immediately you so 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.000
 goes from one side to the other 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.620
 walk and would and yes that that is 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.900
 normal if that is not so whole 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.060
 a lot for me 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.580
 what a because even more i will watch you 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.200
 brand blowout 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.670
 as much as he does your brand class then you have 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.710
 him the flÃ¼gel ether 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.180
 products speak very well again 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.220
 which is our thing with which you file 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.890
 teammates can join five and yep one 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.530
 mark chicken that time just lay it down 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.710
 you and turn your own again 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.170
 you here well I forget that believe 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.400
 I really love the 10 times here 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.100
 yes that's also because I just completely 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.370
 no longer in it and late was true is already 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.600
 reasonable angle we will think here 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.920
 yourself you know what i just leave one 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.750
 seeing a piece of this is a coincidence 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.910
 minutes do not a good room 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.750
 weighing five is advantageous 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.040
 but in case you are not already reasonable 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.480
 here the things about myself with that I had 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.460
 to sing the piece so much fun 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.090
 always a bit of introduction 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.610
 pedophile chunk on my channel of course 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.500
 but yes what should do more tell 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.240
 about it yes it is a cloth so the that 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.790
 that just one of course soon 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.709
 new battlefield opens 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.360
 for me from the beginning in October 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.840
 November invasion around that time rather say 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.579
 but 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.069
 and of course we just go too 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.329
 feel free to play and the ego that is 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.370
 of course also upload on my 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.070
 channel of course it must open 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.570
 is it on a new console that I am 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.549
 this playing and that seems really super to me 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.320
 fat naturally drained to just 32 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.070
 against 32 us me and my head and yes 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.960
 Wow 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.490
 as you see the sound effect you belong in 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.650
 this game it is just very different then 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.919
 quality coach who is actually more lk 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.479
 the if you then just view and you 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.550
 went lies because article is fun 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.259
 to award games or the games but well 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.810
 I understand that will be a lot of people 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:45.590
 just too yes they know real 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.870
 find it super and here in the something more your 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.599
 but he really is like we in real 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.210
 world is also moving in terms of sounds and 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.410
 so and stuff like that so I can imagine that 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.110
 quite imagine that people just 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.780
 really like it well and yes i had it 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.060
 is so much fun to play 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.580
 some disadvantages that I find then 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.949
 Battlefield 3 shelf is then that 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.900
 match at the matches there is way too 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.760
 take a long time for your feeling 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.740
 miss it if you come to a john lobby 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.490
 like this so for my own service 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.289
 no one 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.580
 and then that thick it would be so called 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.250
 or nobody points this out to you 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.560
 eliminate in this case because mine 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.919
 pastor you have to get rid of that point 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.539
 edition yes so instead of the other way around 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.979
 say you repeated it in calvia 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.760
 just enter your number of points here 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.590
 get rid of it and yes those are own servers 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.090
 and the data unfortunately is more expensive just too long 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.860
 nature of the limes are half an hour I 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.050
 it is here that i can hardly eat it 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.490
 I really can't take advantage of that 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.620
 nice person now start with just one 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.229
 short movie like this and just this a bit 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.940
 wants to expand and will echo myself yes 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.830
 just fill in a bit more 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.330
 yes mean the game who you want to explore 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.190
 and explore there 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.570
 I played a little day like this until now 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.740
 and 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.910
 me that is of course oil for a long time 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.330
 ago so I'm just the again 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.860
 nutrition calls in it and without saying well 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.600
 I hope you just want here 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.260
 liked to see this and so and so 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.340
 I would say 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.120
 of course give a thumbs up and 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.590
 we say i wanted 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.590
 as always to 100 times in
