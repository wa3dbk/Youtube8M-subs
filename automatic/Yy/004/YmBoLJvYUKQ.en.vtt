00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.559
 as you can only see very much 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.829
 really light really is really cute 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.629
 also trendy and certainly some 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.910
 enough terms have me 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.129
 given these plus two others that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 instagram was definitely short 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.410
 anyway if you are interested in this 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.920
 this type of earrings is there 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.510
 girl that really makes me very good 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.970
 I don't know any other info so I can only 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.920
 leave him his facebook page 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.010
 ok let's start immediately on the various steps to do 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.570
 to create this look more lips 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.990
 fleshy step number one is preventing the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 wrinkles 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.180
 so it's nice anyway 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.700
 prevent these wrinkles especially before 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.680
 that is why once you do 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.680
 our wrinkles will be created 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.950
 practically impossible 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.890
 so now I am in this period 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.580
 using the planter's sérum eye contour 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.490
 and lip contour which is this here 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.120
 very little passes and goes by 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.120
 to apply 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.410
 here along the entire contour of the lips 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.450
 so once this is done 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.520
 proceeding we can pass 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.989
 then to the application of the illuminant 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:25.890
 we want to exalt the arch of cupid that it is 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:27.780
 exactly this area here ok for the 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.769
 again the excess on the hand I'm using 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.970
 now how do you eliminate the minute claws of 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.970
 clarence so I go with the small brush 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:54.830
 exactly along the arc and then I like it 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:57.959
 blend my 130 mach ok anyway 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.170
 we can also put it on the ledge 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.540
 of the chin to give this effect 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.950
 here I have to give this wrong 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.930
 very nice effect at this point 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.500
 we can move on to the application of 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.260
 lipstick for thin lips me 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.380
 I always recommend they are always more beautiful 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.079
 to see the lipsticks but in this case 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.000
 I'm using the pease now I don't have 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.640
 thin lips or lips 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.130
 in my opinion normal going on 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.380
 channel roses mandante but they seem to me 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.959
 of very normal sized lips 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.170
 and since I like them even more 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.079
 great more meaty effect I go 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.989
 always apply very willingly 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.900
 very full-bodied lipsticks very covering 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.019
 which can be opaque lipsticks 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.549
 so in this case the plisnic of matt 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.389
 it's one of my favorites 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:58.210
 it is a rose that for a little while 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:04:03.060
 on the mauve very beautiful 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.060
 and I simply apply it 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:17.590
 storm so keeping me I always keep 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.370
 quite external so I go to 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.960
 cover not only the part of the lips 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.500
 colored by our pigmentation 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.810
 natural but I keep slightly outside 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.890
 along just the outer edge I go to 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.890
 cover it all 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.110
 see already as having given the first 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.090
 layer on the upper lip 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.120
 it seems that the upper lip is more 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.120
 in short, fleshy bigger 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.100
 if you smile like that you will be able to apply 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.100
 I feel it better 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.110
 see how the effect looks like lips 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.630
 there are much more fleshy girls 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.040
 that anyway for those who have lips 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.200
 small 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.600
 sometimes I have also seen in various videos 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.550
 suggests red lipsticks from 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.400
 very brightly colored lipsticks 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.770
 the ris advice because the lipstick 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.830
 red however the color lipstick 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.980
 very bright that you notice goes right to 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.030
 delimit the circumscribed area of ​​the 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.770
 lips therefore delimiting outlining us 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.230
 does highlight anyway 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.820
 distances that are between the lips and the 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.310
 end of the face then the lips 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.590
 they will seem even smaller then 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.870
 for those with very thin lips or 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.150
 very with a very small mouth 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.420
 I can not help but suggest gods 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:13.650
 these are the soft colored lipsticks 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:18.660
 rose of the news or of the marroncini 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:22.400
 rosé very light plus the fact of the 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:26.070
 matte formulation then matt lipsticks 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.190
 lipsticks with soft colors lipsticks that 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.770
 they are very full bodied and therefore very opaque 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.850
 which will give this lip effect more 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.850
 fuller lips more fleshed out another 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:44.420
 what you can do is when you go 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.420
 apply to blend the outer edges 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.450
 slightly 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.230
 by blending the outer edges you will get 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.590
 this airbrush effect that I like 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:11.470
 very very natural very effect 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:14.410
 unpainted lipstick lips 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.979
 artificial here I really like this 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.710
 airbrush effect is on the tinted background 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:23.410
 that he likes lips on his lips 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.919
 too outlined effect pencil effect 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.830
 graphic I do n't like at all 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:32.500
 so this effect is a bit blurred 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.680
 surely it will help even more to give 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:39.060
 an effect of fleshier lips to have 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:43.680
 larger and even more attractive lips 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.680
 step another layer of lipstick 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.020
 and I would say that we hope these 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.570
 little tricks here are these little ones 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.880
 tips you have been helpful let me 

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.650
