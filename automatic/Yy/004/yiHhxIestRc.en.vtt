00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.689
 the x1 is a slightly different camera 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.869
 from other mirrorless cameras of the 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.180
 Hicks series popular films is indeed like 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.920
 we see very similar aesthetically 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.879
 to the aics m1 but inside there is a 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.250
 different sensor is not the trans mix but 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:45.089
 a sensor always aps cc moves and xr one 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.320
 very simple and essential camera 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:51.030
 suitable for those who want to get closer 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.530
 to this system the fujifilm system 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.129
 inside as we have said we find 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.920
 the sensor c mos from 16 mag to xr is 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.329
 flanked by the processor and xr that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.129
 we have already seen a tested one 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.170
 processor that we have already seen provide 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.270
 good image quality and also 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.590
 low noise levels 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.929
 now we go into the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.820
 features of this camera and 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.130
 then the images we have will follow 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.170
 made in our usual test 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.509
 on the test field we made 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.200
 with the new zoom xc 16 50 mm that comes 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.300
 supplied in kit form with the camera on 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.890
 right side we have the two connections 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.890
 hdmi and usb 

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:37.300
 at the top we see the sled for 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.399
 the external flash in fact the x1 can 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.550
 put also external flashes besides 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.170
 built-in flash program ring 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.849
 here too we see a lot of ring 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.069
 complete because despite being one 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.590
 top-level camera 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.020
 even the most advanced features for those 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.679
 already knows how to juggle with photography 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.229
 the shutter and ignition button the 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.179
 fn customization button 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.330
 allow a function we use the most 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.900
 it is also frequently to be remembered that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.130
 the camera is 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.040
 the wireless connection is here the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.340
 ring to select the various 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.910
 settings the camera we remember 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.030
 that thanks to the exr processor is able 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.130
 to be active and ready to use in 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.680
 very little time because of the time of 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.860
 startup is 0 5 seconds and click delays 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.520
 of just 0 05 the shooting sequence 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.160
 it reaches 5 6 frames per second 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.980
 lcd vasku labile as we see for 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:47.600
 position it in the position that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:50.780
 the more there is useful on the back we have at the top 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.930
 the key that unlocks the integrated flash 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.420
 flash pop up on this side a ferrule 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.760
 which allows us to move in the various 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.560
 settings or to change i 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.080
 times to get me when we are priority 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.600
 teeth diaphragms the rate to review i 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.450
 files stored the red button for 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.510
 direct start of the function 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.920
 video fair the classic 4 4 buttons 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.230
 central button to enter the menu 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.550
 main 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.800
 let's try to see enter the menu 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.780
 main and see the various options 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.019
 we have the film simulation which is typical 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.830
 bracketing of the machines fused 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:38.739
 of the color self-timer film simulations 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.739
 the various possibilities of settings 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.799
 if we move further in the various 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.610
 four-function joystick functions 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:56.900
 we have the possibility to choose the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.420
 focus point balancing 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.120
 of white here too it is important to note 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.620
 that the camera is based but has 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.200
 however of the very functions 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.060
 interesting even for those who are more 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.489
 smaliziato 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.000
 then we have the shooting mode 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:18.019
 single continuous self-timer flash 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.549
 the macro function immediately below we have 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.859
 the quick menu 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.379
 here too we have all available 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.560
 main functions so as to 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:30.139
 to be able to modify them quickly with 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.379
 the ring we saw above 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:40.449
 we can set the function there 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:42.979
 interested and here we have at least general 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.289
 with the button we saw on the back 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.289
 activate the integrated flash 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.000
 However
