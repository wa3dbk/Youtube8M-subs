and the reason for that is I want to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.530 
and the reason for that is I want to
keep<00:03:52.750> all<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.709> oxygen<00:03:54.100> away<00:03:54.489> from<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.180> carrot

juice<00:03:55.569> so<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.139> doesn't<00:03:56.500> deteriorate

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
juice so that it doesn't deteriorate

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.309 
juice so that it doesn't deteriorate
then<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.639> cap<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.690> then<00:03:58.870> put<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.139> in<00:03:59.230> the

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319
