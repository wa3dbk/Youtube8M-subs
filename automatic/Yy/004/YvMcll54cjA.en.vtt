00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
think it was so funny and it was so much

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
think it was so funny and it was so much
fun<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.160> fill<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:56.879> enough<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.270> let's<00:00:57.989> get

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
fun to fill but enough of that let's get

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.490 
fun to fill but enough of that let's get
into<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.590> video<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> unfortunately<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.289> can't

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
into the video so unfortunately we can't

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
into the video so unfortunately we can't
all<00:01:01.649> wake<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.340> Kylie<00:01:02.850> Jenner<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.329> Beyonce

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
all wake up like Kylie Jenner or Beyonce

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
all wake up like Kylie Jenner or Beyonce
so<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.710> need<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.309> use<00:01:05.430> some<00:01:05.880> sort<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so I need to use some sort of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.700 
so I need to use some sort of
foundations<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.110> favorite<00:01:07.530> right

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
now Smashbox camera ready BB cream it's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
now Smashbox camera ready BB cream it's
light<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.159> feels<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.790> wearing

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
light and it feels like I'm not wearing

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
light and it feels like I'm not wearing
makeup<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> gives<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.930> pretty<00:01:13.320> good<00:01:13.560> amount

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
makeup but it gives a pretty good amount

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
makeup but it gives a pretty good amount
of<00:01:13.920> coverage<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.119> dotting<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.840> over

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
of coverage so I'm dotting this all over

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.450 
of coverage so I'm dotting this all over
my<00:01:16.170> face<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.409> blending<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
my face and blending this in with a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.940 
my face and blending this in with a
buffing<00:01:17.880> brush<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:19.140> using<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.619> brush<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
buffing brush I think using a brush is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
buffing brush I think using a brush is
way<00:01:20.189> faster<00:01:20.790> than<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.150> fingers<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.840> used

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
way faster than my fingers which I used

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
way faster than my fingers which I used
to<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.490> applying<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.850> all
