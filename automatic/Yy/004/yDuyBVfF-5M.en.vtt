00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.719 
functionality so what you can see here
in<00:01:18.210> Revit<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.729> different

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
in Revit is that we have different

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210 
in Revit is that we have different
levels<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> details<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.920> take<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
levels of details so if we take the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
levels of details so if we take the
course<00:01:23.460> level<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.119> detail<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.659> we'll<00:01:24.810> see

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
course level of detail here we'll see

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
course level of detail here we'll see
that<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.350> an<00:01:25.590> opening<00:01:25.979> which<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.729> perfect

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that we have an opening which is perfect

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.499 
that we have an opening which is perfect
for<00:01:27.560> an<00:01:28.560> exchange<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.220> analytic<00:01:29.640> exchange<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
for an exchange in analytic exchange to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.920 
for an exchange in analytic exchange to
a<00:01:30.540> building<00:01:31.470> engineer<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.909> next<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
a building engineer the next one is the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.710 
a building engineer the next one is the
medium<00:01:34.320> where<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.430> show<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.329> bit<00:01:36.479> more

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
medium where we show a little bit more

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630 
medium where we show a little bit more
information<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> final<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.220> which

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
information and then the final one which

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.010 
information and then the final one which
is<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> course<00:01:39.150> fine<00:01:39.450> where<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.689> show<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:39.990> of

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
is of course fine where we show all of

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.010 
is of course fine where we show all of
the<00:01:40.200> information<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.030> we<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.570> quickly<00:01:42.750> jump

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the information and we just quickly jump

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
the information and we just quickly jump
over<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> 3d<00:01:43.770> window<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.159> see<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.700> at

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
over to the 3d window you see that at

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.530 
over to the 3d window you see that at
this<00:01:45.420> stage<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> fine<00:01:47.450> level<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
this stage I have the fine level of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
this stage I have the fine level of
detail<00:01:48.899> activated<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.799> you'll<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
detail activated so you'll see all of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.010 
detail activated so you'll see all of
the<00:01:50.549> window<00:01:50.820> handles<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.720> change<00:01:51.960> that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the window handles and if we change that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
the window handles and if we change that
to<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.320> medium<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.399> window<00:01:53.640> handles<00:01:54.030> will

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
to a medium the window handles will

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.460 
to a medium the window handles will
actually<00:01:54.390> disappear<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:54.990> could<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.259> quite

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
actually disappear which could be quite

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.679 
actually disappear which could be quite
helpful<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.250> large<00:01:56.460> project<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> again

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
helpful if it's a large project so again

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.620 
helpful if it's a large project so again
that's<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.860> different<00:02:02.310> levels<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.030> details

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that's the different levels of details

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.109 
that's the different levels of details
if<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> look<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.759> intersection<00:02:05.759> here

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
if we have a look in intersection here

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
if we have a look in intersection here
you<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.439> very

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
you see that we have very

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.029 
you see that we have very
information-rich<00:02:08.670> objects<00:02:09.860> showing<00:02:10.860> the

frame thicknesses etc which can be very
helpful<00:02:17.330> means<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.650> save<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> lot<00:02:20.100> of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
helpful means that you save a lot of

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
helpful means that you save a lot of
time<00:02:20.690> for<00:02:21.690> detail<00:02:22.080> work<00:02:22.320> we<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.400> take<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
time for detail work we can take the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.520 
time for detail work we can take the
information<00:02:24.330> we<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.810> extract<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.260> directly

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
information we can extract it directly

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.250 
information we can extract it directly
from<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.800> model<00:02:26.070> rather<00:02:26.220> than<00:02:26.720> doing<00:02:27.720> 2d

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
from the model rather than doing 2d

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.210 
from the model rather than doing 2d
details<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:30.380> again<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.500> see<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.100> we

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
details and again you see here that we

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.520 
details and again you see here that we
have<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.510> section<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.900> well<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.350> some

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
have in the section as well we have some

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.790 
have in the section as well we have some
nice<00:02:34.680> high<00:02:35.550> detailed<00:02:35.970> information<00:02:36.540> as<00:02:36.660> well

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.520 

so<00:02:40.800> again<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.820> 200<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:43.050> 200

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
so again that's the the 200 I the 200

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.510 
so again that's the the 200 I the 200
hallo<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.880> course<00:02:45.180> finally<00:02:45.540> at<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.990> doors

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
hallo and of course finally at the doors

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.850 
hallo and of course finally at the doors
the<00:02:47.520> 500<00:02:48.030> series<00:02:48.210> out<00:02:48.480> your<00:02:48.630> doors<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.710> if<00:02:49.770> we

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
the 500 series out your doors so if we

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.070 
the 500 series out your doors so if we
just<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> quick<00:02:51.150> look<00:02:51.240> at<00:02:51.420> those<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
just have a quick look at those in the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.760 
just have a quick look at those in the
3d<00:02:52.350> window<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:54.260> basically<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.440> doors<00:02:55.590> are

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
3d window and basically the doors are

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.260 
3d window and basically the doors are
quite<00:02:55.950> similar<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.790> other<00:02:57.000> door

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
quite similar it's the other door

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.640 
quite similar it's the other door
handles<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.690> are<00:02:57.810> different<00:02:58.200> for<00:02:58.530> these

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
handles that are different for these

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.110 
handles that are different for these
particular<00:02:58.920> doors<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.460> we<00:02:59.520> have<00:02:59.670> some<00:02:59.850> patio

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
particular doors and we have some patio

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.400 
particular doors and we have some patio
doors<00:03:00.390> as<00:03:00.570> well<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.780> again<00:03:06.780> don't<00:03:06.960> forget<00:03:07.110> if

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
doors as well and again don't forget if

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.830 
doors as well and again don't forget if

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
that was the functionality quickly in

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.610 
that was the functionality quickly in
Revit<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:45.210> I'm<00:03:45.270> gonna<00:03:45.360> do<00:03:45.570> now<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.810> just

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
Revit so what I'm gonna do now is just

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.410 
Revit so what I'm gonna do now is just
jump<00:03:47.040> over<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.340> ArchiCAD<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> look<00:03:48.300> at

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
jump over to ArchiCAD and have a look at

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.280 
jump over to ArchiCAD and have a look at
the<00:03:48.540> objects<00:03:48.990> in<00:03:49.140> ArchiCAD<00:03:50.810> okay<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:51.870> now

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
the objects in ArchiCAD okay so now

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.800 
the objects in ArchiCAD okay so now
we're<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.560> archicad<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.670> we<00:03:54.360> have<00:03:54.510> all<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:54.720> the

thing<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.690> is<00:05:19.810> a<00:05:19.870> little<00:05:20.050> bit<00:05:20.170> different<00:05:20.470> in

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
thing that is a little bit different in

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.370 
thing that is a little bit different in
ArchiCAD<00:05:20.980> is<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.720> when<00:05:22.870> you<00:05:22.960> change<00:05:23.140> the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
ArchiCAD is that when you change the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.770 
ArchiCAD is that when you change the
scale<00:05:23.590> here<00:05:24.000> so<00:05:25.000> for<00:05:25.240> example<00:05:25.570> if<00:05:25.660> I<00:05:25.750> just

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
scale here so for example if I just

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.410 
scale here so for example if I just
change<00:05:26.200> this<00:05:26.380> to<00:05:26.440> 1<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.980> 50<00:05:27.310> you'll<00:05:28.000> see<00:05:28.210> now

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
change this to 1 to 50 you'll see now

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.240 
change this to 1 to 50 you'll see now
that<00:05:28.450> we<00:05:28.750> have<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.230> tolerance<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.950> little

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
that we have a tolerance and a little

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.800 
that we have a tolerance and a little
bit<00:05:30.340> more<00:05:30.520> detail<00:05:30.910> that's<00:05:31.150> shown<00:05:31.360> here<00:05:31.390> and

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
bit more detail that's shown here and

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.870 
bit more detail that's shown here and
then<00:05:32.320> we<00:05:32.440> have<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.620> final<00:05:33.070> level<00:05:33.280> of<00:05:33.370> data<00:05:33.550> which

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
then we have a final level of data which

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.350 
then we have a final level of data which
is<00:05:34.000> 1<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.300> 20<00:05:34.660> and<00:05:35.100> with<00:05:36.100> we<00:05:36.490> get<00:05:36.670> full<00:05:36.940> detail

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
is 1 to 20 and with we get full detail

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.230 
is 1 to 20 and with we get full detail
here<00:05:37.630> which<00:05:38.290> again<00:05:39.160> is<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.520> huge<00:05:39.850> time-saver

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
here which again is a huge time-saver

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.340 
here which again is a huge time-saver
for<00:05:40.840> detail<00:05:41.320> work<00:05:42.840> these<00:05:43.840> functionalities

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
for detail work these functionalities

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.250 
for detail work these functionalities
are<00:05:44.740> of<00:05:44.830> course<00:05:44.980> available<00:05:45.190> in<00:05:45.790> 2d<00:05:46.330> I<00:05:46.600> saw<00:05:47.110> in

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
are of course available in 2d I saw in

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.020 
are of course available in 2d I saw in
the<00:05:47.410> section<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:47.800> in<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.130> 3d<00:05:48.490> window<00:05:48.610> as<00:05:48.850> well

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
the section and in the 3d window as well

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.940 
the section and in the 3d window as well
so<00:05:49.240> if<00:05:49.300> we<00:05:49.390> just<00:05:49.540> quickly<00:05:49.720> take<00:05:50.320> up<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.590> section

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
so if we just quickly take up a section

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.180 
so if we just quickly take up a section
here<00:05:51.130> so<00:05:51.730> you<00:05:51.820> see<00:05:51.970> here<00:05:52.180> 1<00:05:52.600> to<00:05:52.750> 100<00:05:53.200> I'll<00:05:53.980> go

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
here so you see here 1 to 100 I'll go

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.030 
here so you see here 1 to 100 I'll go
straight<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.490> 1<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.210> 20<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:55.840> as<00:05:56.650> you<00:05:56.740> can<00:05:56.860> see

straight to 1 to 20 and as you can see

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.540 
straight to 1 to 20 and as you can see
here<00:05:57.280> we<00:05:57.400> have<00:05:57.900> full<00:05:58.900> detail<00:05:59.320> in<00:06:00.010> the<00:06:00.190> section

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
here we have full detail in the section

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.520 
here we have full detail in the section
as<00:06:00.670> well<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.950> then<00:06:02.950> finally<00:06:04.530> fighters

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
as well and then finally fighters

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:13.210 
as well and then finally fighters
quickly<00:06:06.300> take<00:06:07.300> up<00:06:07.420> a<00:06:07.830> section<00:06:08.830> here

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.400 

another<00:06:13.970> thing<00:06:14.180> of<00:06:14.270> course<00:06:14.420> which<00:06:14.660> is<00:06:14.840> very

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
another thing of course which is very

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.200 
another thing of course which is very
important<00:06:16.040> for<00:06:16.130> example<00:06:16.250> if<00:06:16.610> this<00:06:16.760> window<00:06:17.090> is

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
important for example if this window is

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.330 
important for example if this window is
to<00:06:17.330> be<00:06:17.420> include<00:06:17.720> in<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:18.110> balcony<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:19.190> a

to be include in a balcony of a
high-rise<00:06:19.640> building<00:06:19.700> we<00:06:20.660> need<00:06:20.810> to<00:06:20.930> know<00:06:21.050> of

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
high-rise building we need to know of

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.290 
high-rise building we need to know of
course<00:06:21.200> if<00:06:21.710> it's<00:06:21.920> an<00:06:22.040> opening<00:06:22.520> window<00:06:22.820> that<00:06:23.030> it

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
course if it's an opening window that it

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.610 
course if it's an opening window that it
can<00:06:23.450> actually<00:06:23.600> open<00:06:23.990> all<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.200> way<00:06:26.200> this<00:06:27.200> next

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
can actually open all the way this next

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.560 
can actually open all the way this next
function<00:06:28.190> that<00:06:28.310> I'm<00:06:28.430> about<00:06:28.970> to<00:06:29.150> show<00:06:29.300> here<00:06:29.540> is

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
function that I'm about to show here is

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.600 
function that I'm about to show here is
actually<00:06:30.200> something<00:06:30.740> that<00:06:30.920> needs<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:31.310> be<00:06:31.340> set

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
actually something that needs to be set

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.490 
actually something that needs to be set
manually<00:06:32.030> it's<00:06:32.240> nothing<00:06:32.570> that's<00:06:32.720> done<00:06:32.930> it's

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
manually it's nothing that's done it's

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.840 
manually it's nothing that's done it's
not<00:06:33.620> something<00:06:33.950> that's<00:06:34.040> done<00:06:34.280> automatically

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
not something that's done automatically

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.940 
not something that's done automatically
and<00:06:35.210> that's<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:35.750> 3d<00:06:36.080> level<00:06:36.350> of<00:06:36.440> detail<00:06:36.830> which

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
and that's the 3d level of detail which

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.560 
and that's the 3d level of detail which
can<00:06:37.130> be<00:06:37.250> found<00:06:37.430> under<00:06:37.850> the<00:06:37.880> general<00:06:38.240> settings

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
can be found under the general settings

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
take the 3d level of detail here and

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.680 
take the 3d level of detail here and
change<00:06:44.240> that<00:06:44.420> to<00:06:44.480> detailed<00:06:46.150> we<00:06:47.150> see<00:06:47.300> here<00:06:47.570> that

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
change that to detailed we see here that

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
we get a very high detail in the 3d

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.180 
we get a very high detail in the 3d
model<00:06:51.680> as<00:06:51.800> well<00:06:52.150> which<00:06:53.150> again<00:06:53.390> is<00:06:54.190> it's
