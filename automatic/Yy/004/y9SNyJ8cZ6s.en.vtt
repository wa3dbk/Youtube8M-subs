Hello everyone! With you LPS DrakoNika, and today I'll tell you how to do hair style Space Girl !

00:00:07.797 --> 00:00:09.797
(Look at this hair style) ;)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.720
Make this thing easy

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.320
Now we will discuss the main points in making this LPS hairstyles

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.300
Oh, by the way: The effect of "space" is achieved by "space" nail varnishes

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.840
If you know it, you're clever! ;)

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.580
The main action is the modeling clay hairstyles from the air ( model magic clay )  and paint this haircut "space" nail polish

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.240
I use dark blue, purple and pink colors

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.700
"Space" nail polish is very cool

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.100
Pink nail polish is all shades of pink, orange and gold

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.600
Purple nail polish has all the shades of purple and blue

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:47.449
Dark - blue nail polish has all shades of blue and dark blue

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:52.202
I do not like nail polish dark colors, so I do not paint their nails them

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.260
I bought them just for hair dyeing Space Girl

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.521
Space Spider!

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.640
I love these spider legs

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.980
they are SPACE!

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:15.800
(song) you're my space ... You're my space ... You're my favorite space ...

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Yo!

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.760
This cute kitty is our model

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.140
Her hair, we sculpt space

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.623
Started sculpting bangs

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.640
That's what happened in the end

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.480
Once it dries (about 4-6 hours of waiting), we can paint it

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.020
Before painting the hair to be removed

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.460
We paint the front bangs bright pink nail polish

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.500
Next comes the darkest blue nail polish

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.480
Purple nail polish creates a gradient between blue and pink, it is the average of the color transition

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.500
Tails are purple top and dark blue at the bottom

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.480
It is necessary to wait when one layer of nail polish is dry, and then apply the next layer

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:35.860
This chameleon paint, under different lighting it changes color

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.120
Inside, we do not paint, it is not necessary. Paint only from the outside

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.044
We are waiting for the drying layer 1

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.000
Next, paint a dark blue

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.960
And the dark blue paint at the bottom of the tails

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.180
result

00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:14.692
Purple nail polish is applied to complete

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.560
(Result) - Done! We are waiting for drying varnish

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.720
(song) you're my space ... You're my space ... You're my favorite space ...
