00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.040
Hey now, back again?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.960
We may just write another check

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.800
You haven't met all of our friends

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.400
But this is now and that was then

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.560
Torn apart, put away

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.600
Broken down, deactivate

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.280
That won't stop us anyway

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.200
You won't get out this time, no way

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.560
No more doors and lots of room

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.280
And lots of us and one of you

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.800
Check those vents and check those lights

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.940
Better wind that box or you'll be surprised

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.500
Here we are, we're back again

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.460
Then why does the check say "1987"

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.080
What's the past of this shady company?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.820
Wear that mask to protect your life

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.280
Watch those cameras, for 6 hours at a time

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.360
Tell me why

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.200
Five Nights at...

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.060
Five Nights at...

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.680
Five Nights at...

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.700
Five Nights at...

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.460
Five Nights at...

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.240
Five Nights at...

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.040
Five Nights at...

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.620
Five Nights is back again

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.780
No more doors and lots of rooms

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.700
There's lots of us and one of you

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.860
Check those vents and check those lights

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.000
Better wind that box or you'll be surprised

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.640
What are we hiding?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.580
There has to be more

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.800
When gold is the only color we're looking for

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.420
No!

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.860
Let's have some fun

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.600
Let's eat and dance a take a trip to Foxy's Pirate Cove

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.380
Oh!

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.420
A Marionette!

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.040
It looks a little scary but he knows a lot I bet!

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.440
Here we are, we're back again

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.460
Then why does the check say "1987"

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.860
What's the past of this shady company?

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.640
Wear that mask, protect your life

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.200
Watch those cameras, for 6 hours at a time

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.960
Tell me why...
