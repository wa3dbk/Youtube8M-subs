 does not exist at the corner so this is it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.420
 even as you saw some it is so 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.120
 today some applications applied some 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.120
 network programs are expensive that are very 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.760

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.039
 As I promised you, I think 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.640
 was to prevent the video that was this 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.250

 that mazda prays and pro game of the type without 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:42.030
 goals in 15 games in the game bar 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.950
 the mec not know if it's somewhere 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.020
 People would open a game with this here. 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.700
 We do not need the dictation to call 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.770
 for someone will stay here where you 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.900
 can set the world to press 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.610
 appear and you can call 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.080
 game will not spread the skype will not 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.570
 himself no other word than 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.190
 game and it is much better type this game is 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.010
 they can see that it's still in beta 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.780
 So, like, we can know more if 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.490
 know and if everyone starts to 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.800
 use will be better for all 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.330
 games for skype is not suitable for 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.000
 game everybody knows that, so yes 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.200
 buga I thought good if you know how it is 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.350
 the mall 9 bruno ask problem is there 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.299
 so I recommend a lot in record if 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.160
 you want to add and or you put 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.120
 physics or Andrade put in place 90 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.729
 Euros and you continue to tone 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.760
 this is then the other is the synapse 2 ante 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.380
 the program I did not test but I think 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.389
 is for something and set up your 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.210
 network mouse for games 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.010
 I think that's what I saw already 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.900
 I do not have this goofy mouse I have 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.060
 just booked its not that 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.040
 so I do not know but since it's a 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.380
 The network program also had to pass 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.540
 Do you want to take a look there and you will have 12 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.040
 by Portuguese reads what you think 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.050
 maybe it will work for you 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.120
 now the king follows in search then goes to 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.070
 keep looking for what you do not 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.479
 be happy their games and blah blah blah and 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.760
 show that you do not know that the 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.400
 receive the program then the game is 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.380
 predicted but this is better and stronger 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.300
 I think it's more of a barrier then type 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.190
 here I think I was giving a suggestion 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.460
 lakes article 22 tweets of ix aires pace 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.680
 To analyze it, then I'm top. 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.930
 performers then other 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.250
 things that optimizes and it was I am 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.510
 using the one that has or know that I do not 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.190
 I know what it's for, so every year is 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.380
 so it works you see that in the game 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.820
 Clicking here will carry a bar 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.280
 show that you are ready to know 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.260
 if it repeats over the course of the game it opens 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.990
 as it works if you do not work 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.830
 I do not know maybe a little worse subsidy 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.849
