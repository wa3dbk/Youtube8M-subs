five in New York they trusted one
another<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.900> factor<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> going

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
another and I think that factor is going

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.740 
another and I think that factor is going
to<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.189> present<00:00:32.550> again<00:00:32.910> tonight<00:00:33.329> for

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the Celtics to come out on top I think

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.720 
the Celtics to come out on top I think
it<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.380> certainly<00:00:37.380> Paul<00:00:37.620> Pierce<00:00:37.980> was

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it can be certainly Paul Pierce was

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490 
it can be certainly Paul Pierce was
leading<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> charge<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.629> terms<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.260> getting

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
leading the charge in terms of getting

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
leading the charge in terms of getting
the<00:00:40.710> message<00:00:41.010> across<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.370> everybody<00:00:42.030> has<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the message across that everybody has to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.630 
the message across that everybody has to
trust<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.870> another<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.620> ball<00:00:43.829> cannot<00:00:44.190> stick

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
trust one another the ball cannot stick
