or<00:06:12.740> Bishop<00:06:13.130> takes<00:06:14.620> black<00:06:15.620> is<00:06:15.860> still<00:06:16.340> lost<00:06:16.550> so

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
or Bishop takes black is still lost so

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.980 
or Bishop takes black is still lost so
this<00:06:17.690> is<00:06:17.900> not<00:06:18.080> worth<00:06:18.320> playing<00:06:19.570> even<00:06:20.570> rook<00:06:20.780> to

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
this is not worth playing even rook to

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.400 
this is not worth playing even rook to
d1<00:06:21.169> is<00:06:21.860> possible<00:06:22.370> but<00:06:22.750> this<00:06:23.750> is<00:06:23.810> when<00:06:24.020> better

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
d1 is possible but this is when better

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.650 
d1 is possible but this is when better
and<00:06:26.260> so<00:06:27.260> on

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
and so on

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.180 
and so on
so<00:06:28.930> that's<00:06:29.140> why<00:06:29.400> it<00:06:30.570> move<00:06:31.800> 25<00:06:32.800> in<00:06:33.040> this

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
so that's why it move 25 in this

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.670 
so that's why it move 25 in this
position<00:06:34.470> door<00:06:35.470> resigned<00:06:36.780> and<00:06:37.780> it<00:06:37.960> was<00:06:38.170> very

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
position door resigned and it was very

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.100 
position door resigned and it was very
nice<00:06:38.950> attack<00:06:39.370> like<00:06:39.700> us<00:06:39.880> Arab<00:06:40.240> on<00:06:40.480> the<00:06:40.630> kingside
