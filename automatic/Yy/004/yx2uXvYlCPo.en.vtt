because I thought maybe the movie will
come<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:55.340> in<00:00:56.340> August<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:58.109> seeing

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
as i said i was expecting this movie to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.870 
as i said i was expecting this movie to
come<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.159> where<00:01:41.490> later<00:01:41.970> than<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:43.820> but<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
come out where later than this but I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600 
come out where later than this but I
mean<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.509> looks<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.380> mean<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> still

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
think the game itself is not ready to be

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
think the game itself is not ready to be
released<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.409> early<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:52.979> June<00:01:53.250> or
