00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 but on the roads of Surgut became noticeable 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.460
 fewer taxis 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.290
 This is due to the fact that the driver 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.300
 certificate issued and in a number of cis countries 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.980
 outlawed it comes about 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.690
 States that do not perform 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.920
 requirements of an international convention on 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.410
 road traffic 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.940
 This example tajikistan or uzbekistan 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.590
 traffic police are actively checking 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.090
 foreign drivers in case 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.180
 their lack of rights of the Russian 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.939
 sample write out rather big penalties and 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 many pick up cars 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.750
 road managers 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.329
 enterprises have already ceased to produce 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.579
 lines of migrant drivers and often this 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.980
 half the staff and replace these people 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.309
 just a certain Sergei Zotov found out what 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.020
 wait on innovations on the roads 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.160
 New Year's holidays began acres Holmatov 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.200
 party crash 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.329
 returning after the shift stopped at 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 traffic lights at this time in his route 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.559
 Bus drove a foreign car is my car 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.329
 slightly scratched and 1 stopped like that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.199
 accident as usual 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.409
 came also climbed to the reports and us 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.750
 Said that the traffic police in form will go and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.850
 traffic police after making a crash and checking all 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.439
 documents it turned out that acres 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 carries passengers illegally 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.229
 driver's license he got in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.030
 tajikistan 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.710
 now like most of his colleagues 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 migrants working in boxing 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.790
 repair technique difference between 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.590
 Russians and also what rights he doesn't 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 He sees, according to him, perfectly 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 coped with driving the bus like in 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.600
 Russia and at home to myself 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.790
 and no matter how necessary it is, ours disappeared said 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.619
 internationally you have so important too 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.810
 if we had international why should i 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.060
 from the right to us just not so no matter how 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 I know the right side more than 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.070
 law, some have been added as well as on 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.960
 I think I think it's not a new beginning with 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.329
 last year Surgut policeman 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.549
 one of the first in the district began active 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.630
 fighting border guards driving exceptions 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.219
 doesn't do for anyone 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.439
 fine for driving with a foreign 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.540
 ID is from 5 to 15 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.090
 thousand rubles are also taken from the migrant 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.320
 car at a car pound 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.420
 recent changes in international 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.070
 convention and in federal law 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.780
 prohibit drivers from driving 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.700
 what car rights are not 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.569
 meets the uniform standards of this 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.670
 convention itself 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.040
 driving license in most 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.459
 cis countries belong to the category 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.739
 such 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.260
 from hepatitis they say it is including 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.360
 affect the qualifications of drivers in 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.430
 more than 500 accidents occurred last year 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.069
 in which people have suffered or died 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.769
 ten percent of the culprits of the accident were 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.560
 migrants I think so with a vision from 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.299
 these new rules and regulations we naturally 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.310
 reduce the number of drivers themselves on 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.310
 the road and this including affect 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.569
 certainly the number of crashes with 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.860
 participation of foreign drivers because 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.049
 what practice shows even 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.920
 practical skills they have time for a year 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.940
 for two to work on driving on 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.069
 the territory of the Russian Federation 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.379
 that theory they have on very 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.540
 weak level in less than three months 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.420
 the work of the staff and bdd revealed more 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.430
 1300 offenders migrants as claimed 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.470
 in traffic police is only the beginning 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.209
 many motor executives 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.769
 businesses are concerned about this and not 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.440
 release to the line of their foreign 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.359
 Drivers are often just visiting 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.510
 make up most of the state in such 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.780
 films to date more 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.190
 more than thirty odd machine units 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.920
 operates on a regular transport line 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.410
 works less than last year and 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.829
 today is still the effect of this law 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.410
 law still stops a number of drivers 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.180
 who can not leave but since 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.310
 that they may be law-abiding 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.530
 today do not have the rule of opportunity like 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.269
 change this driver's license 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.030
 and it turns out that you are extremely you 5 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.069
 whether the passenger will remain the passenger 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.380
 extreme if the driving manners of visitors 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.569
 driver change for the better 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.849
 rather than yes to it itself 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.599
 count not only the police well and 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.599
 same passengers
