Western Conference a lot and I mean a

Western Conference a lot and I mean a
lot<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.310> controversial<00:03:17.880> calls<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.690> are

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
lot of controversial calls that are

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.870 
lot of controversial calls that are
going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.019> made<00:03:19.230> because<00:03:19.790> other<00:03:20.790> than

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
going to be made because other than

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.740 
going to be made because other than
Oklahoma<00:03:21.209> City<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.890> Lakers<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.549> mean<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
Oklahoma City and the Lakers I mean the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.630 
Oklahoma City and the Lakers I mean the
other<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.350> other<00:03:25.380> three<00:03:25.739> matchups<00:03:25.950> really

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
other the other three matchups really

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.789 
other the other three matchups really
either<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.359> you<00:03:27.390> could<00:03:27.660> win<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> think<00:03:28.680> it's

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
either can you could win so I think it's

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.559 
either can you could win so I think it's
going<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.980> come<00:03:29.160> down<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.760> officiating<00:03:30.329> in

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
going to come down to the officiating in

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.110 
going to come down to the officiating in
those<00:03:30.870> contests<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.680> who<00:03:32.100> really<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.670> able<00:03:33.000> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
those contests and who really is able to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.580 
those contests and who really is able to
get<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.390> benefit<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.049> calls<00:03:34.319> because

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
get the benefit to the calls because

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.140 
get the benefit to the calls because
there's<00:03:34.950> going<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.160> be<00:03:35.220> calls<00:03:35.519> made<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:35.850> these

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
there's going to be calls made in these

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.270 
there's going to be calls made in these
games<00:03:36.390> down<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.930> stretch<00:03:36.959> they're<00:03:37.950> going<00:03:38.220> to

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
games down the stretch they're going to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.729 
games down the stretch they're going to
affect<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.700> outcome<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.390> effect<00:03:39.959> one<00:03:40.410> team

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
affect the outcome and effect one team

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.099 
affect the outcome and effect one team
moving<00:03:41.579> on<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.970> second<00:03:42.420> round<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.780> really

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
moving on to the second round I really

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.660 
moving on to the second round I really
look<00:03:43.260> for<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> lot<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.859> controversy<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.579> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
look for a lot of controversy in the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.160 
look for a lot of controversy in the
Western<00:03:44.970> Conference<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.810> sounds<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.079> me

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
Western Conference so it sounds to me

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.360 
Western Conference so it sounds to me
like<00:03:46.260> you're<00:03:46.650> you're<00:03:46.889> going<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.250> looking

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
like you're you're going to be looking

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.430 
like you're you're going to be looking
for<00:03:47.790> more<00:03:48.209> like<00:03:48.389> six<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.930> seven<00:03:49.260> game<00:03:49.410> series

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
for more like six and seven game series

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.490 
for more like six and seven game series
and<00:03:50.160> maybe<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.329> reps<00:03:51.540> will<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:51.810> leaning

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
and maybe that the reps will be leaning

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.550 
and maybe that the reps will be leaning
towards<00:03:52.739> stretching<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.280> series<00:03:53.549> out<00:03:54.560> no

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
towards stretching the series out no

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.170 
towards stretching the series out no
doubt<00:03:55.739> about<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:56.069> certainly<00:03:56.670> want<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.940> stretch

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
doubt about it certainly want to stretch

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.879 
doubt about it certainly want to stretch
the<00:03:57.329> series<00:03:57.690> out<00:03:57.870> especially<00:03:58.049> if<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.530> ends<00:03:58.769> up

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
the series out especially if it ends up

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.210 
the series out especially if it ends up
31<00:03:59.670> or<00:03:59.940> 30<00:04:00.239> in<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.600> series<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.139> team<00:04:01.709> that's

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
31 or 30 in a series the team that's

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.440 
31 or 30 in a series the team that's
down<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.670> definitely<00:04:03.060> going<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.239> get<00:04:03.329> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
down is definitely going to get the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.660 
down is definitely going to get the
benefit<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.870> those<00:04:03.989> calls<00:04:04.380> but<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.769> think<00:04:05.459> that

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
benefit of those calls but I think that

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.190 
benefit of those calls but I think that
in<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.940> Western<00:04:06.329> Conference<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.989> other

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
in the Western Conference these other

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900 
in the Western Conference these other
matchups<00:04:07.500> other<00:04:08.010> than<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.340> lakers<00:04:08.700> in

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
matchups other than the lakers in

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.970 
matchups other than the lakers in
oklahoma<00:04:09.299> city<00:04:09.420> are<00:04:09.750> are<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.350> evenly<00:04:10.829> matched

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
oklahoma city are are so evenly matched

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.590 
oklahoma city are are so evenly matched
that<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.579> really<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.209> come<00:04:12.359> down<00:04:12.540> to

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
that it's really going to come down to

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.530 
that it's really going to come down to
the<00:04:12.810> officiating<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.790> you're<00:04:14.790> going<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:14.970> see

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
the officiating and you're going to see

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.050 
the officiating and you're going to see
a<00:04:15.569> lot<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.900> controversy<00:04:16.829> in<00:04:17.669> some<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:17.970> these

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
a lot of controversy in some of these

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.390 
a lot of controversy in some of these
games<00:04:18.359> all<00:04:18.750> right<00:04:18.900> which<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.680> 16<00:04:20.100> teams

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
games all right which of the 16 teams

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.830 
games all right which of the 16 teams
the<00:04:20.910> playoffs<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.359> year<00:04:21.419> do<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.750> think

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
the playoffs this year do you think

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.110 
the playoffs this year do you think
might<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.289> overvalued<00:04:22.830> or<00:04:23.310> undervalued<00:04:23.370> i

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
might be overvalued or undervalued i

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.430 
might be overvalued or undervalued i
think<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.630> lakers<00:04:24.840> are<00:04:25.140> certainly

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
think the lakers are certainly

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.899 
think the lakers are certainly
overvalued<00:04:26.159> i<00:04:26.280> don't<00:04:26.490> think<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.729> they

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
overvalued i don't think that they

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.410 
overvalued i don't think that they
really

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
really

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.150 
really
serve<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.840> be<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.110> playoffs<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.680> year<00:04:28.740> I

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
serve to be in the playoffs this year I

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.130

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
think that they got the benefit of a lot

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.350 
think that they got the benefit of a lot
of<00:04:31.260> calls<00:04:31.500> late<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.010> season<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.640> help<00:04:33.120> them

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
of calls late in the season to help them

undervalue you think might be you know a

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.580 
undervalue you think might be you know a
good<00:04:38.970> bet<00:04:39.210> on<00:04:39.390> their<00:04:39.840> spreads<00:04:40.170> at<00:04:40.320> least<00:04:40.470> in

do I like the totals that's what I

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.760 
do I like the totals that's what I
really<00:05:18.570> concentrated<00:05:19.200> on<00:05:19.290> because<00:05:19.620> when<00:05:19.740> I

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
really concentrated on because when I

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.710 
really concentrated on because when I
can<00:05:19.950> look<00:05:20.160> at<00:05:20.250> three<00:05:20.490> referees<00:05:20.670> on<00:05:21.150> again<00:05:21.390> and

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
can look at three referees on again and

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.660 
can look at three referees on again and
know<00:05:22.230> their<00:05:22.440> tendency<00:05:23.040> to<00:05:23.070> whether<00:05:23.430> there's

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
know their tendency to whether there's

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.520 
know their tendency to whether there's
going<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.940> be<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.060> good<00:05:24.360> flow<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.870> game<00:05:25.080> or

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
going to be a good flow to the game or

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.870 
going to be a good flow to the game or
if<00:05:25.770> they're<00:05:25.920> going<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.100> interrupt<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.670> flow

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
if they're going to interrupt the flow

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.120 
if they're going to interrupt the flow
and<00:05:27.300> take<00:05:27.720> guys<00:05:27.930> out<00:05:28.140> of<00:05:28.290> their<00:05:28.380> rhythm<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:28.890> can

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
and take guys out of their rhythm I can

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.440 
and take guys out of their rhythm I can
decide<00:05:29.400> whether<00:05:29.700> i<00:05:29.820> think<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.240> game<00:05:30.420> should

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
decide whether i think the game should

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.260 
decide whether i think the game should
go<00:05:30.780> over<00:05:31.200> or<00:05:31.410> under<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:32.040> this<00:05:32.940> year<00:05:33.120> I've<00:05:33.240> been

some strategies that you might use to

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.540 
some strategies that you might use to
