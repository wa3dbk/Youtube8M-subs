00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
bonus some people think that this gun is

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.350 
bonus some people think that this gun is
kinda<00:00:48.230> overpowered<00:00:48.920> because<00:00:49.280> well<00:00:49.699> it<00:00:50.059> can

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
kinda overpowered because well it can

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.119 
kinda overpowered because well it can
one<00:00:50.570> order<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.989> show<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.289> pilot<00:00:51.710> in<00:00:51.860> close

quarters<00:00:52.609> and<00:00:52.789> this<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.660> understandable

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
quarters and this is understandable

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.619 
quarters and this is understandable
because<00:00:54.469> in<00:00:54.829> many<00:00:55.039> FPS<00:00:55.309> games<00:00:55.820> shotguns

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
because in many FPS games shotguns

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.250 
because in many FPS games shotguns
usually<00:00:57.170> can<00:00:57.739> down<00:00:58.340> your<00:00:58.760> opponent<00:00:58.910> in<00:00:59.660> one<00:01:00.079> or

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
usually can down your opponent in one or

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.759 
usually can down your opponent in one or
two<00:01:00.289> shots<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.280> trust<00:01:02.120> me<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.420> shotgun<00:01:02.780> it

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
two shots and trust me this shotgun it

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.700 
two shots and trust me this shotgun it
just<00:01:04.100> horrible<00:01:04.550> at<00:01:04.730> range<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:05.480> can't<00:01:05.900> even

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
just horrible at range you can't even

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.580 
just horrible at range you can't even
deal<00:01:06.950> some<00:01:07.430> damage<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.850> an<00:01:08.150> enemy<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.110> you

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
deal some damage to an enemy so you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.560 
deal some damage to an enemy so you
either<00:01:09.860> need<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.580> use<00:01:10.880> suppressor<00:01:11.420> which

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
either need to use suppressor which

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.620 
either need to use suppressor which
reduces<00:01:12.080> your<00:01:12.440> damage<00:01:13.180> but<00:01:14.180> gives<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.600> a

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
reduces your damage but gives you a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.010 
reduces your damage but gives you a
small<00:01:14.960> range<00:01:15.680> or<00:01:15.980> again<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.180> need<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.420> be

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
small range or again you need to be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.670 
small range or again you need to be
really<00:01:18.410> close<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:18.920> violet<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.640> kill<00:01:19.970> him

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
really close to violet to kill him

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.040 
really close to violet to kill him
scatter<00:01:21.680> shot<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.220> useful<00:01:22.970> for<00:01:23.000> team<00:01:23.750> with

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
scatter shot is useful for team with

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.530 
scatter shot is useful for team with
large<00:01:24.290> groups<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.920> grants<00:01:25.730> or<00:01:25.880> specials

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
large groups of grants or specials

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.570 
large groups of grants or specials
because<00:01:26.690> they<00:01:27.080> easily<00:01:27.530> dive<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.100> few<00:01:28.340> pellets

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
because they easily dive a few pellets

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.230 
because they easily dive a few pellets
but<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.900> always<00:01:30.320> usually<00:01:30.740> use<00:01:31.240> extended
