00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
before you cook it I actually would

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.920 
before you cook it I actually would
microwave<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.180> warm<00:00:54.449> before<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
microwave it so it's warm before you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
microwave it so it's warm before you
start<00:00:55.140> stir<00:00:55.289> frying<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> two<00:00:57.600> key<00:00:57.809> things

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
back we're at the conclusion of the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.370 
back we're at the conclusion of the
recipe<00:04:28.370> now<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.400> think<00:04:29.610> about<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.900> probably

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
recipe now I think about it is probably

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.050 
recipe now I think about it is probably
easier<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.740> cooking<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.280> come<00:04:32.490> Baptist<00:04:32.940> you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
easier to cooking to come Baptist you

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.460 
easier to cooking to come Baptist you
have<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.300> lot<00:04:33.420> more<00:04:33.600> control<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.350> don't

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
have a lot more control and you don't

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.780 
have a lot more control and you don't
have<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.650> do<00:04:34.770> some<00:04:34.950> of<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.100> sim<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.610> was

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
have to do some of the sim and this was

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.990 
have to do some of the sim and this was
it<00:04:35.970> earlier<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:37.410> yeah<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.580> about<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.880> you

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
it earlier so yeah this is about it you

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.140 
it earlier so yeah this is about it you
should<00:04:39.030> have<00:04:39.300> tasted<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:40.260> should<00:04:40.440> taste<00:04:40.650> one

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150
