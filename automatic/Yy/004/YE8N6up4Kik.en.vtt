 Hello, dear viewers. This is Arsenuy ìceh9î Trynozhenko with a regular edition of Na`Vi tactics. 

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:23.622
 I will tell you about the map. 

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:28.760
 Players began to de_train in official matches recently. De_nuke was replaced with this map. 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.380
 This is a great bonus for Na`Vi. Since the map they canít play was removed. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 And the map, which they’ve always been good at since Counter-Strike 1.6, has been added. 

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:42.306
 Naturally, train balance and balance. 

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:45.221
 In general attack can take here 5-6 rounds. 

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:49.394
 The tactics is simple. Any team should be able to apply it. 

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:55.277
 Its throwing nades to a plant. The smokes should be thrown directly across the lines. 

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:01.538
 Smoke should cover the whole plant. Then you need to move out through the Middle + down ladder. 

00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:07.263
 I wouldn’t like to move away from the Middle Ages, since it seems to me to useless. 

00:01:07.498 --> 00:01:11.493
 I love you to be able to help. 

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:16.753
 I think this option is better. 

00:01:17.394 --> 00:01:20.609
 WellÖ tactics is simple. Nades.
