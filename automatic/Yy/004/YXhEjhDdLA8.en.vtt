00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
really liking right now because you know

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.350 
really liking right now because you know
it's<00:01:03.109> open<00:01:03.320> their<00:01:04.100> landscapes<00:01:04.670> are<00:01:04.850> beautiful

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
it's open their landscapes are beautiful

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.150 
it's open their landscapes are beautiful
and<00:01:05.690> it's<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:05.990> it's<00:01:06.200> really<00:01:06.620> interesting<00:01:06.950> to

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
and it's just it's really interesting to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.700 
and it's just it's really interesting to
see<00:01:07.280> those<00:01:07.580> non-scripted<00:01:08.710> character

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
see those non-scripted character

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.230 
see those non-scripted character
interactions<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:10.460> this<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.730> multiplayer

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
interactions and this is a multiplayer

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.140 
interactions and this is a multiplayer
game<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.740> makes<00:01:12.950> sense<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.460> it's<00:01:13.910> only

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
game so that makes sense and it's only

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.590 
game so that makes sense and it's only
access<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.540> for<00:01:15.070> $25<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:17.030> have<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.270> decide

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
access to for $25 so you have to decide

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.480 
access to for $25 so you have to decide
if<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.870> want<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.170> buy<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.500> or<00:01:18.710> not<00:01:18.770> right<00:01:19.250> now

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
if you want to buy it or not right now

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.800 
if you want to buy it or not right now
if<00:01:19.700> you're<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.909> type<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.090> person<00:01:20.210> who<00:01:20.630> buys

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
if you're the type of person who buys

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.710 
if you're the type of person who buys
maybe<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.860> know<00:01:21.979> four<00:01:22.430> or<00:01:22.549> five<00:01:22.759> games<00:01:23.060> over<00:01:23.509> a

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
period of a year you might not want to

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.469 
period of a year you might not want to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
how to making a realistic

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.069 
how to making a realistic
post-apocalyptic<00:01:40.820> textures<00:01:41.390> all<00:01:41.689> kind<00:01:41.990> of

stuff like that and I can't say in a

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.219 
stuff like that and I can't say in a
hundred<00:01:43.850> percent<00:01:43.909> faith<00:01:44.329> that<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.049> game

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
hundred percent faith that this game

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.530 
hundred percent faith that this game
will<00:01:45.320> be<00:01:45.469> completed<00:01:45.920> but<00:01:46.130> compared<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.700> most

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
will be completed but compared to most

does<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:59.000> fynch<00:01:59.390> have<00:01:59.719> a<00:02:00.049> fantastic<00:02:00.500> job<00:02:01.070> with

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
does a fynch have a fantastic job with

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.980 
does a fynch have a fantastic job with
you<00:02:02.060> know<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> realistic<00:02:02.750> looking

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
you know a realistic looking

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.499 
you know a realistic looking
post-apocalyptic<00:02:03.979> feel<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.180> can<00:02:05.329> give

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
post-apocalyptic feel and you can give

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.179 
post-apocalyptic feel and you can give
CryEngine<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.259> lot<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.530> credit<00:02:06.829> for<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:06.979> but

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
CryEngine a lot of credit for that but

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.499 
CryEngine a lot of credit for that but
you<00:02:07.250> have<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.399> get<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.729> developer<00:02:08.119> credit<00:02:08.360> too

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
you have to get the developer credit too

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.779 
you have to get the developer credit too
because<00:02:08.899> I've<00:02:09.500> watched<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.039> streams<00:02:10.340> earlier

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
because I've watched the streams earlier

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.030 
because I've watched the streams earlier
like<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.090> said<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.570> he<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:11.810> did<00:02:11.960> so<00:02:12.620> much<00:02:12.800> work

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
like I said and he just did so much work

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070 
like I said and he just did so much work
to<00:02:13.070> make<00:02:13.220> sure<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:14.210> know<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.480> map<00:02:14.840> was

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
to make sure you know this map was

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.590 
to make sure you know this map was
detailed<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.070> textures<00:02:16.610> fit<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> whole

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
detailed and the textures fit the whole

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.710 
detailed and the textures fit the whole
entire<00:02:17.950> concept<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.820> added<00:02:20.060> lighting<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
entire concept so the added lighting the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.510 
entire concept so the added lighting the
wind<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.680> know<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.920> plants<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.280> move

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
wind and you know the plants that move

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.009 
wind and you know the plants that move
as<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.760> walk<00:02:22.940> through<00:02:23.150> them<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.870> take

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
as you walk through them you can take

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.839 
as you walk through them you can take
the<00:02:24.170> guys<00:02:24.319> over<00:02:24.590> at<00:02:24.739> CryEngine<00:02:25.459> but<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.730> have

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
the guys over at CryEngine but you have

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.180 
the guys over at CryEngine but you have
to<00:02:25.970> give<00:02:26.090> some<00:02:26.390> thanks<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.410> developer<00:02:28.010> too

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
to give some thanks to the developer too

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.550 
to give some thanks to the developer too
so<00:02:28.819> we're<00:02:28.940> going<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> transition<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.599> a<00:02:29.840> night

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
so we're going to transition to a night

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.589 
so we're going to transition to a night
now<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.860> found<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.400> good<00:02:31.580> town<00:02:31.910> as<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.239> was<00:02:32.390> walking

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
now I found a good town as I was walking

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.660 
now I found a good town as I was walking
which<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.290> good<00:02:33.560> example<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.280> level<00:02:34.459> of

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
which is a good example of the level of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
which is a good example of the level of
detail

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
detail

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.510 
detail
the<00:02:35.810> realism<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.320> these<00:02:36.470> environments<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.310> if

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
the realism of these environments so if

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.610 
the realism of these environments so if
you<00:02:37.910> walk<00:02:38.060> down<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.330> street<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.810> can<00:02:39.350> really

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
you walk down the street you can really

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.190 
you walk down the street you can really
feel<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:40.130> sense<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.000> know<00:02:41.030> brokenness

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
feel a sense of you know brokenness

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.590 
feel a sense of you know brokenness
there's<00:02:42.430> overgrowth<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.640> grafts<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.330> leaves

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
there's overgrowth of grafts and leaves

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.390 
there's overgrowth of grafts and leaves
and<00:02:44.990> then<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.110> houses<00:02:45.530> are<00:02:45.680> overgrown<00:02:46.160> with

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
and then the houses are overgrown with

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.430 
and then the houses are overgrown with
all<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.940> vegetation<00:02:47.120> too<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.170> I'll<00:02:48.260> give<00:02:48.410> a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
all that vegetation too and I'll give a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.590 
all that vegetation too and I'll give a
better<00:02:48.680> example<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.610> daylight<00:02:50.180> later<00:02:50.480> in

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
better example in the daylight later in

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.010 
better example in the daylight later in
this<00:02:50.660> video

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
this video

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.140 
this video
but<00:02:51.740> as<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:51.980> walk<00:02:52.130> into<00:02:52.340> these<00:02:52.520> homes<00:02:52.850> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
but as you walk into these homes the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.180 
but as you walk into these homes the
interiors<00:02:53.720> really<00:02:54.110> follow<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.530> same<00:02:54.980> concept

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
interiors really follow the same concept

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.910 
interiors really follow the same concept
there's<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:55.970> there's<00:02:56.690> garbage<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.590> dirt

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
there's a there's garbage and dirt

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.100 
there's a there's garbage and dirt
everywhere<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:59.090> all<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.540> objects<00:02:59.960> are

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
everywhere like all the objects are

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.290 
everywhere like all the objects are
broken<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.740> then<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.280> have<00:03:01.460> grass<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.120> vines

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
broken and then you have grass and vines

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.270 
broken and then you have grass and vines
growing<00:03:02.810> all<00:03:03.200> over<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.440> place<00:03:03.620> even<00:03:03.860> inside

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
growing all over the place even inside

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.520 
growing all over the place even inside
which<00:03:04.700> I'm<00:03:05.120> really<00:03:05.540> happy<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.990> see<00:03:06.140> something

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
which I'm really happy to see something

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.110 
which I'm really happy to see something
like<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.760> know<00:03:07.850> there's<00:03:08.000> not<00:03:08.090> a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
like that and you know there's not a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.940 
like that and you know there's not a
huge<00:03:08.360> variety<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.840> houses<00:03:09.080> right<00:03:09.410> now<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:09.740> it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
huge variety of houses right now but it

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.160 
huge variety of houses right now but it
should<00:03:10.010> be<00:03:10.370> enough<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.610> keep<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.850> satisfied

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
should be enough to keep you satisfied

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.870 
should be enough to keep you satisfied
at<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.470> moment<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.550> was<00:03:13.640> walking

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
at the moment and it and I was walking

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.400 
at the moment and it and I was walking
as<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.210> was<00:03:14.330> walking<00:03:14.450> down<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.840> street<00:03:15.200> I

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
as I was walking down the street I

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.810 
as I was walking down the street I
haven't<00:03:15.950> found<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.280> house<00:03:16.520> that<00:03:16.700> they

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
haven't found this house that they

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.150 
haven't found this house that they
barricade<00:03:17.690> in<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.960> which<00:03:18.140> was<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:19.040> cool

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
barricade in it which was a really cool

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.440 
barricade in it which was a really cool
idea<00:03:19.280> maybe<00:03:19.610> we'll<00:03:19.790> see<00:03:19.940> something<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:20.300> this

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
idea maybe we'll see something like this

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.210 
idea maybe we'll see something like this
in<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.690> future<00:03:20.960> it<00:03:21.080> can<00:03:21.170> actually<00:03:21.350> build

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
in the future it can actually build

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.910 
in the future it can actually build
these<00:03:22.400> barricade<00:03:22.970> yourself<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.560> walk

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
these barricade yourself and then I walk

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.140 
these barricade yourself and then I walk
down<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.340> road<00:03:25.490> even<00:03:25.610> more<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.000> hit<00:03:26.120> a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
down the road even more and I hit a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.450 
down the road even more and I hit a
supermarket<00:03:27.020> down<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.650> road<00:03:27.800> which<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.100> found

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
supermarket down the road which I found

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.030 
supermarket down the road which I found
very<00:03:28.700> similar<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.390> supermarket<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.500> saw<00:03:30.740> in

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
very similar to a supermarket I saw in

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
played in a game at the moment so we'll

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.360

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
something really interesting about the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.050 
something really interesting about the
lighting<00:04:03.440> in<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:03.620> game<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:04.070> notice<00:04:04.880> what

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
lighting in this game so notice what

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.000 
lighting in this game so notice what
happens<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.690> light<00:04:05.930> as<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.290> walk<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.860> this

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
happens to the light as I walk on this

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.930 
happens to the light as I walk on this
bridge<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.680> game<00:04:12.860> got<00:04:13.070> darker<00:04:13.519> right<00:04:13.670> and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
bridge the game got darker right and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.390 
bridge the game got darker right and
that's<00:04:14.300> because<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:15.080> Sun<00:04:15.410> actually<00:04:16.280> went

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
that's because the Sun actually went

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.979 
that's because the Sun actually went
behind<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.700> cloud<00:04:16.940> I've<00:04:17.299> never<00:04:17.480> actually<00:04:17.690> seen

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
behind a cloud I've never actually seen

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.090 
behind a cloud I've never actually seen
this<00:04:18.080> before<00:04:18.260> in<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.470> game<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.680> was<00:04:18.769> walking<00:04:19.070> I

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
this before in a game I was walking I

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.590 
this before in a game I was walking I
was<00:04:19.190> like<00:04:19.280> why<00:04:19.430> did<00:04:19.580> it<00:04:19.669> just<00:04:19.700> get<00:04:19.970> dimmer<00:04:20.299> like

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
was like why did it just get dimmer like

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.990 
was like why did it just get dimmer like
whoa<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:21.560> actually<00:04:22.040> happened<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:22.460> I've

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
whoa this actually happened so I've

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.430 
whoa this actually happened so I've
never<00:04:23.210> seen<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.570> before<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.110> that's<00:04:24.260> a

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
never seen that before so that's a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.210 
never seen that before so that's a
really<00:04:24.680> cool<00:04:25.870> implementation<00:04:27.070> now<00:04:28.070> that's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
really cool implementation now that's

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.620 
really cool implementation now that's
most<00:04:28.430> like<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.669> feature<00:04:28.910> that<00:04:29.030> came<00:04:29.419> from

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
most like a feature that came from

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.050 
most like a feature that came from
crying<00:04:30.200> ship<00:04:30.440> but<00:04:30.560> either<00:04:30.650> way<00:04:30.890> it's<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:32.000> a

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
crying ship but either way it's a it's a

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.700 
crying ship but either way it's a it's a
really<00:04:32.270> interesting<00:04:32.630> addition<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.410> my

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
really interesting addition in my

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.680 
really interesting addition in my
opinion<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.280> if<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:34.880> follow<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.300> pathway

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
opinion and if you follow the pathway

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.390 
opinion and if you follow the pathway
from<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.020> bridge<00:04:36.230> there's<00:04:37.040> another<00:04:37.160> good

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
from this bridge there's another good

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.640 
from this bridge there's another good
example<00:04:37.460> of<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.120> diverse<00:04:38.840> vegetation<00:04:39.080> in

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
example of the diverse vegetation in

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.530 
example of the diverse vegetation in
this<00:04:39.710> game<00:04:39.950> there's<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.400> ton<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:40.970> different

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
this game there's a ton of different

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.510 
this game there's a ton of different
types<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.930> plants<00:04:42.320> then<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.770> have<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:43.040> sounds

following<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.729> path<00:05:06.969> and<00:05:07.270> was<00:05:07.539> eventually

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:07.749 
following the path and was eventually

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.290 
following the path and was eventually
led<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.139> some<00:05:08.620> houses<00:05:08.860> on<00:05:09.189> the<00:05:09.309> water<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:09.909> I

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
led to some houses on the water and I

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.790 
led to some houses on the water and I
think<00:05:10.479> this<00:05:10.599> would<00:05:10.960> be<00:05:10.990> like<00:05:11.229> a<00:05:11.259> really<00:05:11.499> cool

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
think this would be like a really cool

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.739 
think this would be like a really cool
spot<00:05:12.099> if<00:05:12.339> there<00:05:12.490> were<00:05:12.580> bases<00:05:13.089> implemented<00:05:13.569> so

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:13.749 
spot if there were bases implemented so

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.299 
spot if there were bases implemented so
if<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:13.930> could<00:05:14.080> like<00:05:14.259> barricade<00:05:14.770> these<00:05:14.889> houses

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:15.309 
if you could like barricade these houses

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:16.829 
if you could like barricade these houses
on<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.490> lakes<00:05:15.699> you<00:05:15.939> can<00:05:16.330> kind<00:05:16.509> of<00:05:16.599> make<00:05:16.719> this

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:16.839 
on the lakes you can kind of make this

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.110 
on the lakes you can kind of make this
whole<00:05:17.050> entire<00:05:17.379> like<00:05:17.680> 200<00:05:18.580> foot<00:05:18.699> radius

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
whole entire like 200 foot radius

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.929 
whole entire like 200 foot radius
your<00:05:19.509> owner<00:05:19.870> or<00:05:20.050> your<00:05:20.169> team's<00:05:20.439> own<00:05:20.710> area<00:05:21.669> and

there's a lot of farms too you could

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.439 
there's a lot of farms too you could
probably<00:05:23.529> do<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.889> same<00:05:23.919> thing<00:05:24.210> they're<00:05:25.210> very

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449
