00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
high then our hands hand positions and

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.670 
high then our hands hand positions and
positions<00:00:51.699> they<00:00:51.820> can<00:00:52.000> be<00:00:52.090> together<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:53.500> can

positions they can be together they can

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.720 
positions they can be together they can
be<00:00:53.770> crossed<00:00:54.040> and<00:00:54.640> they<00:00:55.120> can<00:00:55.300> be<00:00:55.330> wide<00:00:55.690> apart

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

be crossed and they can be wide apart
okay<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.000> then<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:59.010> pattern<00:01:00.010> itself<00:01:00.370> within

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
okay and then the pattern itself within

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.920 
okay and then the pattern itself within
one<00:01:00.910> hand<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:02.140> know<00:01:02.290> closed<00:01:02.800> position<00:01:03.930> medium

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930

one hand you know closed position medium
position<00:01:05.850> Y<00:01:06.850> position<00:01:07.770> extra<00:01:08.770> white<00:01:10.560> okay<00:01:11.560> so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
position Y position extra white okay so

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.130 
position Y position extra white okay so
then<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.369> just<00:01:12.550> combined<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.899> now<00:01:14.050> I'm
