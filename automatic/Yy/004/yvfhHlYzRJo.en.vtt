different<00:00:44.579> routers<00:00:45.030> that's<00:00:45.329> why<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.510> IP

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
different routers that's why the IP

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
different routers that's why the IP
addresses<00:00:46.350> are<00:00:46.469> different<00:00:46.850> but<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.239> one

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
addresses are different but this one

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
addresses are different but this one
here<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.930> wireless<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.910> top<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.329> is

my wire you can actually tell if it says

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.900 
my wire you can actually tell if it says
ethernet<00:00:53.370> controller<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.670> wired

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
ethernet controller so I like wired

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.160 
ethernet controller so I like wired

moment just put these bolt the medium

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.420 
moment just put these bolt the medium
your<00:04:03.690> trusted<00:04:04.110> zone<00:04:04.320> or<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.680> keep<00:04:04.860> on<00:04:05.010> medium

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
your trusted zone or we keep on medium

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.370 
your trusted zone or we keep on medium
and<00:04:06.360> your<00:04:06.480> public<00:04:06.780> if<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.989> want<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.200> block

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
and your public if you want to block

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.930 
and your public if you want to block
connections<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.100> want<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.340> put<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.610> too<00:04:08.730> high

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
connections you want to put it too high

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.370 
connections you want to put it too high
if<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.420> want<00:04:09.600> allow<00:04:09.810> connections<00:04:10.260> through

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
if you want allow connections through

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.180 
if you want allow connections through
you<00:04:10.470> put<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.769> medium<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.530> next<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.010> go<00:04:14.130> to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you put it to medium so next to go to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.090 
you put it to medium so next to go to
view<00:04:14.430> zones

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.770 

okay<00:04:18.459> since<00:04:18.730> I<00:04:18.790> have<00:04:18.880> two<00:04:19.000> routers<00:04:19.270> they<00:04:19.630> both

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
okay since I have two routers they both

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.110 
okay since I have two routers they both
show<00:04:19.959> up<00:04:19.990> here<00:04:20.260> make<00:04:20.890> sure<00:04:20.920> all<00:04:21.340> your<00:04:21.910> router

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
show up here make sure all your router

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.640 
show up here make sure all your router
show<00:04:22.480> up<00:04:22.570> as<00:04:22.690> public<00:04:25.170> so<00:04:26.170> let's<00:04:26.350> change<00:04:26.440> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
show up as public so let's change that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.500 
show up as public so let's change that
so<00:04:26.830> they're<00:04:26.950> both<00:04:27.040> public<00:04:27.430> now<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:28.300> want<00:04:28.450> to

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
so they're both public now you want to

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.130 
so they're both public now you want to
go<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.630> add<00:04:28.920> IP<00:04:29.920> range<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:31.450> we're<00:04:31.900> going<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.080> do

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
go to add IP range and we're going to do

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.000 
go to add IP range and we're going to do
the<00:04:32.230> xbox<00:04:32.560> live<00:04:32.770> server<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.400> it's<00:04:33.550> 65<00:04:34.480> dot<00:04:35.010> 5542

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
the xbox live server so it's 65 dot 5542

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.910 
the xbox live server so it's 65 dot 5542
dot<00:04:36.610> 0<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.510> at<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.690> end<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:38.050> want<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.320> do<00:04:38.410> 65

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
dot 0 and at the end you want to do 65

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.320 
dot 0 and at the end you want to do 65
255<00:04:39.600> 42<00:04:40.600> 255<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.860> let's<00:04:42.640> say<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.730> xbox<00:04:43.180> live

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
255 42 255 and let's say that xbox live

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.150 
255 42 255 and let's say that xbox live
servers<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:46.500> next<00:04:47.500> one<00:04:47.650> we're<00:04:47.890> going<00:04:47.980> to<00:04:48.070> be

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
servers and next one we're going to be

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.520 
servers and next one we're going to be
doing<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:49.180> black<00:04:49.420> ops<00:04:49.570> 2<00:04:49.810> servers<00:04:50.200> or

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
doing the black ops 2 servers or

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.820 
doing the black ops 2 servers or
actually<00:04:50.830> it's<00:04:50.950> all<00:04:51.040> called<00:04:51.310> servers<00:04:51.700> it's

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
actually it's all called servers it's

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.950 
actually it's all called servers it's

if you wait long enough you'll actually

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.390 
if you wait long enough you'll actually
pull<00:05:42.610> your<00:05:42.730> own<00:05:42.760> lobby<00:05:43.950> I'll<00:05:44.950> show<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.310> that

it's<00:05:45.640> actually<00:05:45.760> blocking<00:05:46.150> because<00:05:46.480> if<00:05:46.600> you

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
it's actually blocking because if you

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.280 
it's actually blocking because if you
just<00:05:46.870> turn<00:05:47.290> this<00:05:47.410> to<00:05:47.560> medium<00:05:47.950> you'll<00:05:48.820> start<00:05:49.030> IP

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
just turn this to medium you'll start IP

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.290 
just turn this to medium you'll start IP

 a sourcing IP showing up as you
see<00:05:52.420> right<00:05:52.450> there<00:05:52.750> in<00:05:53.500> almost<00:05:53.680> a<00:05:53.830> lot<00:05:53.920> faster

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
see right there in almost a lot faster

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.920 
see right there in almost a lot faster
kind<00:05:55.570> of<00:05:55.600> weird<00:05:56.580> so<00:05:57.580> if<00:05:57.940> you<00:05:58.060> right-click<00:05:58.390> hit

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
kind of weird so if you right-click hit

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.880 
kind of weird so if you right-click hit
remove<00:05:59.200> all<00:05:59.550> then<00:06:00.550> delete<00:06:01.000> all<00:06:01.120> entries<00:06:01.890> that
