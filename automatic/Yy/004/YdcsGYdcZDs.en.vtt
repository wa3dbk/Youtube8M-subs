00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.200 

and<00:04:26.290> then<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.160> would<00:04:27.670> take<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.270> here<00:04:30.060> put<00:04:31.060> it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
and then I would take this here put it

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.940 
and then I would take this here put it
under<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:32.020> one<00:04:32.940> fold<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.510> then<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.710> can

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
under this one fold it and then I can

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
take a glue dot and the reason because I

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.420
