00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.860
 do not want to compete and be disciplined 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.319
 It helps you a lot to be well as 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.210
 person and the stadium clear incompetence 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.009

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.840
 foreigners have an idol 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.090
 Australian that ends several times 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.350
 world champion actually if he is one 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.830
 of the best level runners 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.810
 world 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.960
 the name of the stand hill my track 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.789
 favorite is one that is left in esczu by 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.100
 the neighborhood el carmen called the caÃ±o 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.600
 they are the most dangerous tracks and more 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.819
 fast country has a section of 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.450
 many stones and it's actually the best 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.190
 from the country 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.509
 Many people believe that this sport is a 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.429
 very expensive sport and do not want it 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.170
 practice for the same thing on the contrary is 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.230
 a sport that you can practice with 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.420
 any mountain bike 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.000
 little by little the position modifying to 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.190
 the right grounds and what it is 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.959
 necessary is a closed helmet that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.810
 protect the entire jaw with a helmet 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.450
 motorcycle knee pads and gloves as 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.430
 principal that it is recommended that you use a 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.860
 beginner person in the down on 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.049

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.040
 work in which I feel very free and 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.390
 always thinking about the crisis in a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.400
