machine ever built is finally going to
turn<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.110> take<00:00:40.260> two<00:00:40.469> things<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
turn on you take two things and you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
turn on you take two things and you
smash<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:41.879> together<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
smash them together you get a lot of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.990 
smash them together you get a lot of
stuff<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.100> collision<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.760> try

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
stuff out of that collision and you try

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
stuff out of that collision and you try
to<00:00:45.079> understand<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.379> stuff<00:00:46.649> could<00:00:47.250> be

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to understand that stuff could be

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
to understand that stuff could be
nothing<00:00:47.610> other<00:00:48.120> than<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.500> understanding

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
nothing other than just understanding

nothing other than just understanding
everything<00:00:51.230> little<00:00:52.230> did<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
everything little did I know and I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
everything little did I know and I
started<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> experiments<00:00:54.930> would<00:00:55.050> take

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
started that the experiments would take

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.160 
started that the experiments would take
30<00:00:55.590> years<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.219> Here<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.699> am<00:00:56.789> still<00:00:57.480> not<00:00:57.840> knowing

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
30 years and Here I am still not knowing

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.090 
30 years and Here I am still not knowing
I<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.980> want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.609> truth<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
I really want to know the truth the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.080 
I really want to know the truth the
first<00:01:02.219> time<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> ever<00:01:02.550> saw<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
