61 so it's one over sixty one is your

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.840 
61 so it's one over sixty one is your
shutter<00:00:54.719> speed<00:00:54.809> okay<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> go

again<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> play<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.659> biggest<00:01:30.840> role

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
again is going to play the biggest role

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.420 
again is going to play the biggest role
in<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
in that and that's going to be a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.859 
in that and that's going to be a
thousand<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> way<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> eight

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
thousand all the way up to eight

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
thousand all the way up to eight
thousand<00:01:34.380> sometimes<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> need<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> max<00:01:35.579> out

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
thousand sometimes you need to max out

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450 
thousand sometimes you need to max out
your<00:01:35.820> camera<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> find<00:01:37.560> myself<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:38.159> often

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
your camera and I find myself more often

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240 
your camera and I find myself more often
than<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.640> shooting<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> lower<00:01:40.020> ISO<00:01:40.290> say

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
than not shooting it at a lower ISO say

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.999 
than not shooting it at a lower ISO say
200<00:01:41.880> millimeter<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.420> 200<00:01:42.869> ISO<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.799> then

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
200 millimeter or 200 ISO and then

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.620 
200 millimeter or 200 ISO and then
shooting<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.640> eight<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.479> get

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
shooting it to eight just so I can get

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
shooting it to eight just so I can get
that<00:01:45.780> shutter<00:01:46.049> speed<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.619> high<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that shutter speed up as high as I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.310 
that shutter speed up as high as I
possibly<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.899> some<00:01:49.110> light

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
possibly can and in some light

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.160 
possibly can and in some light
situations<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.130> low-light<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.509> extremely

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
situations like low-light it's extremely

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.840 
situations like low-light it's extremely
hard<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> freeze<00:01:52.860> action<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> end<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
hard to freeze action at the end of the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.060 
hard to freeze action at the end of the
day<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.149> you're<00:01:54.270> doing<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.750> lot<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.799> lot<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
day if you're doing a lot of a lot of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.100 
day if you're doing a lot of a lot of
horse<00:01:56.340> shows<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> races<00:01:57.450> happen<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
horse shows a lot of races happen to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.630 
horse shows a lot of races happen to
where<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.590> right<00:01:58.770> into<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.159> night<00:01:59.340> time

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
where they go right into the night time

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.789 
where they go right into the night time
and<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.540> lot<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> bigger<00:02:01.020> stadiums<00:02:01.590> have

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and a lot of the bigger stadiums have

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
and a lot of the bigger stadiums have
lights<00:02:02.130> too<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
lights too where you can actually get a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.060 
lights too where you can actually get a
higher<00:02:03.659> shutter<00:02:03.960> speed<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> freeze<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
higher shutter speed and freeze that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.219 
higher shutter speed and freeze that
action<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> shutter<00:02:06.299> speed<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.630> what<00:02:06.899> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
action but the shutter speed is what is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.749 
action but the shutter speed is what is
shutter<00:02:07.590> speed<00:02:07.680> skews<00:02:08.129> me<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.340> what<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.550> going

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
shutter speed skews me is what is going

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.910 
shutter speed skews me is what is going
to<00:02:08.879> play<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> biggest<00:02:09.509> role<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.170> freezing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
to play the biggest role in freezing

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250 
to play the biggest role in freezing
action<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.120> situation<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.200> would

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
action so in that situation you would

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.700 
action so in that situation you would
basically

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
basically

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710 
basically
make<00:02:13.800> an<00:02:13.920> equation<00:02:14.190> shutter<00:02:15.030> speed<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.450> first

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
make an equation shutter speed is first

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
make an equation shutter speed is first
as<00:02:15.930> top<00:02:16.170> priority<00:02:16.350> followed<00:02:17.130> by<00:02:17.220> your

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
as top priority followed by your

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.010 
as top priority followed by your
aperture<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> good<00:02:18.360> exposure<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
aperture to get the good exposure and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.320 
aperture to get the good exposure and
then<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> want<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.500> ISO<00:02:20.040> after<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.610> adjust

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
then you want the ISO after that adjust

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.030 
then you want the ISO after that adjust
your<00:02:21.450> ISO<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> detail<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> image

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
your ISO to get the detail in the image

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.900 
your ISO to get the detail in the image
and<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.310> adjust<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.730> white<00:02:23.880> balance

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and then you adjust the white balance

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.120 
and then you adjust the white balance
for<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> color<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.410> that's<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.770> basically

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
for the color so that's the basically

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.760 
for the color so that's the basically
the<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.660> algorithm<00:02:27.660> or<00:02:27.840> recipe<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.590> get<00:02:28.740> a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the the algorithm or recipe to get a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.890 
the the algorithm or recipe to get a
solid<00:02:29.070> exposure<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.360> want<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.660> stop

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
solid exposure if you want to stop

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900 
solid exposure if you want to stop
