00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
think he was crying because of the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.420 
think he was crying because of the
implications<00:03:44.800> of<00:03:44.890> what<00:03:44.950> had<00:03:45.190> just<00:03:45.220> happened

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
know bad when Vincent Brett has such a

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.690 
know bad when Vincent Brett has such a
relationship<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.390> because<00:05:36.510> of<00:05:36.950> how<00:05:37.950> the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
relationship and because of how the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.730

sport has really escalated into the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.659 
sport has really escalated into the
entertainment<00:05:41.160> field<00:05:41.790> and<00:05:42.650> money<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:44.070> I

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
entertainment field and money and I

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.260 
entertainment field and money and I
guess<00:05:45.360> ethics<00:05:46.140> are<00:05:46.460> monies<00:05:47.460> in<00:05:47.640> ethics<00:05:48.090> are

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
guess ethics are monies in ethics are

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.190 
guess ethics are monies in ethics are
out<00:05:48.390> but<00:05:49.280> bottom<00:05:50.280> line<00:05:50.520> is<00:05:50.910> that<00:05:51.570> if<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:52.080> were

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
out but bottom line is that if you were

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.780 
out but bottom line is that if you were
Vince<00:05:52.440> McMahon<00:05:52.950> and<00:05:53.160> I<00:05:53.220> think<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.550> more<00:05:53.760> time

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
Vince McMahon and I think the more time

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.240 
Vince McMahon and I think the more time
separates<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:55.320> event<00:05:55.740> from<00:05:55.980> what<00:05:56.130> had
