live comm kind of tutorial here on where

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.570 
live comm kind of tutorial here on where
to<00:00:06.899> find<00:00:07.080> all<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.410> these<00:00:07.589> guys<00:00:07.980> right<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
to find all of these guys right here the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.549 
to find all of these guys right here the
key<00:00:08.730> usually<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.540> spot<00:00:09.809> if<00:00:10.260> it's<00:00:10.410> not

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
key usually is on the spot if it's not

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.690 
key usually is on the spot if it's not
on<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.860> spot<00:00:11.099> right<00:00:11.250> here<00:00:11.309> there's<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> whole

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
on this spot right here there's a whole

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.919 
on this spot right here there's a whole
bunch<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.969> places<00:00:12.090> through<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> map<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:12.840> it

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
bunch of places through the map that it

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:13.999 
bunch of places through the map that it
could<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.259> let's<00:00:13.410> go<00:00:13.500> try<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> find<00:00:13.920> them

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
could be so let's go try to find them

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.650 
could be so let's go try to find them
and<00:00:14.160> basically<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> little<00:00:15.420> thing<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and basically it's a little thing with a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.910 
and basically it's a little thing with a
star<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.170> hook<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.500> star<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.830> them

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
star the hook with the star on them

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.590 
star the hook with the star on them
anywhere<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.550> find<00:00:17.789> them<00:00:17.880> with

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
anywhere that you can find them with

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.790 
anywhere that you can find them with
that<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.020> I'm<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> go<00:00:19.380> ahead<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.650> start

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that so I'm going to go ahead and start

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.349 
that so I'm going to go ahead and start
over<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.220> left<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.730> go<00:00:20.820> upstairs

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
over here on the left and go upstairs

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.370 
over here on the left and go upstairs
and<00:00:22.250> jump<00:00:23.250> across<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:24.269> now<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.050> sometimes

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and jump across here now that sometimes

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.689 
and jump across here now that sometimes
a<00:00:25.500> key<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.769> right<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:26.490> hooks

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
a key can be right on one of these hooks

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.169 
a key can be right on one of these hooks
here<00:00:27.150> that's<00:00:27.840> two<00:00:28.140> places<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.769> far<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.310> don't

side I've never actually found one up
here<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:14.010> sometimes<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.880> usually

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
here on this side sometimes it usually

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.969 
here on this side sometimes it usually
spawns<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.259> two<00:01:16.470> two<00:01:16.860> or

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
spawns in like one of like two two or

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
spawns in like one of like two two or
three<00:01:17.100> places<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> doesn't<00:01:17.939> always<00:01:18.060> spawn

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
three places so it doesn't always spawn

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.929 
three places so it doesn't always spawn
all<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.320> spots<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.400> there's<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
all these spots it just it's there's a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.810 
all these spots it just it's there's a
possibility<00:01:21.570> yeah<00:01:22.200> some<00:01:22.409> nut<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.950> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
possibility yeah some nut up here so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.690 
possibility yeah some nut up here so
that<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.780> spot<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.590> there's<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.159> over

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that was for spot then there's one over

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.330 
that was for spot then there's one over
here<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.810> one's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.170> tricky

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
here this one's a little tricky

think that there are any keys is a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.690 
think that there are any keys is a
church<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:19.200> candy<00:02:19.500> shop<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.130> barn<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the key could be any of the other

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.300 
the key could be any of the other
buildings<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> found<00:02:24.750> at<00:02:24.870> least<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.680> so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
nope nope that's not a spot that's a

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.900 
nope nope that's not a spot that's a
mystery<00:02:39.240> box<00:02:39.390> location<00:02:39.960> back<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.910> don't

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
mystery box location back there I don't

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.040 
mystery box location back there I don't
think<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.150> there's<00:02:42.300> any<00:02:42.480> other<00:02:42.600> spots<00:02:42.870> over

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
think that there's any other spots over

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.900 
think that there's any other spots over
here<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:46.220> for<00:02:47.220> good<00:02:47.340> measure<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.670> don't

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
here and for a for good measure I don't

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.250 
here and for a for good measure I don't
think<00:02:48.090> there's<00:02:48.210> any<00:02:48.360> spots<00:02:48.660> back<00:02:48.870> here<00:02:49.110> either

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
think there's any spots back here either

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.800 
think there's any spots back here either
back<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> beginning<00:02:51.330> area<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:51.780> I

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
back at the at the beginning area but I

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.300 
back at the at the beginning area but I
guess<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.230> should<00:02:52.380> double-check<00:02:52.590> really<00:02:53.010> quick

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
guess I should double-check really quick

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.380 
guess I should double-check really quick
because<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.400> never<00:02:56.520> know<00:02:56.730> sometimes<00:02:57.240> they

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
because you never know sometimes they

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.290 
because you never know sometimes they
could<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:57.630> them<00:02:57.780> back<00:02:57.960> at<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.940> area

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
could have them back at the this area

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
could have them back at the this area
right<00:03:00.420> here<00:03:00.480> where<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.020> quick
