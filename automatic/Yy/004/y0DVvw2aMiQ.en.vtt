00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
when I have an implant which is like a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.070 
when I have an implant which is like a
hearing<00:02:36.490> aid

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.870 

anyway

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.690 

I<00:02:43.970> noticed<00:02:44.750> they<00:02:44.840> move<00:02:45.080> around<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.800> so

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700
