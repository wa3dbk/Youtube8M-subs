I life is falling for a demonstration

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.760 
I life is falling for a demonstration
because<00:00:27.350> she's<00:00:27.920> really<00:00:28.369> small<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:28.910> thin<00:00:29.180> and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
because she's really small and thin and

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.619 
because she's really small and thin and
he<00:00:30.770> can't<00:00:30.980> use<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.460> lot<00:00:31.699> of<00:00:31.730> body<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.210> eat<00:00:32.329> a<00:00:32.419> shot

ball
and<00:02:13.780> look<00:02:13.930> at<00:02:13.990> this<00:02:14.080> massive<00:02:14.410> fault<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:15.160> don't

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and look at this massive fault I don't

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.950 
and look at this massive fault I don't
like<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.850> massive<00:02:16.240> Moorhead<00:02:16.570> fall<00:02:16.750> through

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
like this massive Moorhead fall through

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.870 
like this massive Moorhead fall through
kind<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.200> than<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.440> doll<00:02:17.590> thing<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.700> let's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
kind of than the doll thing but let's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.400 
kind of than the doll thing but let's
give<00:02:19.030> her<00:02:19.090> good<00:02:19.180> topspin<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.170> know<00:02:20.380> I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
give her good topspin so you know I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.730 
give her good topspin so you know I
think<00:02:20.590> that's<00:02:20.860> why<00:02:20.950> she<00:02:21.070> does<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.740> it's

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
think that's why she does it and it's

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.020 
think that's why she does it and it's
that's<00:02:24.040> kind<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.310> new<00:02:24.490> school<00:02:24.760> because<00:02:24.910> no

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that's kind of new school because no

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.130 
that's kind of new school because no
everyone<00:02:25.300> talks<00:02:25.450> about<00:02:25.540> hanging<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:25.930> new

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
everyone talks about hanging that new

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.230 
everyone talks about hanging that new
confident<00:02:27.010> follow<00:02:27.190> through<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:28.000> swing

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
confident follow through the swing

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.780 
confident follow through the swing
completely<00:02:28.480> now<00:02:29.370> she<00:02:30.370> comes<00:02:30.580> through<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
completely now she comes through the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.750 
completely now she comes through the
ball<00:02:30.970> with<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.630> rapid<00:02:32.140> racket<00:02:33.130> acceleration

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
ball with a rapid racket acceleration

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.840 
ball with a rapid racket acceleration
and<00:02:34.800> then<00:02:35.800> go<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.040> another<00:02:36.160> shot<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:36.790> a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
and then go to another shot just a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.630 
and then go to another shot just a
little<00:02:37.030> higher<00:02:37.240> ball<00:02:37.540> no<00:02:38.070> same<00:02:39.070> setup<00:02:39.340> and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
little higher ball no same setup and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.250 
little higher ball no same setup and
come<00:02:39.880> right<00:02:40.060> through<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.480> shot<00:02:40.750> come<00:02:41.050> over

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
come right through the shot come over

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.210 
come right through the shot come over
top<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.940> very<00:02:43.090> consistent<00:02:43.570> with<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.750> swing

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
top it's very consistent with this swing

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.770 
top it's very consistent with this swing
comes<00:02:45.220> over<00:02:45.370> top<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.850> don't<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.690> because

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
comes over top I don't like it because

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.480 
comes over top I don't like it because
it's<00:02:46.960> kind<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.260> big<00:02:47.470> backswing<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.310> think

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
it's kind of a big backswing and I think

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.730 
it's kind of a big backswing and I think
she<00:02:48.640> had<00:02:48.790> 41<00:02:49.090> they<00:02:49.210> hit<00:02:49.330> hard<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.660> her<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.530> she

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
she had 41 they hit hard to her but she

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.880 
she had 41 they hit hard to her but she
probably<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.280> about<00:02:51.550> five<00:02:52.030> feet<00:02:52.240> tall<00:02:52.570> and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
probably is about five feet tall and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.460 
probably is about five feet tall and
about<00:02:53.890> 90<00:02:54.460> pounds<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.240> she's<00:02:55.450> about<00:02:57.090> 150

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
about 90 pounds so she's about 150

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.230 
about 90 pounds so she's about 150
centimeters<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.740> she's<00:03:00.070> probably<00:03:00.280> about<00:03:00.490> 40

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
centimeters and she's probably about 40

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.070 
centimeters and she's probably about 40
kilos<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:03.060> what<00:03:04.060> he<00:03:04.360> learned<00:03:04.540> from<00:03:04.570> her<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:04.870> you

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
kilos so what he learned from her is you

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.140 
kilos so what he learned from her is you
want<00:03:05.260> maximize<00:03:05.860> your<00:03:06.040> swing<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.730> your<00:03:06.820> body

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
want maximize your swing with your body

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:17.270 
want maximize your swing with your body
and<00:03:07.510> use<00:03:07.660> your<00:03:07.810> body<00:03:07.960> at<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.170> shot

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:50.160 

you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.230 

you
