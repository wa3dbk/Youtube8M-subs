that<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> pretty<00:01:07.920> much<00:01:08.100> where<00:01:08.369> our<00:01:08.549> chin<00:01:08.850> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that is pretty much where our chin is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
that is pretty much where our chin is
going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.140> wondering<00:01:10.170> how

going to be now if you're wondering how
far<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.280> should<00:01:11.520> go<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
far down you should go to get to the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.469 
far down you should go to get to the
chin<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.350> about<00:01:13.830> one-third<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> length

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
chin it's about one-third of the length

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
chin it's about one-third of the length
of<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> circle<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> draw<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> chin

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of the circle and now you draw the chin

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210 
of the circle and now you draw the chin
in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> jawbone<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:19.110> about<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> chin<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
in the jawbone now about the chin you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.460 
in the jawbone now about the chin you
can<00:01:20.430> draw<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> pretty<00:01:21.689> much<00:01:21.780> whatever<00:01:22.140> way

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470

can draw it and pretty much whatever way
you<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.460> draw<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.729> more<00:01:24.000> pointy

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
you want you can draw it more pointy

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.469 
you want you can draw it more pointy
more<00:01:24.900> flat<00:01:25.500> bigger<00:01:26.009> smaller<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.330> up

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
more flat bigger smaller it's really up

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.810 
more flat bigger smaller it's really up
to<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:27.930> style<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.380> drawing

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
to you and your style of drawing

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.950 
to you and your style of drawing
afterwards<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.060> rid<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.270> some<00:01:30.450> stuff<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
afterwards we get rid of some stuff and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.719 
afterwards we get rid of some stuff and
then<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:31.530> down<00:01:31.740> where<00:01:32.009> our<00:01:32.130> eyes<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
then we put down where our eyes and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
then we put down where our eyes and
where<00:01:32.909> our<00:01:33.060> mouths<00:01:33.270> are<00:01:33.509> gonna<00:01:33.689> pee<00:01:33.900> now<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
where our mouths are gonna pee now the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
where our mouths are gonna pee now the
mouth<00:01:35.009> height<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
mouth height is going to be

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.940 
mouth height is going to be
approximately<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> jawbone

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
approximately that of what the jawbone

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.789 
approximately that of what the jawbone
is<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> ends<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> hide<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.530> gonna

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
is when it ends and the I hide is gonna

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
is when it ends and the I hide is gonna
be<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.700> around<00:01:41.850> where<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> circle

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
be right around where the circle

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
be right around where the circle
originally<00:01:43.680> separated<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> downward

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
originally separated from the downward

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
originally separated from the downward
curve<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.509> drew<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> face<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
curve we drew for the face and now that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
curve we drew for the face and now that
we<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.549> base<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> head<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.810> head

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
we have the base for the head this head

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.870 
we have the base for the head this head
is<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.860> our<00:01:50.070> measurement<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
is going to be our measurement for the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
is going to be our measurement for the
rest<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> body<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.960> our<00:01:52.110> body<00:01:52.350> length<00:01:52.649> is

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
rest of the body so our body length is

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.230 
rest of the body so our body length is
going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.280> two<00:01:53.520> heads<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.939> we'll<00:01:54.119> be

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
going to be two heads and we'll be

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.609 
going to be two heads and we'll be
starting<00:01:54.509> from<00:01:54.810> where<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> neck<00:01:55.380> would<00:01:55.590> be

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
starting from where the neck would be

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.560 
starting from where the neck would be
starting<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.610> end<00:01:56.850> from<00:01:57.090> our<00:01:57.299> legs

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
starting and we will end from our legs

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.899 
starting and we will end from our legs
would<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.899> starting<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.579> put<00:01:59.790> on

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
would be starting so now we can put on

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.580 
would be starting so now we can put on
the<00:02:00.060> shoulders<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> hips<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the shoulders and the hips and as you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.380 
the shoulders and the hips and as you
see<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> shoulders<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.060> wider

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
see the shoulders are a little bit wider

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.630 
see the shoulders are a little bit wider
than<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.960> hips<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.950> shoulder<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
than the hips are and one shoulder is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.950 
than the hips are and one shoulder is
wider<00:02:06.000> than<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.329> other<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:06.689> because

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
wider than the other that's because

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.990 
wider than the other that's because
we're<00:02:07.110> drawing<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.500> three<00:02:07.920> quarters<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.670> i<00:02:08.849> like

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
we're drawing a three quarters as i like

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059 
we're drawing a three quarters as i like
to<00:02:09.030> call<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.360> perspective<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.709> shoulders

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
to call it perspective and the shoulders

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.589 
to call it perspective and the shoulders
are<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> little<00:02:11.370> wider<00:02:11.700> than<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> hips<00:02:12.270> that's

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
are a little wider than the hips that's

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.630 
are a little wider than the hips that's
because<00:02:12.900> we're<00:02:13.020> going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.290> drawn

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
because we're going to be drawn

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.580 
because we're going to be drawn
man<00:02:13.910> right<00:02:14.240> now<00:02:14.270> if<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:14.810> were<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.110> be<00:02:15.200> drawing<00:02:15.470> a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
man right now if we were to be drawing a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.010 
man right now if we were to be drawing a
woman<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.100> shoulders<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.850> hips<00:02:17.210> were<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.870> be

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
woman the shoulders and hips were to be

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.980 
woman the shoulders and hips were to be
at<00:02:18.260> about<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.980> same<00:02:19.010> width<00:02:19.670> now<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
at about the same width now see the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.260 
at about the same width now see the
circles<00:02:21.410> I've<00:02:21.620> put<00:02:21.830> in<00:02:21.920> some<00:02:22.130> places<00:02:22.430> well

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
circles I've put in some places well

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.630 
circles I've put in some places well
they're<00:02:23.690> basically<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.440> indicate<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.190> end<00:02:25.400> of

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
they're basically to indicate the end of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.850 
they're basically to indicate the end of
a<00:02:25.730> certain<00:02:26.060> body<00:02:26.240> part<00:02:26.660> measurement<00:02:27.200> now

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
a certain body part measurement now

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.800 
a certain body part measurement now
we're<00:02:28.069> going<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.370> draw<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.790> upper<00:02:29.390> part<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
we're going to draw the upper part of

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.420 
we're going to draw the upper part of
the<00:02:29.870> arm<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.440> for<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.770> we're<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.280> use

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the arm and for this we're going to use

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.430 
the arm and for this we're going to use
our<00:02:31.610> head<00:02:31.820> as<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> measurement<00:02:32.420> again<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.260> this

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
our head as a measurement again but this

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.170 
our head as a measurement again but this
time<00:02:33.500> we're<00:02:33.860> not<00:02:34.010> going<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.490> be<00:02:34.610> using<00:02:34.850> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
time we're not going to be using the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.060 
time we're not going to be using the
full<00:02:35.450> length<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.080> head<00:02:36.320> instead<00:02:36.830> we're

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
full length of the head instead we're

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.930 
full length of the head instead we're
going<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.520> using<00:02:37.730> about<00:02:38.270> one-sixth<00:02:39.170> less

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
going to be using about one-sixth less

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.310 
going to be using about one-sixth less
but<00:02:40.940> for<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.480> forearm<00:02:41.870> are<00:02:42.050> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> be

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
but for the forearm are going to be

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.770 
but for the forearm are going to be
using<00:02:42.560> one<00:02:42.920> full<00:02:43.160> head<00:02:43.370> then<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:44.060> do<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.209> exact

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
using one full head then we do the exact

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.680 
using one full head then we do the exact
same<00:02:44.930> thing<00:02:45.530> for<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.830> other<00:02:45.920> arm<00:02:46.280> now<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.120> leg

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
same thing for the other arm now the leg

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.630 
same thing for the other arm now the leg
from<00:02:48.200> hip<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.470> knee<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.130> going<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.520> be

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
from hip to knee is going to be

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.570 
from hip to knee is going to be
approximately<00:02:50.320> one<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.560> one-quarter<00:02:52.400> of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
approximately one and one-quarter of

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.390 
approximately one and one-quarter of
what<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.180> original<00:02:53.239> head<00:02:53.720> length<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.200> do<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
what the original head length is do the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.830 
what the original head length is do the
same<00:02:55.640> thing<00:02:55.940> over<00:02:56.120> there<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.630> now<00:02:56.720> we're

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
same thing over there and now we're

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.479 
same thing over there and now we're
going<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.989> take<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.470> same<00:02:57.739> measurement<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
going to take that same measurement and

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.699 
going to take that same measurement and
use<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.180> for<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> length<00:02:59.720> between<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.440> knee

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
use it for the length between the knee

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.610 
use it for the length between the knee
and<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:01.100> ankle<00:03:01.670> now<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.480> put<00:03:02.810> down<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.050> quick

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
and the ankle now just put down a quick
