00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.810
 Naver is a smart phone with the torch hand in hand 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.780
 Aiming 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.780
 Could you show me the effect 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:12.999
 Before deciding 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.060
 Before setting up this project, you should adjust the configuration Cubs 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.960
 That's it. 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.250
 Asking all family members 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 The pixel is at the end 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.359
 Illegal construction 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.269
 The value of 0.9091 has been selected. 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.269
 If you do not, 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.570
 Bible study controls but new 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 here 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.930
 If you estimate something different or something else 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.530
 When rendering 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 Rendering - 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.150
 Along with Pixel's scooter 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.630
 Later, 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.080
 Can I get the ratio correctly and correctly? 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.550
 So when you start your business, did you work with it 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.310
 Who is Okay? 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.190
 I will flow the smartphone image once 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.720
 Keep track of track 1 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 I'll tell you this length. 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.390
 When Jesus sees the image of the specials, 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.380
 Ian is good and good. 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 All of these parts are transparent. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.450
 And above 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.650
 It was the 2nd place in the school satisfaction point. 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.230
 Now picture 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.200
 Because it is a national policy for itself 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.290
 A little less board 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.370
 I will see 47 in the middle of the moderately the motion 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.770
 Go in 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 Reduce the size of the load. 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.530
 I'll call you once. 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.730
 Do not call me a photo 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.840
 Weightlifting 10 I'm pushing for the first time. 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.600
 When you see the move, 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.070
 Both sides and upper and lower 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.470
 This is because the government has two 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.070
 There's a payoff. 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.290
 On photo 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.390
 I did not see the margins again. 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.590
 With Spectra Issue 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.920
 Checked in 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.599
 Give it all back. 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.899
 In this part, 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.439
 From event products 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.439
 On the right button, you hit the shop, 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.310
 like this 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.039
 It solved the distortion. 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.039
 So the quality is good and you see 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:26.569
 Record side 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.439
 towards its own 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.540
 ipo laughs and only part of the rebound problems 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.659
 It would. 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.489
 At Event Cup 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.599
 Among these, 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.399
 Decrease position 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.249
 like this 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.510
 Limit only 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.510
 Of these, only two are mountains. 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.079
 In the middle of it, 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.219
 I will be a pastor. 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.469
 Exit 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.499
 When you see the top 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.499
 We currently need 2 decks. 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.090
 If you check 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.479
 1.9 million 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.889
 I need a little bit of information so I can not see the photos on page two 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.019
 Factor is good, part of the decomposition and no need to strike 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:20.689
 Being 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.089
 It's the same at the bottom. 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.189
 The second song 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.590
 I'll buy it with a mask. 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.369
 Mask 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:30.739
 Chosun has one photo. 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.669
 It's multifunctional. 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.669
 You used to have a background around two chairs. 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.449
 Board of Directors 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.719
 e Spot good images between 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.059
 Because the uc background must be included 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:49.489
 Add a track between it's mart phone image and board 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.669
 I turned it off. 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.209
 it would be up the uo logo 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.139
 By inserting into the track 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:55.929
 Here, 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.929
 I can call it video source. 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:00.790
 One such 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.239
 I won 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.249
 204 to the future 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.339
 Two minutes and you're like this, 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.469
 In the back of the picture, 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.479
 You will not see it. 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.569
 Can not be non-spiritual 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.469
 This part of the event killed funds with a mask. so 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.509
 I wrote this article. 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.419
 You have to decide. 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.419
 Check out the first and sk. 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.469
 The charges for choosing a tent 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.639
 It's a part of this, but I do not know after it's gone. 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.259
 The country is buried high. 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.430
 I get a war on terror. 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.729
 Like this 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.720
 I've taken it now, so I'm taking a pretty big mistake. 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.719
 I can see you twist so much. 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.370
 Moving for the beginning of it part 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.490
 You just have to adjust this part exactly. 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.490
 You can choose text for Kim Hee-sun. 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.180
 With one click on the outside, 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.989
 Again two points 

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:11.210
 While clicking 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.939
 Finished 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.800
 You can see the preview gate here now. 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.529
 This is quality. 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:18.839
 This part 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:19.879
 like this 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.990
 Exactly fit the sidewalk 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.220
 It also gets smaller. Keeping a low point 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.800
 not care 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.759
 As before 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.129
 How do I move while watching the preview 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.440
 Should I 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.440
 Likewise, 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.920
 I take it moderately. 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.570
 This part of the video minority is here dr. You can see the window. 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.539
 then 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.979
 Because the biceps now need to be seen, 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.129
 I can see it. 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.129
 I tried to reverse. In all, not portibo 

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:03.639
 Select this mask as the negative and select this outside 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.550
 Make it look like 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.529
 Improvements are becoming more prominent. 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.699
 Why do you choose? 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.209
 As you can see, how the outside gets cold with the video source. 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:18.029
 I will sleep this way with pictures on both sides. 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.770
 I'm getting out. 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.770
 The picture is a bit like this 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.999
 I fell down. 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.999
 It only takes about 2 seconds. 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.030
 Expectations 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.319
 It's nice. 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.919
 I do not have much more weight. 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.919
 And 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.080
 The next picture may be a picture or a second picture 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.269
 The keyboard touches 

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:48.159
 This too 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.430
 About 2 seconds 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.270
 Did you catch me like this 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.270
 This second picture likewise 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.699
 In this part of the event you will see the event in Tangkur 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.029
 Adjusted. 

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:07.029
 Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.069
 By adjusting the focus 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.629
 Well, I'm putting it in exactly the tax position. 

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.819
 And I have a private life in stone. Third picture 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.219
 To come 

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:26.780
 Spill oil 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.139
 It likewise 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.109
 About 2 seconds 

00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:33.479
 I'm catching the last day. 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.550
 All the others. 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.180
 Asbestos has been used for more than 10 years 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.160
 You drank the part. 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.710
 So to turn to 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.849
 At Event Cup 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:47.860
 Focus 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.860
 I want to meet you 

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:56.469
 He rewards recognition 

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:59.149
 This photo of the world is an alternative business
