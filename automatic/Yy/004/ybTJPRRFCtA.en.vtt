okay<00:01:29.020> yep<00:01:30.020> yep<00:01:30.430> I<00:01:33.130> don't<00:01:34.130> think<00:01:34.310> we<00:01:34.430> need<00:01:34.580> to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
okay yep yep I don't think we need to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.690 
okay yep yep I don't think we need to
render<00:01:34.940> distance<00:01:35.360> on<00:01:35.870> extreme<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.560> be<00:01:36.590> honest

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.940 

but<00:01:40.700> with<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:42.250> we'll<00:01:43.250> talk<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.610> find<00:01:43.880> extreme

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
but with it we'll talk to find extreme

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.640 
but with it we'll talk to find extreme
everything<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.880> high<00:01:47.260> I'm<00:01:48.260> getting<00:01:48.770> about

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
water how good it looks with the shaders

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.680 
water how good it looks with the shaders
look<00:02:27.260> at<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.500> look<00:02:28.190> at<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.370> water<00:02:28.610> looks<00:02:29.270> so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:51.180 

the<00:02:43.450> tree<00:02:43.810> Smithers<00:02:44.610> did<00:02:45.610> they<00:02:48.360> nope<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
the tree Smithers did they nope but the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:03.320 
the tree Smithers did they nope but the
Sun<00:02:51.520> looks<00:02:51.820> beautiful<00:02:52.980> clouds<00:02:53.980> are<00:02:54.250> great

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.100 

getting<00:03:04.650> stable<00:03:05.650> 60<00:03:05.950> FPS<00:03:06.610> or<00:03:06.820> higher<00:03:07.110> so

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
getting stable 60 FPS or higher so

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.500 
getting stable 60 FPS or higher so
that's<00:03:08.470> really<00:03:08.680> good<00:03:08.940> especially<00:03:09.940> when<00:03:10.390> I'm

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
that's really good especially when I'm

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.360 
that's really good especially when I'm
on<00:03:10.570> max<00:03:10.840> settings<00:03:11.080> like<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.800> I<00:03:11.890> turn<00:03:12.070> down<00:03:12.100> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
on max settings like if I turn down the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.420 
on max settings like if I turn down the
render<00:03:12.790> distance<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:14.860> only<00:03:15.010> need<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:15.400> to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
render distance like we only need up to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.810 
render distance like we only need up to
10<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:17.140> FPS<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:17.800> Rises<00:03:18.430> about<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.900> 50<00:03:20.820> or

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
10 the FPS just Rises about like 50 or

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.630 
10 the FPS just Rises about like 50 or
more<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.920> because<00:03:23.920> we<00:03:24.040> don't<00:03:24.220> really<00:03:24.340> need

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
more and because we don't really need

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.330 
more and because we don't really need
that<00:03:25.390> high<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.320> render<00:03:26.620> distance<00:03:26.770> unless

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
that high of a render distance unless

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.450 
that high of a render distance unless
you<00:03:27.520> really<00:03:27.940> want<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.960> like<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.320> be<00:03:29.350> max<00:03:29.770> max<00:03:30.300> so

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
you really want it like to be max max so

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.650 
you really want it like to be max max so
yeah<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.480> I'm<00:03:35.350> gonna<00:03:35.590> go<00:03:35.710> look<00:03:36.460> for<00:03:36.880> some<00:03:37.480> stuff
