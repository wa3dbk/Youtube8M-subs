00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.589
 know how you can make the perfect gaming keyboard for me personally to remove 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.650
 all the extra kitty esports did just that and released soft jenin keyboard like me 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.990
 I have already said that there is nothing superfluous coverage does not get dirty and there is nothing here to get dirty 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 To be honest, the distance from the edge to the buttons is a minimal mechanical keyboard with 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.410
 switches cherry mx black mechanics are usually heavy 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.239
 but as I have repeatedly said it is good, Klava does not drive around the table during 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.960
 games that immediately catches the eye thick 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.829
 I understand that the wire should be thick because it feeds not only 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.950
 Klava backlit but also two additional ports 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.980
 Yes, and 2 audio jacks here, too, is not just so well, damn it is thick and very bad 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.469
 bends on the other hand he according to statements 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.629
 manufacturer of extra strong and able to withstand any hardship keys high 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.440
 with a long stroke, I like a person accustomed to using black candles 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.210
 conveniently others say that I would like to understand when the button is pressed but this 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.070
 rather a discussion of the characteristics of candles and here is the question of individual best 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.600
 the tradition of game mechanics, the design is such that the buttons go up 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.100
 made to be more comfortable for the spire to type text and it works 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.689
 In short, it was convenient for me to work with her, too, as this mechanic 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.729
 the slightest movement of the finger gives a kickback feeling super no membranes to with this 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.500
 can not be compared if you connect the keyboard and beaten it stands 6 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 simultaneous keystrokes which is quite enough during the game but if you want 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.619
 so that all the keys are pressed during the game, then connect through the adapter ps 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.869
 2 since there are no additional keys, the keyboard is like for shooters however 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.860
 no one forbids you to spit it on anything you want extra keys 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
 No, but there are additional functions for this control of music and sound. 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.760
 with the fn key there are backlight buttons 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
 1 turns on the backlight and switches its zones, for example the backlight can be 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.350
 either full or only these keys or these or these 2 buttons switches the brightness 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.000
 here seven levels begin to pulsate and ascending from the weakest to 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.020
 the brightest illumination of the Russian characters of course leaves much to be desired 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.190
 Better darkness has to turn on the maximum backlight level to 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.600
 they were visible only in this case if this English burns out the blood 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.340
 the palm rest is removed this is very cool because I donâ€™t really like them 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.350
 so everyone is good and those who love and those who do not, by the way if you remove the delivery 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.910
 Immediately there is one moment from below there are rubber bands everywhere so that the keyboard does not 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.510
 drove on the table but under the space and and no therefore if 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.530
 strongly press the club bends true to be honest then I did not immediately 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.270
 noticed so that someone can be it does not interfere with a few words about the drivers 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.400
 They are not Yes, the keyboard works without any drivers 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.550
 and forward the keyboard is a class for me personally, such keyboards are just a place to find 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.890
 the table takes a little extra keys there is no wire though thick but protected 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.510
 The backlight is bright, but with Russian characters, of course, the file is well and deflection 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.160
 the center may not like many; nevertheless, these two points are all that can be 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.360
 find fault in this keyboard and the pros are much more on it all with 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.930
