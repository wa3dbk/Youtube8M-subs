that<00:01:29.250> hooks<00:01:29.700> into<00:01:29.820> those<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.420> don't<00:01:30.570> go

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that hooks into those so they don't go

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.560

sliding<00:01:30.990> forward<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.400> carpet<00:01:32.790> ones<00:01:33.000> have

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
sliding forward the carpet ones have

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
sliding forward the carpet ones have
velcro<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.560> bottom<00:01:34.950> instead<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.310> hooks

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
velcro on the bottom instead of hooks

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.830 
velcro on the bottom instead of hooks
the<00:01:35.700> velcro<00:01:35.880> keeps<00:01:36.329> them<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.659> sliding

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the velcro keeps them from sliding

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.780 
the velcro keeps them from sliding

of<00:04:24.840> course<00:04:25.020> looks<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.380> same<00:04:25.560> over<00:04:25.800> there<00:04:25.920> nice

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
of course looks the same over there nice

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.330

clean very very good fitment as you

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.240 
clean very very good fitment as you
would<00:04:29.460> expect<00:04:30.410> same<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.560> true<00:04:31.710> up<00:04:31.889> here<00:04:32.070> at<00:04:32.160> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
would expect same is true up here at the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.460 
would expect same is true up here at the
front<00:04:32.400> since<00:04:32.820> these<00:04:32.970> are<00:04:33.180> new<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.260> little

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
front since these are new the the little

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.470 
front since these are new the the little
kink<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.070> floor<00:04:35.310> where<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.700> goes<00:04:36.030> up<00:04:36.090> there

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
kink in the floor where it goes up there

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.670 
kink in the floor where it goes up there
the<00:04:36.630> mat<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.990> probably<00:04:37.320> going<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.500> take<00:04:37.650> a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
the mat is probably going to take a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.980 
the mat is probably going to take a
little<00:04:37.889> bit<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.160> time<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.580> develop<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.540> kinks

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
little bit of time to develop that kinks

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.110 
little bit of time to develop that kinks
so<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.230> fits<00:04:40.500> right<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.190> m5<00:04:41.610> badging

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
so that fits right that the m5 badging

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.110 
so that fits right that the m5 badging
looks<00:04:42.300> really<00:04:42.750> nice<00:04:42.919> next<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.940> door

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
looks really nice next to the the door

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.990
