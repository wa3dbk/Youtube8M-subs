00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
I guess like the chorus and it's it's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.060 
I guess like the chorus and it's it's
very<00:01:21.770> easy<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.250> should<00:01:22.690> be<00:01:23.690> is<00:01:24.440> sounds<00:01:24.979> like

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
very easy it should be is sounds like

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.660 
very easy it should be is sounds like
this<00:01:25.220> B<00:01:25.460> 2<00:01:25.970> 3<00:01:26.600> 4<00:01:27.670> C<00:01:28.670> sharp<00:01:29.000> 2<00:01:29.270> 3<00:01:29.840> 4<00:01:30.350> D<00:01:30.950> sharp<00:01:31.280> minor

can sort of get a little bit fancy with
those<00:02:38.310> parts<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:39.600> instance<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.500> third

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
those parts for instance on the third

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.260 
those parts for instance on the third
chord<00:02:41.220> you're<00:02:41.400> gonna<00:02:41.520> hold<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.180> little

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
chord you're gonna hold it for a little

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.390 
chord you're gonna hold it for a little
bit<00:02:42.360> longer<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.720> D<00:02:43.500> sharp<00:02:43.800> two<00:02:44.130> three<00:02:44.790> four

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.949 

you<00:02:48.879> do<00:02:49.000> something<00:02:49.329> like<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.480> where<00:02:49.870> you

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
you do something like that where you

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.929 
you do something like that where you
basically<00:02:50.140> are<00:02:50.439> walking<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.189> we<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.790> these

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
basically are walking up so we see these

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:58.870 
basically are walking up so we see these
two<00:02:52.180> notes<00:02:52.769> they<00:02:53.769> go<00:02:53.920> whole<00:02:54.159> step

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.920 

so<00:02:59.880> I'll<00:03:00.000> show<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.240> with<00:03:00.360> them<00:03:00.540> what<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
so I'll show you with them what that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.059 
so I'll show you with them what that
looks<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.140> with<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.380> playing<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.860> notes

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
looks like with just playing the notes

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.490 
looks like with just playing the notes
so<00:03:03.800> d<00:03:04.800> sharp<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.400> sharp<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.600> D<00:03:06.810> sharp<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.319> your

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
so d sharp a sharp and D sharp and your

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.490 
so d sharp a sharp and D sharp and your
a<00:03:07.530> hand<00:03:07.830> F<00:03:08.790> sharp<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.390> sharp<00:03:10.370> d<00:03:11.370> sharp

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.410 

and<00:03:14.590> then<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.370> move<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.580> F<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.770> G<00:03:17.770> sharp<00:03:18.420> in

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
and then you move to F and G sharp in

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.660 
and then you move to F and G sharp in
your<00:03:19.600> right<00:03:19.750> hand<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.320> D<00:03:20.620> sharp<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:21.400> stays

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
your right hand and a D sharp this stays

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.940 
your right hand and a D sharp this stays
the<00:03:21.850> same<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:23.200> if<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.320> can<00:03:23.440> take<00:03:23.560> are<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:23.830> of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the same so if you can take are one of

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
and then G sharp a sharp and D sharp

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.790 
and then G sharp a sharp and D sharp
okay

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.990 

but<00:03:39.800> if<00:03:39.980> that's<00:03:40.160> confusing<00:03:40.520> don't<00:03:40.790> worry

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
but if that's confusing don't worry

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.310 
but if that's confusing don't worry
about<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.360> last<00:03:41.540> trick<00:03:41.900> which<00:03:42.020> is<00:03:42.050> very

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
