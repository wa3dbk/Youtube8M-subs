00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
little bit well little did I know that a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.390 
little bit well little did I know that a
fan<00:03:03.709> does<00:03:04.709> not<00:03:04.860> come<00:03:05.010> with<00:03:05.100> an<00:03:05.190> air<00:03:05.250> purifier

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
fan does not come with an air purifier

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.030 
fan does not come with an air purifier
an<00:03:06.209> air<00:03:06.660> purifier<00:03:06.870> doesn't<00:03:07.769> really<00:03:07.890> come<00:03:08.010> with

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
an air purifier doesn't really come with

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.030 
an air purifier doesn't really come with
a<00:03:08.160> fan<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.239> either<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.930> gotta<00:03:10.140> buy<00:03:10.260> two<00:03:10.319> separate

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
a fan so either I gotta buy two separate

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.789 
a fan so either I gotta buy two separate
units<00:03:11.220> or<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.970> gotta<00:03:12.150> buy<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.239> really<00:03:12.600> expensive

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799

air purifier that can blow air out
enough<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.470> actually<00:03:16.680> cool<00:03:16.980> off<00:03:17.160> all<00:03:17.430> right

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
enough to actually cool off all right

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.490 
enough to actually cool off all right
because<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.090> sounds<00:03:18.329> like<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:19.049> get<00:03:19.140> it's<00:03:19.350> one

I<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.100> find<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.370> fan<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:36.239> will<00:03:36.360> purify<00:03:36.510> air

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.370 

well<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.270> people<00:03:42.540> they<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:42.960> fans

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
well just like on people they have fans

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.870 
well just like on people they have fans
and<00:03:43.680> they<00:03:43.770> have<00:03:43.890> hair<00:03:44.070> pure<00:03:44.310> fighters<00:03:44.670> and

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
and they have hair pure fighters and

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.960 
and they have hair pure fighters and
these<00:03:45.690> are<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> air<00:03:45.960> purifiers<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.940> none<00:03:47.940> of

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
these are the air purifiers and none of

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.700 
these are the air purifiers and none of
them<00:03:48.120> talk<00:03:48.240> about<00:03:48.300> air<00:03:48.690> speeds<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.620> I'm

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
them talk about air speeds and so I'm

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.020 
them talk about air speeds and so I'm
actually<00:03:49.830> show<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.370> air<00:03:50.490> coming<00:03:50.700> up<00:03:50.760> top

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
actually show the air coming up top

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.490 
actually show the air coming up top
which<00:03:51.360> tells<00:03:51.720> me<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.020> it's<00:03:52.140> not<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.260> fan<00:03:52.470> at

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
