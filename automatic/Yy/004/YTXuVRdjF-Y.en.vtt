00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.300
 Hello and welcome again 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 in a states world i want now 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 just show it for a short time today 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.570
 far the filling from the high bed now 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.570
 already advanced 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.740
 I have some more cards here now 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.820
 measures must be in 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.330
 probably could not do anything in the days 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 the weather has not changed completely 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.670
 Well set it now is so 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 that I have another situation now 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 grass scar did it naturally 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.820
 far it goes wrong so with the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.350
 earth up with the grass and that 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.350
 weed what's in there is broken and 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.660
 From now on, only too good that comes 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.210
 a little bit more now 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.650
 grasschnitt and something just so 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.960
 bio garbage accumulated was fast in front of him 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.940
 which quickly decomposes and 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.000
 then then just stop earth 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.620
 mixed with fine compost 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.700
 so far I have here It's filled 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.410
 the 8km of wood and so on 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:21.140

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:24.710

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.600
 and sicker grass scar as well as two 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.420
 I think years can think so 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.680
 everyone can make a picture of it 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.259

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.880
 So, if you 're up to something, I can 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.080

 Already in the open country, it's good too 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.930
 bit bigger than it 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.970
