headed
I<00:00:44.350> think<00:00:44.949> we're<00:00:45.070> based<00:00:45.339> on<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.640> fact<00:00:45.879> that<00:00:46.000> we

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
I think we're based on the fact that we

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.500 
I think we're based on the fact that we
have<00:00:46.890> brand<00:00:47.890> new<00:00:48.010> technology<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.970> hasn't

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
have brand new technology that hasn't

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.289 
have brand new technology that hasn't
been<00:00:49.720> adopted<00:00:50.290> around<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.070> world<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:51.489> so<00:00:52.089> for

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
been adopted around the world so so for

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.079 
been adopted around the world so so for
us<00:00:52.449> it's<00:00:52.750> not<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:52.989> much<00:00:53.379> a<00:00:53.439> matter<00:00:53.559> of<00:00:54.089> evolving

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
us it's not so much a matter of evolving

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.030 
us it's not so much a matter of evolving
or<00:00:55.239> adapting<00:00:55.750> it's<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:56.049> matter<00:00:56.259> of<00:00:56.409> proving

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
or adapting it's a matter of proving

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.890 
or adapting it's a matter of proving
that<00:00:57.220> our<00:00:57.400> technology<00:00:58.089> is<00:00:58.299> the<00:00:58.629> best

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
that our technology is the best

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.689 
that our technology is the best

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.050 

we<00:01:09.140> needed<00:01:09.410> access<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:10.760> brightest

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
we needed access to the brightest

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.210 
we needed access to the brightest
engineering<00:01:11.570> minds<00:01:11.750> in<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.740> world<00:01:12.860> and

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
engineering minds in the world and

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.860 
engineering minds in the world and
that's<00:01:14.000> still<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.390> case<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.600> that's

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
that's still the case that that's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.720 
that's still the case that that's
Silicon<00:01:15.410> Valley<00:01:15.680> Silicon<00:01:16.250> Valley<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.580> where

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
Silicon Valley Silicon Valley is where

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.620 
Silicon Valley Silicon Valley is where
you<00:01:16.880> go<00:01:17.120> to<00:01:17.900> find<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.250> brightest<00:01:20.150> engineering

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
you go to find the brightest engineering

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.510 
you go to find the brightest engineering
minds<00:01:20.960> in<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.260> world<00:01:21.410> in<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.800> world<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.400> this

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
minds in the world in the world to this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.090 
minds in the world in the world to this
day<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.229> for<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.440> reason<00:01:24.500> yeah<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:24.979> think

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
day and so for that reason yeah I think

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.330 
day and so for that reason yeah I think
it<00:01:25.520> was<00:01:25.700> for<00:01:26.240> us<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:27.380> most<00:01:27.560> important<00:01:28.010> factor

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
it was for us the most important factor

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.300 
it was for us the most important factor
in<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:29.570> starting<00:01:30.080> off<00:01:30.200> here<00:01:30.440> geographically

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
in and starting off here geographically

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.160 
in and starting off here geographically
and<00:01:31.369> I<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:31.640> that's<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.910> case<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:33.020> you're

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
and I think that's the case if you're

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.390 
and I think that's the case if you're
looking<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.770> start<00:01:34.070> from<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.090> technology<00:01:35.840> base

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
looking to start from a technology base

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400 
looking to start from a technology base
or<00:01:37.400> have<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:37.820> engineering<00:01:38.240> base<00:01:38.510> this<00:01:39.229> is

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
or have the engineering base this is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.470 
or have the engineering base this is
where<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.680> best<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.010> brightest<00:01:40.280> go

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.250 

the<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.680> landscape<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.250> think<00:01:47.280> has<00:01:47.550> changed<00:01:48.260> to

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
the the landscape I think has changed to

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.570 
the the landscape I think has changed to
an<00:01:49.350> extent<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:49.980> I<00:01:50.010> think<00:01:50.250> they're<00:01:50.400> still

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
an extent but I think they're still

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.230 
an extent but I think they're still
going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.910> be<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> need<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:52.800> innovation

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
going to be the need for innovation

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.970 
going to be the need for innovation
and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.020> think<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
and I think that with not just the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.200 
and I think that with not just the
capability<00:01:58.980> that's<00:01:59.190> here<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.610> also<00:01:59.760> kind<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
capability that's here but also kind of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.740 
capability that's here but also kind of
this<00:02:00.620> enthusiastic<00:02:02.240> entrepreneurial<00:02:03.240> spirit

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.550 
this enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit
that<00:02:03.900> exists<00:02:04.320> here<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:06.090> continues<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that exists here it continues to be a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
that exists here it continues to be a
place<00:02:08.040> where<00:02:08.070> people<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.610> drawn<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.810> place

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
place where people are drawn and a place

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.770 
place where people are drawn and a place
where<00:02:10.290> people<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.780> starting

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
where people think that starting

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.410 
where people think that starting
businesses<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.320> starting<00:02:13.770> enterprises<00:02:14.730> is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
businesses and starting enterprises is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.390 
businesses and starting enterprises is
still<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.020> on

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.020 

I<00:02:21.489> mean<00:02:22.239> we're<00:02:22.510> we're<00:02:22.989> not<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.349> this<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.620> become

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
I mean we're we're not in this to become

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.369 
I mean we're we're not in this to become
the<00:02:25.030> biggest<00:02:25.269> car<00:02:25.629> maker<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.170> world

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
the biggest car maker in the world

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.690 
the biggest car maker in the world
that's<00:02:26.739> not<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:27.040> objective<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.670> objective

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
that's not the objective the objective

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.869 
that's not the objective the objective
is<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:29.049> act<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.379> catalyst<00:02:29.860> for<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.430> industry

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
is to act as a catalyst for the industry

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.050 
is to act as a catalyst for the industry
global<00:02:31.629> industry<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.980> get<00:02:33.310> them<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:33.819> adopt

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
global industry and to get them to adopt

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.699 
global industry and to get them to adopt
electric<00:02:34.599> mobility<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.200> electric<00:02:35.590> power

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
electric mobility and electric power

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.740 
electric mobility and electric power
trains<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.430> that's<00:02:36.760> happening<00:02:37.180> slowly<00:02:37.510> but

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
trains and that's happening slowly but

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.899 
trains and that's happening slowly but
surely<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.439> our<00:02:39.069> position<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.609> one<00:02:39.790> to

surely and so our position is one to

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.319 
surely and so our position is one to
take<00:02:40.090> tech<00:02:41.019> leadership<00:02:41.470> position<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:43.090> show

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
take tech leadership position to show

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.869 
take tech leadership position to show
the<00:02:43.540> potential<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.069> viability<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.670> this

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
the potential and the viability of this

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.759 
the potential and the viability of this
technology<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:47.079> happen<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.349> think<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.590> have

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
technology we happen to think we have

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.130 
technology we happen to think we have
the<00:02:47.890> best<00:02:48.069> technology<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.390> will<00:02:49.629> continue<00:02:49.900> to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
the best technology and will continue to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.319 
the best technology and will continue to
do<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:50.709> we've<00:02:50.920> implemented<00:02:51.329> IP

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
do so and so we've implemented IP

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.509 
do so and so we've implemented IP

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
from the very very beginning it's just

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.229 
from the very very beginning it's just
kind<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.680> accelerated<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.459> lot<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.730> maturation

kind of accelerated a lot of maturation

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.930 
kind of accelerated a lot of maturation
process<00:03:57.690> but<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.739> for<00:03:58.890> us<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.190> goes<00:03:59.340> hand<00:03:59.819> in
