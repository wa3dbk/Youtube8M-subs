first of all and she traveled everywhere

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.270 
first of all and she traveled everywhere
I<00:00:50.430> remember<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.240> a<00:00:51.270> child<00:00:51.920> spending<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:53.100> with

I remember as a child spending time with

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.680 
I remember as a child spending time with
her<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.700> summer<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.060> would<00:00:54.360> spend<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.630> a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
week out a summer with her and then I

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.260 
week out a summer with her and then I
would<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.280> her<00:00:56.310> all<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.970> know<00:00:57.090> always

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
would see her all you know always

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.940 
would see her all you know always
throughout<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.810> year<00:00:57.990> but<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.590> would<00:00:58.800> always

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
throughout the year but I would always

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
well Mertz in Egypt or Mertz gone on a

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.320 
well Mertz in Egypt or Mertz gone on a
trip<00:01:04.230> to<00:01:04.410> Jordan<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.890> Mertz<00:01:05.190> in<00:01:05.400> Brazil<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.240> she

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
trip to Jordan or Mertz in Brazil so she

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.440 
trip to Jordan or Mertz in Brazil so she
was<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.380> who<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.550> planted

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
was the one who really you know planted

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.290 
was the one who really you know planted
that<00:01:09.570> seed<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.990> travel<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.250> thought<00:01:12.090> what

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
that seed of travel and I thought what

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.320 
that seed of travel and I thought what
if<00:01:12.450> she<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.740> travel<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.970> part

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
if she can do it so can I travel is part

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
if she can do it so can I travel is part
of<00:01:15.390> my<00:01:15.570> DNA<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.410> really<00:01:16.890> didn't<00:01:17.160> get<00:01:17.250> tapped

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
of my DNA that really didn't get tapped

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.750 
of my DNA that really didn't get tapped
into<00:01:17.729> until<00:01:18.620> later<00:01:19.620> in<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:19.950> life<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.550> my

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
into until later in my life and I my

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.060 
into until later in my life and I my
whole<00:01:20.970> life<00:01:21.150> has<00:01:21.360> changed

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
whole life has changed

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
whole life has changed
exponentially<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.550> it<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.030> become

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
exponentially because of it it's become

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
exponentially because of it it's become
a<00:01:24.390> huge<00:01:24.869> part<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.380> son's<00:01:25.680> life<00:01:26.010> he's<00:01:26.610> been

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
a huge part of my son's life he's been

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
a huge part of my son's life he's been
traveling<00:01:26.970> since<00:01:27.420> he<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.810> six<00:01:28.380> months<00:01:28.500> old

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
traveling since he was six months old

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.300 
traveling since he was six months old
his<00:01:29.880> perception<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.630> travel<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.619> gonna<00:01:31.830> be<00:01:31.979> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
his perception on travel is gonna be so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060 
his perception on travel is gonna be so
completely<00:01:33.030> different<00:01:33.360> than<00:01:33.780> mine<00:01:34.070> because

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
completely different than mine because

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.070 
completely different than mine because
not<00:01:35.400> only<00:01:35.729> has<00:01:35.910> he<00:01:36.060> traveled<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
not only has he traveled all over the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.960 
not only has he traveled all over the
place<00:01:37.380> he's<00:01:37.680> also<00:01:38.100> getting<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.610> grow<00:01:38.760> up<00:01:38.850> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
place he's also getting to grow up in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.120 
place he's also getting to grow up in
New<00:01:39.060> York<00:01:39.119> City

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.920 

when<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.160> travel<00:01:45.820> if<00:01:46.090> it's<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.360> place<00:01:46.510> I'm<00:01:46.660> going

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
when I travel if it's a place I'm going

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.660 
when I travel if it's a place I'm going
back<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.320> for<00:01:47.500> maybe<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.890> second<00:01:48.190> or<00:01:48.280> third<00:01:48.310> time

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
back to for maybe a second or third time

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.840 
back to for maybe a second or third time
I<00:01:48.910> typically<00:01:49.420> tend<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.440> skip<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.310> touristy

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
I typically tend to skip the touristy

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.410 
I typically tend to skip the touristy
things<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.240> like<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.720> find<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.530> local<00:01:53.890> things

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
