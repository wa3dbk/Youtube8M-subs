00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.970
 and here we are again in the kitchen of 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.469
 chickens to prepare a dish 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.630
 international is a chicken show 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.269
 with basmati rice and of course 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.250
 always with our punished a pulp of 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.410
 diced tomato 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 let's start with the chicken then 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 we begin to brown the onion 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 we light the Italian fire le 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.910
 end of the onion 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.660
 we divide it half and then we cut it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:44.140
 in fact he has put timpa we pour a thread 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.140
 of oil we make it warm 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.460
 inside the pan and meanwhile 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.340
 let's proceed with cutting the rest of the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.970
 vegetables that are just one 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.870
 carrot removing the ends la 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.790
 we always divide in half 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.790
 so is we do na rentals 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.890
 the same operation we do with the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:17.409
 celery and cut into even slices 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.630
 this once the oil is ready 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.659
 we can begin to brown the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.829
 our vegetables 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.829
 so let's start with the onion 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:35.560
 yes and let's take the chicken and let's say it 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.910
 then touch the whole paul lo 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.840
 we cut precisely to the perfect goal 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.660
 we try to clean it as much as possible and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.460
 then we keep it in strips 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.460
 in this way so 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 we always check the cooking of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:04.090
 vegetables let's lower the flame e 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.360
 let's leave it alone softly 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.630
 paul pieces that touched will be 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.180
 small and less will naturally be the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.340
 cooking time 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.730
 in this way so once browned 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.010
 the onion we introduce the chicken and it 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.010
 let's brown 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.269
 then we go up 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 meanwhile the water is boiling to save water 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.500
 of the rice and pour the basmati rice 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.379
 ok 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.379
 then recover apollo 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.450
 and once well browned can come 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.450
 to the rest of the vegetables celery and carrots 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.470
 we still remember salt 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:33.660
 while everything is cooked chop 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:33.660
 a bit of perfect parsley 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.230
 I can always live on fire 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.230
 add the tomato cube 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.150
 in this way 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.790
 we pour the tomato 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.610
 together 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.530
 let's flavor everything for a few 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.020
 minute a few moments only point 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.910
 to slightly heat the tomato and 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.790
 allow all the ingredients to 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:21.930
 blend together they lose the rice 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.020
 in this way always in pasta school 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.840
 rice will practically act as a bed 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:34.180
 to accommodate my stew 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:37.300
 I raise the flame for a moment so well 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.320
 such a point to restrict everything well 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.420
 the sauce and finally we add the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.440
 parsley parsley or if you don't have it go 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.260
 perfect also with the perfect coriander 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.300
 and now we serve our stew 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.690
 chicken with diced tomato 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.290

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.290

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.290
 fresh 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:19.120
 the color is the scent of fresh tomatoes 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:22.400

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.070
