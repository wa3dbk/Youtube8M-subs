actually<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> hundred<00:00:41.340> percent<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.059> let

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
actually know a hundred percent but let

that we have so really guys in all we
have<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:47.100> massive<00:00:48.000> possibilities<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.200> black

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
have two massive possibilities for black

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.130 
have two massive possibilities for black
ops<00:00:49.649> 3<00:00:50.219> zombies<00:00:50.250> ate<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.870> be

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
ops 3 zombies ate it's going to be

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
ops 3 zombies ate it's going to be
either<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.739> multiplayer<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.760> even<00:00:54.090> have

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
either like multiplayer and even have

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
either like multiplayer and even have
like<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> gun<00:00:54.930> smith<00:00:55.320> system<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.949> everything

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
like the gun smith system and everything

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
like the gun smith system and everything
or<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.410> like

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
or be it's not going to be like

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
or be it's not going to be like
multiplayer<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> separate

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
multiplayer and it's going to separate

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.750 
multiplayer and it's going to separate
the<00:01:00.660> its<00:01:00.930> own<00:01:01.199> game<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.039> said<00:01:02.100> we

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the its own game and like I said we

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
the its own game and like I said we
don't<00:01:03.030> necessarily<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
don't necessarily know if this is a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.560 
don't necessarily know if this is a
hundred<00:01:04.979> percent<00:01:05.100> true<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.030> turns<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.420> if

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
hundred percent true and turns up if

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.539 
hundred percent true and turns up if
it's<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> be<00:01:07.229> more<00:01:07.500> statistically<00:01:08.340> like

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it's going to be more statistically like

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
it's going to be more statistically like
multiplayer<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.659> all<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.140> sort<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
multiplayer with all this like sort of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.890 
multiplayer with all this like sort of
black<00:01:10.650> ops<00:01:10.950> 3<00:01:11.250> exosuit<00:01:11.909> equivalent<00:01:12.570> whatever

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
black ops 3 exosuit equivalent whatever

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
black ops 3 exosuit equivalent whatever
it<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.310> something

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it is or it's going to be something

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
it is or it's going to be something
completely<00:01:14.760> different<00:01:15.479> sort<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.229> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
completely different sort of like with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.920 
completely different sort of like with
origins<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.729> crazy<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.540> got<00:01:18.720> us

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
origins that was just crazy it got us

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380 
origins that was just crazy it got us
out<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.200> nowhere<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.490> let<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.700> talk<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:20.939> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
out of nowhere so let me talk about this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
out of nowhere so let me talk about this
a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.540> bit<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.930> guys<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.560> black

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
a little bit more guys with the black

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.190 
a little bit more guys with the black
ops<00:01:23.100> 3<00:01:23.430> zombies<00:01:23.460> again<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.570> could<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.020> like

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
ops 3 zombies again it could be like

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960 
ops 3 zombies again it could be like
black<00:01:25.590> ops<00:01:25.920> 2<00:01:26.220> zombies<00:01:26.250> where<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
black ops 2 zombies where the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
black ops 2 zombies where the
multiplayer<00:01:27.570> guns<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.080> copied<00:01:28.680> onto<00:01:28.950> zombies

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
multiplayer guns are copied onto zombies

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
multiplayer guns are copied onto zombies
so<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.570> possibility<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so that could be a possibility like I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
so that could be a possibility like I
was<00:01:32.100> saying<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.729> why<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.360> believe<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.840> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
was saying and why don't believe this is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.690 
was saying and why don't believe this is
because<00:01:34.350> mark<00:01:34.650> Lamia<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.610> his

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
because mark Lamia and one of his

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
because mark Lamia and one of his
interviews<00:01:36.270> he<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.689> said<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
interviews he actually said that this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.760 
interviews he actually said that this
game<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.430> zombies<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.329> itself<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.619> be

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
game or zombies in itself is going to be

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
game or zombies in itself is going to be
very<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> separate<00:01:42.720> game<00:01:43.020> from

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
very much like a separate game from

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.319 
very much like a separate game from
multiplayer<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.579> plausible

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
multiplayer so that's a really plausible

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.440 
multiplayer so that's a really plausible
factor<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.149> will

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
factor there that we can see that will

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
factor there that we can see that will
make<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.049> sort<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.350> weapons<00:01:49.799> different<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
make the sort of weapons different and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.069 
make the sort of weapons different and
more<00:01:50.729> enjoyable<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> lot<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.960> people

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
more enjoyable and a lot of people

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.899 
more enjoyable and a lot of people
really<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> black<00:01:53.430> ops<00:01:53.700> 3

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
really don't want the black ops 3

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819 
really don't want the black ops 3
multiplayer<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.780> mechanics<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.619> in

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
multiplayer and mechanics to be in

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.950 
multiplayer and mechanics to be in
zombies<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.790> don't<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.149> guys<00:01:57.390> we've<00:01:57.719> seen

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
zombies but I don't know guys we've seen

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.139 
zombies but I don't know guys we've seen
it<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.140> every<00:01:58.649> single<00:01:58.920> zombies<00:01:59.490> game<00:01:59.700> before

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it in every single zombies game before

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.450 
it in every single zombies game before
like<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.509> black<00:02:00.750> ops<00:02:00.990> 2<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.799> wore<00:02:02.040> black

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
like in black ops 2 will that wore black

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.209 
like in black ops 2 will that wore black
ops<00:02:02.729> 1<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.479> i<00:02:03.509> highly<00:02:03.899> doubt<00:02:04.320> black<00:02:04.710> ops<00:02:05.009> 3

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
ops 1 so i highly doubt black ops 3

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
ops 1 so i highly doubt black ops 3
would<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.000> game<00:02:06.210> changer<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:06.810> again<00:02:07.079> we

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
would be the game changer but again we

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.050 
would be the game changer but again we
had<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> climax<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
had this is going to be the climax of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.029 
had this is going to be the climax of
zombies<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.690> Vonderhaar<00:02:10.200> says<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.709> we

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
zombies like Vonderhaar says and we

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.100 
zombies like Vonderhaar says and we
really<00:02:11.220> don't<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.879> any<00:02:12.180> idea<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:12.780> again

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
really don't have any idea but again

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.790 
really don't have any idea but again
like<00:02:13.290> i<00:02:13.440> said

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
like i said

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
like i said
is<00:02:13.950> very<00:02:14.160> plausible<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:15.150> black<00:02:15.660> ops<00:02:15.930> 2

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
is very plausible because black ops 2

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
is very plausible because black ops 2
and<00:02:16.350> black<00:02:16.590> ops<00:02:16.830> 1<00:02:17.130> did<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.580> now<00:02:17.790> also

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and black ops 1 did this now also

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.780 
and black ops 1 did this now also
creating<00:02:18.840> another<00:02:19.380> weapon<00:02:19.830> Arsenal<00:02:20.640> is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
creating another weapon Arsenal is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.820 
creating another weapon Arsenal is
something<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.510> would<00:02:21.690> take<00:02:21.900> forever<00:02:22.170> for

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
something that would take forever for

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.070 
something that would take forever for
zombies<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.730> say<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:23.940> example<00:02:24.240> they<00:02:24.750> weren't

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
zombies so say for example they weren't

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.870 
zombies so say for example they weren't
going<00:02:25.350> for<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.650> futuristic<00:02:26.310> setting<00:02:26.550> in

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
going for the futuristic setting in

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.910 
going for the futuristic setting in
black<00:02:27.180> ops<00:02:27.420> 3<00:02:27.540> zombies<00:02:27.690> they<00:02:28.500> would<00:02:28.710> have<00:02:28.890> to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
black ops 3 zombies they would have to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.550 
black ops 3 zombies they would have to
take<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.520> massive<00:02:30.030> amount<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.810> time<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
take a massive amount of time to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.130 
take a massive amount of time to
recreate<00:02:31.950> new<00:02:32.370> weapons<00:02:32.880> or<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.360> rehash<00:02:33.810> them

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
recreate new weapons or to rehash them

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.990 
recreate new weapons or to rehash them
from<00:02:34.350> old<00:02:34.590> game<00:02:34.920> files<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.760> make<00:02:35.970> them

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
from old game files and to make them

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.510 
from old game files and to make them
into<00:02:36.510> better<00:02:36.540> graphics<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.100> new<00:02:38.220> gen

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
into better graphics for the new gen

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.730 
into better graphics for the new gen
consoles<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.210> that's<00:02:39.450> why<00:02:39.720> I'm<00:02:39.930> not<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> hundred

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
consoles so that's why I'm not a hundred

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.680 
consoles so that's why I'm not a hundred
percent<00:02:40.920> sure<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.790> they<00:02:41.910> would<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
percent sure that they would take the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.350 
percent sure that they would take the
old<00:02:42.930> weapons<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.830> do<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.910> think<00:02:44.940> just

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
old weapons and do that and I think just

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.300 
old weapons and do that and I think just
creating<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.900> whole<00:02:46.110> other<00:02:46.350> weapon<00:02:46.860> Arsenal

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
creating a whole other weapon Arsenal

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.160 
creating a whole other weapon Arsenal
would<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> most<00:02:48.180> time<00:02:48.480> consuming<00:02:48.510> part

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
would be the most time consuming part

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.110 
would be the most time consuming part
and<00:02:49.650> again<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:49.980> guys<00:02:50.130> know<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.490> call<00:02:50.760> duties

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
and again you guys know the call duties

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.600 
and again you guys know the call duties
on<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> yearly<00:02:51.600> basis<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:52.320> again<00:02:52.620> black<00:02:53.130> ops<00:02:53.400> 3

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
on a yearly basis but again black ops 3

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.940 
on a yearly basis but again black ops 3
was<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.240> three-year<00:02:54.780> development<00:02:55.380> cycle<00:02:55.800> so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
was in a three-year development cycle so

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.980 
was in a three-year development cycle so
this<00:02:56.160> could<00:02:56.370> very<00:02:56.430> much<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.940> true<00:02:57.480> now<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
this could very much be true now in the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.110 
this could very much be true now in the
little<00:02:58.230> snippet<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.950> zombies<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.790> we<00:02:59.940> were

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
little snippet of zombies that we were

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.330 
little snippet of zombies that we were
able<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:00.990> that<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.500> was<00:03:01.740> confirmed

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
able to see that there was confirmed

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.850 
able to see that there was confirmed
nazi<00:03:02.940> zombie<00:03:03.420> hats<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.080> we<00:03:04.260> sort<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> figured

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
nazi zombie hats and we sort of figured

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.010 
nazi zombie hats and we sort of figured
out<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.850> going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.780> happening

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
out that this is going to be happening

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.830 
out that this is going to be happening
somewhere<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.310> germany<00:03:08.910> area<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.630> just

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
somewhere in the germany area and just

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.080 
somewhere in the germany area and just
guys<00:03:10.260> i<00:03:10.290> think<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:10.950> really<00:03:11.340> cool<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.820> see

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
guys i think it's really cool to see

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.330 
guys i think it's really cool to see
that<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:13.230> already<00:03:13.500> some<00:03:14.010> sort<00:03:14.280> of

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
that that we have already some sort of

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.760 
that that we have already some sort of
idea<00:03:14.550> about<00:03:15.270> black<00:03:15.540> ops<00:03:15.810> 3<00:03:16.020> zombies<00:03:16.050> but<00:03:16.590> guys

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
idea about black ops 3 zombies but guys

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.300 
idea about black ops 3 zombies but guys
think<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.520> buried<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.570> was<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> very<00:03:19.310> 1800

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
think of this buried it was a very 1800

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.430 
think of this buried it was a very 1800
styled<00:03:20.790> map<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> setting<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
styled map but the setting of the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.010 
styled map but the setting of the
zombies<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.489> very<00:03:23.760> futuristic<00:03:24.180> like<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.870> had

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
zombies was very futuristic like we had

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.449 
zombies was very futuristic like we had
the<00:03:25.140> Remington<00:03:25.650> we<00:03:25.800> had<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.010> war<00:03:26.160> machine

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the Remington we had the war machine

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.640 
the Remington we had the war machine
these<00:03:26.640> weapons<00:03:27.120> are<00:03:27.270> quite<00:03:27.660> futuristic<00:03:27.930> now

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
these weapons are quite futuristic now

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.100 
these weapons are quite futuristic now
this<00:03:28.860> could<00:03:29.130> possibly<00:03:29.520> happen<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.780> black

storyline<00:05:09.730> if<00:05:09.910> we're<00:05:10.120> going<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.480> be<00:05:10.600> in<00:05:10.750> the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
storyline if we're going to be in the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.440 
storyline if we're going to be in the
future<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.440> could<00:05:11.890> possibly<00:05:12.490> happen<00:05:12.760> if<00:05:13.120> we're

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
future it could possibly happen if we're

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.360 
future it could possibly happen if we're
going<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.780> be<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.080> past<00:05:14.320> I<00:05:14.560> highly<00:05:15.340> highly

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
going to be in the past I highly highly

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.430 
going to be in the past I highly highly
doubt<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.390> again<00:05:16.630> we<00:05:16.810> are<00:05:16.960> sort<00:05:17.380> of

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
doubt it and again we are sort of

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.500 
doubt it and again we are sort of
unconfirmed<00:05:17.860> with<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.610> whole<00:05:18.760> nazi<00:05:19.180> zombie

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
unconfirmed with the whole nazi zombie

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.120 
unconfirmed with the whole nazi zombie
thing<00:05:19.660> because<00:05:20.140> it<00:05:20.170> doesn't<00:05:20.560> really<00:05:20.740> tell<00:05:21.100> us

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
thing because it doesn't really tell us

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.760 
thing because it doesn't really tell us
anything<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:22.300> guys<00:05:22.480> let's<00:05:23.050> look<00:05:23.200> back<00:05:23.440> at

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
anything and guys let's look back at

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.730 
anything and guys let's look back at
black<00:05:24.190> ops<00:05:24.460> 1<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:25.060> black<00:05:25.480> ops<00:05:25.780> 2<00:05:26.080> zombies<00:05:26.110> so

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
black ops 1 and black ops 2 zombies so

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.500 
black ops 1 and black ops 2 zombies so
the<00:05:26.890> very<00:05:27.100> last<00:05:27.280> map<00:05:27.550> on<00:05:27.730> black<00:05:27.910> ops<00:05:28.120> 1<00:05:28.240> was

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
the very last map on black ops 1 was

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.750 
the very last map on black ops 1 was
moon<00:05:28.750> and<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.080> starting<00:05:29.440> one<00:05:29.620> was<00:05:29.830> transit<00:05:30.580> so

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
moon and the starting one was transit so

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.850 
moon and the starting one was transit so
there<00:05:31.000> is<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.240> sort<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.720> storyline<00:05:32.230> correlation

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
there is a sort of storyline correlation

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.470 
there is a sort of storyline correlation
there<00:05:33.010> after<00:05:33.430> they<00:05:33.550> blow<00:05:33.790> off<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.030> earth<00:05:34.180> then

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
there after they blow off the earth then

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.660 
there after they blow off the earth then
you<00:05:34.660> got<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.840> screw<00:05:35.260> on<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.500> earth<00:05:35.770> that<00:05:36.040> does

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
you got a screw on the earth that does

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.580 
you got a screw on the earth that does
all<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.060> stuff<00:05:37.300> for<00:05:37.480> Richthofen<00:05:38.050> am<00:05:38.140> axis

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
all the stuff for Richthofen am axis

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.260 
all the stuff for Richthofen am axis
that's<00:05:38.800> very<00:05:39.070> understandable<00:05:39.250> but<00:05:40.120> with

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
that's very understandable but with

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.240 
that's very understandable but with
black<00:05:40.510> ops<00:05:40.750> 2<00:05:40.900> in<00:05:41.020> black<00:05:41.260> ops<00:05:41.470> 3<00:05:41.590> I<00:05:41.740> feel<00:05:42.100> this

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
black ops 2 in black ops 3 I feel this

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.680 
black ops 2 in black ops 3 I feel this
is<00:05:42.310> going<00:05:42.640> to<00:05:42.730> be<00:05:42.820> a<00:05:42.850> little<00:05:43.090> bit<00:05:43.240> different

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
is going to be a little bit different

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.060 
is going to be a little bit different
because<00:05:43.780> with<00:05:44.110> black<00:05:44.320> ops<00:05:44.560> 2<00:05:44.710> at<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.860> end

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
because with black ops 2 at the end

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.790 
because with black ops 2 at the end
origins<00:05:45.970> is<00:05:46.300> sort<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:46.810> at<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.110> beginning<00:05:47.230> it's

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
origins is sort of at the beginning it's

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.770 
origins is sort of at the beginning it's
not<00:05:47.980> at<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.250> end<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.730> anything<00:05:49.270> so<00:05:49.600> if

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
not at the end of anything so if

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.050 
not at the end of anything so if
possibly<00:05:50.620> with<00:05:51.100> black<00:05:51.340> ops<00:05:51.580> 3<00:05:51.760> we<00:05:51.910> either

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
possibly with black ops 3 we either

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.850 
possibly with black ops 3 we either
going<00:05:52.390> to<00:05:52.480> be<00:05:52.630> a<00:05:52.660> super<00:05:53.320> far<00:05:53.530> in<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.680> future

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
going to be a super far in the future

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.500 
going to be a super far in the future
after<00:05:54.190> buried<00:05:54.700> but<00:05:54.850> I<00:05:54.910> highly<00:05:55.180> doubt<00:05:55.450> it

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
after buried but I highly doubt it

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.880 
after buried but I highly doubt it
because<00:05:55.690> that<00:05:55.990> was<00:05:56.110> sort<00:05:56.320> of<00:05:56.350> considered<00:05:56.800> the

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
because that was sort of considered the

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.550 
because that was sort of considered the
end<00:05:57.070> of<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.580> world<00:05:57.760> or<00:05:58.090> with<00:05:58.690> black<00:05:58.990> ops<00:05:59.320> 3

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
end of the world or with black ops 3

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.830 
end of the world or with black ops 3
zombies<00:05:59.590> this<00:06:00.130> could<00:06:00.310> possibly<00:06:00.520> possibly<00:06:01.360> be

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
zombies this could possibly possibly be

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.500 
zombies this could possibly possibly be
right<00:06:02.170> after<00:06:02.670> origins<00:06:03.670> and<00:06:03.880> some<00:06:04.090> people<00:06:04.360> say

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
right after origins and some people say

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.540 
right after origins and some people say
even<00:06:04.840> one<00:06:05.110> it's<00:06:05.290> after<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.710> cutscene<00:06:06.100> was

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
even one it's after the cutscene was

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.550 
even one it's after the cutscene was
finished<00:06:06.880> in<00:06:07.030> origins<00:06:07.510> after<00:06:08.230> they<00:06:08.350> closed

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
finished in origins after they closed

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.780 
finished in origins after they closed
the<00:06:08.710> door<00:06:08.890> that's<00:06:09.130> going<00:06:09.430> to<00:06:09.520> be<00:06:09.580> the<00:06:09.670> new

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
the door that's going to be the new

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.550 
the door that's going to be the new
starting<00:06:10.180> map<00:06:10.300> for<00:06:10.480> zombies<00:06:10.870> in<00:06:11.020> black<00:06:11.230> ops<00:06:11.440> 3

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
starting map for zombies in black ops 3

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.790 
starting map for zombies in black ops 3
I<00:06:11.860> have<00:06:12.400> no<00:06:12.640> idea<00:06:12.720> guys<00:06:13.720> but<00:06:14.020> possibly<00:06:14.620> this

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
I have no idea guys but possibly this

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.490 
I have no idea guys but possibly this
could<00:06:14.860> all<00:06:15.340> be<00:06:15.880> happening<00:06:16.360> we<00:06:16.510> really<00:06:16.900> have<00:06:17.140> no

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
could all be happening we really have no

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.650 
could all be happening we really have no
idea<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:18.250> black<00:06:18.520> ops<00:06:18.820> 3<00:06:19.060> again<00:06:19.360> like<00:06:19.510> I<00:06:19.630> said

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
idea and black ops 3 again like I said

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.020 
idea and black ops 3 again like I said
we<00:06:20.320> all<00:06:20.500> know<00:06:20.770> that<00:06:20.980> this<00:06:21.070> fits<00:06:21.400> in<00:06:21.610> with<00:06:22.000> the

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
we all know that this fits in with the

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.850 
we all know that this fits in with the
storyline<00:06:22.660> of<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:23.050> other<00:06:23.230> game<00:06:23.530> so<00:06:23.770> it's

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
storyline of the other game so it's

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.530 
storyline of the other game so it's
either<00:06:24.040> going<00:06:24.340> to<00:06:24.430> be<00:06:24.550> in<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.820> future<00:06:25.210> or<00:06:25.480> in

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
either going to be in the future or in

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.960 
either going to be in the future or in
the<00:06:26.110> between<00:06:26.410> like<00:06:26.830> in<00:06:27.040> der<00:06:27.250> riese<00:06:27.460> and<00:06:27.700> guys<00:06:27.820> I

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
the between like in der riese and guys I

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.730 
the between like in der riese and guys I
think<00:06:28.660> it's<00:06:28.780> so<00:06:28.930> stupid<00:06:29.320> because<00:06:29.410> they've

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
think it's so stupid because they've

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.920 
think it's so stupid because they've
already<00:06:29.980> remade<00:06:30.850> darice<00:06:31.270> why<00:06:31.600> would<00:06:31.810> they

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
already remade darice why would they

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.720 
already remade darice why would they
remake<00:06:32.440> it<00:06:32.590> a<00:06:32.710> third<00:06:32.950> time<00:06:32.980> I<00:06:33.370> just<00:06:33.550> feel<00:06:33.700> so

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
remake it a third time I just feel so

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.940 
remake it a third time I just feel so
stupid<00:06:34.180> but<00:06:34.510> guys<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.930> final<00:06:35.380> conclusion<00:06:35.860> I

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
stupid but guys the final conclusion I

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.010 
stupid but guys the final conclusion I
have<00:06:35.980> for<00:06:36.370> this<00:06:36.430> video<00:06:36.760> for<00:06:37.270> the<00:06:37.450> first<00:06:37.480> map

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
have for this video for the first map

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.830 
have for this video for the first map
speculation<00:06:38.980> it's<00:06:39.190> either<00:06:39.670> going<00:06:39.970> to<00:06:40.090> be

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840
