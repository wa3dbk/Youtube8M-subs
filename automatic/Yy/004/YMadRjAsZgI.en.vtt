00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the upcoming starts you have to do it 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.879
 most of his life 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.770
 eating habits habitual and joy not 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.809
 entertainment communication with loved ones and 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.309
 family and friends and practice 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.170
 shows what exactly the one who can 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.160
 more severely limit himself will achieve 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.160
 more in our sport 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.420
 hello viewers of the channel and get me 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 name is ilya baskin 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.490
 this year I performed in the category 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 classic bodybuilding up to 180 meters 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.150
 on the cup of saint petersburg and finished 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.200
 honorable third place in this video and 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.880
 I would like to talk about how 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 prepare for a novice competition 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.239
 almost from scratch how underwater 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.160
 stone must be prepared and most importantly 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.160
 how not to break and protest the way to the end 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.140
 the first place is probably worth talking 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.880
 about training is important to understand that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 the preparation for the competition is very strong 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.670
 different from ordinary workouts in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.680
 the gym 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.299
 if your ordinary lives you just 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.729
 like to train is not a fact that so 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.689
 will be on preparation moreover training 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.869
 sooner or later will begin to cause 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.570
 disgust when you train on 3 1 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.060
 4 times a day you train without carbohydrates 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.369
 you train without strength you train without 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.679
 mood you have to endure 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.350
 go on here the only thing you can 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.590
 say you have to bite the bullet 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590
 forward 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.860
 the first thing an athlete should do 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.230
 preparing a colored meme is to find a good one 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.260
 Coach necessarily hence experience 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.530
 and even better with a successful competitive 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.210
 of experience 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.330
 here first you need a look with 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.830
 parties secondly a lot of things on 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.750
 which you do not pay attention to 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.910
 which is crucial for the judges and 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.200
 for competitions the coach owes you 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.240
 specify periodization food and this 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.470
 training during preparation is required 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.420
 includes various ways 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.760
 increase efficiency and intensity 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.980
 it can be supersets this be 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.720
 drop sets it doesn't matter if you like the training 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.340
 whether we are preparing or not it should be 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.350
 most productive but it 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.600
 actually and your directed work and 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.950
 your coach's job and still very important 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.140
 listen to your body after all at the end 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.489
 After all we are in the wrong here 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.230
 will be more if you go to 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.130
 preparation but who will do the best 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.920
 form and since chance of injury 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.270
 getting sick burn out is very great a 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 the first to suffer is nervous 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.430
 system 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 important at some points included 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.450
 turn off the tap and turn off warrior mode 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.510
 give yourself some short break 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 saying treat your head to yourself and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.850
 to your body to your health as regards 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.709
 diets 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.840
 first you need to learn how to cook 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.640

 help you prepare well and the most 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.750
 unpleasant of course children are exhausting 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.390
 feeling hungry when you have to 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.200
 this feeling of hunger go to bed 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.180
 wake up and most importantly 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.900
 train strength 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 no energy but 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.299
 go ahead further not really helped 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.390
 carrot game su and all day leaving 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:55.159
 sometimes imagine that this is pineapple what is it 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:04:00.379

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:02.780
 tasty third stage is money if you have 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.310
 there is no way you have to work and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.140
 earn a lot closer to the end 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.909
 training half the time I 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.310
 trained half the time 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.680
 earned money 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.379

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.389
 budget 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.239
 and if he had enough money at the beginning 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.919
 preparation then at the end of the costs majesty 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.430
 geometric progression to this is necessary 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.310
 be ready 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.080
 The main advice by the way about money is not 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.669
 take a loan do not take loans 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.350
 Firstly, you definitely will not give them up 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.699
 competitions and secondly it will be for you 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.310
 extra mental pressure during 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.750
 training regarding health i think 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.460
 you know perfectly well what is between 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.410
 old time bodybuilding and healthy 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.949
 life is absolutely nothing 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.660
 in common 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.880
 so get ready for what you 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.720
 sure to be something to hurt something 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.210
 cut down 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.710
 don't feel like temporary 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.360
 resources on training are limited you 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.260
 will just drown out all your sores 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.910
 all your painkillers injuries 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.600
 antipyretic energetics 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.600
 and so on 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.570
 it is important to understand that all your training 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.520
 one way or another will affect your 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.570
 relationship with a close good 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.669
 man son husband friend colleague you 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.310
 were not sooner or later preparing you 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.050
 become unbearable willpower can 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.419
 enough to prepare for 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.070
 competition keep diet keep 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.960
 mode to say big 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.760
 condition from friends and relatives effect 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.660
 you definitely do not put the problem is that you 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.550
 really imagine yourself 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.070
 control and restrain yourself perfectly 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.840
 impossible probably one of the adequate 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.430
 options it would really limit 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.130
 chat with friends and relatives 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.870
 period of preparation many really rented 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.150
 the apartment is handed some separate 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.110
 dwelling in order not to communicate with 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.479
 friends and relatives 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.039
 but I was lucky my close ones very 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.320
 big understanding of wearing my 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.970
 preparation although I have combined so far 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.039
 it's a shame try to understand what 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.650
 perception of reality in preparation 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.690
 different from ordinary is that you 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.410
 see what annoys you 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.030
 most likely question your head your 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.160
 own relationship therefore 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:18.410
 try to be kinder and more tolerant to 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.900
 people generally all the training reminds 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.990
 such a rise uphill and at first you 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.330
 just being a little hard and unpleasant 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.700
 but in the end with each new step 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.039
 every new month with every new 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.720
 weeks due training is required 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.110
 something added hard training 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.860
 either trimmed his diet get to it 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.570
 another trouble and because of this very 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.550
 many guys that are enough 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.010
 comfortable and easy aha felt about 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.710
 Do not hold off another step 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.720
 of this mode and it's bad because 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.229
 already a lot of money time and 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560
 forces 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.060
 energy spent nothing but 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.070
 frustration and frustration in yourself 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.150
 It does not work so if you do and stood on 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:04.130
 this way you need to reach the end 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.039
 what's interesting before the competition 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.620
 all bad mood all tired 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.870
 all the pain goes away he was built very very 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.699
 fun can be a matter of carbohydrate 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.250
 downloads may be the case is just 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:19.700
 adrenaline in the spirit of rivalry but on 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.010
 in fact, there is absolutely no scene 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.090
 no fear this is a nice feeling i 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.610
 think about worth experiencing 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.590
 maybe it's worth all the preparation of all 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.419
 those tests that withstand and for 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.860
 these half a year 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:33.289
 there is nothing worse than giving up 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.240
 break and then regret all my life 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.210
 about the fact that you have not brought your dream 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.349
