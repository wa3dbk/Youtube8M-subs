00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.210
 hi girls today a lot of videos 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.500
 Interesting 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.290
 if I will explain to you how to admit 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.190
 eye shadow or pencil under the eye 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.279
 without smudging especially for those at the 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.470
 very shaky hand then 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.960
 first of all to have a good effect e 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.869
 to avoid in products advice of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.180
 put a good base of concealer e 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.980
 face powder now this contract in a 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.980
 very abundant way because 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.280
 it will practically avoid making attack 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.920
 the eyeshadow that falls therefore if there are 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.920
 smudge and simplify elimination 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.469
 since while there are this will be the 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.210
 my make up to go out take advantage of it 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.070
 I do complete so I take a 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:03.949
 very light and side eyeshadow e 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.170
 light up the eyelid in mine 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.350
 right eye I will show you how 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.350
 I apply the pencil is the eye shadow in the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.020
 lower part in a fast way e 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.960
 without smudging in the right eye I will do 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.460
 see how you do it because you 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.700
 obviously for girls who have the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.719
 hand is very flickering and I emphasize that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.040
 however, more practical do better 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.740
 because slowly even if you have the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.869
 very busy hand 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.549
 let's say you're still good at it 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.969
 the more the sinuous trait will be without it 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.969
 without three ways 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.580
 look how thin the line now I take 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.149
 a very small brush is a 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.380
 blue eyeshadow let me see how 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.380
 instead I put on eye shadow 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:33.569
 broadside made for you who have the hand 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.030
 a tremonti I will not let me see a 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.680
 trick to make a line like 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.280
 this beautiful thin you have to take a 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:51.469
 lovely soft tissue folded to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:03:00.230
 half is folded on itself in a way 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:03:00.230
 I hope you understand that and then again 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.129
 so 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.519
 so as to prevent this form 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.379
 in case to block the movement of the 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.260
 handkerchief you can apply a little 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:26.610
 scotch and where there are the pleats way 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.610
 such that it sets better to support it 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:48.469
 so also who is the trembling hand if 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.629
 he drools the extra pencil but I believe that 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.109
 instead same method however as 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:56.629
 however at the steady hand I will show you 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.639
 using one is a brush 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.519
 very popular always the same blue 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.519
 of before and I take it with all the bristles 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:15.519
 you see I always put the handkerchief it 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.519
 I keep very well 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.669
 let's do too cola pigtail eye shadow e 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.460
 pencil put in a very subtle way 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.320
 also using a chubby brush 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.180
 then putting the handkerchief in that 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.770
 way also to the hand tremolo and not 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.960
 being able to put eye shadow under rock 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.600
 because everything leccese in more will go to 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.090
 end up being up to 8 from 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.330
 face powder remove excess figures that 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.850
 we put it before and eventually 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.650
 some grain eyeshadow bed I'd say 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.479
 that the result is the same if it is not there 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.240
 had been and handkerchief all one 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.000
 Blue eyeshadow is the purple pencil that 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.240
 see attack here they would have been here 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.460
 basically how it can be useful 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.440
 precisely all the girls they have 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.979
 the very moved hand and in my opinion is a 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.010
 good method I repeat the thing the most 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.320
 however, it's always better to do a lot 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.380
 so much practice make up every day 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.340
 and you will see that the results will be there now 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.340
 I complete my mac
