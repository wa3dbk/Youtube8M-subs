00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
this well on a hacky hearing we're

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:21.690 
this well on a hacky hearing we're
hoping<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.930> some<00:02:03.960> bitoni<00:02:04.380> test<00:02:04.680> two

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.809 

so<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:23.770> just<00:02:23.890> go<00:02:23.980> ahead<00:02:24.040> move<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.370> over<00:02:24.520> real

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
so we just go ahead move this over real

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.530 
so we just go ahead move this over real
quick

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.050 

could<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.630> kind<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.870> side<00:02:29.200> view<00:02:29.500> here<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
could you kind of side view here do you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.540 
could you kind of side view here do you
see<00:02:31.180> how<00:02:31.270> much<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.480> got<00:02:31.660> them<00:02:31.750> through<00:02:31.900> this

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
see how much I got them through this

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.210 
see how much I got them through this
came<00:02:33.550> back<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:33.940> up<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.240> bit<00:02:34.450> more<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
came back this up a little bit more and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:03:02.070 
came back this up a little bit more and
go<00:02:36.220> from<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.490> angle<00:02:53.910> back<00:02:54.910> edge<00:03:01.080> definitely

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
go from this angle back edge definitely

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.300 
go from this angle back edge definitely
for<00:03:02.290> tonight's<00:03:02.500> works<00:03:02.680> better<00:03:02.890> but<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.280> a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
for tonight's works better but this is a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.050 
for tonight's works better but this is a
functional<00:03:04.320> secondary<00:03:05.320> option<00:03:06.060> probably

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
functional secondary option probably

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.940 
functional secondary option probably
they<00:03:07.150> were<00:03:07.270> taunting<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.110> might<00:03:08.290> doll

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
they were taunting with it it might doll

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.580 
they were taunting with it it might doll
