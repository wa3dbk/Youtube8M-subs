clearly working on the forehand and of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.369

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.600 
I think we not worry only about herself
and<00:01:38.920> how<00:01:39.100> she's<00:01:39.340> playing<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.979> vintage<00:01:42.429> on

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
and how she's playing I think vintage on

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.399 
and how she's playing I think vintage on
the<00:01:42.700> other<00:01:42.820> hand<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.210> probably<00:01:43.659> super

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
the other hand is probably super

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.570 
the other hand is probably super
consumed<00:01:44.860> with<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.070> fact<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.340> she's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
consumed with the fact that she's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.710 
consumed with the fact that she's
playing<00:01:45.820> on<00:01:45.970> in<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.149> best<00:01:46.299> place<00:01:46.509> in<00:01:46.689> the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
playing on in the best place in the

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.350 
playing on in the best place in the
world<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.170> also<00:01:47.979> knowing<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.549> Lina's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
world and also knowing that Lina's

record<00:01:49.780> year<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.020> Australia<00:01:50.080> speaks<00:01:50.649> itself<00:01:51.130> I

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
record year in Australia speaks itself I

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.279 
record year in Australia speaks itself I
think<00:01:51.939> vintage<00:01:52.270> will<00:01:52.479> go<00:01:52.600> out<00:01:52.750> with<00:01:52.899> nothing

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
think vintage will go out with nothing

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.830 
think vintage will go out with nothing
