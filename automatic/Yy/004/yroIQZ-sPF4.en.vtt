 if our people start about something 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.630
 talking means the way it is 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.889
 because our people don't like to lie if 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.590
 our people say that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.690
 breed fast as rabbits mean 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.289
 there is information there is information about 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.750
 reproduction speed of rabbits and in will and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.039
 in captivity and really take two 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 rabbit is desirable of course heterosexual and 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.359
 put them in a cage after some 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.309
 time I saw it myself instead of two 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.800
 rollers three four five six seven out 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.000
 example of artificial rabbits even 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 artificial rabbits as you see 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.390
 multiplied question is budding you 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.730
 what they did or not in short 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.680
 see what happens to the real 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.860
 rabbits because what happens to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.160
 rabbit toy science understand not 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160
 can 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.500
 sorry you can ask you a question yes how 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 you think how fast 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.650
 breed rabbits it all depends

 rabbit 16 rabbits and dfm maybe 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.820
 this question seems ridiculous but 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.750
 the program Galileo decided to sort out 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.750
 scientifically, we are a rabbit 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.979
 the farm is about breeding 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.500
 fluffy know firsthand 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.500
 the bride 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.420
 and rabbits are the opposite; males live 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.420
 separately by the way 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.260
 their enclosures are two more spacious than most 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.099
 Here is the groom Abdullah as well as in the east to 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.209
 young weddings were not even familiar wah 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.340
 what eared wife 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:45.269
 the choice is approved as they say be fruitful and 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:49.450
 multiply the night of love does not last long 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.480
 the female is already driven back home here she is 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.880
 will bear offspring 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.690
 [music] 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:03.500
 and Abdullah and in the mouth does not blow 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:07.460
 He is one and many wives for and on Jamil 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.450
 use so i do 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.510
 zuhra and so on on the farm males 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.570
 manufacturers impregnate about 20 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.540
 most per month that's why the males themselves 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.690
 much less here 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.420
 back to breeding speed 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.140
 countdown went rabbit breeder tamara 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.140
 preparing future childish material 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.770
 for the nest besides fenced off 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.260
 part of the cell 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.430
 but in nature rabbits breed in 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.430
 earthen holes 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.360
 not to get cold they are buried 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.790
 below the depth of soil freezing 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.520
 pregnancy is short only 30 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.950
 days during this time in the body and 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.450
 bunny matures from eight to 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.830
 fifteen cubs are such a big family 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.140
 forced measure so nature 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.930
 took care of the livestock 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.970
 rabbits have not faded away because they 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:11.220
 unable to protect their offspring themselves 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.670
 three weeks have passed for the future mother 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.950
 this is a serious time 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.890
 rabbits are born naked so you have to 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:25.050
 warm nests gray down 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.900
 well, or as in our case wool and more 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.990
 a week later , 8 was born 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.120
 charming crumbs 6 girls and two 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.220
 boy 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.640
 it turns out the rate of reproduction of rabbits 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.220
 not so high take your time with 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.770
 conclusions what time 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.270
 kids need to turn 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.140
 in adults 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.050
 while the bunnies are blind and small from 40 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.400
 up to 80 grams weigh on 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.380
 newborn milk 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.700
 20 days later rabbits appear 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.160
 wool and normalizes with sight all this 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.370
 Rabbit time is completely dependent on 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.770
 his mom and and health and temperament in 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.890
 about 1 month old they are evicted 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.060
 from the nest the youth can already eat 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.940
 feed 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.919
 he smoothly goes to all the glue 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.919
 from one bunker feeders 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.840
 edge 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.760
 it is eaten little but often up to 80 times a day 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.900
 the fact is that in the rabbit intestines 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.700
 not enough muscle every next portion 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.060
 signs the previous one and so the food 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.130
 comes to the stomach and if in the throat 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.470
 will dry out 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:52.190
 drinking bowls are arranged according to the principle of a washstand 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.730
 per day 1 bunny licks half a liter 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.730
 liquids 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.669
 sixty days old furry 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.330
 youth vaccinated without exception 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:06.520
 Simply put make vaccinations the thing is 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.259
 rabbits have the weakest immune 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.259
 system among all mammals 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:20.770
 but they can give birth to already 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:21.509
 fourth month and now let's 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.530
 we estimate 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:30.250
 bunny bears posterity month in 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:35.110
 average born 10 rabbits let's say 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.669
 8 of them girls 4 months later they are 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.930
 ready to breed 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:44.830
 in 8 months, the Fuzzies will be 72 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.710
 after year 712 and after three years two 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.230
 will turn into 37 million 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.850
 [music] 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.550
 so the question is how fast 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.710
 breed rabbits can be answered 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.630
 only one 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.910
 quickly and ruthlessly 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.090
 strange that about them have not made a film 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.480
 horror 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:13.260
 something like 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.260
 rabbits they filled the entire planet 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:20.039
 It seems to me that such a speed 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.470
 breeding in rabbits is connected with what 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:24.870
 they have the same beautiful and meat and 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.599
 fantastic fur and they are this way 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:31.530
 try to save the population my dear 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:33.150
 rabbits make no sense better 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.840
 so you have disgusting meat 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.830
 desirable 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.560
 poisonous and instead of fur, shagreen leather 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.660
 That's when you sure and multiply not 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.020
 it will be necessary because there will be nobody 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.020
 Not needed
