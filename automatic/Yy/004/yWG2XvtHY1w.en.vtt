00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Thanks for coming, James.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I called you today because there's something only you can do.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A Tokkyujar train.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
was changed into a Bikkura Tamago.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want you to help it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
OK, Sir Topham Hat.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's up to you, James.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The route is bumpy, so take care!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.800
There it is!

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.800
OK, push it from behind so it dissolves in the water.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.040
The police train was rescued.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.040
Well done, James!

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.080
You're a really useful locomotive.
