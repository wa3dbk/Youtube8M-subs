00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.190
 so what about the functions of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.660
 reference you also have the function 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.900
 square root of the showers function 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.490
 Saturday in Vichy in the second it was not 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.450
 maybe more or less but it's a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 form of indifference that must 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 know is as the name already indicated 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.630
 that the phrase king have elucidated at the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.910
 root of linz one simply takes 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.260
 the square root of the ingot x but we 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 can not learn the interest of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.500
 Any number too is for 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.630
 that when you like the curve 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.359
 representative here of the function 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.700
 considered we see that it is defined 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.309
 on from there and then until then 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.350
 more infinite have qualified on zero + 1 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.649
 so does not end that considers 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.170
 the range to take with 26 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.670
 years we are witnessing the meaning of the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.680
 definition 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.360
 you can not therefore calculated image of me 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.360
 I like their rating to its good rating 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.469
 about the variations you see 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.989
 that she is strictly passersby are 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.760
 thoughtful definition of agreement must 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 well see that they show a maybe 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 not enormously like the functions at the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.150
 fim that are strictly growing 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.010
 we see that it goes up there she 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.229
 functions roots the root function 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.280
 square perhaps to the functions 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.479
 similar have already for no 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.380
 finally you really have to have it in mind 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.380
 it will serve me for the future 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.579
 so I want to see what facts 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.600
 which end to basin but forced to 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.400
 apart from climbing so what is it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.009
 will see changes made pentagon 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.210
 attention the pdf file to an error it 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.970
 there marked me infinity it's not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.520
 possible so already value zero plus one 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:50.410
 movie x fbi 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.720
 bah good prince there strictly between 1.80 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.250
 and arrow not to mention the image of 0 which 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:02.170
 event 0if here I was dull orange 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 otherwise I read so much for your good 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.760
 relationship before not much to do 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.190
 but we will have to remember 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.390
 even for other functions even though 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.010
 it's there are not a lot of things to 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.290
 remember to remember 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.240
 variation easily we will already try 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.290
 the representation of a minor your head 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.090
 this will help you for the following here in at 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.270
 the inverse function has as its name 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.430
 say we take a drink and good x 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.780
 men employers of any language 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.130
 we know we can not take the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.800
 Wed 2 0 in other words we can not / 0 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.280
 as affirmation 0 it is not possible 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.780
 physically it shows you would like it 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.700
 not an image of zero to the indefinite 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.080
 okay so already for expression 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.650
 are going to have real x's equal 1 on ellis 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:03:03.390
 for the whole definition good to my 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:06.989
 infinite 0 union 0 simpler this is for 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.989
 the definition set 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.610
 you can very well say star in 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.019
 it works very well 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.610
 okay we had to be careful 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:21.159
 when you can not talk about variations 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.230
 then inverse function according 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.120
 inverse so this is a function if 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.260
 particular that even its curve 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.079
 representative to water 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.060
 it's a hyperbole we do not confuse with 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.069
 the parable for the function to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.650
 canaries the tension had received nor their 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:41.400
 flight that's where it could possibly 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.400
 serve this vocabulary 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.900
 so it's a 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.540
 so concerning these variations 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.000
 because that's very important for 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.340
 we as far as the functions 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.700
 especially their behavior okay if he 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.799
 wants to be able a little monotony 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.829
 there it is strictly decreasing 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.609
 but on the interval minus infinity these 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.810
 Nobles have noted that she too 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.299
 strictly decreasing on 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.879
 the interval 0 more infinite obviously 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.680
 always zero claimed the terminal that 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.109
 is open at level 2 0 so what is it 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.940
 that is advantageous for the table of 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.250
 variation 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.049
 we are not finishes and hand on 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.569
 my infinite 0 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.550
 finished at 6 0 which touches the cover seen 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:27.069
 it's not set to 0 on it 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.060
 points out in the table the nation in 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:32.949
 medals a double bar one gets 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.000
 remind of her to me we did not want us 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.289
 lets not put it it's not 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.940
 possible then from x chris paul said 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.539
 she d strictly to be at 100 on my 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.639
 infinite 0 the problem is nothing 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.580
 what a beautiful image wrong in the image of 0 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.490
 have therefore received direct 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.759
 increments on 0.8 infinity okay on 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.569
 be careful about the interval 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:02.080
 when we talk about the monotony of a 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:15.060
 function all to avoid saying that f is 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:17.409
 strictly decreasing on the canvas 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.919
 okay it's through the interval is this 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.960
 that I know of 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.560
 r stars it's a million 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.150
 at intervals we pay attention we speak 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.680
 well from the interval mans infinity 0 and 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.680
 then intervalzero simpler
