well the plan is perfectly simple you
take<00:00:26.350> a<00:00:26.560> bucket<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.070> drill<00:00:27.490> a<00:00:27.520> hole<00:00:27.760> in<00:00:27.939> the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
take a bucket you drill a hole in the

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.300 
take a bucket you drill a hole in the
bottom<00:00:28.360> you<00:00:28.900> stick<00:00:29.110> a<00:00:29.140> tomato<00:00:29.529> plant<00:00:29.830> so<00:00:30.189> it

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
bottom you stick a tomato plant so it

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.130 
bottom you stick a tomato plant so it
sticks<00:00:30.970> out<00:00:31.180> of<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.360> bottom<00:00:31.689> you<00:00:31.810> fill<00:00:32.020> it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
sticks out of the bottom you fill it

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.320 
sticks out of the bottom you fill it
with<00:00:32.169> soil<00:00:32.470> you<00:00:33.010> can<00:00:33.040> even<00:00:33.400> grow<00:00:33.580> other<00:00:33.880> plants

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
with soil you can even grow other plants

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.630 
with soil you can even grow other plants
in<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.570> top<00:00:34.780> if<00:00:34.989> you<00:00:35.110> like<00:00:35.290> and<00:00:36.190> then<00:00:36.309> you<00:00:36.340> hang

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
in the top if you like and then you hang

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.040 
in the top if you like and then you hang
it<00:00:36.790> up<00:00:36.940> somewhere<00:00:37.390> where<00:00:37.660> it's<00:00:37.780> going<00:00:37.900> to<00:00:37.960> be

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
it up somewhere where it's going to be

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.170 
it up somewhere where it's going to be
nice<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.410> sunny<00:00:38.559> now<00:00:38.890> in<00:00:39.040> this<00:00:39.129> case<00:00:39.340> I've<00:00:40.030> got

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
nice and sunny now in this case I've got

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.970 
nice and sunny now in this case I've got
my<00:00:40.300> trusty<00:00:40.570> little<00:00:40.809> climbing<00:00:41.410> Frank

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
my trusty little climbing Frank

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.000 
my trusty little climbing Frank
and<00:00:42.100> I've<00:00:43.030> actually<00:00:43.530> purposely<00:00:44.530> made<00:00:44.800> these

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
and I've actually purposely made these

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.780 
and I've actually purposely made these
sparse<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.820> stick<00:00:46.210> out<00:00:46.390> like<00:00:46.720> so<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.430> they

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
sparse to stick out like so and they

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.549 
sparse to stick out like so and they
make<00:00:49.000> ideal<00:00:49.809> hanging<00:00:51.780> spars<00:00:52.780> for<00:00:53.320> these

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
make ideal hanging spars for these

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.510 
make ideal hanging spars for these
buckets

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400 

when<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.240> drilling<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> hole<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.230> have

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
when you're drilling the hole you have

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.460 
when you're drilling the hole you have
to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.860> little<00:01:02.040> bit<00:01:02.280> careful<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:04.260> one

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to be a little bit careful this one

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.330 
to be a little bit careful this one
turned<00:01:04.740> out<00:01:04.890> fine<00:01:05.690> unfortunately<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:08.100> one

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
turned out fine unfortunately this one

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.260 
turned out fine unfortunately this one
didn't<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.620> as<00:01:10.620> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.400> cracked<00:01:11.940> now

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
didn't and as you can see it cracked now

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
didn't and as you can see it cracked now
the<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.930> secret<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> drilling<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.980> base<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the the secret to drilling the base of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.250 
the the secret to drilling the base of
the<00:01:14.340> bucket<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.210> very<00:01:15.630> gentle<00:01:15.720> with

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
the bucket to be very very gentle with

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.770 
the bucket to be very very gentle with
the<00:01:16.410> drill<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.540> you're<00:01:18.660> almost

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the drill and so is if you're almost

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
the drill and so is if you're almost
like<00:01:19.020> burning<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.620> way<00:01:19.710> through<00:01:20.040> rather

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
like burning your way through rather

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.740 
like burning your way through rather
than<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:21.090> cutting<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.570> what

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
than actually cutting because what

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510 
than actually cutting because what
happen<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.050> this<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.230> as<00:01:22.980> soon<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.280> broke

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
happen with this one as soon as I broke

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.150 
happen with this one as soon as I broke
through<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.090> drill<00:01:24.690> sort<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.260> jumped<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
through the drill sort of jumped in and

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:40.420 
through the drill sort of jumped in and
it<00:01:26.310> snaps<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> bucket<00:01:38.180> now<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> type<00:01:39.630> of

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
it snaps the bucket now the type of

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
it snaps the bucket now the type of
tomato<00:01:41.430> plant<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.660> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
tomato plant on going for now is a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.380 
tomato plant on going for now is a
center<00:01:43.830> floor<00:01:44.040> type<00:01:44.340> now<00:01:44.580> these<00:01:44.760> are<00:01:45.060> supposed

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
center floor type now these are supposed

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
center floor type now these are supposed
to<00:01:45.540> give<00:01:45.800> extremely<00:01:46.800> high<00:01:46.950> yields<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.520> small

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
to give extremely high yields of small

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.130 
to give extremely high yields of small
cherry<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.510> plum<00:01:48.810> sized<00:01:49.670> tomatoes<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
cherry or plum sized tomatoes and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.660 
cherry or plum sized tomatoes and
they're<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> bush<00:01:52.470> type<00:01:52.800> which<00:01:53.190> means<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
they're a bush type which means that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.310 
they're a bush type which means that
hopefully<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.360> should<00:01:54.630> grow<00:01:54.930> quite<00:01:55.290> well

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
hopefully they should grow quite well

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.140 
hopefully they should grow quite well
side<00:01:55.950> down<00:01:56.160> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> bucket<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:56.970> at<00:01:57.060> least

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
side down in the bucket well at least

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.510 
side down in the bucket well at least
that's<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.540> theory<00:01:57.750> anyway<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.369> let's<00:01:59.369> give

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's the theory anyway so let's give

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.790 
that's the theory anyway so let's give
it<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.940> see<00:02:00.060> how<00:02:00.840> how<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:06.800> okay

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
it a go and see how how we get on okay

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.190 
it a go and see how how we get on okay
I've<00:02:08.190> never<00:02:08.220> done<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> before<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> decided

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
I've never done this before so I decided

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.510 
I've never done this before so I decided
I'd<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:10.350> sort<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.710> jump<00:02:11.009> straight<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I'd just sort of jump straight in and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
I'd just sort of jump straight in and
have<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> go<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.180> decided<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.320> best<00:02:13.500> approach

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
have a go I decided the best approach

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
have a go I decided the best approach
was<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.310> very<00:02:14.550> gently<00:02:14.690> persuade<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
was just to very gently persuade the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.620 
was just to very gently persuade the
leaves<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:17.370> through<00:02:17.580> without<00:02:17.820> snapping<00:02:18.360> or

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
leaves to go through without snapping or

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.830 
leaves to go through without snapping or
bending<00:02:19.020> them<00:02:19.550> now<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.580> also<00:02:20.970> decided<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.690> would

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
bending them now I also decided I would

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.140 
bending them now I also decided I would
remove<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.380> bottom<00:02:22.680> two<00:02:22.890> leaves<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:24.000> would

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
remove the bottom two leaves and I would

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.750 
remove the bottom two leaves and I would
plant<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.860> base<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> plant<00:02:26.550> very

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
plant the the base of the plant very

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.360 
plant the the base of the plant very
deeply<00:02:27.270> within<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> pot<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.370> hopefully

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
deeply within the pot and hopefully

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.040 
deeply within the pot and hopefully
where<00:02:29.550> I'd<00:02:29.700> removed<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.450> two<00:02:30.690> leaves

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
where I'd removed the two leaves

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.980 
where I'd removed the two leaves
hopefully<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.069> would<00:02:32.250> turn<00:02:32.730> into<00:02:33.030> feeder

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
hopefully that would turn into feeder

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.180 
hopefully that would turn into feeder
roots<00:02:35.569> then<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.900> decided<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.260> would<00:02:37.440> add<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
roots then I just decided I would add a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.720 
roots then I just decided I would add a
good<00:02:38.640> variety<00:02:39.000> or<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.540> good<00:02:39.720> mix<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.290> different

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
good variety or a good mix of different

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.180 
good variety or a good mix of different
composts<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.970> soils<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.990> found<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> was<00:02:44.130> easier

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
composts and soils I found it was easier

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.130 
composts and soils I found it was easier
to<00:02:44.490> balance<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.120> bucket<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.569> little<00:02:45.810> cup

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
to balance the bucket on a little cup

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.980 
to balance the bucket on a little cup
type<00:02:46.610> pot<00:02:47.610> makes<00:02:48.360> life<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.660> little<00:02:48.750> bit<00:02:48.930> easier

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
type pot makes life a little bit easier

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.700 
type pot makes life a little bit easier
and<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.250> added<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.150> say<00:02:51.330> different

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
and I just added as I say different

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.710 
and I just added as I say different
styles<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.880> compost<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.300> vermiculite

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
styles of compost a bit of vermiculite

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.830 
styles of compost a bit of vermiculite
and<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.530> course<00:02:55.800> crushed<00:02:56.700> oyster<00:02:56.910> shell<00:02:57.510> which

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and of course crushed oyster shell which

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.190 
and of course crushed oyster shell which
provides<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.650> calcium<00:02:59.280> which<00:03:00.270> helps<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
provides a calcium which helps in the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.170 
provides a calcium which helps in the
prevention<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.830> blossom<00:03:02.340> end<00:03:02.520> rot<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.030> all<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
prevention of blossom end rot so all I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.930 
prevention of blossom end rot so all I
did<00:03:06.330> was<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:06.660> at<00:03:07.430> different<00:03:08.430> types<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.730> soil

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
did was just at different types of soil

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.700 
did was just at different types of soil
you<00:03:09.270> know<00:03:09.450> layer<00:03:09.690> at<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.960> time<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.380> then<00:03:10.500> mix

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
you know layer at a time and then mix

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.450 
you know layer at a time and then mix
them<00:03:10.890> up<00:03:11.040> as<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.400> went

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
them up as I went

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.190 
them up as I went
so<00:03:12.610> essentially<00:03:13.420> what<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.630> end<00:03:13.780> up<00:03:13.870> with<00:03:14.050> is

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
so essentially what you end up with is

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.650 
so essentially what you end up with is
kind<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.530> like<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.710> Mel's<00:03:15.070> mix<00:03:15.520> from<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.060> square

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
kind of like a Mel's mix from the square

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:27.460 
kind of like a Mel's mix from the square
for<00:03:16.870> gardening<00:03:17.260> method

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.170 

so<00:03:28.470> there<00:03:28.770> we<00:03:28.860> have<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.310> finished<00:03:29.490> thing

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
so there we have the finished thing

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.410 
so there we have the finished thing
we've<00:03:30.480> got<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:31.130> little<00:03:32.130> tomato<00:03:32.370> plant<00:03:32.880> hanging

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
we've got a little tomato plant hanging

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.620 
we've got a little tomato plant hanging
out<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.600> bottom<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:35.060> plenty<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.150> soil<00:03:36.330> in<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
out the bottom and plenty of soil in the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.370 
out the bottom and plenty of soil in the
top<00:03:36.840> there<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.970> hopefully<00:03:42.050> that's<00:03:43.050> going<00:03:43.290> to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
top there and hopefully that's going to

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.760 
top there and hopefully that's going to
sit<00:03:43.560> there<00:03:43.740> quite<00:03:44.250> happily<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:45.470> grow<00:03:46.470> away<00:03:46.709> to

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
sit there quite happily and grow away to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.750 
sit there quite happily and grow away to
its<00:03:47.010> heart's<00:03:47.280> content

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
its heart's content

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.410 
its heart's content
now<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:49.530> problem<00:03:49.890> there<00:03:50.130> will<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:51.270> it

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
now the problem there will be is if it

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.920 
now the problem there will be is if it
gets<00:03:51.540> windy<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.350> buckets<00:03:52.800> going<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.130> want<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
gets windy the buckets going to want to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.880 
gets windy the buckets going to want to
tend<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.550> swing<00:03:56.550> around<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:57.060> lot<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:58.620> order

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
tend to swing around a lot so in order

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.860 
tend to swing around a lot so in order
to<00:03:58.980> get<00:03:59.100> around<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.580> I'm<00:03:59.760> going<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.000> fasten

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
to get around that I'm going to fasten

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.430 
to get around that I'm going to fasten
it<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.459> actual<00:04:02.459> post<00:04:03.269> itself<00:04:03.750> I'm<00:04:04.230> going

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
it to the actual post itself I'm going

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:14.880 
it to the actual post itself I'm going
to<00:04:04.500> do<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.860> using<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.400> bit<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.640> builders<00:04:06.060> band

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:41.379 

you

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.899 

now<00:04:42.289> builders<00:04:42.770> band<00:04:43.009> can<00:04:43.340> be<00:04:43.370> quite<00:04:43.699> expensive

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
now builders band can be quite expensive

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.809 
now builders band can be quite expensive
to<00:04:44.330> buy<00:04:44.509> so<00:04:45.139> a<00:04:45.169> cheaper<00:04:45.650> alternative<00:04:45.680> is<00:04:46.400> to

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
to buy so a cheaper alternative is to

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:57.279 
to buy so a cheaper alternative is to
use<00:04:46.849> cable<00:04:47.629> ties

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:17.690 

you

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:35.990 

you

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.500 

nice<00:05:37.000> clean<00:05:37.419> floor<00:05:38.700> what<00:05:39.700> I<00:05:39.730> have<00:05:39.940> noticed<00:05:40.120> is

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
nice clean floor what I have noticed is

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.650 
nice clean floor what I have noticed is
the<00:05:41.100> when<00:05:42.100> you<00:05:42.220> water<00:05:42.370> them<00:05:42.730> and<00:05:42.880> they<00:05:43.419> drip

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
the when you water them and they drip

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.210 
the when you water them and they drip
out<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.930> bottom<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:45.370> start<00:05:45.610> with<00:05:45.880> they<00:05:46.270> drip<00:05:47.230> a

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
out the bottom to start with they drip a

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.330 
out the bottom to start with they drip a
lot<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.180> compost<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.050> stuff<00:05:50.350> out<00:05:50.590> but<00:05:51.190> then

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
lot of compost and stuff out but then

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.980 
lot of compost and stuff out but then
the<00:05:51.520> water<00:05:51.669> comes<00:05:51.910> out<00:05:52.120> clear<00:05:52.419> so<00:05:52.750> I<00:05:52.780> think

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
the water comes out clear so I think

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:09.219 
the water comes out clear so I think
that's<00:05:53.320> just<00:05:53.440> where<00:05:53.650> they're<00:05:53.740> settling<00:05:54.160> down

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.499 

so<00:06:10.229> that's<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:10.919> for<00:06:11.129> now<00:06:11.310> that's<00:06:11.699> all<00:06:11.909> I<00:06:12.060> can<00:06:12.300> do

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
so that's it for now that's all I can do

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.529 
so that's it for now that's all I can do
I<00:06:13.080> have<00:06:13.469> to<00:06:13.590> admit<00:06:13.800> they're<00:06:14.009> not<00:06:14.159> looking

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
I have to admit they're not looking

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.540 
I have to admit they're not looking
particularly<00:06:15.539> happy<00:06:16.169> right<00:06:16.349> now<00:06:16.379> being<00:06:16.919> held

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
particularly happy right now being held

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.249 
particularly happy right now being held
upside<00:06:18.029> down<00:06:18.210> hopefully<00:06:18.749> that's<00:06:18.960> going<00:06:19.139> to

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
upside down hopefully that's going to

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.040

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
change over the next couple of days as I

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.300

said<00:06:22.289> earlier<00:06:22.529> in<00:06:22.590> the<00:06:22.680> video<00:06:22.889> this<00:06:23.069> is<00:06:23.129> the

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
said earlier in the video this is the

said earlier in the video this is the
first<00:06:23.580> time<00:06:23.789> I've<00:06:23.939> done<00:06:23.969> this<00:06:24.389> so<00:06:25.080> it's<00:06:25.830> all<00:06:26.039> a

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
first time I've done this so it's all a

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:27.769 
first time I've done this so it's all a
bit<00:06:26.279> of<00:06:26.310> an<00:06:26.460> experiment<00:06:26.939> for<00:06:27.360> me<00:06:27.389> about

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
bit of an experiment for me about

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.360 
bit of an experiment for me about
hopefully<00:06:28.789> touchwood<00:06:29.789> things<00:06:30.509> will<00:06:30.810> turn<00:06:31.139> out

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
hopefully touchwood things will turn out

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.909 
hopefully touchwood things will turn out
for<00:06:32.370> the<00:06:32.520> best<00:06:32.719> so<00:06:33.719> all<00:06:33.990> I<00:06:34.050> can<00:06:34.199> do<00:06:34.289> now<00:06:34.439> is<00:06:34.469> sit

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
for the best so all I can do now is sit

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.379 
for the best so all I can do now is sit
