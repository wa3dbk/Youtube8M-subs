00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.360

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.100
 my bad board and those friends to whom 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.900
 you also condemn you by mouth 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.910

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.769
 whole in the waiting room just in case 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.180
 something was missing and they are the same as 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.380
 they are waiting to go to the court and 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.330
 when I take them to martincito the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.310
 court for them our son is like 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.079
 if it were your son you know that they do not have a 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.190
 fucking penny my friends but I already 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.020
 they bought the shirt 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.590
 every time they want to buy a coca 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.040
 for him and these bullies like you 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.400
 you say are proudly like that and you 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.110
 you want to take to the farce of your family 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.060
 born to pretend by lowering the 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.920
 rest just because they inherited a great 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.320
 company did not even earn them 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.130
 he pulled from above that they know of pains 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.410
 hugs that will speak to me of belgrano 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.780
 why our son as honest as a 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.060
 drunk like a madman is always going to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.000
 prefer the court because while in your 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.970
 family talk about prices us 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.700
 we talk about values the woman looks at 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.170
 almost unanswered swallows for 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.590
 moisturize a throat that looks like 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.280
 wood 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.150
 and I, who am not a member, can also go 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.970
 the guy is surprised is worth my life 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.579
 It's worth the doors and the arms 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.500
 they are always open but it does not make me 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.840
 no song I'm going to do and 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.680
 you're going to learn, dear, you're going to 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.870
 learn hey that woman turns 16 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.550
 always coming to the court with the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590
 friends of your husband who are your own 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.620
 friends and he's right behind that 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.440
 flag that prays when you see him from the arms 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.200
 open plays the celestial that is what 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.200
 God want and God want to get the bird
