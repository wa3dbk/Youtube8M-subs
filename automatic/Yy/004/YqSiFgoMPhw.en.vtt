yourself you know a piece of webbing

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.780 
yourself you know a piece of webbing
this<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.560> where<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.800> attaches<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.610> lower

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
this is where it attaches to the lower

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.840 
this is where it attaches to the lower
hole<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.739> in<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:25.830> case<00:02:26.160> you're<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.790> to

hole and in this case you're going to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.259 
hole and in this case you're going to
need<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> loop<00:02:27.300> here<00:02:28.819> because<00:02:29.819> when<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> reach

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
need a loop here because when you reach

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.059 
need a loop here because when you reach
that<00:02:30.300> point<00:02:30.540> you're<00:02:31.230> going<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.410> end<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:31.680> zip

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
that point you're going to end up zip
