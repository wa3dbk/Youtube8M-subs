00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:55.120 
all right let's see what the temperature
is<00:02:50.140> well<00:02:51.140> I'm<00:02:51.440> almost<00:02:51.680> halfway<00:02:51.950> there

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.610 

it's<00:02:55.640> really<00:02:55.940> actually<00:02:56.840> not<00:02:57.050> that<00:02:57.110> bad<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.530> a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
it's really actually not that bad of a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.440 
it's really actually not that bad of a
run<00:02:59.080> I<00:03:00.520> think<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.580> cool<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:01.970> happen<00:03:02.360> a

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
run I think the cool this happen a

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.560 
run I think the cool this happen a
little<00:03:02.690> bit<00:03:02.810> out<00:03:02.930> life<00:03:03.410> out<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.680> me<00:03:03.890> but<00:03:04.130> I

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
little bit out life out of me but I

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.620 
little bit out life out of me but I
guess<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.690> used<00:03:06.080> to<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.320> would<00:03:06.440> be<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.710> bad<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
guess it used to it would be so bad and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.790 
guess it used to it would be so bad and
that<00:03:11.630> too<00:03:11.990> many<00:03:12.080> people<00:03:12.140> looking<00:03:12.560> at<00:03:12.650> me<00:03:12.770> I

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
that too many people looking at me I

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.680 
that too many people looking at me I
think<00:03:12.950> they're<00:03:13.070> more<00:03:13.220> concerned<00:03:13.400> about<00:03:13.690> give

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
think they're more concerned about give

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.560 
think they're more concerned about give
me<00:03:14.780> home<00:03:14.930> for<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.140> holiday<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:16.570> guess

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
me home for the holiday so I guess

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.520 
me home for the holiday so I guess
that's<00:03:17.690> a<00:03:17.840> good<00:03:17.870> thing

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
that's a good thing

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.820 
that's a good thing
the<00:03:19.250> basically<00:03:19.640> what<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.820> do<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:24.280> touch<00:03:25.280> it

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
the basically what I do is I touch it

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.280 
the basically what I do is I touch it
yeah<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:30.050> run<00:03:30.230> back<00:03:31.750> when<00:03:32.750> I'm<00:03:32.900> passing<00:03:33.080> a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
yeah I can run back when I'm passing a

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.200 
yeah I can run back when I'm passing a
sign<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:33.680> now<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.130> do<00:03:34.340> temperature

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
sign right now this to do temperature

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.200 
sign right now this to do temperature
was<00:03:35.440> 47<00:03:36.440> degrees<00:03:36.560> push<00:03:37.550> against<00:03:37.850> really<00:03:38.060> isn't

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
was 47 degrees push against really isn't

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.320 

fortunately<00:03:58.800> I'm<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.700> mile<00:03:59.910> away<00:04:00.030> from<00:04:00.180> my

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
fortunately I'm a mile away from my

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.690 
fortunately I'm a mile away from my
house<00:04:00.599> so<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.140> had<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.830> could<00:04:02.010> crawl<00:04:02.310> there<00:04:02.640> if

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
house so I had to I could crawl there if

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.470
