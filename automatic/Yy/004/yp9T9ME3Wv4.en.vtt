00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.909 
whole of we are talking about society
and<00:03:40.269> its<00:03:40.389> ramifications<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:41.379> think<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.769> could

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
and its ramifications I think I could

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.860 
and its ramifications I think I could
scare<00:03:42.220> an<00:03:42.370> entire<00:03:42.669> society<00:03:42.909> vied<00:03:43.419> to<00:03:43.449> do<00:03:43.720> an

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
scare an entire society vied to do an

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.569 
scare an entire society vied to do an
item<00:03:44.109> number<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:44.680> no<00:03:44.799> it's<00:03:44.980> sort<00:03:45.129> of<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.310> car<00:03:45.459> I

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
item number so no it's sort of the car I

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.979 
item number so no it's sort of the car I
just<00:03:45.849> think<00:03:45.970> today<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.299> think<00:03:46.629> that<00:03:46.750> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
just think today I think that the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.869 
just think today I think that the
younger<00:03:47.290> generation<00:03:47.889> are<00:03:48.069> really<00:03:48.340> prepared

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
younger generation are really prepared

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.460 
younger generation are really prepared
and<00:03:49.180> they're<00:03:49.359> really<00:03:49.510> confident<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:50.290> there's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
and they're really confident so there's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.110 
and they're really confident so there's
not<00:03:50.620> much<00:03:50.889> to<00:03:51.099> really<00:03:51.340> wait<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.790> watch<00:03:51.909> out

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
not much to really wait and watch out

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.759 
not much to really wait and watch out
for<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.930> know<00:03:53.019> there<00:03:53.169> used<00:03:53.199> to<00:03:53.349> be<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.500> time

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
for you know there used to be a time

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.170 
for you know there used to be a time
where<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.159> know<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.370> were<00:03:54.639> initially<00:03:54.819> they

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
where you know you were initially they

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.789 
where you know you were initially they
were<00:03:55.239> raw<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.840> then<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.139> had<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.349> certain

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
were raw and then they had a certain

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.000 
were raw and then they had a certain
kind<00:03:56.979> of<00:03:57.099> bandwidth<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.870> improvement<00:03:59.769> but<00:03:59.979> i

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
kind of bandwidth of improvement but i

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.500 
kind of bandwidth of improvement but i
think<00:04:00.310> these<00:04:00.430> days<00:04:00.729> in<00:04:00.909> fact<00:04:01.120> what<00:04:01.269> you<00:04:01.389> have

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
think these days in fact what you have

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.879 
think these days in fact what you have
to<00:04:01.599> do<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:01.840> turn<00:04:01.989> down<00:04:02.229> their<00:04:02.409> confidence

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
to do is turn down their confidence

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.979 
to do is turn down their confidence
levels<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:03.940> they<00:04:04.060> are<00:04:04.120> also<00:04:04.150> raring<00:04:04.870> to

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
levels because they are also raring to

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.899 
levels because they are also raring to
go<00:04:05.109> to<00:04:05.169> face<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.620> camera<00:04:05.979> that<00:04:06.459> sometimes<00:04:06.849> you
