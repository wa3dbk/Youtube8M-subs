00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.900
 welcome to a scalar tutorial today 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
 we are going to begin to assemble 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.219
 sando inspired the 20s for it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.490
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.790
 materials a little ankle of which we have 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.900
 employee to choose the shawl the needle of 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.900
 3 mm crochet 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.850
 a count them 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.850
 and one 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.480
 Well, we started 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.770
 to start we will take the second phase 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.010
 of construction of the sun with the right 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.690
 of the work looking up on 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.470
 she will place trying to fit in 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.470
 This line 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.420
 this here is what we are going to weave and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.260
 where the two pieces are going to be joined 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 to help us weave better we are going to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.940
 put markers in the center 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.640
 corners and 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.350
 the upper part where the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.430
 increases and the line goes up 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.540
 well and we will start to knit here 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.430
 I will perform 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.020
 a low point joining the first phase and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.020
 going through the second 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.120
 now 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:46.130
 I'll make a chain stitch and knit 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.600
 what would be at the end of the stick here and 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.070
 would join in the part d 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.220
 phase 2 also 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.830
 I would like to clarify that phase 3 of 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.490
 take the opening facing the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.410
 interior comes we will begin to unite the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.330
 two first phase of construction with the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.000
 third start explaining how we are going to 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.220
 make the line the stoves we 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.310
 we will join with two of the squares that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.280
 we see here from here we will leave a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.270
 space of 123 squares and the fourth 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.459
 we will unite with this block one two three 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.060
 and the fourth with this gold breaks from 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.060
 chain stitch 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.440
 Y 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.440
 we will join 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.850
 with a flat stitch another chain stitch 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.750
 and we will go to another space point 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.520
 and now here to cover the distance 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:57.850
 of the three squares and get to the 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:01.420
 fourth we will do 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 points of 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.550
 chain 1 2 3 and in the 4th square 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.850
 I put the needle and go to the first block 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:14.470
 taking the central high point of the 3 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.970
 that there is here and 1 with a low point 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.970
 I will do so until the end 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.109
 we will join together as follows 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.550
 every high point start with this 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.800
 here they will join with a low point in 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.470
 half a chain 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.520
 we return to join these two with a point 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.660
 satin a chain stitch we unite 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.660
 new with satin stitch
