a<00:03:18.560> fan<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:20.380> commentaries<00:03:21.380> but<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.739> I

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
a fan of the commentaries but that I

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.710 
a fan of the commentaries but that I
think<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.400> because<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.790> guys<00:03:22.910> don't<00:03:23.180> really

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
think is because you guys don't really

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.190 
think is because you guys don't really
give<00:03:24.530> him<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.769> chance<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:26.600> was<00:03:26.810> sort<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.080> an
