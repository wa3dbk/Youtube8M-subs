looking<00:01:53.050> for<00:01:53.170> certain<00:01:53.380> reverbs<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.920> outboard

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
looking for certain reverbs the outboard

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.710 
looking for certain reverbs the outboard
units<00:01:54.520> are<00:01:54.670> definitely<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.180> best<00:01:55.420> because

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
units are definitely the best because

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.630 
units are definitely the best because
the<00:01:55.960> springs<00:01:56.290> float<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:56.890> that's<00:01:57.460> what's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
the springs float and that's what's

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.040 
the springs float and that's what's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
it's basically the whole lessons going

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's basically the whole lessons going
to<00:02:04.030> be<00:02:04.120> evolved<00:02:04.450> around<00:02:04.659> a<00:02:04.870> in<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.740> sense<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.580> if

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
to be evolved around a in a sense so if

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.100 
to be evolved around a in a sense so if
you<00:02:07.150> listen<00:02:07.390> in<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.540> beginning<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:07.960> riff

or right now I'm using an open a to kind
of<00:02:11.769> sustain<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.209> start<00:02:13.420> getting<00:02:13.540> into

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
of sustain then we start getting into

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.160 
of sustain then we start getting into
the<00:02:13.989> little<00:02:14.290> riff<00:02:14.440> right<00:02:14.650> here
