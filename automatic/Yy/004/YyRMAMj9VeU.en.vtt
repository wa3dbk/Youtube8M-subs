00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 remember that you 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.350
 this is my life they are only entities that apply in each job 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.830
 forming part of other daily behaviors and attitudes in the practices

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
 area 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.980
 in most of the work activities 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.420
 and manual handling of loads is usual even if it is something that is part of 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.780
 our daily work 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 and in appearance we find it especially dangerous 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.420
 in practice it can become a source of numerous risks 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.960
 in Spain a large part of the accidents real data that occur 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.430
 serene incorrect handling of the boxes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210
 to the point that one-third absenteeism at work goes because of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.800
 accidents originates precisely on that reason 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.890
 to avoid the damages that may occur for this reason 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.250
 it is necessary to control the situation 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.950
 foreseeing and controlling any circumstance that may result 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.879
 dangerous for workers 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.780
 the limitations of our own body is one but its motive is 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.250
 The main problem is that manual handling of loads poses a risk to health 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.819
 any overexertion apple that we submit to our supporting structure 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:29.269
 composed of bones and joints and lamothe ligaments 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.400
 conformed by the muscles and the tendons hello control ie the 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.399
 nervous system can cause serious damage 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.909
 the bone structure of the spine itself limit the movements of 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.209
 rotation as well as lateral and backward bending 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:51.629
 on the other hand the pressure on the column increases to the extent that 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.019
 we separate the load from the body 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.730
 to control the weight the most important thing is to have a knowledge 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.590
 complete of those circumstances that favor it although in appearance if 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.369
 they have conditions 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:09.659
 some of these are what make our work more common 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.400
 so by being accustomed to performing the sharia river we do not take the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.289
 precautions due 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:20.859
 You can also enter, I risk the actions we take because of 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.719
 unexpected situations 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.049
 or those that involve small efforts and diplomas often without taking 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.699
 precautions 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.900
 these last ones can cause injuries whose effects are not immediate so

 requires that manual manipulation decades 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.139
 I demanded that we perform various actions with our body 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.070
 although these will be simultaneously in most of the 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.569
 actions always stands out among the others 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.710
 the fastening of a load is one of them 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.710

 circumstances
