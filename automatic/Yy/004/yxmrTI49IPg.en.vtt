sprayer off to the side here now in this
case<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.310> set<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.699> we've<00:00:24.180> actually<00:00:24.420> got

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
case and this set up we've actually got

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.290 
case and this set up we've actually got
a<00:00:25.010> filtered<00:00:26.010> water<00:00:26.160> system<00:00:26.760> that's<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.119> this

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
a filtered water system that's on this

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.349 
a filtered water system that's on this
side<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.920> two<00:00:29.160> main<00:00:29.400> types<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.880> faucets

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
side you have two main types of faucets

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.600 
side you have two main types of faucets
that<00:00:30.480> you'll<00:00:30.660> find<00:00:30.900> today<00:00:31.289> there's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.250> stem

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that you'll find today there's a stem

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
that you'll find today there's a stem
and<00:00:32.940> valve<00:00:33.510> type<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> compression

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and valve type and then a compression

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.650 
and valve type and then a compression
type<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> compression<00:00:36.000> type<00:00:36.239> will<00:00:36.450> use

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
type now the compression type will use

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.319 
type now the compression type will use
washers<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> stem<00:00:38.520> type<00:00:38.879> basically

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
washers and then the stem type basically

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.750 
washers and then the stem type basically
it<00:00:39.540> has<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:40.410> unit<00:00:40.520> within<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> cylinder

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
it has all one unit within the cylinder

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
it has all one unit within the cylinder
now<00:00:44.760> underneath<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.840> handle<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.410> handle

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
now underneath this handle this handle

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.990 
now underneath this handle this handle
is<00:00:47.100> attached<00:00:48.590> usually<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.250> set<00:00:50.670> screw

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
is attached usually with a set screw

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
is attached usually with a set screw
which<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.600> an<00:00:51.719> allen<00:00:52.050> wrench<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> have

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
which is an allen wrench so if you have

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
which is an allen wrench so if you have
a<00:00:53.190> allen<00:00:53.879> wrench<00:00:54.120> such<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.870> you're<00:00:55.649> able

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
a allen wrench such as this you're able

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
a allen wrench such as this you're able
to<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.989> access<00:00:58.170> tit<00:00:59.120> access

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to get in here and to access tit access

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.290 
to get in here and to access tit access
it<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.890> loosen<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it and all you do is just loosen the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.700 
it and all you do is just loosen the
allen<00:01:03.690> wrench<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.350> handle<00:01:07.680> pops<00:01:07.950> off

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
allen wrench and this handle pops off

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.340 
allen wrench and this handle pops off
and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.549> you're<00:01:11.790> exposed<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> inside

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and then you're exposed to the inside

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.710 
and then you're exposed to the inside
now<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.770> particular<00:01:14.100> faucet<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.030> actually

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
now this particular faucet here actually

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.630 
now this particular faucet here actually
has<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> stem<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.860> had<00:01:17.040> any<00:01:17.220> problems

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
has a stem so if we had any problems

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.870 
has a stem so if we had any problems
with<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> faucet<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:19.409> simply<00:01:19.890> unscrew<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
with this faucet we simply unscrew this

just need to remove your handle and to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.020 
just need to remove your handle and to
look<00:01:37.979> inside<00:01:40.040> how<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.280> works<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
look inside how this works with this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.969 
look inside how this works with this
particular<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.770> main

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
particular one is you have your main

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
particular one is you have your main
main<00:01:44.549> lines<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.240> feed<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.689> underneath<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
main lines that feed up underneath the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.200 
main lines that feed up underneath the
sink<00:01:47.299> with<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.570> valve<00:01:49.500> side<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.070> actually

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
sink with this valve side it actually

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
sink with this valve side it actually
mixes<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> hot<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> cold<00:01:52.340> together

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
mixes the hot and the cold together

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.450 
mixes the hot and the cold together
depending<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.590> rotate<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
depending on if you rotate it to this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.760 
depending on if you rotate it to this
side<00:01:56.759> it'll<00:01:57.119> put<00:01:57.329> more<00:01:57.540> cold<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
side it'll put more cold in if you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.130 
side it'll put more cold in if you
rotate<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.729> left<00:01:59.850> it'll<00:02:00.540> put<00:02:00.719> more<00:02:00.930> hot

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
rotate it to the left it'll put more hot

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.590 
rotate it to the left it'll put more hot
in<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.399> adjust<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:02.880> temperature<00:02:03.090> by

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
in so you can adjust your temperature by

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.240 
in so you can adjust your temperature by
moving<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> handle<00:02:04.500> back<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.979> forth

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.980 

and<00:02:07.610> then<00:02:07.760> again<00:02:08.000> with<00:02:08.210> a<00:02:08.240> sprayer<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.840> can

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
and then again with a sprayer you can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.140 
and then again with a sprayer you can
