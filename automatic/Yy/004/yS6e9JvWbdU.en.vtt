guard and engaging when people are out
of<00:00:23.850> position<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.600> isn't<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.930> only

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
of position but this isn't the only

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.630

reason<00:00:25.170> actually<00:00:25.590> has<00:00:26.039> great<00:00:26.250> late<00:00:26.460> game

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
reason actually has great late game

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.859

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
kite potential with a slow so overall it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.130 
kite potential with a slow so overall it
just<00:00:30.060> means<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.359> she's<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.750> good<00:00:30.900> pic

whenever<00:00:58.079> available<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.920> might<00:00:59.039> see

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
whenever available so you might see

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.349 
whenever available so you might see
volley<00:00:59.340> first<00:00:59.640> catch<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> main<00:01:00.180> damage

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
volley first catch the main damage

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.760 
volley first catch the main damage
source<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> frost<00:01:01.260> shot<00:01:01.410> second

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
source and then you frost shot second

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
source and then you frost shot second
because<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> saw<00:01:02.250> increases<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.850> every<00:01:02.940> rank

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
because it saw increases with every rank

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
because it saw increases with every rank
so<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.019> items<00:01:04.290> trying<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.589> Dorrans<00:01:04.890> both

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so for items trying to get Dorrans both

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.289 
so for items trying to get Dorrans both
first<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> pretty<00:01:05.850> much<00:01:05.909> become<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
first and this is pretty much become a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090

standard<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:06.990> ad<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.770> because

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
standard for any ad now this is because

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.130 
standard for any ad now this is because
it<00:01:08.220> provides<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> ad<00:01:08.820> health<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> life<00:01:09.810> still

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
baiting you don't then you're already at

you<00:01:19.590> want<00:01:19.799> actually<00:01:20.009> times<00:01:20.189> vamp<00:01:20.460> delta<00:01:20.729> into

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you want actually times vamp delta into

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.550 
you want actually times vamp delta into
anything<00:01:21.240> until<00:01:21.600> very<00:01:21.810> late<00:01:21.869> into<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.350> build

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
anything until very late into your build

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.990 
anything until very late into your build
so<00:01:22.799> that's<00:01:22.950> why<00:01:23.130> i<00:01:23.159> say<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so that's why i say if it's it's a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.520 
so that's why i say if it's it's a
difficult<00:01:24.180> lane<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> buy<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
difficult lane you want to buy that but

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.780 
difficult lane you want to buy that but
if<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> delay

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
if not then it's just going to delay

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
if not then it's just going to delay
your<00:01:26.909> actual<00:01:27.270> build<00:01:27.479> now<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> core<00:01:28.140> item<00:01:28.380> 1a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
your actual build now the core item 1a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.660 
your actual build now the core item 1a
she<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:28.979> infinity<00:01:29.369> edge<00:01:29.460> NEX

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
she is going to be infinity edge NEX

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.130 
she is going to be infinity edge NEX
just<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.150> her<00:01:30.270> damage<00:01:30.540> scales<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:30.990> Auto

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
just because her damage scales with Auto

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.719 
just because her damage scales with Auto
attacks<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.829> abilities<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.520> means

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
attacks and not abilities that means

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.219 
attacks and not abilities that means
that<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.909> Creek<00:01:33.150> works<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.930> her

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that this Creek works really well on her

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.359 
that this Creek works really well on her
if<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> guys<00:01:34.710> been<00:01:34.890> following<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
if you guys been following me for a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.830 
if you guys been following me for a
while<00:01:35.549> you'll<00:01:35.759> notice<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.240> always<00:01:36.420> pick<00:01:36.659> P

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
while you'll notice that I always pick P

do<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.259> ship<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> probably<00:01:37.860> shocked<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
do is ship and you probably shocked to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
do is ship and you probably shocked to
see<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.549> ship<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.119> fast<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.930> actually

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
see the ship here fast but actually

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.300 
see the ship here fast but actually
think<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.409> works<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.100> ash<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
think it works really well with ash and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.980 
think it works really well with ash and
that's<00:01:41.549> why<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> second<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.869> means

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that's why I get it second it just means

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.090 
that's why I get it second it just means
that<00:01:43.079> ultra<00:01:43.380> attacks<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.890> bit<00:01:43.979> more

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that ultra attacks a little bit more

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.380 
that ultra attacks a little bit more
deadly<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> provides<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> extra

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
deadly because it provides the extra

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.030 
deadly because it provides the extra
damage<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:45.990> also<00:01:46.110> gives<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> wave<00:01:46.740> clear

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
damage and it also gives it a wave clear

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.260 
damage and it also gives it a wave clear
that's<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.790> strong<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.149> mid

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's going to be really strong for mid

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.789 
that's going to be really strong for mid
game<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.899> after<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.200> I've<00:01:49.409> got<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> last

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
game so after that I've got a last

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.109 
game so after that I've got a last
whisper<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> mitigate

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
whisper which is just going to mitigate

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.580 
whisper which is just going to mitigate
some<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> arm<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> enemy<00:01:51.960> team<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
some of the arm on the enemy team and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.840 
some of the arm on the enemy team and
then<00:01:52.710> finally<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> blood<00:01:53.460> thirst<00:01:53.700> or

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
then finally I get a blood thirst or

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.429 
then finally I get a blood thirst or
just<00:01:54.149> means<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.689> crits<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
just means that your crits are going to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.319 
just means that your crits are going to
hit<00:01:55.590> even<00:01:55.770> harder<00:01:56.130> finally<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:56.939> defensive

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
hit even harder finally for defensive

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.580 
hit even harder finally for defensive
items<00:01:57.659> i<00:01:57.750> actually<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.049> branches<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
items i actually think branches is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.870 
items i actually think branches is
probably<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> best<00:01:59.040> choice<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
probably the best choice it's one of the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.429 
probably the best choice it's one of the
best<00:02:00.060> choices<00:02:00.360> Freddi<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
best choices Freddi now that is a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.499 
best choices Freddi now that is a
big-ticket<00:02:01.860> item<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.909> other<00:02:03.000> choices<00:02:03.240> will

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
big-ticket item the other choices will

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.850 
big-ticket item the other choices will
be<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.780> guardian<00:02:04.079> angel<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.590> actually

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
be the guardian angel because actually

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.440 
be the guardian angel because actually
attack<00:02:05.130> range<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> relatively<00:02:05.850> low<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.360> then

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
attack range is relatively low and then

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.730 
attack range is relatively low and then
finally<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> random<00:02:07.049> enzyme<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.619> you're

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
finally a random enzyme and if you're

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.139 
finally a random enzyme and if you're
against<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.009> heavy<00:02:08.190> ad<00:02:08.429> team<00:02:08.789> when<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> just

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
against a heavy ad team when you just

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.339 
against a heavy ad team when you just
need<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> get<00:02:09.450> some<00:02:09.599> distance<00:02:09.810> from<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
divers slashes damage and lane is really

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.830 
divers slashes damage and lane is really
relying<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.810> constant<00:02:13.230> pressure<00:02:13.440> sin

you're<00:02:15.640> probably<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> lose<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.239> trade

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
you're probably going to lose that trade

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.850 
you're probably going to lose that trade
because<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.930> just<00:02:17.110> doesn't<00:02:17.410> have<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.560> birds

trade<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.150> also<00:02:25.360> take<00:02:25.540> no<00:02:25.720> damage<00:02:25.959> in<00:02:26.140> return

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
trade and also take no damage in return

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.869 
trade and also take no damage in return
so<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.129> difficult<00:02:27.310> for<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.640> enemy<00:02:27.849> to

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
so it's very difficult for the enemy to

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.250 
so it's very difficult for the enemy to
trade<00:02:28.209> after<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.750> because<00:02:28.900> he's<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
trade after that because he's going to

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.720 
trade after that because he's going to
be<00:02:29.349> slowed<00:02:29.590> by<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.769> volley<00:02:30.010> if<00:02:30.280> he<00:02:30.400> does<00:02:30.580> keep

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
be slowed by the volley if he does keep

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.070 
be slowed by the volley if he does keep
chasing<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.269> than<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.660> your<00:02:31.750> support

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
chasing you than you and your support

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.660 
chasing you than you and your support
can<00:02:32.319> just<00:02:32.500> slowly<00:02:32.620> cut<00:02:32.980> him<00:02:33.099> around<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.580> do<00:02:33.640> a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
can just slowly cut him around and do a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.100 
can just slowly cut him around and do a
lot<00:02:33.879> of<00:02:33.910> damage<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.390> him<00:02:34.510> why<00:02:34.629> doesn't<00:02:34.989> really

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
lot of damage to him why doesn't really

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.690 
lot of damage to him why doesn't really
do<00:02:35.230> anything<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.220> final<00:02:36.519> thing<00:02:36.549> I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
do anything to you the final thing I

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.100 
do anything to you the final thing I
want<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:36.879> say<00:02:36.940> about<00:02:37.030> ashes<00:02:37.390> lameface<00:02:37.599> that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
want to say about ashes lameface that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.479 
want to say about ashes lameface that
her<00:02:38.230> ultimate<00:02:38.500> pretty<00:02:38.739> much<00:02:38.860> guarantees<00:02:39.340> our

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
her ultimate pretty much guarantees our

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.979 
her ultimate pretty much guarantees our
kill<00:02:39.670> when<00:02:39.849> someone<00:02:40.120> ganks<00:02:40.480> now<00:02:40.629> because<00:02:40.870> of

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
kill when someone ganks now because of

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:41.880 
kill when someone ganks now because of
this<00:02:41.049> it's<00:02:41.260> really<00:02:41.470> good<00:02:41.590> idea<00:02:41.799> to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
this it's really good idea to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.170 
this it's really good idea to
communicate<00:02:42.280> with<00:02:42.400> your<00:02:42.489> jungler<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.000> say

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
communicate with your jungler and say

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.460 
communicate with your jungler and say
that<00:02:43.330> you've<00:02:43.420> got<00:02:43.540> your<00:02:43.569> ultimate<00:02:43.959> available

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
that you've got your ultimate available

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.809 
that you've got your ultimate available
and<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> should<00:02:44.799> come<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.069> gank<00:02:45.280> when<00:02:45.580> he<00:02:45.670> does

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
and it should come and gank when he does

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.130 
and it should come and gank when he does
game<00:02:46.030> can<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.239> get<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.420> killed<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.019> can

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
game can you get that killed and you can

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.600 
game can you get that killed and you can
rotate<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.560> dragon<00:02:47.890> take<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.370> advantage

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
rotate the dragon take that advantage

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.819 
rotate the dragon take that advantage
it's<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:49.630> good<00:02:49.690> way<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.930> carrying<00:02:50.230> soloq

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
it's a really good way of carrying soloq

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.620 
it's a really good way of carrying soloq
finally<00:02:51.489> in<00:02:51.579> teamfights<00:02:51.819> your<00:02:52.239> job<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.480> either

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
finally in teamfights your job is either

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.360 
finally in teamfights your job is either
to<00:02:52.840> initiate<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.410> air<00:02:53.650> or<00:02:53.769> save<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.220> for

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
to initiate with the air or save it for

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.830 
to initiate with the air or save it for
when<00:02:54.400> someone<00:02:54.760> jumps<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.120> your<00:02:55.239> face<00:02:55.450> now

when someone jumps on your face now

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.360 
when someone jumps on your face now
initiation<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.500> probably<00:02:56.709> better<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.190> two

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
initiation is probably better of the two

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.830 
initiation is probably better of the two
options<00:02:57.760> because<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.239> catch<00:02:58.390> people<00:02:58.750> off

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
options because you can catch people off

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599
