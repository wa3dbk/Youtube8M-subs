00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
about the graph the graph is have been

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.800 
about the graph the graph is have been
looking<00:00:15.540> nice<00:00:15.690> since<00:00:16.590> 09<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.369> mean<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.660> like

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
looking nice since 09 I mean like I like
the<00:00:18.930> wood<00:00:19.020> uniforms<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.220> environments

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the wood uniforms and the environments

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.420 
the wood uniforms and the environments
that's<00:00:21.720> nice<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.140> mean<00:00:22.260> even<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.130> con

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
pc and the developers that made MLB the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.890 
pc and the developers that made MLB the
shows<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.250> make<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.609> whatever<00:00:30.300> I'll<00:00:30.779> by

shows and make it but whatever I'll by
the<00:00:30.960> way<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> he<00:00:31.289> ee<00:00:31.529> 13<00:00:31.859> demo<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.309> very

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the way is he ee 13 demo was very

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.979 
the way is he ee 13 demo was very
disappointing<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.360> haven't<00:00:33.630> any<00:00:33.809> image

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
disappointing and I haven't any image

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
disappointing and I haven't any image
but<00:00:34.380> anyways<00:00:34.590> um<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> men<00:00:36.450> 13

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
but anyways um so you have the men 13

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.400 
but anyways um so you have the men 13
demo<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> Griffin<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> way<00:00:39.329> gameplay<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
demo so Griffin of the way gameplay the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.799 
demo so Griffin of the way gameplay the
gameplay<00:00:41.399> still<00:00:41.910> feels<00:00:42.149> very<00:00:42.390> similar<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
gameplay still feels very similar to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
gameplay still feels very similar to
previous<00:00:43.020> games<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.190> obviously<00:00:44.399> an

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
previous games you know obviously an

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.500 
previous games you know obviously an
looks<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:46.230> similar<00:00:46.440> oh<00:00:46.940> they<00:00:47.940> did<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
looks very similar oh they did it at the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
looks very similar oh they did it at the
infinity<00:00:49.140> engine<00:00:49.350> animation<00:00:50.160> based<00:00:50.730> physics

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
infinity engine animation based physics

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.650 
infinity engine animation based physics
in<00:00:51.600> genetic<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.940> too<00:00:54.120> hyped

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in genetic but let's not get too hyped

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.540 
in genetic but let's not get too hyped
and<00:00:54.930> crazy<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.129> face<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:58.170> yes<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.280> did

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and crazy and we face and it yes I did

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490 
and crazy and we face and it yes I did
notice<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.910> difference<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.960> didn't<00:01:01.379> notice

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
notice a difference like I didn't notice

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
notice a difference like I didn't notice
they<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:01.890> had<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> players<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:03.090> follow

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
they all had the players like follow

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.590 
they all had the players like follow
each<00:01:03.660> other<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.309> bump<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.760> each<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
each other and bump it to each other and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.710 
each other and bump it to each other and
him<00:01:06.720> hi<00:01:06.900> bodies<00:01:07.290> roll<00:01:07.500> off<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.939> happens<00:01:09.630> in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
him hi bodies roll off and it happens in

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
him hi bodies roll off and it happens in
a<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:09.900> realistic<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.979> life<00:01:11.549> even<00:01:11.760> with

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
a more realistic way in life even with

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
a more realistic way in life even with
the<00:01:12.180> arms<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.869> getting<00:01:13.260> clipped<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the arms like getting clipped on a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.410 
the arms like getting clipped on a
player<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.390> moves<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
player like it moves and all that and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.160 
player like it moves and all that and
and<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.650> stumble<00:01:20.159> sometimes<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.170> yeah

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and like they stumble sometimes and yeah

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
and like they stumble sometimes and yeah
I<00:01:22.380> didn't<00:01:22.830> notice<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.820> diving<00:01:24.030> said

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I didn't notice that but was diving said

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.830 
I didn't notice that but was diving said
I<00:01:24.890> would<00:01:25.890> still<00:01:26.220> wait<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.360> bands<00:01:27.570> from

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I would still wait two more bands from

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
I would still wait two more bands from
now<00:01:28.159> yo<00:01:29.159> man<00:01:29.369> 15<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.090> yeah<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> wait<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
now yo man 15 or yeah I was to wait to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.899 
now yo man 15 or yeah I was to wait to
like<00:01:32.549> yeah<00:01:33.360> Batman<00:01:34.189> for<00:01:35.189> coming<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:35.759> they

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
like yeah Batman for coming because they

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
like yeah Batman for coming because they
finally<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.329> an<00:01:36.479> animation<00:01:36.869> based<00:01:37.229> physics

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
finally got an animation based physics

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.390 
finally got an animation based physics
and<00:01:38.189> animation<00:01:38.970> based<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.070> would

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and animation based at that so I would

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
and animation based at that so I would
probably<00:01:41.579> wait<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:42.960> work

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
probably wait for them to do some work

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.499 
probably wait for them to do some work
on<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.439> frog<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.189> oh<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.850> gosh<00:01:45.060> vision

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
on this frog and all oh my gosh vision

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
on this frog and all oh my gosh vision
because<00:01:45.869> yes<00:01:46.649> i<00:01:46.799> did<00:01:47.130> notice<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.460> difference

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because yes i did notice a difference

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.350 
because yes i did notice a difference
you<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.600> i<00:01:48.930> mean<00:01:49.290> cuz<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:50.220> men<00:01:50.729> 11<00:01:51.270> up

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you know i mean cuz like from men 11 up

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.289 
you know i mean cuz like from men 11 up
until<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.590> only<00:01:52.619> reason<00:01:53.369> I've<00:01:53.549> been<00:01:54.119> able

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
until now the only reason I've been able

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.819 
until now the only reason I've been able
to<00:01:54.659> tell<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.930> difference<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.380> locomotion

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to tell the difference is locomotion

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.340 
to tell the difference is locomotion
utter<00:01:56.310> net<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:58.100> locomotion<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:00.320> mean<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
utter net it locomotion and I mean I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
utter net it locomotion and I mean I
mean<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.460> haven't<00:02:02.790> been<00:02:02.939> able<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.240> tell

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
mean I really haven't been able to tell

whatever<00:02:36.180> whenever<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.660> came<00:02:36.840> out<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.200> them

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
whatever whenever it came out to them

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.550 
whatever whenever it came out to them
for<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.830> think<00:02:38.220> but<00:02:38.760> if<00:02:39.690> they<00:02:39.900> were<00:02:39.960> having<00:02:40.410> a

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
for I think but if they were having a

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.140 
for I think but if they were having a
game<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.980> then<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.490> now<00:02:41.670> getting<00:02:41.730> it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
game and then is just now getting it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.760 
game and then is just now getting it
because<00:02:42.420> they<00:02:42.660> were<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.900> worried<00:02:43.110> about<00:02:43.200> some

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
because they were so worried about some

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.250 
because they were so worried about some
