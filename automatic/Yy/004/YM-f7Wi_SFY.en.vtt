course the home button and of course we
boot<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:10.500> up<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.990> boots<00:05:13.139> up<00:05:13.200> a<00:05:13.290> lot<00:05:13.440> faster

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
boot this up it boots up a lot faster

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.159 
boot this up it boots up a lot faster
too<00:05:13.860> because<00:05:14.669> it's<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.880> new<00:05:14.910> processor<00:05:15.750> 600

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
too because it's a new processor 600

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.050 
too because it's a new processor 600
megahertz<00:05:16.380> see<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.460> bags<00:05:17.639> already<00:05:17.790> getting

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
megahertz see the bags already getting

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.159 
megahertz see the bags already getting
kind<00:05:18.210> of<00:05:18.240> fingerprinting<00:05:18.720> not<00:05:18.900> as<00:05:19.020> much

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
kind of fingerprinting not as much

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.340 
kind of fingerprinting not as much
though<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.850> front<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.810> front<00:05:21.960> does<00:05:22.169> feel

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
though and the front the front does feel

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.680 
though and the front the front does feel
a<00:05:22.380> little<00:05:22.440> different<00:05:23.100> not<00:05:23.220> much<00:05:23.690> actually

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
a little different not much actually

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.240 
a little different not much actually
rubbing<00:05:25.020> my<00:05:25.169> fingers<00:05:25.440> on<00:05:25.560> now<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.010> because

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
rubbing my fingers on now and because

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.830 
rubbing my fingers on now and because
you<00:05:26.340> think<00:05:26.580> eventually<00:05:26.729> disappeared<00:05:27.510> quickly

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
you think eventually disappeared quickly

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.990 
you think eventually disappeared quickly
so<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.410> is<00:05:28.530> fingerprint<00:05:28.949> resistant<00:05:29.340> or<00:05:29.850> it's

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
so it is fingerprint resistant or it's

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.550 
so it is fingerprint resistant or it's
pretty<00:05:30.150> nicely<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:31.110> see<00:05:31.289> there's<00:05:31.440> already

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
pretty nicely and see there's already

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.800 
pretty nicely and see there's already
booted<00:05:31.770> up<00:05:31.979> see<00:05:32.340> it's<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.300> lot<00:05:33.419> faster<00:05:33.570> than<00:05:33.750> I

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
booted up see it's a lot faster than I

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.360
