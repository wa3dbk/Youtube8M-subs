 Reply to dn's tag about books 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.640
 comforting are two questions 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.800
 so come on then question number 1 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.280
 which books have the power to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.379
 awaken good memories of your childhood 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.330
 I chose a shock, I do not think so. 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.710
 I spoke of this book even though it is you 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.960
 It's capped by lygia bojunga, I love it. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.030

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.920
 years that I bought but of any 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.309
 The way I have a new one for me is mine. 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.879
 destroy is this book here is sensational 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.660
 childhood 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.220

 and it's very cool he's reading a book 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.330
 I will also take a look at 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.830
 say there are many figures the same text 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.310
 very small but the message very 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.590
 beautiful I love this book question number 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.360
 4 What is your favorite literary genre? 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.120
 comforting, I already told you 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.520
 fantastic realism is sensational if I 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.740
 I could only go on a lie joking 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.630
 I read everything you know but the 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.940
 Fantastic realism is really my 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.360
 genre and so I do not know what 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.860
 reads 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.870
 O I will read something at his side 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.870
 gabriel garcía marquez 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.780
 finally there are thousands and that's it I love it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.790
 It's my comforting genre and there's 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.910
 next question why is the writer 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.640
 more comforting there maybe you 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.590
 ask that tomorrow I 'll give a 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.320
 different answer is more today in this 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.019
 right now an author that I would sit 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.330
 a soft armchair and read with the 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.980
 Brazilian so hours would be 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.590
 anything gabriel garcía marquez 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.950
 question number 6 and writer you 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.900
 seeks when you want comfort for the soul 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.430
 This question for me was more 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.489
 hard to answer 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.470
 and I could lie to you and say that 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.709
 I do not know, I want to comfort you, I look for you. 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.519
 she sells at some simon show of people 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.580
 here at last be one answer to 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.530
 I would be the same simone but have a 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.690
 another Brazilian I like with 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.460
 rubble that I'm sure a lot of 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.870
 people are even now without problems and I think 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.810
 I already talked about her sometime here 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.610
 what is it to love this frazão dorça frazão 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.140
 so comfort for the soul knows 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.020
 reaffirmation of some things yes 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.129
 there off feminism and everything 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.739
 no matter if she speaks of witch 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.779
 and she at least she never said that she does 

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:45.789
 rain but on tape 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.379
 it does not matter your least in the work 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.489
 But I really like the things that 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.809
 She writes 

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:52.089
 I like to see the interviews she gives 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:54.309
 Joao Soares is to last more frazão 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:56.469
 and now the last four questions 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:59.619
 It has to be quick game then number 7 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:03.279
 a book for days of fury then is that 

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:05.019
 Okay, I do not like feeling angry 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.419
 so if I'm in a day of fury 

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:09.610
 I'll read something like this with 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.550
 a little bit to laugh at I think 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.800
 Patricia also spoke about portugal and 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.539
 people stay here it 's very funny who 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.149
 Did not read, please. 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.509
 It was really fun now if it's like this. 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:24.399
 to confirm is to reaffirm my 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.379
 fury know not choose something 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:30.369
 true with the new né 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:32.679
 just there number 8 a book for moments of 

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:34.990
 melancholy sadness then usually 

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:37.539
 when I feel sad melancholy I 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.899
 yes I hear very Russian renato I go 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:45.129
 in this world and then I go I thought of 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:47.139
 two sad but fantastic books 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:50.139
 The first one I chose here was the 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.419
 pit or other clan who rt Day dan 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.449
 likes dogs prepares before 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.939
 of this binding book that only 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.769
 remember him since he likes the illusions 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.179
 I've already told him about science. 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:03.039
 I reread need to do a review 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.999
 Decent for you, but this book 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.059
 here he 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:11.979
 he is a delicacy and the staff 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:14.649
 very sad very sad but a number 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.139
 9 a book that brings you to a great moment 

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:19.179
 very good of your life and why ? 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.729
 Well, I actually think about my 

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:24.339
 also the technical college tatá that the 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.229
 my technical collegiate period that was 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:28.360
 the interview with the vampire that I got 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.499
 here to represent the things of ene 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:35.259
 vrae would be much more in this period 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:36.610
 It was our birthday there that year. 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.800
 90 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.259
 and this one specifically was the 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.659
 first I thought it was sensational I devoured this 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.429
 book okay I read the book after 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.500
 seen the movie movie came out when it was good 

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:50.980
 small room that had room 10 and 11 years 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.440
 and I read the book already there with 15 and 16 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.770
 I found the sensational book very careful. 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.060
 with the film and I did not arrive many 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.140
 years I do not read this book I do not know 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.290
 if today 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.340
 rereading it will have the same the same 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.620
 the meaning he had for me 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.160
 at that time but it's a book that I look at 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.350
 I miss the mirror a lot 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.150
 tatiana doing chemistry school and 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.950
 last question a book to provoke 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.960
 good emotions and then I could not think 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.940
 I thought any comic book 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.060
 thing of the tires anything of the 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:25.390
 macca mafalda in the car in donating or 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:29.770
 of the sensational had provoked emotions 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:32.590
 good reviews he has a little something else 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.590
 melancholic in the last book but 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:38.070
 in the others is always a lot of fun 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.780
 if you read the reviews are always is 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.280
 funny so worth it if you 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.840
 you need good emotions there 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.820
