hello everyone this is MIA Collins and
today<00:00:03.480> I'll<00:00:03.659> be<00:00:03.689> showing<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.259> my<00:00:04.440> very<00:00:04.650> first

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
today I'll be showing you my very first

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.430 
today I'll be showing you my very first
tutorial<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.210> scene<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.690> can<00:00:06.930> see<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.319> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
tutorial of the scene you can see in the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.400 
tutorial of the scene you can see in the
background<00:00:07.730> that<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.760> did<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.330> blender<00:00:09.840> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
background that I did with blender and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.470 
background that I did with blender and
the<00:00:10.800> cycles<00:00:11.250> render<00:00:11.460> engine<00:00:13.969> but<00:00:14.969> first<00:00:15.299> of

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the cycles render engine but first of

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960 
the cycles render engine but first of
all<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.929> show<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.619> very<00:00:16.859> first<00:00:17.279> version<00:00:17.640> of

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
all I show you the very first version of

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.720 
all I show you the very first version of
this<00:00:18.150> flower<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.840> did<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
this flower I did back then with the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.170 
this flower I did back then with the
blender<00:00:21.240> internal<00:00:22.080> window<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:23.039> really<00:00:24.000> liked

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
blender internal window I really liked

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.519 
blender internal window I really liked
the<00:00:24.420> contrast<00:00:24.990> between<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:26.779> size<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the contrast between the size of the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.440 
the contrast between the size of the
pole<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> head<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.390> west<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> flower

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
pole and head to the west of the flower

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.290 
pole and head to the west of the flower
and<00:00:33.450> sometimes<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.829> idea<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.850> having

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
and sometimes I like the idea of having

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.819 
and sometimes I like the idea of having
a<00:00:36.630> object<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> very<00:00:38.520> plain<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.300> white

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
a object on a very plain and white

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
a object on a very plain and white
background<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> very<00:00:42.480> first

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
background so what this was a very first

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.490 
background so what this was a very first
version<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.360> version<00:00:45.660> with

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
version of it so this is a version with

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.580 
version of it so this is a version with
a<00:00:46.530> cycles<00:00:47.100> window<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> came<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:49.260> at

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a cycles window when it came out but at

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
a cycles window when it came out but at
that<00:00:49.890> time<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.550> lost<00:00:50.760> my<00:00:51.090> interest<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that time I lost my interest in this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.000 
that time I lost my interest in this
playing<00:00:52.320> picture<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.360> tried<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.010> try

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
playing picture so I really tried to try

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
playing picture so I really tried to try
something<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.969> nearly<00:00:57.480> kills<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:58.109> old

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
something that nearly kills my old

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.400 
something that nearly kills my old
computer<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> end<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> turned<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
computer and in the end it turned out to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.250 
computer and in the end it turned out to
be<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.829> project<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.789> took<00:01:03.059> 12<00:01:03.570> hours<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
be this project that took 12 hours of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:17.230 
be this project that took 12 hours of
when<00:01:04.500> doing<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.729> size<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:07.850> 1400<00:01:08.850> pixels

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.399 

my<00:01:17.570> first<00:01:17.810> step<00:01:18.200> was<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.530> create<00:01:18.950> an<00:01:19.250> IQ<00:01:19.700> sphere

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
my first step was to create an IQ sphere

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.250 
my first step was to create an IQ sphere
Waianae<00:01:21.409> Coast<00:01:21.619> field<00:01:21.979> because<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.510> distance

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
Waianae Coast field because the distance

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.840 
Waianae Coast field because the distance
between<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.830> words<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.220> always<00:01:25.520> with<00:01:25.700> the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
between the words is always with the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.290 
between the words is always with the
same<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.420> when<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.170> attach<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.890> other

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
same and when you attach the other

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.510 
same and when you attach the other
objects<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:30.229> will<00:01:30.500> give<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.040> an<00:01:31.280> even

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
objects to it it will give you an even

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.390 
objects to it it will give you an even
look<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.659> pole<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.110> object<00:01:33.590> will<00:01:33.950> not<00:01:34.159> be

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
look and the pole and object will not be

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:44.450 
look and the pole and object will not be
squeezed

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.560 

you<00:01:45.460> can<00:01:45.850> see<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.450> windowed<00:01:46.840> mode<00:01:48.300> first<00:01:49.300> of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
you can see the windowed mode first of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.200 
you can see the windowed mode first of
the<00:01:49.750> ecosphere<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:52.120> sunlight<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:55.180> I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
the ecosphere with the sunlight then I

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.469 
the ecosphere with the sunlight then I
edit<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:56.500> leaves<00:01:57.280> with<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.729> particle<00:01:58.330> system

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
edit the leaves with a particle system

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.430 
edit the leaves with a particle system
and<00:01:59.100> the<00:02:00.100> final<00:02:00.520> result<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.780> Poland

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
and the final result of the Poland

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.030 
and the final result of the Poland
objects<00:02:03.310> attached<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.479> ecosphere<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
objects attached to the ecosphere and

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.870 
objects attached to the ecosphere and
you<00:02:06.700> can<00:02:07.119> see<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.479> trick<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.020> did<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.670> had

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
you can see a trick I did because I had

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.840 
you can see a trick I did because I had
to<00:02:10.090> save<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.479> lot<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.810> memory<00:02:11.380> while<00:02:11.980> working

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
to save a lot of memory while working

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.780 
to save a lot of memory while working
and<00:02:13.120> rendering<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:14.040> cut<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.340> ball<00:02:15.610> ahead

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.300 

so<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.569> second<00:02:23.990> file<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:24.860> which<00:02:25.069> I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
so this is the second file of in which I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.670 
so this is the second file of in which I
queried<00:02:25.730> five<00:02:26.390> grass<00:02:26.930> objects<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.680> man

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
queried five grass objects like this man

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.940 
queried five grass objects like this man
then<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> attached<00:02:32.270> them<00:02:32.630> with<00:02:33.260> particle

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
then I attached them with particle

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.240 
then I attached them with particle
system<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:34.819> plane<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.920> grass

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
system to a plane and this is the grass

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.820 
system to a plane and this is the grass
in<00:02:38.319> so<00:02:39.319> on<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.770> second<00:02:40.160> layer<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.819> created

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
in so on the second layer I created

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.910 
in so on the second layer I created
these<00:02:42.830> guys<00:02:43.780> which<00:02:44.780> are<00:02:45.020> more<00:02:45.290> in<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.650> front

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
these guys which are more in the front

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.470 
these guys which are more in the front
of<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.280> camera<00:02:46.730> view<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:48.319> third<00:02:48.890> layer

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
of the camera view and the third layer

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.830 
of the camera view and the third layer
where<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.569> can<00:02:50.810> see<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:52.069> other<00:02:52.580> parts<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.570> the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
where you can see the other parts of the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.280 
where you can see the other parts of the
flowers

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.399 

so<00:03:01.040> now<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.400> linked<00:03:01.909> the<00:03:02.150> first<00:03:02.450> fire<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
so now I linked the first fire with the

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.020 
so now I linked the first fire with the
second<00:03:03.890> because<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.709> project<00:03:06.709> cost<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.730> much

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
second because the project cost so much

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.750 
second because the project cost so much
memory<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.530> couldn't<00:03:10.129> work<00:03:10.310> with<00:03:10.610> it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
memory and I couldn't work with it

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.589 
memory and I couldn't work with it
before<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.569> I<00:03:11.599> had<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.290> split<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.709> in<00:03:12.829> two<00:03:13.599> so

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
before so I had to split it in two so

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.530 
before so I had to split it in two so
this<00:03:14.900> takes<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.560> minute<00:03:15.590> for<00:03:16.159> attaching<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
this takes a minute for attaching the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.420 
this takes a minute for attaching the
first<00:03:17.810> five<00:03:18.170> with<00:03:18.650> other<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:21.430> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
first five with other and you is it the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.610 
first five with other and you is it the
whole<00:03:22.640> flower<00:03:22.970> scene<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.959> go<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.349> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
whole flower scene and now I go to the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.490 
whole flower scene and now I go to the
render<00:03:27.890> layers<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.640> when<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.299> note<00:03:35.290> this<00:03:36.290> you

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
render layers and when of note this you

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.470 
render layers and when of note this you
already<00:03:36.920> know<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.400> have<00:03:37.579> seen<00:03:37.609> before

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.680 

then<00:03:44.110> I'm<00:03:44.349> adding<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.190> first<00:03:45.489> plane<00:03:46.330> with

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
then I'm adding the first plane with

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.589 
then I'm adding the first plane with
grass

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.069 

and<00:03:54.140> then<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.829> second<00:03:55.340> thing<00:03:56.239> scars<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:57.049> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
and then the second thing scars in the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.759 
and then the second thing scars in the
fort<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:00.799> this<00:04:00.920> gives<00:04:01.159> a<00:04:01.430> more<00:04:01.730> realistic

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
fort so what this gives a more realistic

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.330 
fort so what this gives a more realistic
view<00:04:03.769> because<00:04:04.569> grass<00:04:05.569> is<00:04:05.780> not<00:04:05.989> so<00:04:06.379> plain<00:04:07.280> and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
view because grass is not so plain and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.479 
view because grass is not so plain and
even<00:04:08.090> it's<00:04:08.450> everywhere

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
even it's everywhere

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.530 
even it's everywhere
this<00:04:10.909> is<00:04:11.060> last<00:04:11.389> layup<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.319> now<00:04:12.650> all<00:04:12.889> together

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
this is last layup and now all together

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.680 
this is last layup and now all together
you<00:04:14.540> can<00:04:14.569> see<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.290> first<00:04:15.889> steps<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.699> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
you can see the first steps of the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.010 
you can see the first steps of the
rendered<00:04:18.169> scene

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.800 

it's<00:04:25.440> more<00:04:25.680> like<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:28.699> that's<00:04:29.699> basically<00:04:30.479> the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
it's more like it that's basically the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.210 
it's more like it that's basically the
whole<00:04:31.100> picture<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.699> now<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.750> choose<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.220> good

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
whole picture and now you choose a good

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.980 
whole picture and now you choose a good

perspective and here you can see the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.279 
perspective and here you can see the
side<00:04:40.259> view<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:41.400> where<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.120> did<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.840> tricky

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
side view and where I did the tricky
