00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.930 
it's the same basic beat though G right
just<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.900> high<00:02:39.549> upstroke<00:02:40.549> sort<00:02:40.819> of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
just with the high upstroke sort of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.809 
just with the high upstroke sort of
added<00:02:41.209> in<00:02:41.330> right<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:43.010> then<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.310> second<00:02:43.670> verse

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
added in right so then the second verse

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.900 
added in right so then the second verse
is<00:02:43.850> basically<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.569> same<00:02:44.780> thing<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:46.489> then

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
is basically the same thing and then

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.759 
is basically the same thing and then
there's<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.660> little<00:02:47.810> chorus<00:02:48.260> part<00:02:48.560> right

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
there's the little chorus part right

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.140 
there's the little chorus part right
that<00:02:48.950> he<00:02:49.040> goes<00:02:49.190> into<00:02:49.400> once<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:50.330> got<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> whole
