00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.250
 hi to all and welcome whipper in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.020
 the ninth episode defends as a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 pro today we go for the third 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.890
 time on inferno and we will be interested in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.090
 a way to hold the ride in this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 episode it was going to set up 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 what's called a stratum cph these 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
 strata was popularized by the team 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.170
 cph bolt as his name indicated and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.610
 they allow to block the banana 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.619
 cement plants on the terrorist side 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.120
 thanks to smocks that are launched from the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.649
 spawn ct the defense can quietly 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.210
 banana customers 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.560
 the main advantage of this stratum 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 it is that it allows a defender dubÃ© 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.570
 to reposition themselves on the a for 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.070
 get a defense in 4 1 we 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.870
 find today a team rather 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 exotic it is the Brazilian team of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.020
 kaboom these have created the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 sensation recently by qualifying 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.469
 for the next major at Katowice in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.460
 beating many teams that 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.820
 were supposed to be better on the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.800
 paper 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 in this match he will be opposed to the Danes 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.780
 of dig it has which some members are 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.610
 at the origin of the famous strata cph 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.350
 to start we'll see fallen a 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.270
 defender who usually on the to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 take a stand for the old man makes fun 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.140
 the spawn this grenade is going 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.250
 immediately blocked the small space to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.049
 the entry of the banana on the side of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 terrorists and that will allow its 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.479
 teammates to advance more easily 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.619
 in this area 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.270
 as you can see if the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.770
 terrorists hesitate at the beginning of round a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.240
 attacked the banana he finds himself 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.070
 completely stuck at the top of their 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.570
 stairs in this case they are 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.340
 almost forced to delay the end 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.450
 leaves book to attack the area and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.400
 I already talked about it in a previous 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.810
 episode by properly handling the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.130
 rotate to make fun of molotov 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.619
 the area can be obstructed during 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 three quarters of the red to mimic the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.979
 snop de fallon there are many 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.540
 variations could take one done 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.460
 by the Brazilian you will have to place 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.810
 in this angle the important reference for 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.310
 this is mocking what are these antennas on 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.530
 the roof and more particularly the one 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.909
 which is all the right after placing 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.470
 our viewfinder at this antenna 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.939
 you just have to rise until 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.860
 electrical wires and it will launch 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.470
 this mocking running there the agent when 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.390
 you arrive at the center of this well the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.740
 main feature of this smokes 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.060
 it's also blocking the vision 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.560
 terrorists who are already 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.829
 advanced below the pillars of the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.829
 banana 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.230
 one of the most known variations of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.620
 this smoke starts from this 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.330
 in law 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.099
 position yourself in the center of this 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.989
 vehicle and place your viewfinder on the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.220
 right of the chimney ride up another 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.319
 your viewfinder up to the level of 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.700
 bell tower which on your left is launched in 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.050
 running just before going below 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.310
 from this pair gaulle to his two 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.420
 first make fun asks a little 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.620
 training to be successful at 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.000
 every shot because it takes throws in 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.870
 current which adds a small factor 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.519
 random 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.780
 so I want to show you one last 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.180
 way to make this fun 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.530
 systematically we place ourselves this time 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.930
 in a your qi and more precisely to 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.280
 center of this pillar then shifted you 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.750
 slightly from the wall to leave 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.299
 appear in space between the roof to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.489
 right and the bell tower on the left will require 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.750
 replace the viewfinder at this level where 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.849
 we can see a very small 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:59.170
 end of the bell that protrudes launched at 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:01.000
 stop and enjoy now that you 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.410
 know how started this word that we will see 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.599
 how do the brazilians use them to 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.760
 their advantage first of all we have style 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.019
 who plays the m4 his role will be to 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.910
 make sure the land is not 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.470
 advanced beneath the pillars once 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.340
 that he has this info eelv after shock to 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.440
 through smoke 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.750
 just before refreshing the smoke and 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.880
 to go back on the has indeed with the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.380
 strategy cph only one defender is 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.859
 largely enough to hold the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.660
 position 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.579
 it also adds a surprise effect 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.190
 for the defense of the ha thanks to a player 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.930
 extra on his side zac the sniper 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.459
 of the team is enjoying its good this pole 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.150
 to take this line directly at 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.980
 level of the car 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.600
 this one allows the brazilians to be 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.010
 sure that no opponent can 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.810
 level with the logs on 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.609
 the right of the banana while his 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.380
 teammate checks him the left side of 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.690
 the banana he's going to reposition himself on the 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.489
 car is hanged elevated line which is 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.049
 a bit special but that actually allows 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.450
 to thwart a new potential of 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.250
 the attak with this position you have in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.930
 makes a direct line on a boost 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.340
 possible terrorists like you 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.750
 go see it as soon as there is a moc 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.400
 in this place the potting soil can 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.880
 move on this flowerpot on top of 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.040
 stairs 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.989
 the player on the top can thus have 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.090
 a line over the smoke can the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.380
 car and the bottom of the banana you 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.700
 will have understood the different elements 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.220
 we saw today are to reuse 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.840
 duo in matchmaking on the one hand the stratum 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.209
 cph to defend the banana by being 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.590
 advanced and on the other side the boosts the 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.139
 flowerpot if you undergo the same 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.850
 stratum in terrorists and here we are at the 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.040
 end of this episode defends as a
