00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.410
 if all then saw that you have 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.780
 much appreciated the video on pimples 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 where he gave simple advice 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.890
 without too many pretensions 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.630
 I thought about doing a similar thing for 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.900
 instead it concerns wrinkles therefore 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.609
 its how to prevent them and also cure them 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 in quotes or at least try to 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.169
 mitigate even here are tips 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.149
 simple but I hope they can come back 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.890
 useful to someone so I would say of 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.259
 start the first one immediately 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.410
 the advice I wanted to give you is that 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.550
 not to pull the bench for when 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.040
 rigged 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 unfortunately this is something that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.630
 it really bothers me is that known 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 a lot of these even more from the 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.140
 other girls making videos for charity 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 I do n't blame him, though, but that second 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.770
 me is not giving a good example 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.900
 because you never should never 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.150
 stress then pull the skin of the 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.620
 around the eyes so I recommend it 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.140
 when you put her liner, for example 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.960
 try to get used to exercising 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.100
 admit it without actually pulling the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.439
 eyelid because in the long run 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.749
 then obviously another is marked 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.549
 advice I give you and it may seem like one 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:14.490
 strange thing what if what not 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.100
 it is is to avoid sleeping on a 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.100
 alongside it the right flank seeds 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.039
 They are an important but should 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.049
 sleep with your belly in short, because 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.819
 over the years obviously not 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.950
 it's something that happens with passing 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.630
 of the days however it is that here to pass of the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.719
 years with time so in the long run 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.880
 if you are used to sleeping on a 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.880
 side you will notice that the sides of the face that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.369
 rests on the pillow and more marked 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.139
 of the other in some way we crush 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.740
 let's say they do it when we support each other 

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:49.139
 on the pillow it is therefore obvious that during 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.479
 the note just as for so many hours the 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.590
 face we say no twisted in this 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.299
 position 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.359
 then there is the risk that the outline 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.429
 who marks himself or the forehead and then 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.420
 I know that you will tell how you are 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.430
 used so need 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.490
 this is a bit like the mummies then with 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.920
 the ep antonio on such straight and with i 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.810
 stretched out so if you are there 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.520
 remember maybe obvious how 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.010
 the habit that assuming as a thing 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.530
 a bit complicated then obviously also 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.700
 lifestyle affects our land 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.989
 and therefore the way in which 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.900
 we lead our lives 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.060
 then it is reflected on the skin so it is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.319
 obvious that it is fundamental has a style of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.900
 healthy life 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.200
 so I would definitely say no smoke 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.600
 so don't smoke and no alcohol 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.840
 so it's obvious that like all things 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.510
 nothing or nothing is good then 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.750
 you have a glass of wine every now and then 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.090
 however, here it is however known that smoking 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.930
 and alcohol certainly does not sell 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.930
 our skin 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.500
 matt gray direct skin ages 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.600
 first and therefore a skin would be better 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.799
 these victims probably also for 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.500
 other reasons absolutely more 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.989
 important is ok then then that style 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.590
 of healthy life but certainly also 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.640
 important sleep is just is 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.630
 very important for the skin for the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.190
 cell 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.370
 and therefore important that we seek to 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.370
 sleep eight hours a night because it is 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.620
 even during the night that the cells do 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.870
 regenerate and therefore also the canvas 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.600
 just regenerates itself so let's say but 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.570
 here is that if you manage to sleep 7 author 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.290
 is fine while you sleep na 3 4 hours 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.670
 per night 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.459
 obviously not 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.620
 always remaining on the subject of prevention e 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.720
 also very important to protect the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.750
 our skin from the rays of the sun because 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.120
 the sun is one of the main if not the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.190
 main factor of aging 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.250
 early so it's important anyway 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.950
 prosthodontists especially if you expose yourself 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.410
 long under the rays of the sun 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.870
 and that's why I when I made the order 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.420
 on the site from nature as I had 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.209
 said in another video we bought 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.880
 also this sun cream face of the 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.100
 fan line with protection factor 30 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.530
 this also without perfume therefore a 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.810
 protection against UV and UV rays b 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.720
 so he said precisely it is very important 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.090
 the sun cream to use I would say 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.620
 all year round especially not here 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.150
 just maybe every day because or 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.370
 because if you know that you go to the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.410
 work and you don't have to walk much up 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.820
 surely here people are not right 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.979
 the maximum 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.260
 have your own sunscreen 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.360
 all young people though if you know that 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.880
 you will go for a long walk 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.289
 then you will still be in the sun myself 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.210
 however, he advises you to 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.890
 protect you throughout the year with a 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.350
 sunscreen so these were in the 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.539
 tips regarding the fact of 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.820
 prevent wrinkles now let's move on to 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.880
 cures and anyway I wanted to say something 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.180
 or that I do not demonize therefore not 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.669
 come and tell me but because of foods of 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.169
 to treat wrinkles and so on and so on 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.510
 he didn't demonize them simply 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.090
 I think maybe later 20 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.400
 the better, however, I think there are many of them a 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.210
 three rooms so just so now 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.370
 let's move on to treatment then I'd say that 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.620
 I think this is one in my opinion 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.350
 this craze also means a girl 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.720
 young however can use for example 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.400
 a vegetable oil at least in the 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.770
 eye contour because it does not have 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.010
 is not absolutely contraindicated 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.470
 however like a cream but active 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.440
 specific against wrinkles simply 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.570
 helps keep hydrated precisely 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.210
 area around the eyes that like 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.310
 we know no presents there are not 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.130
 sebaceous glands and therefore obviously 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.040
 here the canvas is thinner and tends to 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.080
 annoyingly being assigned easily and then 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.540
 I think vegetable oil is fine 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.640
 even when young style can be 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.070
 sweet almond oil can be 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.250
 avocado oil then if we want instead 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.500
 just switch to something anti-wrinkle 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.450
 specifically I found a 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.980
 produced on the amazon site I have there 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.810
 already showed some other file in 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.090
 past that is called the lac stream 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.950
 then this is an active and not 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.480
 Long recurring much about this 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.400
 produced because anyway in this video 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.110
 where just some advice you can 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.110
 definitely go for amazon substitutes 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.360
 and read his technical sheet I tell you 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.660
 only that I use this mixed 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.940
 to the genius and that I feel good and that is 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.380
 compared to Botox though 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.690
 obviously not to the effect of botulinum 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.540
 so let's say that a momentary effect 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.790
 and that, however, in the long run from little ones 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.410
 improvements and is indeed compared 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.600
 Botox so if you are curious 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.010
 you can replace it amazon 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.660
 maybe that 's how the five 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.020
 facilitate them in the car garage 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.940
 ok then my current eyes cover that 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.410
 I'm using what I mean now 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.980
 I'll show you what it is 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.160
 and this of the antipodes brand you have 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.190
 peeked and my good when 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.590
 in products it is a cream 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.660
 eye contour with the oil of the seeds of the 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.760
 kiwi I must say that I am very well 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.120
 also especially due to the fact that it does not 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.580
 the outline that is then served 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.440
 really fast and very well and therefore 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.050
 ideal to use even during the day 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.340
 and ceiling is curious or if you are 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.380
 interested 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.140
 you can find it on the covered site between 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.810
 the other a brand opposed to a single brand 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.330
 of the new zealand that also uses a 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.520
 very good and pure avocado oil 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.740
 that there is also in here then the last one 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.080
 product that I wanted to show you since 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.170
 we are talking about wrinkles and 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.870
 this yes I was a face with hyaluronic acid 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.550
 of the bjork dot brand and I bought 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.160
 also this product on the site from 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.170
 nature then it is a few days that 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.880
 therefore use is not dead and therefore 

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.800
 this is simply my first 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.110
 impression however I must say that it is me 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.510
 if you like it a lot it should be deceiving and 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.330
 toning the skin maybe living with others 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.600
 dead behind ecological bio formulas a 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.420
 therefore, base of vegetable hyaluronic acid 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.490
 not animal undiluted with strong 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.620
 innovative and how moisturizing properties 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.380
 ethics also on the skin for all 

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.690
 skins without age limits 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.520
 then yes I can I use it 

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.680
 even the youngest girls then 

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.750
 these were my recommendations for what 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.720
 concerns the long or care then 

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:14.419
 how to play anyway you attenuate them or 

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.130
 however delay them I hope they are 

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:17.690
 useless states advise me precisely 

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.010
 simple and you see us 

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.010
