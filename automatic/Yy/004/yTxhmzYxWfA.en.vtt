00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 subscribers of my channel i visit 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.269
 nokia companies stagnation and many thanks 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.330
 I was shown the latest news 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.660
 Of course, many are waiting for waiting nokia 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.580
 lumia 925 here it is I specifically put 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 near nokia lumia 920 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 I'll show you how they differ by 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.380
 the design difference is of course colossal 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.720
 plus it is very important that there is a cap that is 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 you can either buy it or buy something 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 there is respectively flour itself small 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.820
 Now I will show you compared to 920 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.730
 thousand black then 920 white and respectively 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.469
 aluminum is 925 in the case that is it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 differs quite strongly both by 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.050
 thickness and in size 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 see for yourself when I am, respectively 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 took 1 time hands feeling that she is well 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.320
 much less 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.879
 plus of course she has a different display 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.579
 I personally like more 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.440
 display technology is amoled now i'm 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.750
 put the same respectively 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 photography and brightness worth 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.880
 automatic on both devices on my 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.770
 view display is still better plus not 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 forget that the amoled display of course 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 significantly saves energy that is 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.040
 925 should be even more 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 powerful than 920 of course i will have these 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.740
 devices that is 925 a little later on the review 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.640
 and most likely I will do of course 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.360
 Compared to the 920 e 100 is still important in the case 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.680
 she herself 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 solid aluminum looks like this 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.820
 rear polycarbonate also which in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 principle does not scratch does not fight in a very 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.009
 strong phone itself is of course very 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.409
 Thin well compared to 920 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.040
 looks good in hand is very 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.780
 convenient first impression of course 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 the camera here is more fancy if 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.250
 say so by simple there are many 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.630
 Modes can now all in detail 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.490
 I will not describe the experience very much 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.350
 a lot from different devices on camera to me 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.930
 10 very much you can do 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.570
 different movie with him about the race car 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.909
 highlight everything else will be blurred 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.829
 very beautiful and separately of course about 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.310
 cover with wireless charging like this 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.319
 Here it looks and, accordingly, with 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.330
 the phone itself is wireless charging now 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.360
 does not support if you separately 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.010
 buy cover and wireless charging 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.660
 no wireless charging included 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.069
 a coin 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.900
 then you put that kind of cap on 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.019
 the device and additionally it protects it 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.790
 This is done as I understand it at the request of us. 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.010
 there are many users with you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.090
 asked to reduce the size and weight 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.940
 deals and a separate review I am shooting now 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.630
 July 11, 2013 will begin in a week 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.850
 sales start selling nokia lumia 925 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.010
 and on the site nokia, by the way, those who leave 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.900
 pre-order on the official website nokia then 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.970
 gets a gift such a cover and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.920
 gets powerless better 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.200
 the cost is about three thousand rubles and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.769
 Now we â€™ll talk to them a little more. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.470
 early 925 920 and after that I will tell 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.830
 you about and the other news is nokia asha 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.690
 501 this is the first budget smartphone to be 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.849
 soon enough be sold in Russia for 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.510
 price of 3 thousand rubles from 4000 rubles 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.760
 Total 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.950
 The most important thing is his chip, of course, except 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.019
 the fact that he dvuhsimochny inexpensive then 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.100
 that it is built from the first apparatus on 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.190
 nokia asha 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.980
 that is, this operating system, moreover 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.760
 translated asa as hope from the Indian 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.590
 but they are a little later and the devices themselves 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.590
 compare that is I think you already 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:41.109
 opinions about the screens has now taken shape 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:41.109
 scrolling that is, it is on top of 925 and 920 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:54.739
 brightness is worth the average recall 925 925 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.579
 review and of course now again 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.579
 show externally 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:07.230
 on the buttons by the way it is basically the same 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.020
 the most that there are 20 keys 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.520
 volume on / off button 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.530
 lock and separately rendered by the window 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.100
 camera button and buttons 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.930
 respectively for the exit menu and so 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.049
 further top charging 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.450
 1 micro sim card of course monolithic 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.950
 housing is not separable and the connector itself 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.740
 under headphones all 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.740
 and camera module well, of course, flash 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.850
 so once again comparing the appearance now 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.419
 only i have a case with it and so black it 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.370
 lumia 920 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:48.120
 metal if me 925 again 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.340
 showing maybe not so good here 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.560
 it can be seen but it feels almost 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.880
 less than half the thickness of that is 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.190
 just in size between 925 than 920 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.110
 weight by the way the difference is only 50 grams I 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.640
 I think more than Well wait a review from 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.740
 I sure will come in handy here it is 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.550
 returned feature celebrity clock in 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.550
 standby time
