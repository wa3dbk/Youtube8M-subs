believe a car like this should be

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.990 
believe a car like this should be
crushed<00:01:24.680> into<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.130> little<00:01:25.400> metal<00:01:25.640> cube<00:01:25.880> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
completely agree with him I mean look at

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.520 
completely agree with him I mean look at
the<00:01:31.009> state<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.460> thing<00:01:34.450> it's<00:01:35.450> pretty<00:01:36.380> much

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the state of this thing it's pretty much

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.430 
the state of this thing it's pretty much
a<00:01:36.590> pile<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:36.890> trash<00:01:37.250> Oh<00:01:37.700> No<00:01:38.170> there's<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.259> rip

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
a pile of trash Oh No there's a rip

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.020 
a pile of trash Oh No there's a rip
leather<00:01:39.710> there<00:01:40.009> which<00:01:40.670> means<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:41.000> should

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
leather there which means I should

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.060 
leather there which means I should
probably<00:01:41.450> go<00:01:41.750> finance<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.229> new<00:01:42.259> car<00:01:42.560> most

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
probably go finance a new car most

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.889 
probably go finance a new car most
likely<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:44.390> um<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.700> Sun<00:01:46.940> roof<00:01:47.440> doesn't<00:01:48.440> leak

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
likely so um the Sun roof doesn't leak

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.210 
likely so um the Sun roof doesn't leak
but<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.020> probably<00:01:51.229> actually<00:01:51.500> does<00:01:51.830> because

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
but it probably actually does because

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.760 
but it probably actually does because
all<00:01:52.490> cars<00:01:52.940> over<00:01:53.210> 150,000<00:01:54.080> miles<00:01:54.200> have<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.470> leaky

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
all cars over 150,000 miles have a leaky

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.290 
all cars over 150,000 miles have a leaky

mile car hopefully you can read that
300,000<00:03:16.260> miles<00:03:16.849> started<00:03:20.420> most<00:03:21.420> likely<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
300,000 miles started most likely the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.809 
300,000 miles started most likely the
next<00:03:22.140> time<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.290> put<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.560> key<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:22.950> its<00:03:23.519> going<00:03:23.730> to

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
next time I put that key in its going to

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.460 
next time I put that key in its going to
blow<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.450> battery<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.230> going<00:03:25.410> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
blow up the battery and it's going to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.050 
blow up the battery and it's going to
melt<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.769> engine<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.670> will<00:03:26.760> probably<00:03:26.910> be

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
melt the engine and it will probably be

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.940 
melt the engine and it will probably be
like<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.269> four<00:03:27.510> thousand<00:03:27.930> dollar<00:03:28.049> repair<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.709> I

actually hang out before I get out a
real<00:04:08.669> Road<00:04:08.910> here<00:04:09.180> but<00:04:10.609> most<00:04:11.609> likely<00:04:11.849> what's

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
real Road here but most likely what's

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.099 
real Road here but most likely what's
gonna<00:04:12.750> happen<00:04:13.139> when<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.290> put<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:13.590> car<00:04:13.859> in<00:04:13.889> gear

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
gonna happen when I put this car in gear

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.140 
gonna happen when I put this car in gear
is<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.859> transmission<00:04:17.430> will<00:04:17.519> probably<00:04:17.849> grind

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
is it transmission will probably grind

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.969 
is it transmission will probably grind
so<00:04:18.659> much<00:04:18.810> metal<00:04:19.169> flakes<00:04:19.379> to<00:04:19.500> go<00:04:19.620> everywhere

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
so much metal flakes to go everywhere

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.439 
so much metal flakes to go everywhere
and<00:04:20.579> it's<00:04:20.699> going<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.849> about<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> three

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
and it's going to about it three

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.779 
and it's going to about it three
thousand<00:04:21.870> five<00:04:22.049> thousand<00:04:22.469> dollar<00:04:22.590> repair<00:04:22.979> so

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789
