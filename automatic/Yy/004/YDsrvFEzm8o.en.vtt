00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
for this video i think when i go with t1

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.020 
for this video i think when i go with t1
and<00:02:36.599> then<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.080> tap<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.890> thing<00:02:38.459> again<00:02:38.790> like

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and then if you tap the thing again like

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.640 
and then if you tap the thing again like
if<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.180> tap<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.510> twice<00:02:39.629> this<00:02:40.260> little<00:02:40.530> bar

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
if you tap it twice this little bar

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.380 
if you tap it twice this little bar
comes<00:02:40.890> up<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.400> choose<00:02:41.610> how<00:02:41.849> intense

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
comes up so you can choose how intense

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.380 
comes up so you can choose how intense
