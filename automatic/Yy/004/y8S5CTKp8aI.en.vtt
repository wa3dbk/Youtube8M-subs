00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
ease I'm gonna drag it to the desktop

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.790 
ease I'm gonna drag it to the desktop
noticing<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.400> makes<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.730> copy<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.590> let's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
noticing that it makes a copy so let's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
noticing that it makes a copy so let's
have<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> look<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.460> file<00:00:29.640> extension

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
have a look here at this file extension

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.900 
have a look here at this file extension
normally<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.990> lowercase<00:00:31.560> M<00:00:31.800> lowercase<00:00:32.610> P

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
normally it's lowercase M lowercase P

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.479 
normally it's lowercase M lowercase P
the<00:00:33.210> device<00:00:33.600> gives<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.680> uppercase<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the device gives it uppercase and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
the device gives it uppercase and
GarageBand<00:00:35.850> doesn't<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.780> with

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
GarageBand doesn't know what to do with

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
GarageBand doesn't know what to do with
that<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.290> right<00:00:37.890> away<00:00:38.040> change<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.820> file

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that so right away change the file

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
that so right away change the file
extension<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.750> lowercase<00:00:40.020> M<00:00:40.379> lowercase<00:00:40.800> P

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
extension to lowercase M lowercase P

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.100 
extension to lowercase M lowercase P
what<00:00:41.610> will<00:00:41.730> happen<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.239> you'll<00:00:42.360> try<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> drop

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
what will happen is you'll try to drop

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
what will happen is you'll try to drop
your<00:00:43.379> file<00:00:44.100> into<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> GarageBand<00:00:45.059> project

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

your file into the GarageBand project
and<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> won't<00:00:45.989> drop<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.250> number

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and it won't drop so that's the number

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.150 
and it won't drop so that's the number

timeline let's listen
this<00:01:53.259> is<00:01:53.439> me<00:01:53.710> testing<00:01:54.640> how<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.329> split<00:01:55.689> a<00:01:55.719> clip

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
this is me testing how to split a clip

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.550 
this is me testing how to split a clip
into<00:01:56.530> segments<00:01:57.159> so<00:01:57.880> set<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.539> first<00:01:58.840> split

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
into segments so set the first split

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.419 
into segments so set the first split
point<00:01:59.920> right<00:02:00.640> here<00:02:01.030> or<00:02:01.240> cut<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.049> track<00:02:02.429> so

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
point right here or cut the track so

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.099 
point right here or cut the track so
that's<00:02:03.700> where<00:02:03.939> I've<00:02:04.060> said<00:02:04.359> I<00:02:04.390> want<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.869> cut<00:02:05.020> the

something like that they're not going to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.600 
something like that they're not going to
tell<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.769> split<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.099> clip<00:02:12.250> you'll<00:02:12.459> be

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.550 
was then there'd be all this blank space
at<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.650> end<00:04:21.770> of<00:04:21.860> my<00:04:21.950> track<00:04:22.250> this<00:04:22.550> tells

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
at the end of my track this tells

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.750 
at the end of my track this tells
GarageBand<00:04:24.560> when<00:04:24.740> you're<00:04:24.860> exporting<00:04:25.130> that

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
GarageBand when you're exporting that

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.360 
GarageBand when you're exporting that
this<00:04:26.060> is<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.390> end<00:04:26.600> right<00:04:26.990> here<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:27.920> we're

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
this is the end right here so we're

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.630 
this is the end right here so we're
basically<00:04:28.880> done<00:04:29.180> here<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.740> could<00:04:30.920> do<00:04:31.100> sort<00:04:31.580> of

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
basically done here you could do sort of

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.520 
basically done here you could do sort of
any<00:04:31.790> panning<00:04:32.390> or<00:04:32.540> volume<00:04:32.870> adjustments<00:04:33.350> if<00:04:33.440> you

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
any panning or volume adjustments if you

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.890 
any panning or volume adjustments if you
had<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.830> do<00:04:33.980> that<00:04:34.130> here<00:04:34.580> but<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.480> think<00:04:35.780> it

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
had to do that here but I think it

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.830 
had to do that here but I think it
sounds<00:04:36.140> ok<00:04:36.440> so<00:04:36.950> I'm<00:04:37.160> gonna<00:04:37.340> go<00:04:37.610> share<00:04:38.030> export

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840
