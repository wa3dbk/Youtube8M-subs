technical ability you know is tactical

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.229 
technical ability you know is tactical
awareness<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.189> you<00:02:48.430> actually<00:02:48.519> see<00:02:48.879> that<00:02:49.090> on

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
awareness and you actually see that on

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.289 
awareness and you actually see that on
the<00:02:49.389> pitch<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:51.430> gives<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.819> real<00:02:52.060> buzz

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
the pitch it gives you a real buzz

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.289

knowing<00:02:52.689> that<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.549> you<00:02:54.549> know<00:02:54.639> I<00:02:54.669> think<00:02:55.090> a

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
knowing that you you know I think a

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.670 
knowing that you you know I think a
player<00:02:55.480> has<00:02:55.629> his<00:02:55.659> own<00:02:55.900> natural<00:02:56.349> ability

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
player has his own natural ability

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.170 
player has his own natural ability
anyway<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.370> think<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.730> coach<00:02:57.970> is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
anyway and I think as coach is

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.119 
anyway and I think as coach is
developing<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:59.470> need<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.739> try<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.040> enhance

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
developing we need to try and enhance

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.309 
developing we need to try and enhance
that<00:03:00.609> as<00:03:00.760> much<00:03:01.150> we<00:03:01.269> can<00:03:01.419> to<00:03:01.569> get<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.870> best<00:03:02.079> out

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
that as much we can to get the best out

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.679 
that as much we can to get the best out
of<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:02.500> player<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.489> moving<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.569> to

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
of the player and to moving on to it to

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.869 
of the player and to moving on to it to
even<00:03:04.959> greater<00:03:05.230> greater<00:03:05.889> levels<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.370> play<00:03:06.609> and

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
even greater greater levels of play and

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.960 
even greater greater levels of play and
I<00:03:07.720> think<00:03:08.109> when<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.319> do<00:03:08.439> that<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.639> a<00:03:09.669> real

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
I think when you do that it is a real

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.949 
I think when you do that it is a real
sense<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.959> achievement<00:03:12.750> firstly<00:03:13.750> for<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
sense of achievement firstly for the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.439 
sense of achievement firstly for the
player<00:03:14.169> of<00:03:14.560> course<00:03:14.949> fit<00:03:15.190> for<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:16.329> had<00:03:16.419> a

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
player of course fit for you you had a

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.719 
player of course fit for you you had a
successful<00:03:16.750> playing<00:03:17.139> career<00:03:17.440> yourself<00:03:17.769> how

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
successful playing career yourself how

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.670 
successful playing career yourself how
different<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.359> for<00:03:19.989> when<00:03:20.109> you<00:03:20.260> were<00:03:20.379> coming

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
different is it for when you were coming

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.689 
different is it for when you were coming
up<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.829> how<00:03:21.099> these<00:03:21.280> leads<00:03:22.120> are<00:03:22.209> coming<00:03:22.269> up<00:03:22.599> I

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
up to how these leads are coming up I

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.280 
up to how these leads are coming up I
think<00:03:24.699> they're<00:03:24.819> certainly<00:03:25.120> quicker<00:03:25.569> than<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
think they're certainly quicker than the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.619 
think they're certainly quicker than the
men<00:03:26.549> are<00:03:27.549> played<00:03:27.879> in<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.180> games<00:03:28.419> a<00:03:28.599> lot

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
men are played in the games a lot

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.349 
men are played in the games a lot
quicker<00:03:29.109> winner<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:30.459> than<00:03:30.699> it<00:03:31.000> was<00:03:31.030> when<00:03:31.239> I

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
quicker winner now than it was when I

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.729 
quicker winner now than it was when I
applied<00:03:31.599> not<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:31.930> i<00:03:31.989> think<00:03:32.199> the<00:03:32.319> physicality

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
applied not and i think the physicality

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.159 
applied not and i think the physicality
of<00:03:32.979> it<00:03:33.190> as<00:03:33.310> well<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:33.669> know<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.940> these<00:03:34.750> some<00:03:35.139> of

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
of it as well you know the these some of

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.719 
of it as well you know the these some of
the<00:03:35.260> players<00:03:35.440> they're<00:03:36.069> such<00:03:36.280> athletes

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
the players they're such athletes

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.360 
the players they're such athletes
technically<00:03:37.449> and<00:03:37.750> i<00:03:38.379> think<00:03:38.769> certainly<00:03:39.129> this

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
technically and i think certainly this

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.189 
technically and i think certainly this
country<00:03:39.790> it's<00:03:40.090> getting<00:03:40.419> better<00:03:40.569> getting<00:03:40.930> much

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
country it's getting better getting much

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.750 
country it's getting better getting much
much<00:03:41.379> better<00:03:41.590> i<00:03:41.769> think<00:03:42.099> some<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> quality

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
much better i think some of the quality

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.000 
much better i think some of the quality
that<00:03:42.790> we<00:03:43.000> have<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.299> these<00:03:43.870> first<00:03:44.169> class<00:03:44.379> the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
that we have is these first class the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.530 
that we have is these first class the
English<00:03:45.459> football's<00:03:45.790> unit<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.150> think<00:03:46.359> in<00:03:46.449> a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
English football's unit I think in a

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.349 
English football's unit I think in a
very<00:03:46.569> good<00:03:46.870> stay<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.079> think<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.680> term<00:03:48.359> is

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
very good stay I think that term is

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.360 
very good stay I think that term is
probably<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.079> lot<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.620> negativity<00:03:50.949> around

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
probably a lot of negativity around

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.280 
probably a lot of negativity around
steal<00:03:51.819> dat<00:03:52.000> wit<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.359> know<00:03:52.510> not<00:03:53.019> as<00:03:53.109> good<00:03:53.229> as

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
steal dat wit you know not as good as

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.719 
steal dat wit you know not as good as
these<00:03:53.560> technically<00:03:54.099> not<00:03:54.340> as<00:03:54.400> good<00:03:54.489> as<00:03:54.609> in

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
these technically not as good as in

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.399 
these technically not as good as in
technically<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:55.720> actually<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.049> think<00:03:56.109> we

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
technically but actually I think we

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.559 
technically but actually I think we
really<00:03:56.650> are<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:56.949> think<00:03:57.280> we<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.209> some<00:03:58.449> great

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
really are I think we have some great
