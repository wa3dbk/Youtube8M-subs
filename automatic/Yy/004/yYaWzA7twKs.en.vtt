00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello friends now in this 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.610
 I will introduce you to another video 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.230
 such a wonderful document is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.480
 record requirement 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.740
 telephone conversations produced in 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.269
 the framework of rendering the banks not 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.430
 consumer service contract 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.490
 such and such 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:26.660
 well, too, like an impossible requirement 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 that is, you probably will not give 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.190
 the answer the request does not perform more precisely 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 It provides some excuse the runaround 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 In principle, what we need and what we 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 achieve why we ask it we 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 the bank is asking yes if we already 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.719
 overdue bangkok payments 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.789
 frantically begins to produce on our 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.930
 subscriber number including numbers 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.170
 familiar breasts and relatives here but we 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 when signed a credit agreement is not 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 have been notified by the bank that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.290
 In case of delay in payment to us the bank 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.450
 will begin as a mad nazvanivat on our 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.850
 phone numbers we have a contract 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 remote where if we delayed payment what 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.549
 we come here so 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.040
 responsibility yes we expect that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.470
 this will be the responsibility of the bank and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.330
 right there 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.340
 there are recent requirements 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.759
 the right to sue the bank will start 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.890
 us 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.500
 call a place to torture in the contract in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.979
 principle is not spelled out there is a bank 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.229
 at the conclusion of the contract is from us 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.700
 opened hit that is not revealed 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.350
 Fully us the essence of the services offered 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 consumer protection law thinks 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.630
 differently due to rights protection law 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.490
 consumers think about what the bank 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.340
 I had to tell us all the nuances 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.950
 services 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.119
 taras didnâ€™t say monk 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.240
 does wrong accordingly we 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.160
 based on this order from the bank 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.099
 recording requirements 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.620
 telephone conversations produced in 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.170
 consumer service 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.900
 under contract 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.880
 It means the text of the connection with the periodic 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.130
 incoming calls to my 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.900
 subscriber phone number as well as 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.459
 third party numbers 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.840
 persons from people calling themselves 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.620
 bank employees 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.390
 gave a ban making an incoming call to 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.239
 framework of rendering me a consumer 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.920
 contractual service number of dyeing 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.260
 personal personal information and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.599
 disclosing information components 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 bank secrecy while not getting on 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.530
 this action is my consent 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.090
 and also due to the fact that the bank process 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.910
 communication resulting 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.549
 making an incoming call to the bank 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.690
 my bank number notifies the bank that 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.890
 keeps an audio recording of all the conversation demanding 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.660
 give me all the records of all 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.299
 produced by banks not by bank 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.090
 telephone conversations and conversations with 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.920
 me or with third parties committed 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.900
 the bank as part of rendering to me 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.549
 consumer service contract number 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.680
 some 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.799
 records are required to provide as 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.450
 audio format 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.850
 so in printed out on paper 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.209
 carrier seeing in the printout demanding 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.639
 specify 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.889
 talk text datum time 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.799
 the call number from which 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.810
 made a call last name name middle name and 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.090
 post produced communication 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.590
 employee 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.139
 Requests to provide answers in writing 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 paper form and apply or 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:41.310
 ssd discs or 99 discs in mp3 format 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.870
 10-day period and send to my 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.060
 home address above 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.239
 already said 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.770
 Mark most likely will not provide these 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.840
 data accordingly will be possible 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.220
 to refer to the fact that the bank at the conclusion 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.540
 the contract did not inform about all the nuances 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.750
 we represent their consumer services 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.130
 accordingly there is a reason to break 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:16.459
 contract with the bank and ask the bank 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:20.880
 return all payments all interest which 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.040
 were listed in repayment 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.760
 velvet like u to not rendered for what 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.889
 I can pay 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.110
 it is clear that for example if you came to 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.840
 to the hairdresser he cut you 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.340
 formal work done but if there 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.900
 he you cut your fist lucky say so and 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.550
 hairstyle does not fit it is clear that for 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.919
 no one pays the work done 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.590
 this is the same with the bank we 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.500
 count on one piece bank 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.060
 renders does so to speak trim 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.410
 us are you shooting some old clak 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.300
 As a result, the service is not provided. 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.110
 before or rendered inadequate quality 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.930
 and we demand to get our money back 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.600
 accordingly, if you have been long 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.700
 pay a loan for example there is a five year 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.550
 crisis of the year three then it can happen 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.460
 that the bank should still be let 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.140
 if you subtract all payments 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.820
 from all payments deduct his loans 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.289
 look at what's left but it's in 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.240
 theory in practice do not know how 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.240
 implemented as it is implemented and 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.130
 accordingly we catch the bank she 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.570
 looked all the nuances where he breaks 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.400
 that is, shout it borrowers violate 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.490
 I try to violate the bank too, so 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.070
 tell the wheel to drill yourself into a gun 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.639
 Here we are banks trying to catch this 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.880
 if the bank miraculously provides 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.729
 us all records of all produced by the bank 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.470
 telephone conversations talking to us 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.200
 there are third parties then it will be generally 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.480
 a gift of fate because on the grounds 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.540
 almost every conversation you can to 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.990
 jar such a bouquet of claims present 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.290
 that little seething does not seem so the bank 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.930
 likely to be providing 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:10.720
 numbers by the way again in court when 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.330
 this paper will pop up if the newspaper or 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.740
 when for the sake of what you need and in the court studio 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.140
 there is paper that there is a game borrower 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.770
 the presence of a petition that the bank has not fulfilled 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:28.840
 their terms of the contract yes and therefore not 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:31.300
 worthy of payment from you and you spent this 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.640
 paper can be asked to court 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.440
 the bank must provide all these 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.360
 call recordings from disney bank 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.250
 provide these conversations records in 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.669
 court for a long time to listen to their judicial 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:49.720
 the process may not be a year for interest in 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:52.570
 theoretically well the text will also attach in 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.000
 description of the video clip he hope video 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.540
 It was helpful Thank you all for your attention 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.540
 to new meetings
