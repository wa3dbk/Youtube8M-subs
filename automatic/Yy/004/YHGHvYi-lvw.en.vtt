to show you is also for the chest I
basically<00:00:14.510> only<00:00:14.930> do<00:00:15.139> two<00:00:15.350> exercises<00:00:15.379> one<00:00:16.340> was

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
basically only do two exercises one was

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.630 
basically only do two exercises one was
the<00:00:17.060> barbell<00:00:17.480> bench<00:00:17.750> press<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:19.250> one<00:00:19.490> is

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
the barbell bench press and this one is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.420 
the barbell bench press and this one is
actually<00:00:19.820> inclined<00:00:20.630> flies<00:00:21.189> now<00:00:22.189> I<00:00:22.220> want<00:00:22.400> to

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
actually inclined flies now I want to

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.279 
actually inclined flies now I want to
just<00:00:22.550> explain<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.060> you<00:00:23.330> what<00:00:23.509> incline<00:00:24.020> and

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
just explain to you what incline and

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.279 
just explain to you what incline and
decline<00:00:24.529> flies<00:00:25.130> are<00:00:25.720> inclined<00:00:26.720> or<00:00:26.900> decline

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
decline flies are inclined or decline

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.390 
decline flies are inclined or decline
exercises<00:00:28.250> on<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.810> decline<00:00:30.320> means<00:00:30.800> that<00:00:31.130> your

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
exercises on the decline means that your

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.520 
exercises on the decline means that your
hips<00:00:31.910> are<00:00:32.500> higher<00:00:33.500> than<00:00:33.949> your<00:00:34.730> chest<00:00:35.320> so<00:00:36.320> what

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
hips are higher than your chest so what

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.770 
hips are higher than your chest so what
that<00:00:36.559> does<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.400> works<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:38.000> bottom<00:00:38.510> part

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
that does is that works the bottom part

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.340 
that does is that works the bottom part
of<00:00:39.019> your<00:00:39.199> chest<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:41.180> more<00:00:41.449> inclined<00:00:42.110> you

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
of your chest the more inclined you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.829 
of your chest the more inclined you
become<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:43.280> further<00:00:43.610> round<00:00:44.089> your<00:00:44.420> chest<00:00:44.690> that

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
become the further round your chest that

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.289 
become the further round your chest that
actually<00:00:45.170> works<00:00:45.409> so<00:00:46.220> what<00:00:46.460> happens<00:00:46.850> is<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.150> get

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
actually works so what happens is to get

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.509 
actually works so what happens is to get
around<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.900> chest<00:00:48.290> you<00:00:48.559> need<00:00:48.830> to<00:00:49.040> be<00:00:49.250> more

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
around the chest you need to be more

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.750 
around the chest you need to be more
inclined<00:00:50.089> otherwise<00:00:50.600> you'll<00:00:50.930> see<00:00:51.140> sometimes

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
inclined otherwise you'll see sometimes

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.500 
inclined otherwise you'll see sometimes
people<00:00:52.760> who<00:00:52.820> have<00:00:52.909> been<00:00:52.940> training<00:00:53.420> with

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
people who have been training with

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.450 
people who have been training with
weights<00:00:53.720> end<00:00:54.589> up<00:00:54.769> with<00:00:54.920> quite<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.129> flat<00:00:55.430> chest

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
weights end up with quite a flat chest

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.200 
weights end up with quite a flat chest
well<00:00:56.420> defined<00:00:56.930> but<00:00:57.589> quite<00:00:57.830> flat<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.879> want<00:00:59.119> a

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
well defined but quite flat you want a

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.390 
well defined but quite flat you want a
round<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.659> chest<00:00:59.989> well<00:01:00.650> that's<00:01:00.830> what<00:01:00.979> I<00:01:01.010> work

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
round a chest well that's what I work

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.149 
round a chest well that's what I work
for<00:01:01.640> as<00:01:01.790> a<00:01:01.850> decent<00:01:02.540> rounded<00:01:02.930> chest<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:03.500> I<00:01:03.530> do<00:01:03.739> a

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
for as a decent rounded chest so I do a

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.120 
for as a decent rounded chest so I do a
number<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.970> incline<00:01:05.479> flies<00:01:05.869> that<00:01:06.590> way<00:01:06.830> I<00:01:07.070> could

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
number of incline flies that way I could

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.130 
number of incline flies that way I could
with<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.580> top<00:01:07.820> part<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.240> chest<00:01:08.510> the

with the top part of the chest the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.350 
with the top part of the chest the
further<00:01:09.380> up<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.860> come<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.670> more<00:01:10.909> rounded

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
further up you come the more rounded

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.330 
further up you come the more rounded
girls<00:01:11.600> until<00:01:11.960> eventually<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.920> can<00:01:13.070> imagine

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
girls until eventually you can imagine

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.010

shoulder presses so you working

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.690 
shoulder presses so you working
shoulders<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.570> remember<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:18.590> higher<00:01:18.860> you
