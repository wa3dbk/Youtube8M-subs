and senses of a spider and not just dead

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.110 
and senses of a spider and not just dead
they<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> something<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.910> let

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
they think is something that we can let

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
they think is something that we can let
slide<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.020> were<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
slide but if they were to get all the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
slide but if they were to get all the
spider<00:00:50.129> powers<00:00:50.309> including<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> webbing<00:00:51.750> then

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
spider powers including the webbing then

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
spider powers including the webbing then
theoretically<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.489> should<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:54.000> coming<00:00:54.390> out

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
