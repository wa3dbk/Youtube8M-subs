00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
kybella but it helps us calculate how

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.389 
kybella but it helps us calculate how
much<00:01:46.290> we're<00:01:46.530> using<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:48.710> we'll<00:01:49.710> take<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.159> off

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
much we're using and we'll take that off

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.810 
much we're using and we'll take that off
and<00:01:50.720> there<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.049> our<00:01:52.500> chem<00:01:53.040> calculate<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> dose

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and there is our chem calculate the dose

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.319 
and there is our chem calculate the dose
of<00:01:54.060> kybella<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> we've<00:01:55.740> done<00:01:55.920> our<00:01:56.040> tattoo<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
of kybella so we've done our tattoo the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.359 
of kybella so we've done our tattoo the
dots<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> periphery<00:01:58.409> there's<00:01:58.920> no<00:01:59.100> fat

dots on the periphery there's no fat

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.889 
dots on the periphery there's no fat
here<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.790> we're<00:01:59.909> not<00:01:59.939> counting<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.630> there's

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
here so we're not counting them there's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.749 
here so we're not counting them there's
no<00:02:01.020> fat<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.590> there's<00:02:02.040> no<00:02:02.219> fat<00:02:02.490> at<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
no fat there there's no fat at the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.450 
no fat there there's no fat at the
mandibular<00:02:03.180> border<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.320> really<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.770> 22

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
mandibular border so we really have 22

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.490 
mandibular border so we really have 22
meaningful<00:02:06.390> dots<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.960> those<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> dots

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
meaningful dots and those are the dots

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.729 
meaningful dots and those are the dots
that<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.819> circling<00:02:09.360> our<00:02:09.450> fat<00:02:09.690> deposit<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that are in circling our fat deposit so

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.710 
that are in circling our fat deposit so
what<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.520> take<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.760> 22<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.660> you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
what you do is you take that 22 and you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.370 
what you do is you take that 22 and you
volatilize

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
volatilize

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.730 
volatilize
times<00:02:13.560> two<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.570> 44<00:02:15.570> if<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.230> move<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
times two that's 44 if you move the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.250 
times two that's 44 if you move the
decimal<00:02:17.160> point<00:02:17.370> over<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.840> four

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
decimal point over one that is four

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.460 
decimal point over one that is four
point<00:02:19.800> four<00:02:20.190> milliliters<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.540> kybella<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
point four milliliters of kybella and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.250 
point four milliliters of kybella and
that's<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.340> tad<00:02:23.580> over<00:02:23.910> two<00:02:24.540> vials<00:02:25.080> each

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
that's just a tad over two vials each

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.760 
that's just a tad over two vials each
vial<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.830> 2<00:02:26.460> ml<00:02:26.850> now<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> small<00:02:28.020> person<00:02:28.470> they

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
vial is 2 ml now on a small person they

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.730 
vial is 2 ml now on a small person they
may<00:02:28.950> only<00:02:29.130> need<00:02:29.570> two<00:02:30.570> ml<00:02:30.900> which<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.470> vial

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
may only need two ml which is one vial

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.870 
may only need two ml which is one vial
on<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> larger<00:02:33.000> person<00:02:33.240> they<00:02:33.510> may<00:02:33.900> use<00:02:34.110> up<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.880> 6

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
on a larger person they may use up to 6

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.170 
on a larger person they may use up to 6
ml<00:02:36.270> which<00:02:36.510> would<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.870> three<00:02:37.470> vials<00:02:37.890> or<00:02:38.100> 8<00:02:38.790> ml

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
ml which would be three vials or 8 ml

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000 
ml which would be three vials or 8 ml
which<00:02:39.360> would<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.600> four<00:02:39.870> vials<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.590> my

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
which would be four vials in my

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.190 
which would be four vials in my
experience<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.180> are<00:02:42.210> usually<00:02:42.810> using

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
experience here we are usually using

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
experience here we are usually using
about<00:02:43.530> three<00:02:43.950> vials<00:02:44.400> per<00:02:44.580> patient<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.250> 22<00:02:47.250> dots

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
about three vials per patient so 22 dots

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.820 
about three vials per patient so 22 dots
multiplied<00:02:48.180> times<00:02:48.420> two<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:48.930> 44<00:02:49.470> move<00:02:49.740> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
multiplied times two that's 44 move the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.980 
multiplied times two that's 44 move the
decimal<00:02:50.190> point<00:02:50.370> over<00:02:50.550> one<00:02:50.880> that's<00:02:51.450> four<00:02:51.720> point

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
decimal point over one that's four point

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.290 
decimal point over one that's four point
four<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.500> that's<00:02:53.040> how<00:02:53.340> many<00:02:53.550> milliliters<00:02:54.000> of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
four and that's how many milliliters of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.150 
four and that's how many milliliters of
kybella<00:02:54.810> we'll<00:02:55.080> use<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.650> patient

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
kybella we'll use on this patient

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.820 
kybella we'll use on this patient
okay<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.090> we've<00:02:57.810> marked<00:02:58.110> our<00:02:58.380> critical

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
okay so we've marked our critical

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.320 
okay so we've marked our critical
landmarks<00:02:59.400> we<00:02:59.520> want<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> stay<00:02:59.940> away<00:03:00.030> from<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
landmarks we want to stay away from the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.790 
landmarks we want to stay away from the
marginal<00:03:00.690> mandibular<00:03:01.140> nerve<00:03:01.500> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
marginal mandibular nerve the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.950 
marginal mandibular nerve the
submandibular<00:03:02.340> glands<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.210> thyroid<00:03:03.240> gland

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
submandibular glands the thyroid gland

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.930 
submandibular glands the thyroid gland
and<00:03:04.140> now<00:03:04.950> we're<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.520> do<00:03:05.610> our<00:03:05.640> actual

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and now we're going to do our actual

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.330 
and now we're going to do our actual
injection<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> half-inch<00:03:07.440> needle<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
injection this is a half-inch needle and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.370 
injection this is a half-inch needle and
what<00:03:09.060> we're<00:03:09.210> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.810> put<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> needle

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
what we're going to do is put the needle

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.740 
what we're going to do is put the needle
in<00:03:10.550> about<00:03:11.550> half<00:03:11.790> way<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.330> we're<00:03:12.570> going<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
in about half way and we're going to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.120 
in about half way and we're going to
inject<00:03:12.990> point<00:03:13.500> 2<00:03:14.360> ml<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.630> each<00:03:15.930> area<00:03:16.290> now<00:03:16.920> on

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
inject point 2 ml in each area now on

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.310 
inject point 2 ml in each area now on
the<00:03:17.280> sides<00:03:17.550> here<00:03:18.060> I'm<00:03:18.420> going<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.690> feather<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the sides here I'm going to feather it a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.750 
the sides here I'm going to feather it a
little<00:03:19.500> bit<00:03:19.710> so<00:03:19.890> I'll<00:03:20.010> probably<00:03:20.220> put<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> little

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
little bit so I'll probably put a little

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.650 
little bit so I'll probably put a little
bit<00:03:21.120> less<00:03:21.980> but<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> center<00:03:23.610> for<00:03:24.090> sure<00:03:24.360> and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
bit less but in the center for sure and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.020 
bit less but in the center for sure and
you<00:03:25.470> want<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.740> inject<00:03:26.010> perpendicular<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you want to inject perpendicular to the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.380 
you want to inject perpendicular to the
skin<00:03:27.740> for<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.100> sake<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.760> video<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.360> you

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
skin for the sake of the video so you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.200 
skin for the sake of the video so you
can<00:03:30.630> see<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:31.080> going<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.320> angle<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:32.400> syringe<00:03:33.090> a

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
can see I'm going to angle the syringe a

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.860 
can see I'm going to angle the syringe a
little<00:03:33.450> bit<00:03:33.600> but<00:03:33.780> I'm<00:03:33.870> putting<00:03:34.130> 0.2<00:03:35.130> ml<00:03:35.520> and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
little bit but I'm putting 0.2 ml and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.850 
little bit but I'm putting 0.2 ml and
again<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.580> half-inch<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.470> 32

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
again it's a half-inch this is a 32

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.900 
again it's a half-inch this is a 32
gauge<00:03:41.310> needle

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.720 

most<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.690> our<00:03:46.920> situation<00:03:47.920> here<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.400> in<00:03:48.610> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
most of our situation here is in the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.090 
most of our situation here is in the
center<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.630> we're<00:03:50.020> we're<00:03:50.590> going<00:03:50.710> to<00:03:50.770> keep<00:03:50.890> this

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
center so we're we're going to keep this

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.700 
center so we're we're going to keep this
probably<00:03:51.460> to<00:03:51.580> four<00:03:51.820> CCS<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:53.080> for<00:03:53.590> our

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
probably to four CCS so for our

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.290 
probably to four CCS so for our
treatment<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.460> is<00:03:54.580> just<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.850> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.150> a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
treatment and this is just a this is a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.260 
treatment and this is just a this is a
Botox<00:03:55.690> setup<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:56.710> is<00:03:56.860> just<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:57.910> ml

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
Botox setup this is just a one ml

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
just through the dot a bit not or not

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.640 
just through the dot a bit not or not
through<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.390> dot<00:04:28.570> just<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.140> side<00:04:29.380> of<00:04:29.410> the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
through the dot just to the side of the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.350 
through the dot just to the side of the
dot<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.100> really<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:33.610> are<00:04:33.670> we're<00:04:34.030> just<00:04:34.210> done

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
dot and really we are we're just done

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.010 
dot and really we are we're just done
two<00:04:34.480> hours<00:04:35.070> after<00:04:36.070> our<00:04:36.400> Cabella<00:04:37.150> injections

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
two hours after our Cabella injections

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.620 
two hours after our Cabella injections
and<00:04:38.200> let's<00:04:39.070> turn<00:04:39.700> sideways<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.390> way<00:04:40.450> a

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
and let's turn sideways this way a

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.200 
and let's turn sideways this way a
little<00:04:40.780> bit<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.200> we<00:04:42.100> have<00:04:42.280> some<00:04:42.520> swelling<00:04:42.820> and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
little bit so we have some swelling and

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.270 
little bit so we have some swelling and
you<00:04:43.390> can<00:04:43.510> see<00:04:43.720> how<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.080> kind<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.740> wobbles<00:04:45.160> a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
you can see how this kind of wobbles a

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.980 
you can see how this kind of wobbles a
little<00:04:45.520> bit<00:04:45.670> it<00:04:45.820> didn't<00:04:46.150> waddle<00:04:46.630> quite<00:04:46.840> as

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
little bit it didn't waddle quite as

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.420 
little bit it didn't waddle quite as
much<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.410> expect<00:04:47.800> more<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:48.220> tonight

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
much and I expect more of that tonight

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.520 
much and I expect more of that tonight
that's<00:04:49.240> probably<00:04:49.510> going<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.780> last<00:04:49.930> three<00:04:50.440> or

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
that's probably going to last three or

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.010 
that's probably going to last three or
four<00:04:50.590> days<00:04:51.010> I<00:04:51.820> would<00:04:52.270> imagine<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:52.900> is

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
four days I would imagine that this is

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.950 
four days I would imagine that this is
going<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.200> be<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.320> little<00:04:53.560> bit<00:04:53.680> sore<00:04:53.980> tonight

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
going to be a little bit sore tonight

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.450 
going to be a little bit sore tonight

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
of bruises there the four or five little

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.890 
of bruises there the four or five little
bruise<00:05:02.920> marks<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:03.550> can<00:05:03.700> see<00:05:03.850> this<00:05:04.060> mobile

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
bruise marks and you can see this mobile

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.840 
bruise marks and you can see this mobile
tissue<00:05:05.290> here<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.800> that's<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:06.070> swelling<00:05:06.670> and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
tissue here and that's the swelling and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.520 
tissue here and that's the swelling and
that'll<00:05:07.570> last<00:05:07.720> for<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> couple<00:05:08.320> days<00:05:08.470> so

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
that'll last for a couple days so

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.740 
that'll last for a couple days so
basically<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:09.520> mean<00:05:09.970> she's<00:05:10.270> going<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.540> work

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.600 
today so most people would do fine with
this<00:05:13.540> some<00:05:13.840> patients<00:05:14.200> might<00:05:14.350> swell<00:05:14.830> more<00:05:15.100> now

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610
