00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
to know where those go and the engine

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.180 
to know where those go and the engine
itself<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.760> has<00:01:00.000> sides<00:01:00.530> where<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.560> pins<00:01:02.010> will

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
itself it has sides where the pins will

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.680 
itself it has sides where the pins will
sit<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.760> keep<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.120> bearing<00:01:03.510> from

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
sit and that will keep your bearing from

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.440 
sit and that will keep your bearing from
spinning<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.430> through<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:06.000> sure<00:01:06.030> all

fucking hero in and we're gonna start
mounting<00:02:13.270> her<00:02:13.510> pistons<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.380> arrow<00:02:14.709> goes

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
mounting her pistons and that arrow goes

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.130 
mounting her pistons and that arrow goes
towards<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.910> exhaust<00:02:16.300> side<00:02:16.570> that's<00:02:16.900> very

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
towards the exhaust side that's very

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.550 
towards the exhaust side that's very
important<00:02:17.680> I'm<00:02:18.520> gonna<00:02:18.700> show<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.030> why<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:20.380> this

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
important I'm gonna show you why on this

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.580 
important I'm gonna show you why on this
one<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:22.450> if<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.600> see<00:02:22.810> right<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:23.320> where<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
one now if you see right there where the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.010 
one now if you see right there where the
piston<00:02:23.800> grooves<00:02:24.250> are<00:02:24.520> that's<00:02:25.180> your<00:02:25.540> gap<00:02:25.750> where

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
piston grooves are that's your gap where

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.860 
piston grooves are that's your gap where
your<00:02:26.110> pistons<00:02:26.590> are<00:02:26.850> that's<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.090> gap<00:02:28.330> where

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
your pistons are that's the gap where

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.420 
your pistons are that's the gap where
your<00:02:29.020> piston<00:02:29.410> ring<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.709> right<00:02:29.950> there<00:02:30.220> and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
your piston ring is right there and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
your piston ring is right there and
right<00:02:30.610> there<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.630> when<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.959> put<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> arrow

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
right there and when you put the arrow

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.090 
right there and when you put the arrow
to<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:33.040> exhaust<00:02:33.400> side<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.560> see<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.890> one

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
to the exhaust side you can see the one

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.759 
to the exhaust side you can see the one
gap<00:02:36.370> there<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.150> then<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> other<00:02:37.930> gap<00:02:38.320> there

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
gap there and then the other gap there

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.650 
gap there and then the other gap there
right<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.519> if<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.730> put<00:02:39.970> your<00:02:40.000> piston<00:02:40.540> in

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
right so if you put your piston in

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.259 
right so if you put your piston in
backwards<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.890> gap<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.550> actually<00:02:43.000> going<00:02:43.120> to

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
backwards that gap is actually going to

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.030 
backwards that gap is actually going to
hit<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.660> opening<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.290> that's<00:02:44.739> going<00:02:44.980> to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
hit that opening and that's going to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.580 
hit that opening and that's going to
destroy<00:02:45.489> your<00:02:45.670> freaking<00:02:46.030> engine<00:02:46.420> or<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:47.470> you

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
destroy your freaking engine or if you

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.990 
destroy your freaking engine or if you
flip<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.980> block<00:02:48.220> down<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:49.239> gap<00:02:51.000> those

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
flip the block down that gap those

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.060 
flip the block down that gap those
piston<00:02:52.570> ring<00:02:52.780> gaps<00:02:53.050> are<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.440> go<00:02:53.800> on<00:02:53.920> this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
piston ring gaps are going to go on this

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.880 
piston ring gaps are going to go on this
side<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:54.970> side<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:56.080> you're<00:02:56.470> not

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
going to catch trust me I've seen it

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.199 
going to catch trust me I've seen it
happen<00:02:59.200> before<00:02:59.830> people<00:02:59.860> install<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.790> Pistons

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
happen before people install the Pistons

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.540 
happen before people install the Pistons
backwards<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.989> then<00:03:02.709> it'll<00:03:02.980> run<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.489> about

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
backwards and then it'll run for about

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.460 
backwards and then it'll run for about
three<00:03:03.910> seconds<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.540> she'll<00:03:04.750> seize<00:03:05.019> up<00:03:05.260> and

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
three seconds and she'll seize up and

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.560 
three seconds and she'll seize up and
your<00:03:05.860> ring<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.280> gonna<00:03:06.459> be<00:03:06.580> fuckin<00:03:06.970> piled<00:03:07.209> up<00:03:07.390> in

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
your ring is gonna be fuckin piled up in

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.220 
your ring is gonna be fuckin piled up in
the<00:03:07.600> hole<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.050> don't<00:03:08.200> fuck<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.709> up<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:10.080> like<00:03:11.080> to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
put one clip on the inside of the piston

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.449 
put one clip on the inside of the piston
makes<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.600> little<00:03:19.720> bit<00:03:19.810> easier<00:03:20.250> I'm<00:03:21.250> going<00:03:21.280> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
put them on top and then use like a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.720 
put them on top and then use like a
small<00:03:54.970> pick<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:56.349> get<00:03:56.560> them<00:03:56.680> into<00:03:57.069> place<00:03:57.430> and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
small pick to get them into place and

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.300 
small pick to get them into place and
then<00:03:58.420> your<00:03:58.629> head<00:03:58.840> gasket<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.739> going<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.159> get

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
then your head gasket is going to get

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.440 
then your head gasket is going to get
sandwiched<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.500> top<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.739> that<00:04:03.390> alright<00:04:04.390> let's

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
sandwiched on top of that alright let's

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.910 
sandwiched on top of that alright let's
look<00:04:04.720> at<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.989> head<00:04:05.170> gasket

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
look at the head gasket

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.390 
look at the head gasket
you<00:04:06.220> got<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.849> groove<00:04:07.390> side<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.319> then<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.069> flat

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
you got a groove side and then a flat

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.580 
you got a groove side and then a flat
side<00:04:09.700> which<00:04:09.909> side<00:04:09.940> goes<00:04:10.360> where<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:11.019> head

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
side which side goes where the head

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.770 
side which side goes where the head
gasket<00:04:12.099> can<00:04:12.250> only<00:04:12.400> go<00:04:12.640> on<00:04:12.670> one<00:04:13.180> way<00:04:13.209> because

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
gasket can only go on one way because

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.830 
gasket can only go on one way because
the<00:04:13.959> doll<00:04:14.200> pins<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.670> it<00:04:15.790> goes<00:04:16.000> with<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.630> rough

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
the doll pins so it goes with the rough

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.979 
the doll pins so it goes with the rough
side<00:04:17.579> going<00:04:18.579> up<00:04:18.789> then<00:04:19.329> you<00:04:19.449> put<00:04:19.630> your<00:04:19.750> head<00:04:19.959> on

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
side going up then you put your head on

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.279 
side going up then you put your head on
top<00:04:20.350> of<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:21.210> now<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.630> important<00:04:23.139> this

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
top of that now this is important this

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.500 
top of that now this is important this
has<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.710> go<00:04:23.860> on<00:04:23.889> a<00:04:24.070> certain<00:04:24.460> way<00:04:24.699> otherwise

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
has to go on a certain way otherwise

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.879 
has to go on a certain way otherwise
your<00:04:25.750> engines<00:04:26.050> never<00:04:26.199> going<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.530> fucking

all right so I got a lot of shit bolted
up<00:05:12.930> here<00:05:13.199> your<00:05:13.319> throttle<00:05:13.740> cable<00:05:14.129> you<00:05:14.189> want

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:14.339 
up here your throttle cable you want

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.010 
up here your throttle cable you want
your<00:05:14.430> throttle<00:05:14.819> cable<00:05:15.240> adjusted<00:05:15.779> like<00:05:15.899> if

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
your throttle cable adjusted like if

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.290 
your throttle cable adjusted like if
you're<00:05:16.199> bolting<00:05:16.469> on<00:05:16.649> an<00:05:16.830> old<00:05:16.979> carb<00:05:17.339> one<00:05:18.149> that

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
you're bolting on an old carb one that

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.049 
you're bolting on an old carb one that
probably<00:05:18.629> came<00:05:18.809> off<00:05:18.839> the<00:05:19.169> engine<00:05:19.610> your<00:05:20.610> idle

00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:21.059 
probably came off the engine your idle

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.239 
probably came off the engine your idle
already<00:05:21.719> be<00:05:21.869> set<00:05:22.259> so<00:05:22.499> just<00:05:22.529> hook<00:05:23.009> up<00:05:23.129> the

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:23.249 
already be set so just hook up the

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:24.649 
already be set so just hook up the
throttle<00:05:23.610> cable<00:05:23.789> so<00:05:24.059> there's<00:05:24.210> no<00:05:24.300> slack<00:05:24.629> in

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
throttle cable so there's no slack in

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.659 
throttle cable so there's no slack in
the<00:05:24.960> line<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.559> that<00:05:26.009> you<00:05:26.129> can<00:05:26.249> open<00:05:26.580> the

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
the line and that you can open the

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.730 
the line and that you can open the
throttle<00:05:26.939> full<00:05:27.899> throttle<00:05:27.960> without<00:05:28.559> any

you need to line those two lines up for
the<00:05:46.919> oil<00:05:47.099> pump<00:05:47.369> and<00:05:47.909> then<00:05:48.569> I<00:05:49.550> got<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.669> positive

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
the oil pump and then I got the positive

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.909 
the oil pump and then I got the positive
on<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.389> starter<00:05:51.869> it's<00:05:52.020> on<00:05:52.139> the<00:05:52.259> bottom<00:05:52.740> I
