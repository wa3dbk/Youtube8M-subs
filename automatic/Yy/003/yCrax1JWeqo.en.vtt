00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.529
 today I bring a little bit of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.059
 showing the lay campaign you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.490
 we talk with two viruses for three we have 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.620
 mods and all that kind of fun stuff 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.369
 and then we can kill everyone 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.010
 all easy fun and so handsome you're not going 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.869
 it comes to you and so I kill each one as a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.400
 dragon like crap and that's how by 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.200
 example nobody could do this and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.940
 kill them 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.870
 who announces me I do not know what is 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.870
 announcing but good 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.050
 I am repairing doing in fact 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 the low 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.969
 and well let's see what they are doing 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.969
 here 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.340
 with those mortars 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.670
 outside 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.590
 why what for 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.860
 we do not have the best time we fly to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860
 through it 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.100
 because it continues to melt we have the time 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.460
 as it should be 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.320
 we approach and well we are already the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.560
 we will see the imagination 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 following 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.100
 We also regret and all died 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.649

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.210
 character so good if they had not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.740

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.020

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.650
 coming out the brain and because as you 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.430
 fly 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.430
 of bowling 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 today in the contest to see who gets out 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.520
 the best campaign click 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.060
 that said that you click on the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.450
 campaign that 122 earns 2 thousand 500 points 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.070
 I could make it good 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.360
 clicks I just took a quad with 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.360
 Victor and it's done 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.740
 I can also have the time here look 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.760
 in the cinematics 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.760
 how to get there 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.370
 control whatsapp 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.120
 h 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:42.390
 and good to clear the street of locus for 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.390
 the arrival of the cocacola caravan 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.840
 go here 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.690
 the down 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.190
 I am a little 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.190
 hello my name is little 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.730
 wait for us here 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.730
 you do not have to repeat it 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.050
 of evacuation must be cleared 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.050
 you can not stop it's just a nuance 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.010
 they want to see others and I think that if 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.689
 not everyone wants to see them from macy's 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.659
 so let's see what goes with the 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.750
 others is what they look like here we are 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.510
 showing are like an alien of men in 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.900
 black reminds me a lot to them he gave 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.240
 a little soccer kick but 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.140
 Let's see 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.430
 if these characters had already seen them 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.140
 I hear these characters had not 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.840
 seen now they come out in multiplayer is that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.200
 bring these shields look at shields these 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.900
 hats no and that and also that thing in 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.000
 the head the trickster in the eyes in the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.250
 lenses then it's going to make different 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.360
 to those who watch multiplayer is that I 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.240
 I never give you many decisions 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.040
 things but good installs so that 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.560
 you check it in case you did not know 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.280
 the characters or whatever and says that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.280
 there is a big rock 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.640
 point to other columns 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.340
 with the good boom I have everything 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.470
 there's the buffer they want to see how you 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.470
 give then let's see it 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.560
 there in the boom er 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.060
 new lines I'm a shit of people 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.220
 that will give you 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.290
 there it is that it gave him and well then he is going to 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.290
 start destroying it 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.569
 how difficult is the campaign is for real 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.939
 technology and h 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.770
 by hand 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.409
 Aisha 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.409
 It is already clear that a dream 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.200
 killed the wolves well by zone 1 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.000
 two 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.540
 and that's it 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.220
 you 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.940
 control I want to make a certain 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.940
 clear route 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.910
 the caravan arrives 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.960
 but let's go to the next shit 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:21.400
 I can not feel good boots that is what 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.400
 that shouts shit 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:32.640
 or showing the clay haze cavas we're going to 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.640
