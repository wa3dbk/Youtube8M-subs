it nice and firm take a tire lever and
slowly<00:01:27.030> work<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.360> way<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.590> other<00:01:28.740> hand

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
slowly work your way to your other hand

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.149 
slowly work your way to your other hand
very<00:01:29.600> gently<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.689> coaxing<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.740> tire<00:01:31.950> onto

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
very gently just coaxing the tire onto

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
very gently just coaxing the tire onto
the<00:01:32.280> room<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.360> slowly<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.930> no<00:01:34.170> real

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the room do it slowly with no real

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
the room do it slowly with no real
pressure<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.490> her<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pressure because you don't want her to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
pressure because you don't want her to
be<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.360> tire<00:01:38.360> okay<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.420> half<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.840> side<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
be to the tire okay so half the side is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.700 
be to the tire okay so half the side is
on<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.090> obviously<00:01:42.360> most<00:01:42.960> cublas<00:01:43.409> tires

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
on so now obviously most cublas tires

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.490 
on so now obviously most cublas tires
you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.670> actually<00:01:44.820> close<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> room<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you can actually close the room up so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319 
you can actually close the room up so
the<00:01:46.619> tire<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.520> should<00:01:47.729> inflate<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the tire up and it should inflate and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.569 
the tire up and it should inflate and
hold<00:01:48.540> air<00:01:48.780> without<00:01:48.990> any<00:01:49.860> sealant<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
hold air without any sealant because it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.420 
hold air without any sealant because it
is<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> proper<00:01:51.149> tubeless<00:01:51.659> tire<00:01:52.280> yeah<00:01:53.280> that's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
is a proper tubeless tire yeah that's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.800 
is a proper tubeless tire yeah that's
not<00:01:53.520> how<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.880> gonna<00:01:54.030> tie<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.329> would<00:01:54.659> run

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
not how you're gonna tie you would run

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
not how you're gonna tie you would run
it<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.079> some<00:01:55.229> sealant<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.310> recommend<00:01:56.759> take

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
it with some sealant so I recommend take

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.630 
it with some sealant so I recommend take
some<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.409> sealant<00:01:58.409> shake<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.399> it's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
some of your sealant shake it up if it's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.820 
some of your sealant shake it up if it's
got<00:01:59.790> particles<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
got particles in it

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.010 
got particles in it
in<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.610> case<00:02:02.850> we're<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.300> use<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> 40

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
in this case we're going to use a 40

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.800 
in this case we're going to use a 40
mobcap<00:02:04.410> just<00:02:05.280> pour<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:05.550> cup<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.030> sealant

side<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.070> bead<00:03:08.660> next<00:03:09.660> you'll<00:03:09.780> take<00:03:09.960> your

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
side of the bead next you'll take your

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.840 
side of the bead next you'll take your
floor<00:03:10.350> pump<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:10.830> compressor<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.670> my<00:03:11.790> case

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
floor pump or compressor like in my case

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.320 
floor pump or compressor like in my case
and<00:03:13.070> simply<00:03:14.070> just<00:03:14.280> screw<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:14.970> inflate

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
and simply just screw it on and inflate

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.640 
and simply just screw it on and inflate
for<00:03:15.990> this<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.320> like<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> lie<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.010> tire<00:03:17.400> flat

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
for this I like to lie the tire flat

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.180 
for this I like to lie the tire flat
that<00:03:19.650> way<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.980> gets<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.370> expand<00:03:20.790> more<00:03:21.180> easily

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
that way it gets to expand more easily

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.330 
that way it gets to expand more easily
and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:23.430> upright<00:03:24.650> what<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.830> want<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.070> do<00:03:26.190> is

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
make sure that the bead of the tire pops

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.850 
make sure that the bead of the tire pops
out<00:03:30.180> everywhere<00:03:30.630> slow<00:03:30.990> and<00:03:31.200> steady<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
out everywhere slow and steady and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.640 
out everywhere slow and steady and
straight<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.460> round<00:03:32.810> check<00:03:33.810> both<00:03:34.050> sides<00:03:34.110> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
straight and round check both sides of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.380 
straight and round check both sides of
your<00:03:34.710> wheel<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.340> your<00:03:35.550> bead<00:03:35.790> has<00:03:35.910> popped<00:03:36.270> out

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
your wheel that your bead has popped out

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.600 
your wheel that your bead has popped out
evenly<00:03:36.870> everywhere<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.980> could<00:03:38.220> be<00:03:38.370> that

strike

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.190 

okay<00:03:46.080> our<00:03:46.770> wheel<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.190> perfect<00:03:48.200> obviously

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
okay our wheel is perfect obviously

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.660 
okay our wheel is perfect obviously
close<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.890> your<00:03:50.040> valve<00:03:52.129> and<00:03:53.129> obviously<00:03:53.370> listen
