 Kassel calden its doors 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.599
 in many places, however, one noticed 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.969
 that here one or the other 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.860
 but must be done

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.260
 spoke of the airport Kassel 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.480
 calden would have a location with a future 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.760
 the infrastructure is different than at 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.760
 other airports already available 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.820

 a special day for the airport 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.019
 Hesse on the North Hesse I'm sure 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.909
 that will be the economic development 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.250
 still stronger for our region 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.710
 one of the most important aspects in this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.909
 day was the safety in and around that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.250
 airport grounds 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 responsible for this was among other things the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.970
 federal police under the direction of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.310
 sonja cook trained the first in march 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.140
 This year, the new tasks under 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.330
 also the air safety at the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.310
 had taken over the airport in calden 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 next to a little excitement in the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.479
 main building a journalist had his 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 bag men let stand by 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:48.149
 The opening goes smoothly across the stage 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:50.250
 the preparation of the first machine 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.259
 frankfurt am main comes up against 11 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.299
 10 o'clock on the new runway 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.430
 despite the awkward temperatures and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.020
 Thousands persecuted by an icy wind 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.810
 Visitors landing the first 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.729
 plane around 16 o'clock then starts 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.820
 even the first regular flight from 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.590
 kassel-calden to antalya 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.220
 Visitors in the location Kassel 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.660
 calden positively 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.880
 I like the program, I live 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.880
 kassel is about 10 kilometers away 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.170
 frankfurt or hanover or paderborn 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.700
 is often fully booked if you from there 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.320
 wanted to fly because it was just for kassel 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.630
 lava and now have something else 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.879
 closer and I hope that's what 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.349

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.730
 Half an hour is here in the

 Airport can go on vacation 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.860
 I am the positive 271 million euro 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.049
 the airport ultimately cost 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.909
 Now it's about these investments 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.970
 also profitable to use 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.420
 The number of employees from 50 in early 2012 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.700

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.129
 Airports are already about 700 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.959
