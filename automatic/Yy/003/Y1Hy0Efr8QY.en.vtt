what I recommend which is 3.6 gigs and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.130 
what I recommend which is 3.6 gigs and
the<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> developer

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
the first one is with all the developer
tools<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.340> developers

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
tools so this is for all the developers

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.330

ahead and click on create so now this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
ahead and click on create so now this
will<00:03:42.870> basically<00:03:43.019> create<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.860> will<00:03:44.130> take

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
will basically create it it will take

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.420 
will basically create it it will take
some<00:03:44.610> time<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> little<00:03:46.800> bit<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.920> movie

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
some time so with a little bit of movie

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.490 
some time so with a little bit of movie
editing<00:03:47.610> magic<00:03:48.030> I'm<00:03:48.450> going<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.050> skip<00:03:49.290> through

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
editing magic I'm going to skip through

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.670 
editing magic I'm going to skip through
this<00:03:49.650> process<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.630> as<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.050> can<00:03:52.170> see<00:03:52.230> it's

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
this process so as you can see it's

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.830 
this process so as you can see it's
nearly<00:03:53.040> done<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:55.760> our<00:03:56.760> virtual<00:03:57.030> disc<00:03:57.420> is

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
nearly done and our virtual disc is

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.940 
nearly done and our virtual disc is
nearly<00:03:58.200> created<00:03:59.630> just<00:04:00.630> 19<00:04:01.230> seconds<00:04:01.680> remaining

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
nearly created just 19 seconds remaining

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:11.259 
nearly created just 19 seconds remaining
and<00:04:05.450> should<00:04:06.450> be<00:04:06.630> done<00:04:06.930> any<00:04:08.269> time<00:04:09.269> now<00:04:10.250> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
and should be done any time now and

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.150 
and should be done any time now and
we're<00:04:12.269> done<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:13.290> just<00:04:13.590> basically<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.920> summary

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
we're done now just basically a summary

computer will restart now but it won't
obviously<00:06:37.270> because<00:06:37.509> you're<00:06:37.599> not<00:06:37.690> actually

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
obviously because you're not actually

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.590 
obviously because you're not actually
running<00:06:39.009> the<00:06:39.339> PC<00:06:40.029> is<00:06:40.240> only

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
running the PC is only

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.630 
running the PC is only
in<00:06:40.660> VirtualBox<00:06:41.350> so<00:06:41.800> it's<00:06:42.250> only<00:06:42.340> a<00:06:42.460> virtual

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
in VirtualBox so it's only a virtual

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.270 
in VirtualBox so it's only a virtual
machine<00:06:43.030> so<00:06:43.270> yeah<00:06:43.740> do<00:06:44.740> not<00:06:44.920> show<00:06:45.100> this<00:06:45.220> message
