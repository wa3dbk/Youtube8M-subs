 felt in the hand and does not allow 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.440
 device to fall out that is how would

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.790
 gigabyte of RAM is enough 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.860
 the processor is doing fine 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.570
 the program is not testing because 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.770
 programs work just fine 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.530
 let's say there are some 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.290
 benchmarks are also hardly interesting to anyone 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.450
 so I don't tell them like 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:57.150
 write comments if you like 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.150
 if you are interested i can do 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:08.160
 benchmark for example there in the video under 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:11.170
 system or processor power 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.170
 benchmark Well here such proposal 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.420

 the conductor loud speaker is he 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:47.440
 from behind here is such a device 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.870
 loud speaker doesn't hiss anything so 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.930
