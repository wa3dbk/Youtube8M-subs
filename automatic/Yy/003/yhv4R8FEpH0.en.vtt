00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.679
 hello to all guys welcome to this one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.119
 new computer museums episode this 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.730
 bet we go to see practically 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 how to pair the device the case 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.619
 you bought model vs brewster 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
 dash q9 pretty much what 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.059
 sell and marchini at 15 euros 20 euros and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 pair it so that you can 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 listen to music or receive 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.199
 call everything through ours 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.750
 hi fi system more than anything of mini 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.040
 bluetooth speakers then to do everything 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.409
 this then first of all ours 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.239
 device to be a device with 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.909
 bluetooth system 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.280
 no need to have for example must 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.430
 to be 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.629
 I don't know for example it must have system 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.549
 android symbian system ios system o 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.100
 one of those old cell phones 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.229
 because practically our speakers 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.300
 works practically with everyone 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.320
 the only thing you need to do is activate 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.090
 bluetooth 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 in this case a little touch will suffice 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.580
 the sky right on the screen is 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.610
 practically once we're ready 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.259
 our cash desk will automatically find the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.899
 device and will connect in 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.360
 automatic in the event that it is not so and that 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.340
 you are the first time you use 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.560
 this device to make 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.570
 the coupling with the device will be 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.450
 very simple indeed it will be enough to go up 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.909
 bluetooth search the device then 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.759
 in this case booster for this here 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.500
 lived earth we try to why not me two 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.149
 practically these houses because they are 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.149
 very useful and we pair it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.950
 obviously will give a little paranoia in 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.270
 in case you have the same device 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:04.930
 so let's change 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.930
 let's look now and see if it goes now 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.090
 now we are waiting for him to confirm 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:22.370
 because obviously it takes a second if 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:31.970
 this is not then and the other is 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:34.100
 then and the other ok perfect then a 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.140
 this point once it is received 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.450
 the message obviously sorry if me 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.110
 I'm stuck a second but being that 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.780
 no really 22 are turned on ie like 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.010
 you see the device is two 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.660
 so I had the problem 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.520
 practically that I could not find 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.750
 which rai one is already coupled with a 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.239
 another cell phone then gave me 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.920
 to the mistake of the wrong pin but it goes well a 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.280
 part that once does all this 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.260
 just go to the player in 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.840
 this case I have the reader here 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.150
 player and as you can see we will be ready 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.670
 practically to do more than approve 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.440
 else to see if it works indeed if 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.590
 we 're going to listen to a song 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.209
 any our case practically 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.209
 will receive audio 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.510
 how you see the audio works 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.100
 perfectly we can also 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.520
 lower the volume of the device 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520
 or 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.850
 melody 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.799
 I struggle I will pull 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.870
 I have certainly felt the knowledge 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.280
 now we also know why I was staying 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.680
 deafening the sun even if you have 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.209
 heard my voice as I spoke though 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.829
 oh well as you see is a great one 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.379
 device I recommend you 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.110
 because it is really very useful in 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.299
 travel or vacation where you don't have 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.189
 the possibility of listening to music 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.019
 through the boxes attached to the 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.819
 I thank you for having seen 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.299
 this video and see you next time 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.299
 bet
