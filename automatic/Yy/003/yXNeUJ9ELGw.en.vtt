00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Welcome dear 1000 ps fans 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.170
 to our test the a2 driver's license 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.019
 suitable motorcycles we are now at 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.019
 a very special concept 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.199
 a favorite concept of mine 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.210
 last years because it's so special 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.170
 mix between cruiser bike 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.659
 maybe a bit of a scooter 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.699
 the dct so the dual clutch transmission 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.229
 I do not just like the look 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.799
 but also how it goes with the 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.750
 pre-routed footrests lower 720 mm 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.350
 the whole thing is powered by one 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.690
 Two cylinder with 670 cubic and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.570
 that makes exactly 48 hp the motorcycle 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.030
 So you do not have to throttle but that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.770
 comes just as the box and 12 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.539
 license holder a owner 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.539
 of course that can drive 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.290
 Sorry lazy you like it too 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.170
 as me 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.840
 No, I'll tell you why 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.600
 for me the concept is yes it is 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.310
 independent is what funny honda 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.320
 This makes you think of it more and more often 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.860
 we have the well through that is one 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.690
 batmobil finest quality 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.790
 that goes in the direction of my opinion 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.290
 After Riesa was just for me personally 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.869
 Not everyone has to feel that way now 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.979
 not fish not meat that does not know 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.470
 exactly what I should do with it 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.780
 there is also this nc10 50 it is 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.160
 a real naked bike but that's just it 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.340
 cruiser with these advanced 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.900
 Footpegs I say for myself once 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.880
 personally, it does not like that right now 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.010
 to be correct but that means again 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.340
 that I believe for extremely many 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.050
 beginner and inexperienced a perfect 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.690
 Motorcycle is mainly through this 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.709
 extremely low seat height I am indeed 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.239
 the facts occasionally 1720 120mm function 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.459
 This madness is so low 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.190
 that sits even the smallest or the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.989
 smallest very cute may be great 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.790
 that is very important for 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.739
 Beginner and I understand that too 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.230
 that you come down with it the hocks 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.700
 and yes it offers that you then with 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.090
 your feet must act a bit 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.100
 because of the advanced footpegs is 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.170
 matter of taste I have to say the optics 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.569
 it also so own 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.020
 that is already at the time 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.340
 can please and the world always very much 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.250
 short and lets you the first in Vienna 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.230
 stinks the first private looks for me 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.700
 a bit after batman says what 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.380
 superman tongues yes for me from the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 optics look like many 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.690
 Traveling is really traveling out of the super 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.150
 Of course you have to get on board 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.860
 from like you then it fits the super 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.349
 even likes these pre-routed footpegs 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.420
 not so fond of it with the funding 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.890
 hindered and I believe with very short 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.610
 Shank has it not easy that one 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.230
 quite amazing for her art 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.390
 that it was great normally 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.190
 relatively difficult to drive his father 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.440
 in front of the name candles harder to drive 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 me is the whole is a think 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.510
 but if the far away from the front wheel 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.510
 but that is relatively no matter to the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.360
 calls that is simply the optics 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.160
 It's like the animal there 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.900
 what to take forwarded footrests 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.670
 I find now at less extreme 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.530
 a right the right job or 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.799
 the cruiser is partially correct 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.410
 So come with outstretched hocks 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.840
 which unfortunately is she sets very early 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.160
 so for us at least many 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.650
 normal consumers do not like that 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.100
 but concern us with the test diesel 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.180
 turn over as said was by the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.039
 probably 80 percent of the people 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.140
 does not apply but one must not 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.239
 Doing what I like so much is me 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.680
 have to privately have a cruiser 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.690
 Do not continue to talk about that now 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.250
 this even as it looks but there 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.090
 I sit down to the tracks 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.410
 Machine gun with the one with the cartridges 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.000
 when he pillowed with woronin 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.039
 I'm looking for one 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.470
 race track after so test where you are there 10 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.660
 12 motorcycles set by testing 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.479
 me on it and enjoy and the only one 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.070
 what bothers me is that I have to couple 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.060
 pimp and switch because that's annoying 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.950
 I have 1000 times on the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.169
 race track and I do not have to 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.240
 there is that the cdc gear on it 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.220
 dual-clutch transmission and there I have to 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.450
 I can not drive there and that 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.310
 What you like the thing 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.290
 I also like that too small 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.080
 though one always says the cruiser the 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.890
 must be over a liter or even more 1800 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.350
 gives euro and that has 60 70 and power 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.610
 you still have to sue so much fun 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.970
 we especially the boys probably 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.310
 not too loud but also diesel built 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.410
 and then that would be really what I could 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.940
 put me on it every day after david 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.420
 and simply enjoy relaxation 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.010
 I think I think it does not look that way 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.190
 handy as it is in reality 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.890
 But it just works just as big 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.800
 through the footpegs and the evil dull ones 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.590
 black and so it actually works 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.970
 harder to drive than it is in 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.530
 Reality is above all the profound one 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.680
 focus and it is not so 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.300
 easy on 227 kilo not everything through 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.180
 that 's also a lot with the dct 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.520
 gear weighs just under ten kilos more 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.950
 as a comparable model of the 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.480
 from the other nc models this too 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.410
 without the cd gives gibt's only 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.960
 the cdu certainly the drivability 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.570
 is perfect for a beginner 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.490
 Because Honda puts a lot of emphasis on it now 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.890
 very many beginners with different 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.380
 addressing models is just as well 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.570
 again something like that has something else 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.050
 nobody so that that is fix that something 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.030
 to have only with honda is that it just 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.550
 already a unique feature yes 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.160
 and because of that, I believe that 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.900
 there 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.030
 Also many people want that 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.670
 So I can imagine you 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.620
 yet final words zongo that 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.420
 quarters 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.630
 Well how do you look at and we already see one 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.220
 1000 anyone and every woman fall and 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.740
 that does not look like one either 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.150
 Allerwelts motorcycle that smoking so the 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.040
 there must be, I'm glad that 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.930
 Honda's size has something to it 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.880
 try and that makes me happy 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.440
 just like it or not 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.370
 it's nice that something like that in the world 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.370
 Thank you for watching 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.650
 if you liked it please give 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.990
 a thumbs up subscribes to ours 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.050
 channel and perhaps also looks 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.130
 the other videos of this series 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.610
 say goodbye 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.610
