I'm<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:25.170> good<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.859> actual<00:00:26.220> galaxy<00:00:26.970> s4

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
I'm not as good as the actual galaxy s4

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.900 
I'm not as good as the actual galaxy s4
but<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.510> still<00:00:27.720> pretty<00:00:28.170> good<00:00:28.490> not<00:00:29.490> too<00:00:29.699> bad

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
but it's still pretty good not too bad

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.260 
but it's still pretty good not too bad
and<00:00:30.420> let<00:00:31.109> me<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.289> ahead<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> show<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
multi window bar it is kind of like the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
multi window bar it is kind of like the
galaxy<00:00:36.480> s4<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> white<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> multi

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
galaxy s4 it is the white so the multi

some<00:01:23.610> people<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.360> told<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
some people have actually told me that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
some people have actually told me that
you<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.100> they've<00:01:26.340> lost<00:01:26.549> weight<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you know they've lost weight with it so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
you know they've lost weight with it so
that's<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> cool<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.740> does<00:01:28.979> come

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that's kind of cool this one does come

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.270 
that's kind of cool this one does come
with<00:01:29.369> its<00:01:29.579> own<00:01:29.700> kernel<00:01:30.740> it's<00:01:31.740> called<00:01:32.070> the

pretty<00:01:36.720> good<00:01:36.869> battery<00:01:37.229> life<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.590> far<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pretty good battery life so far and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
pretty good battery life so far and
pretty<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.880> performance<00:01:39.270> without<00:01:40.049> any

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pretty good performance without any

pretty good performance without any
overclocking<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> also<00:01:41.700> there's<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.119> polo

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
overclocking and also there's a polo

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.109 
overclocking and also there's a polo
configurator<00:01:43.850> which<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.479> use<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
configurator which you can use to you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
configurator which you can use to you
know<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.689> additional<00:01:49.200> stuff<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.159> know

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
know do additional stuff but you know

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.530 
know do additional stuff but you know
there's<00:01:50.460> no<00:01:50.610> overclocking<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.420> want

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
there's no overclocking if you want

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.910 
there's no overclocking if you want
overclocking<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.350> install<00:01:52.649> another

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
overclocking you can install another

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
overclocking you can install another
kernel<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.060> also<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.960> mess<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
kernel and also you can mess with the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
kernel and also you can mess with the
voltages<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.210> undervolt

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
voltages a little bit you can undervolt

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.050 
voltages a little bit you can undervolt
it<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.229> bring<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> slightly<00:01:58.799> down<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
it just bring it slightly down and you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
it just bring it slightly down and you
should<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.479> even<00:02:00.810> better<00:02:01.170> battery<00:02:01.799> life<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
should get even better battery life and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.209 
should get even better battery life and
also<00:02:02.490> bln<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.719> um<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:05.040> additional

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
also bln here um so some additional

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
also bln here um so some additional
stuff<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.119> mess<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:07.079> let<00:02:07.200> me<00:02:07.290> show
