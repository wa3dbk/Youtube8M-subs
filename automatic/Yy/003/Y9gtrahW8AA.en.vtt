00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.150 

so<00:00:01.319> here's<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:01.920> close-up<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.740> ribbon<00:00:04.740> cable

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
so here's a close-up of the ribbon cable

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.560 
so here's a close-up of the ribbon cable
and<00:00:06.029> if<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.779> look<00:00:07.319> closely<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.940> far<00:00:09.210> right

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
and if you look closely on the far right

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.589 
and if you look closely on the far right
side<00:00:09.599> are<00:00:10.260> three<00:00:10.920> really<00:00:11.370> thick<00:00:11.849> traces<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
side are three really thick traces and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.829 
side are three really thick traces and
those<00:00:13.200> belong<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.219> speakers<00:00:15.210> as<00:00:15.509> well<00:00:15.540> as

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
those belong to the speakers as well as

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
those belong to the speakers as well as
the<00:00:16.020> speaker<00:00:16.440> ground<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.010> there's<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.250> really

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the speaker ground so there's a really

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.960 
the speaker ground so there's a really
thick<00:00:17.730> one

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
thick one

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.320 
thick one
it<00:00:18.529> is<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.770> speaker<00:00:20.160> ground<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.210> other

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it is the speaker ground and the other

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.990 
it is the speaker ground and the other
two<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.980> left<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:23.550> speakers

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
two are the the left and right speakers

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400 
two are the the left and right speakers
and<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.240> can<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:24.539> trace<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.140> back<00:00:25.199> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and you can actually trace this back to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
and you can actually trace this back to
the<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:27.570> actual<00:00:27.930> speaker<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.070> solder<00:00:29.340> points

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the the actual speaker of solder points

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.630 
the the actual speaker of solder points
and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.470> starting<00:00:32.160> from<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.460> right

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and then from starting from the right

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.060 
and then from starting from the right
toe<00:00:32.910> toward<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> left<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:34.829> next<00:00:35.280> two<00:00:35.630> LOD

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
toe toward the left the next two LOD

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.720 
toe toward the left the next two LOD
traces<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.910> next<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.230> set<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.730> three

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
traces so next to the the set of three

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.150 
traces so next to the the set of three
dark<00:00:42.239> bands<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.890> next

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
dark bands that you see there the next

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.150 
dark bands that you see there the next
two<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.890> LCD<00:00:46.890> a2<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.700> LCD<00:00:48.149> c2<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.350> those

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
two are the LCD a2 and LCD c2 so those

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.840 
two are the LCD a2 and LCD c2 so those
are<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:52.110> five<00:00:52.440> traces<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
are the five traces that you're going to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.420 
are the five traces that you're going to
need<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.050> trim<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.710> cable<00:00:56.100> however

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
need so you can trim this cable however

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.479 
need so you can trim this cable however
you<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.780> cut<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> know

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you like but don't cut off you know

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.110 
you like but don't cut off you know
those<00:00:59.730> five<00:01:00.079> lines<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
those five lines there you do want it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.460 
those five lines there you do want it
relatively<00:01:04.110> thin<00:01:04.500> though<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> I'll<00:01:05.820> show<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
relatively thin though and I'll show you

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
relatively thin though and I'll show you
what<00:01:07.470> mine<00:01:07.680> looks<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:08.010> after<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> trimmed<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
what mine looks like after I trimmed it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.109 
what mine looks like after I trimmed it
at<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.750> second<00:01:15.470> okay<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> cable<00:01:18.000> are

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
at in a second okay so the cable are

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
at in a second okay so the cable are
trimmed<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> basically<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:21.799> if

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
trimmed a little bit and basically if if

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.370 
trimmed a little bit and basically if if
you<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.720> get<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> cable<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you do it right you can get the cable to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
you do it right you can get the cable to
come<00:01:25.530> behind<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.939> little<00:01:27.270> post<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
come behind here this little post and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.719 
come behind here this little post and
it's<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> sit<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it's going to sit in here and this is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.179 
it's going to sit in here and this is
where<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:32.479> old<00:01:33.479> game<00:01:33.900> cartridge<00:01:34.409> used<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> be

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
where the old game cartridge used to be

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.609 
where the old game cartridge used to be
the<00:01:35.340> slot<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.759> cartridge<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.500> can

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the slot one cartridge and as you can

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.640 
the slot one cartridge and as you can
see<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.310> could<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.500> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
see you could actually if you do this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.889 
see you could actually if you do this
really<00:01:41.159> cleverly<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.299> turn

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
really cleverly you can actually turn

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
really cleverly you can actually turn
this<00:01:43.079> upward<00:01:43.530> put<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:43.979> bit<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> tape<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this upward put a little bit of tape to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.170 
this upward put a little bit of tape to
protect<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.930> from<00:01:45.960> causing<00:01:46.740> shorts<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
protect it from causing shorts and you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910 
protect it from causing shorts and you
could<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.509> leave<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> original<00:01:49.320> card

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
could actually leave the original card

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.690 
could actually leave the original card
slot<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.920> course<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> means<00:01:53.399> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
slot one on but of course that means you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:04.630 
slot one on but of course that means you
there's<00:01:53.970> no<00:01:54.149> room<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.360> speakers

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.920 

and<00:02:05.640> let<00:02:05.790> me<00:02:05.910> just<00:02:05.940> show<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.510> other<00:02:06.660> side

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
and let me just show you the other side

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.690 
and let me just show you the other side
so<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.860> actually<00:02:08.430> tilted<00:02:09.150> it<00:02:09.270> down<00:02:09.540> a<00:02:10.700> little

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so I actually tilted it down a little

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.860 
so I actually tilted it down a little
bit<00:02:12.030> there<00:02:13.370> okay<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.210> again<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.690> just

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
bit there okay and this again it's just

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.850 
bit there okay and this again it's just
so<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.350> get<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.640> bin<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:19.200> come<00:02:19.410> just

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
so that we can get the bin to come just

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:33.530 
so that we can get the bin to come just
right

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.920 

okay<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.489> it's<00:02:35.790> almost<00:02:36.360> everything

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
okay so this is it's almost everything

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.580 
okay so this is it's almost everything
is<00:02:37.049> almost<00:02:37.200> done<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.569> decided<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.810> put<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
is almost done here I decided to put the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.520 
is almost done here I decided to put the
Wi-Fi<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.599> pulled<00:02:42.900> out<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.230> screen

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
Wi-Fi that I pulled out of the screen

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.619 
Wi-Fi that I pulled out of the screen
wrap<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> wires<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.209> then<00:02:45.299> finally

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
wrap the wires here and then finally

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.069 
wrap the wires here and then finally
connect<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:47.010> Wi-Fi<00:02:47.629> card

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
connect it to there the Wi-Fi card

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.289 
connect it to there the Wi-Fi card
I<00:02:49.110> guess<00:02:49.590> sits<00:02:50.190> down<00:02:50.370> here<00:02:52.790> here's<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.970> cable

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
I guess sits down here here's the cable

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.949 
I guess sits down here here's the cable
that<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.540> cut<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:58.879> slid<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.480> through

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
that we cut and I slid it up through

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.710 
that we cut and I slid it up through
between<00:03:01.879> basically<00:03:02.879> it's<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:03.180> here<00:03:03.510> so

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
between basically it's right here so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.849 
between basically it's right here so
it's<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.019> sit<00:03:04.470> between<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
it's going to sit between the

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.800 
it's going to sit between the
motherboard<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.549> this<00:03:05.730> post<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.390> post

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
motherboard and this post here that post

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.479 
motherboard and this post here that post
is<00:03:06.989> where<00:03:07.170> we<00:03:07.859> have<00:03:08.129> our<00:03:08.930> trigger<00:03:09.930> button<00:03:10.489> okay

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
is where we have our trigger button okay

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.629 
is where we have our trigger button okay
now<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.480> bent<00:03:12.750> over<00:03:13.139> toward<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.099> top<00:03:14.310> but

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
now it's bent over toward the top but

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.819 
now it's bent over toward the top but
once<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.150> fold<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.599> case<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.139> its<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.680> going

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
once we fold this case in its not going

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:24.259 
once we fold this case in its not going
to<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:17.069> bent<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.370> way<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:19.040> here's<00:03:23.269> your

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
to be bent that way and here's your

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.710 
to be bent that way and here's your
isn't<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:25.849> don't<00:03:26.849> want<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.209> bend<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.510> too

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
isn't it I don't want to bend this too

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.379 
isn't it I don't want to bend this too
much<00:03:27.900> but<00:03:28.769> that's<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.250> back<00:03:29.459> side<00:03:29.790> that's

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
much but that's the back side that's

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.589 
much but that's the back side that's
where<00:03:30.599> I<00:03:30.629> attach<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.489> resistor<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:33.299> over

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
where I attach the resistor and over

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.649 
where I attach the resistor and over
here<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.870> put<00:03:34.319> some<00:03:34.489> electrical<00:03:35.489> tape<00:03:35.659> over

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
here I put some electrical tape over

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.710 
here I put some electrical tape over
where<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> solder<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.560> speakers<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.519> also<00:03:39.480> put

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
where I solder the speakers I also put

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.740 
where I solder the speakers I also put
electrical<00:03:40.199> tape<00:03:40.410> over<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.669> resistor<00:03:42.329> itself

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
electrical tape over the resistor itself

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.689 
electrical tape over the resistor itself
and<00:03:43.349> again<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.889> to<00:03:43.980> prevent<00:03:44.190> any<00:03:44.370> sort<00:03:44.430> of

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
and again this is to prevent any sort of

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.300 
and again this is to prevent any sort of
short<00:03:45.319> over<00:03:46.319> here<00:03:46.620> what<00:03:46.799> I've<00:03:46.919> done<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
short over here what I've done with the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.409 
short over here what I've done with the
case<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:48.590> remove<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.269> used

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
case is I remove this and this this used

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.030 
case is I remove this and this this used
to<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> bar<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.199> goes<00:03:52.230> all<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.560> way<00:03:52.859> across

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
to be a bar that goes all the way across

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.030 
to be a bar that goes all the way across
here<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.329> bar<00:03:54.569> sits<00:03:55.139> actually<00:03:55.709> right

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
here and that bar sits actually right

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.000 
here and that bar sits actually right
here<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.750> remove<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.590> make<00:03:58.739> room<00:03:58.980> for

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
here so I remove that to make room for

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.360 
here so I remove that to make room for
the<00:03:59.310> Wi-Fi<00:03:59.699> I<00:04:00.000> also<00:04:00.840> cut<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:01.889> such<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.129> way

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
the Wi-Fi I also cut this in such a way

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.930 
the Wi-Fi I also cut this in such a way
that<00:04:02.579> they<00:04:03.090> actually<00:04:03.480> act<00:04:03.989> as<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.889> know<00:04:06.109> a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
that they actually act as you know a

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.099 
that they actually act as you know a
security<00:04:08.940> bar<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.449> speak<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
security bar so to speak so that the

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.470 
security bar so to speak so that the
speaker<00:04:10.530> over<00:04:10.739> here<00:04:11.489> doesn't<00:04:11.910> get<00:04:12.030> moved

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
speaker over here doesn't get moved

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.860 
speaker over here doesn't get moved
around<00:04:12.629> too<00:04:12.989> much<00:04:13.199> I<00:04:14.510> didn't<00:04:15.510> do<00:04:15.569> a<00:04:15.599> very<00:04:15.750> good

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
around too much I didn't do a very good

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.830 
around too much I didn't do a very good
job<00:04:16.019> with<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.530> drill<00:04:16.769> holes<00:04:17.060> too<00:04:18.060> for<00:04:18.720> that

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
job with the drill holes too for that

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.659 
job with the drill holes too for that
speaker<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.470> whatever<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.310> gets<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.639> job

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
speaker but whatever it gets the job

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.560 
speaker but whatever it gets the job
done<00:04:20.849> so<00:04:21.500> again<00:04:22.500> take<00:04:22.740> these<00:04:22.919> down<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.570> you

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
done so again take these down and you

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.719 
done so again take these down and you
want<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.810> try<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> put<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.919> foot<00:04:26.490> put<00:04:26.669> of

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
want to try to put this a foot put of

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.980 
want to try to put this a foot put of
the<00:04:26.789> speaker<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.270> such<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.510> way<00:04:27.690> that<00:04:27.720> it

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
the speaker in such a way that it

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.399 
the speaker in such a way that it
doesn't<00:04:28.789> you<00:04:29.789> know<00:04:29.909> sit<00:04:30.750> on<00:04:30.870> top<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.110> this

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
doesn't you know sit on top of this

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.219 
doesn't you know sit on top of this
because<00:04:31.889> there's<00:04:32.070> not<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.340> much<00:04:32.490> clearance

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
because there's not that much clearance

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.140 
because there's not that much clearance
all<00:04:34.229> right<00:04:34.610> when<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:35.699> fold<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.090> over<00:04:38.150> sorry

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
all right when we fold this over sorry

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.240 
all right when we fold this over sorry
about<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.419> lighting<00:04:39.630> there<00:04:40.010> but<00:04:41.010> when<00:04:41.159> we

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
about the lighting there but when we

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.900 
about the lighting there but when we
fold<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.669> over

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.800 

okay<00:04:45.910> everything<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.780> going<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:46.960> sit<00:04:47.200> flat<00:04:47.470> and

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
okay everything is going to sit flat and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.490 
okay everything is going to sit flat and
we<00:04:49.810> will<00:04:49.990> have<00:04:50.200> more<00:04:50.740> than<00:04:50.860> enough<00:04:50.980> clearance

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
we will have more than enough clearance

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:02.960 
we will have more than enough clearance
let<00:04:53.500> me<00:04:53.560> see<00:04:53.710> if<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.830> can<00:04:53.950> grab<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.130> flashlight

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.380 

there<00:05:03.970> we<00:05:04.150> go<00:05:04.620> so<00:05:05.620> once<00:05:05.890> we<00:05:06.300> close<00:05:07.300> this<00:05:09.390> that

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
there we go so once we close this that

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.690 
there we go so once we close this that
cable<00:05:10.750> there<00:05:10.900> will<00:05:11.020> lie<00:05:11.170> flat<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.800> we<00:05:12.580> won't

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
cable there will lie flat and we won't

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.260 
cable there will lie flat and we won't
have<00:05:12.910> any<00:05:13.090> issues<00:05:16.200> okay<00:05:17.340> so<00:05:18.340> when<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.000> close

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
have any issues okay so when you close

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.450 
have any issues okay so when you close
this<00:05:19.540> let<00:05:20.320> me<00:05:20.350> turn<00:05:20.590> off<00:05:20.620> my<00:05:20.890> flashlight<00:05:21.370> just

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.860 

make<00:05:27.460> sure<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.760> there's<00:05:28.060> plenty<00:05:28.360> of

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
make sure that there's plenty of

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.470 
make sure that there's plenty of
clearance<00:05:29.230> so<00:05:30.040> I<00:05:30.070> would<00:05:30.460> do<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.610> dry<00:05:31.180> fit

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
clearance so I would do a dry fit

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.470 
clearance so I would do a dry fit
without<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.230> trigger<00:05:32.470> buttons<00:05:32.800> first<00:05:33.480> just

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
without the trigger buttons first just

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.560 
without the trigger buttons first just
to<00:05:34.600> see<00:05:34.780> if<00:05:34.900> everything<00:05:35.320> will<00:05:35.410> fit<00:05:35.680> so<00:05:36.570> again

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
to see if everything will fit so again

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:44.970 
to see if everything will fit so again
there's<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:38.080> speaker<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:43.440> it's<00:05:44.440> really<00:05:44.770> hard

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
there's the speaker and it's really hard

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.250 
there's the speaker and it's really hard
to<00:05:45.100> do<00:05:45.220> this<00:05:45.340> with<00:05:45.550> one<00:05:45.730> hand<00:05:45.760> but<00:05:46.260> obviously

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
to do this with one hand but obviously

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.140 
to do this with one hand but obviously
it<00:05:47.380> does<00:05:47.590> fit<00:05:47.830> because<00:05:48.100> it<00:05:48.580> was<00:05:48.760> fitting

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
it does fit because it was fitting

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.680 
it does fit because it was fitting
before<00:05:49.540> I<00:05:49.780> took<00:05:50.650> this<00:05:50.950> apart<00:05:51.280> so<00:05:54.300> here's<00:05:55.300> a

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
before I took this apart so here's a

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:11.060 
before I took this apart so here's a
slightly<00:05:56.440> different<00:05:57.040> view<00:05:57.520> of<00:05:57.670> that<00:05:57.790> cable

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.770 

here<00:06:12.070> we<00:06:12.190> go

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.790 

okay<00:06:18.440> so<00:06:18.500> that's<00:06:18.830> how<00:06:19.040> it's<00:06:19.190> going<00:06:19.340> to<00:06:19.460> say

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
okay so that's how it's going to say

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:30.780 
okay so that's how it's going to say
here's<00:06:21.800> a<00:06:22.300> another<00:06:23.300> view<00:06:23.840> on<00:06:24.620> the<00:06:24.770> inside<00:06:29.200> okay

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
here's a another view on the inside okay

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.610 
here's a another view on the inside okay
so<00:06:31.790> I<00:06:31.820> hope<00:06:31.970> you<00:06:32.120> get<00:06:32.240> an<00:06:32.360> idea<00:06:32.600> of<00:06:32.750> how<00:06:32.930> to<00:06:32.990> put

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
so I hope you get an idea of how to put

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:45.679 
so I hope you get an idea of how to put
everything<00:06:33.889> together

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:52.449 

okay<00:06:46.589> everything<00:06:47.369> should<00:06:47.549> be<00:06:47.610> nice<00:06:47.879> and<00:06:48.149> flush

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:52.459 

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:56.689 

right<00:06:53.459> now<00:06:54.379> this<00:06:55.379> is<00:06:55.559> not<00:06:55.589> flush<00:06:56.039> obviously

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 
right now this is not flush obviously

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.389 
right now this is not flush obviously
but<00:06:57.289> that's<00:06:58.289> because<00:06:58.769> I<00:06:58.799> don't<00:06:58.919> have<00:06:59.099> any<00:06:59.309> of

00:06:59.389 --> 00:06:59.399 
but that's because I don't have any of

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:03.049 
but that's because I don't have any of
the<00:06:59.459> screws<00:07:00.229> and<00:07:01.229> I'm<00:07:02.159> not<00:07:02.339> doing<00:07:02.579> putting<00:07:02.909> any

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:03.059 
the screws and I'm not doing putting any

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:08.409 
the screws and I'm not doing putting any
pressure<00:07:03.149> on<00:07:04.369> on<00:07:05.369> this<00:07:06.209> I'm<00:07:06.449> just<00:07:06.689> basically

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
pressure on on this I'm just basically

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.569 
pressure on on this I'm just basically
you<00:07:09.419> know<00:07:09.559> putting<00:07:10.559> enough<00:07:10.829> pressure<00:07:11.069> to<00:07:11.219> sort

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:11.579 
you know putting enough pressure to sort

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.789 
you know putting enough pressure to sort
of<00:07:11.699> represent<00:07:12.149> how<00:07:12.239> much<00:07:12.419> the<00:07:13.229> screws<00:07:13.559> would

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:13.799 
of represent how much the screws would

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:16.850 
of represent how much the screws would
pull<00:07:14.789> these<00:07:14.969> two<00:07:15.149> together<00:07:15.299> so<00:07:16.229> it<00:07:16.469> should<00:07:16.619> lay

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
pull these two together so it should lay

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.169 
pull these two together so it should lay
completely<00:07:17.509> flush<00:07:18.709> otherwise<00:07:19.759> you've<00:07:20.759> done

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:21.179 
completely flush otherwise you've done

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:24.290 
completely flush otherwise you've done
something<00:07:21.569> wrong<00:07:21.719> and<00:07:22.759> that's<00:07:23.759> the<00:07:23.969> beauty<00:07:24.269> of

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
something wrong and that's the beauty of

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.350 
something wrong and that's the beauty of
having<00:07:24.419> a<00:07:24.839> working<00:07:25.619> cables<00:07:26.219> because<00:07:26.459> you

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
having a working cables because you

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.219 
having a working cables because you
don't<00:07:27.539> actually<00:07:27.749> have<00:07:28.110> to<00:07:28.579> worry<00:07:29.579> about<00:07:30.269> too

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
don't actually have to worry about too

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.829 
don't actually have to worry about too
much<00:07:31.379> soldering<00:07:31.829> and<00:07:32.249> everything<00:07:33.239> will<00:07:33.479> fit

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:33.839 
much soldering and everything will fit

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:37.279 
much soldering and everything will fit
into<00:07:33.989> place<00:07:34.169> just<00:07:34.559> right<00:07:35.539> so<00:07:36.539> I'll<00:07:36.989> close<00:07:37.199> this
