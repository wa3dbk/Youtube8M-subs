set down to low V distance is at its

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.930 
set down to low V distance is at its
lowest<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.450> five<00:00:33.899> field<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.070> view<00:00:35.219> I've<00:00:35.430> set<00:00:35.760> up

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
lowest of five field of view I've set up

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.979 
lowest of five field of view I've set up
to<00:00:36.719> 75<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:38.030> which<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.059> above<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> default

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
to 75 because which is above the default

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.590 
to 75 because which is above the default
of<00:00:40.110> 60<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.640> because<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.360> low

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
of 60 and this is because my low

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.750 
of 60 and this is because my low
resolution<00:00:43.730> of<00:00:44.750> caused<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.020> game<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.760> put

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
resolution of caused the game to put

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540 
resolution of caused the game to put
some<00:00:48.090> things<00:00:48.329> off-screen<00:00:49.070> like<00:00:50.070> things<00:00:50.340> like

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
some things off-screen like things like

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
some things off-screen like things like
what<00:00:51.090> melee<00:00:51.329> weapon<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.899> holding<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
what melee weapon I was holding I just I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
what melee weapon I was holding I just I
couldn't<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> had<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> set<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
couldn't see it so I had to set it up to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.029 
couldn't see it so I had to set it up to

75 LOD distance is set at 25 which is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.660 
75 LOD distance is set at 25 which is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
is the lowest resolution that I can go

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
is the lowest resolution that I can go
to<00:01:08.540> I'm<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.720> sure<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.409> into<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to I'm not sure if you can go into the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
to I'm not sure if you can go into the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
game files and edit some file to go even

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.749 
game files and edit some file to go even
lower<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.490> by<00:01:14.610> default<00:01:15.560> 1024<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.770> 768<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
lower but just by default 1024 by 768 is

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.510 
lower but just by default 1024 by 768 is
the<00:01:18.210> lowest<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.110> I've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> full

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the lowest that I can go I've got a full

the lowest that I can go I've got a full
screen<00:01:20.790> enabled<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.750> mean<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> can

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
switch it to windowed mode and I'd get

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.760 
switch it to windowed mode and I'd get
higher<00:01:26.220> frame<00:01:26.610> rates<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.650> just

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
higher frame rates but just I I just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.429

because<00:02:02.549> I've<00:02:02.729> only<00:02:02.850> played<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.840> half

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
because I've only played for about half

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.639 
because I've only played for about half
an<00:02:04.409> hour<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.719> find<00:02:06.719> these<00:02:06.930> settings<00:02:07.320> scary

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
an hour so I I find these settings scary

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.100 
an hour so I I find these settings scary
to<00:02:08.099> me<00:02:08.190> because<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.610> don't<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:09.450> do

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
to me because I don't know what they do

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710 
to me because I don't know what they do
maybe<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> few<00:02:11.310> hours

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
maybe in a few hours

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.080 
maybe in a few hours
I'll<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.230> used<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> game<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.730> change

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I'll get used to the game I can change

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.370 
I'll get used to the game I can change
those<00:02:15.240> settings<00:02:15.390> around<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:15.990> for<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.290> I'm

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
those settings around but for now I'm

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.980 
those settings around but for now I'm
gonna<00:02:16.530> keep<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.860> default<00:02:17.840> okay

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990

it's funded me in a forest area which is
good<00:02:23.070> because<00:02:23.510> all<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.780> trees<00:02:25.580> being<00:02:26.580> spawned

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
good because all the trees being spawned

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.560 
good because all the trees being spawned
will<00:02:27.720> allow<00:02:27.930> me<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.140> show<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.880> good<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.180> good

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
example of framerate

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.750 
example of framerate
I'm<00:02:33.990> gonna<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.260> up<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.560> car<00:02:34.800> here<00:02:35.040> maybe

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
see if I have a weapon now you'll notice

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.460 
see if I have a weapon now you'll notice
up<00:02:38.820> on<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> top<00:02:39.210> right<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.690> framerate<00:02:40.080> again

up on the top right the framerate again

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.620 
up on the top right the framerate again
is<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.890> mean<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.970> pretty<00:02:42.150> high<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> mean

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
is I mean it's it's pretty high I mean

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.010 
is I mean it's it's pretty high I mean
it's<00:02:42.750> 50<00:02:43.520> 50<00:02:44.520> frames<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.820> second<00:02:45.210> down<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.570> high

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
it's 50 50 frames a second down to high

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.460 
it's 50 50 frames a second down to high
40s<00:02:46.850> which<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.970> good<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:49.290> good

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
40s which is good it's it's really good

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.290 
40s which is good it's it's really good
I<00:02:49.680> mean<00:02:49.860> especially<00:02:50.160> considering<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.270> a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
I mean especially considering this is a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.200 
I mean especially considering this is a
surface<00:02:51.840> pro<00:02:52.170> which<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.220> mean<00:02:53.490> let's<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:53.790> honest

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
surface pro which I mean let's be honest

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.400 
surface pro which I mean let's be honest
here<00:02:54.270> it's<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.780> gaming<00:02:55.350> device<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:56.400> um

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
here it's not a gaming device it's um

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.320 
here it's not a gaming device it's um
definitely<00:02:58.410> got<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> priority<00:02:59.160> on<00:02:59.330> being

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
definitely got a priority on being

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.300 
definitely got a priority on being
portable<00:03:01.200> more<00:03:01.980> than<00:03:02.190> anything<00:03:02.340> else<00:03:02.610> so

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
portable more than anything else so

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.850 
portable more than anything else so
anything<00:03:05.310> above<00:03:05.370> 30<00:03:05.760> frames<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.360> second<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.380> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
anything above 30 frames a second on a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.360 
anything above 30 frames a second on a
surface<00:03:08.460> pro<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.880> really<00:03:09.330> good<00:03:10.220> going<00:03:11.220> into

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
surface pro is really good going into

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.750 
surface pro is really good going into
the<00:03:11.580> forest<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.330> more<00:03:12.540> trees<00:03:12.930> spawning

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
the forest here with more trees spawning

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.060 
the forest here with more trees spawning
causes<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> framerate<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.360> go<00:03:15.510> lower<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.470> dips

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
causes the framerate to go lower it dips

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.790 
causes the framerate to go lower it dips
into<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.490> 30s<00:03:18.170> occasionally<00:03:19.170> it'll<00:03:19.380> dip<00:03:19.620> into

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
into the 30s occasionally it'll dip into

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.880 
into the 30s occasionally it'll dip into
the<00:03:20.040> 20s<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:21.480> you'll<00:03:21.870> also<00:03:22.020> see<00:03:22.170> some<00:03:22.320> stutter

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
the 20s and you'll also see some stutter

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.010 
the 20s and you'll also see some stutter
-<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.370> you're<00:03:23.550> running<00:03:23.760> around<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.480> lot<00:03:24.510> and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
- if you're running around a lot and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.290 
- if you're running around a lot and
you're<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.710> causing<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.550> lot<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.850> map<00:03:27.060> -

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
you're just causing a lot of the map -

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.170 
you're just causing a lot of the map -
or<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:28.140> lot<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.620> world<00:03:28.950> objects<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.640> spawn

or a lot of the world objects to spawn

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.780 
or a lot of the world objects to spawn
you'll<00:03:30.960> notice<00:03:31.170> some<00:03:31.290> stutter<00:03:31.770> but<00:03:32.400> right<00:03:32.640> now

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
you'll notice some stutter but right now

you'll notice some stutter but right now
you'll<00:03:33.030> see<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.800> also<00:03:34.920> hear<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
you'll see that you can also hear I

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
getting greener which I know means I

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.720 
getting greener which I know means I
will<00:03:41.430> die<00:03:41.610> if<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.209> walk<00:03:42.390> any<00:03:42.600> further<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.990> way

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.560 
will die if I walk any further that way
now<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.760> know<00:03:44.850> if<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.090> can<00:03:45.209> tell<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.450> video

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
but the fans on the surface Pro are

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.690 
but the fans on the surface Pro are
getting<00:03:47.730> louder<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.300> lot<00:03:48.750> louder<00:03:49.430> louder<00:03:50.430> than

getting louder a lot louder louder than

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.840 
getting louder a lot louder louder than
they<00:03:51.120> would<00:03:51.300> be<00:03:51.450> under<00:03:51.570> normal<00:03:52.050> usage<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:53.340> mean

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
they would be under normal usage I mean

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.070 
they would be under normal usage I mean
that's<00:03:54.000> something<00:03:54.240> that<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.630> would<00:03:54.750> be<00:03:54.900> used

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
that's something that you would be used

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
that the frame rate is pretty high right

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.260 
that the frame rate is pretty high right
now<00:04:22.380> even<00:04:22.800> during<00:04:22.919> combat<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:23.760> that's<00:04:24.000> it's

with<00:04:52.260> all<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.710> settings<00:04:53.070> set<00:04:53.310> down<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.639> low<00:04:53.789> is

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
with all the settings set down to low is

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.650 
with all the settings set down to low is
that<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.479> trees<00:04:54.900> at<00:04:55.650> this<00:04:56.010> distance<00:04:56.460> are<00:04:56.729> 2d

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
that the trees at this distance are 2d

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.010 
that the trees at this distance are 2d
models<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:59.010> once<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.280> get<00:04:59.430> up<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.580> around<00:05:00.330> you

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
models but once you get up to around you

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.950 
models but once you get up to around you
know<00:05:01.139> 30<00:05:01.440> feet<00:05:01.770> within<00:05:02.250> them<00:05:02.750> they'll<00:05:03.750> turn

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
know 30 feet within them they'll turn

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.810 
know 30 feet within them they'll turn
into<00:05:04.110> 3d<00:05:04.530> models<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.220> mean<00:05:05.370> that's<00:05:05.520> because

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
into 3d models and I mean that's because

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.409 
into 3d models and I mean that's because
I<00:05:05.850> just<00:05:06.180> set<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.930> LOD<00:05:07.410> distance<00:05:08.400> down<00:05:08.789> to<00:05:08.820> 25%

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
I just set the LOD distance down to 25%

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.260 
I just set the LOD distance down to 25%
but<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:11.310> know<00:05:11.430> that's<00:05:11.760> just<00:05:11.910> something<00:05:12.030> I

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
but you know that's just something I

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.719 
but you know that's just something I
wanted<00:05:12.510> to<00:05:12.570> point<00:05:12.720> out<00:05:13.010> you<00:05:14.010> just<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.490> bad

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
wanted to point out you just this is bad

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.510 
wanted to point out you just this is bad
again<00:05:14.940> because<00:05:15.330> I've<00:05:15.449> set<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.340> view<00:05:17.340> distance

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
again because I've set the view distance

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.719 
again because I've set the view distance
to<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.270> lowest<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:19.289> can<00:05:19.440> go<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.919> also<00:05:20.639> the

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
to the lowest it can go and also the

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.370 
to the lowest it can go and also the
lighting<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:21.210> bad<00:05:21.240> because<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:21.870> disabled<00:05:22.289> the

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
lighting is bad because I disabled the

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.950 
lighting is bad because I disabled the
shadows<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.180> although<00:05:24.180> all<00:05:24.419> of<00:05:24.450> these<00:05:24.660> things

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
shadows so although all of these things

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.050 
shadows so although all of these things
are<00:05:25.139> just<00:05:25.550> sacrifices<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.669> gotta<00:05:26.880> have<00:05:27.000> to

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
the video it's the frame rate is is

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.400 
the video it's the frame rate is is
bearable<00:06:11.160> it's<00:06:11.490> it's<00:06:12.120> not<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.750> best<00:06:13.139> you<00:06:13.289> can

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
bluntly they're bad but again if those

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.790 
bluntly they're bad but again if those
aren't<00:06:19.590> your<00:06:19.680> top<00:06:19.919> priority<00:06:20.520> then<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:21.539> know

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
aren't your top priority then you know

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.170 
aren't your top priority then you know
you<00:06:22.800> know<00:06:22.860> you'll<00:06:23.340> have<00:06:23.520> fun<00:06:23.700> with<00:06:23.760> it<00:06:24.000> and

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
you know you'll have fun with it and

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.370 
you know you'll have fun with it and
you'll<00:06:24.630> be<00:06:24.780> able<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:24.990> play<00:06:25.140> it<00:06:25.260> on<00:06:25.349> your

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
you'll be able to play it on your

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.580 
you'll be able to play it on your
surface<00:06:25.680> pro<00:06:26.060> and

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
surface pro and

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.930 
surface pro and
since<00:06:27.830> I'm<00:06:27.980> pretty<00:06:28.160> sure<00:06:28.400> at<00:06:28.610> least<00:06:28.760> with<00:06:28.910> a

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
since I'm pretty sure at least with a

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.240 
since I'm pretty sure at least with a
second-generation<00:06:29.420> surface<00:06:30.200> pro<00:06:30.440> because

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
second-generation surface pro because

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.150 
second-generation surface pro because
the<00:06:31.460> first<00:06:31.670> a<00:06:31.790> second<00:06:32.180> have<00:06:32.600> similar

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
the first a second have similar

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.100 
the first a second have similar
specifications<00:06:34.160> I'm<00:06:35.090> sure<00:06:35.330> on<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.750> second

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
specifications I'm sure on the second

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.340 
specifications I'm sure on the second
one<00:06:36.200> the<00:06:36.380> game<00:06:36.590> would<00:06:36.800> perform<00:06:37.360> as<00:06:38.360> well<00:06:39.050> as

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
one the game would perform as well as

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.420 
one the game would perform as well as
this<00:06:39.680> if<00:06:39.920> not<00:06:40.070> better

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
this if not better

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.530 
this if not better
and<00:06:40.610> on<00:06:41.540> the<00:06:41.750> third<00:06:41.780> I'm<00:06:42.200> not<00:06:42.350> sure<00:06:42.590> but<00:06:42.890> I<00:06:43.100> mean

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
and on the third I'm not sure but I mean

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.970 
and on the third I'm not sure but I mean
maybe<00:06:44.540> the<00:06:44.690> same<00:06:44.930> if<00:06:45.140> not<00:06:45.260> better<00:06:45.320> I<00:06:45.710> mean<00:06:45.860> this

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
maybe the same if not better I mean this

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.500 
maybe the same if not better I mean this
just<00:06:46.220> is<00:06:46.460> I<00:06:47.180> think<00:06:47.240> it's<00:06:47.510> safe<00:06:47.660> to<00:06:47.690> assume<00:06:47.900> that

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
just is I think it's safe to assume that

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.140 
just is I think it's safe to assume that
so<00:06:50.510> I<00:06:50.860> yeah<00:06:51.860> this<00:06:52.280> video<00:06:52.550> is<00:06:52.700> just<00:06:52.730> meant<00:06:53.060> to

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
so I yeah this video is just meant to

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.790 
so I yeah this video is just meant to
show<00:06:53.360> you<00:06:53.420> how<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:53.810> game<00:06:54.080> performs<00:06:54.650> on<00:06:54.770> the

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
show you how the game performs on the

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.120 
show you how the game performs on the
surface<00:06:55.220> pro<00:06:55.280> and<00:06:56.560> I'll<00:06:57.560> continue<00:06:57.770> to<00:06:58.010> make

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
surface pro and I'll continue to make

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.830 
surface pro and I'll continue to make
video<00:06:58.550> I'll<00:06:58.730> continue<00:06:59.000> to<00:06:59.240> make<00:06:59.390> videos<00:06:59.750> like

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
video I'll continue to make videos like
