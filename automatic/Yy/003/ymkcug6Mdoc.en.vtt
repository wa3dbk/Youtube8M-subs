hey<00:00:06.660> guys<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.200> video<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.400> not<00:00:08.460> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.150> be<00:00:09.300> a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
hey guys this video is not going to be a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.180 
hey guys this video is not going to be a
rom<00:00:09.630> review<00:00:09.990> or<00:00:10.139> anything<00:00:10.530> it's<00:00:10.740> just<00:00:10.800> going

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
rom review or anything it's just going

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
rom review or anything it's just going
to<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:12.500> demo<00:00:13.500> maybe<00:00:14.250> if<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.700> will<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.230> a<00:00:16.230> new

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
to be a demo maybe if you will of a new

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.019 
to be a demo maybe if you will of a new
feature<00:00:16.800> which<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:17.550> found<00:00:17.820> interesting

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
feature which I really found interesting

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.099 
feature which I really found interesting
now<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:19.020> called<00:00:19.289> peek<00:00:20.180> from<00:00:21.180> paragon<00:00:21.840> droid

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
now it's called peek from paragon droid

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.910 
now it's called peek from paragon droid
guys<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.650> yeah<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.730> works<00:00:24.180> kind<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.350> similar<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
guys so yeah it works kind of similar to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.400 
guys so yeah it works kind of similar to
active<00:00:26.550> display<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> fact<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.170> will

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
active display in the fact that it will

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710 
active display in the fact that it will
show<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.769> guys<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.510> notification<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.689> your

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
show you guys the notification on your

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.799 
show you guys the notification on your
display<00:00:31.219> when<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:32.969> looking<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
display when you are looking at it so

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810 
display when you are looking at it so
that's<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.230> great<00:00:34.649> feature<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that's really great feature but the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.180 
that's really great feature but the
problem<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.360> active<00:00:37.050> display<00:00:37.350> mainly<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
problem with active display mainly is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.299 
problem with active display mainly is
that<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.790> always<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.100> sensor<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that it is always on the sensor is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.119 
that it is always on the sensor is
always<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.480> may<00:00:43.079> lead<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.710> battery

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
always on so it may lead to battery

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.709 
always on so it may lead to battery
drain<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:44.460> something<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.360> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
drain or something like that but this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.290 
drain or something like that but this
one<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.379> more<00:00:46.860> refined<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:47.610> which

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
one is actually more refined way which

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.880 
one is actually more refined way which
some<00:00:48.840> people<00:00:48.960> may<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.340> now<00:00:50.870> with<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.230> thing

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
some people may like now with this thing

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.549 
some people may like now with this thing
it's<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.550> great<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.000> let<00:00:54.719> me<00:00:54.750> tell<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it's really great now let me tell you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.380 
it's really great now let me tell you
guys<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.820> enable<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
guys what it is now if you enable the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
guys what it is now if you enable the
peak<00:00:57.570> function<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> when<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
peak function and when you get a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.389 
peak function and when you get a
notification<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> notification<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
notification you get a notification and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.090 
notification you get a notification and
within<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.180> 10<00:01:03.570> seconds<00:01:04.229> after<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
within that 10 seconds after you get a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.510 
within that 10 seconds after you get a
notification<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.570> phone<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.500> listen<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
notification the phone will listen to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.600 
notification the phone will listen to
two<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.180> its<00:01:09.390> sensors<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.200> gyro<00:01:11.040> sensor<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
two of its sensors the gyro sensor the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.840 
two of its sensors the gyro sensor the
accelerometer<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.490> notification<00:01:14.490> while

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
accelerometer and the notification while

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
accelerometer and the notification while
the<00:01:15.030> proximity<00:01:15.479> sensor<00:01:15.720> both<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the proximity sensor both of them so it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.480 
the proximity sensor both of them so it
will<00:01:17.729> listen<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.560> 10<00:01:19.560> seconds<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.130> both<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
will listen for 10 seconds to both of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.539 
will listen for 10 seconds to both of
them<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.710> someone<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> other<00:01:23.040> gives

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
them and when someone or the other gives

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.580 
them and when someone or the other gives
a<00:01:23.790> signal<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.360> something<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:24.900> we'll

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
a signal of something which we'll

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.609 
a signal of something which we'll
discuss<00:01:25.740> later<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:27.090> other<00:01:27.450> sensor<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> if

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
discuss later the other sensor if you if

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.050 
discuss later the other sensor if you if
the<00:01:28.920> phone<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.549> pocket<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the phone is in your pocket the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.330 
the phone is in your pocket the
proximity<00:01:30.570> sensor<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:31.259> say<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.009> is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
proximity sensor will say that it is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.090 
proximity sensor will say that it is
being<00:01:32.610> covered<00:01:32.850> by<00:01:33.060> something<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.530> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
being covered by something so in that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.910 
being covered by something so in that
case<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> phone<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:36.900> listen<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
case the the phone will not listen to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.420 
case the the phone will not listen to
the<00:01:38.040> gyro<00:01:38.430> sensor<00:01:38.909> anymore<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.950> then<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the gyro sensor anymore and then if you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
the gyro sensor anymore and then if you
pull<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.850> phone<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> pocket<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pull your phone out of the pocket the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130 
pull your phone out of the pocket the
pocket<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:44.159> sensor<00:01:44.579> data<00:01:45.060> changes<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pocket the sensor data changes and it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.380 
pocket the sensor data changes and it
will<00:01:46.290> display<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> notification<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
will display the notification so that is

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.050 
will display the notification so that is
really<00:01:48.420> cool<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.369> other<00:01:50.490> case<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
really cool now in the other case if the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
really cool now in the other case if the
phone<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.450> lying<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.439> table<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.009> somewhere

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
phone is lying in a table or somewhere

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.490 
phone is lying in a table or somewhere
like<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.649> you're<00:01:55.649> well<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.500> proximity

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
like that and you're well the proximity

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
like that and you're well the proximity
sensor<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:59.040> wide<00:01:59.250> open<00:01:59.280> it<00:02:00.000> will<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.630> listen

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
sensor is wide open it will not listen

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
sensor is wide open it will not listen
to<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.290> because<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.799> gyros<00:02:02.250> Deepak<00:02:02.969> unity

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to that because the gyros Deepak unity

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
to that because the gyros Deepak unity
sensor<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.750> working<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> will<00:02:04.890> not

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
sensor is not working so it will not

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
sensor is not working so it will not
listen<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.149> only<00:02:06.299> listen<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
listen to that it will only listen to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.290 
listen to that it will only listen to
the<00:02:06.960> gyro<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> will<00:02:07.890> actually<00:02:08.160> save<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> lot

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the gyro so it will actually save a lot

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.760 
the gyro so it will actually save a lot
of<00:02:09.360> battery<00:02:09.690> life<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.080> that's<00:02:10.259> really<00:02:10.590> great

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
