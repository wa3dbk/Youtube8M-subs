in<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.880> lesson<00:00:30.090> we're<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.630> playing

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
in this lesson we're going to be playing

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
in this lesson we're going to be playing
very<00:00:31.260> few<00:00:31.529> notes<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.009> we're<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> let

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
very few notes and we're going to let

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.810 
very few notes and we're going to let
the<00:00:32.790> dotted<00:00:33.660> 8th<00:00:33.809> tempo<00:00:34.469> delay<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:35.489> most<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the dotted 8th tempo delay do most of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
the dotted 8th tempo delay do most of
the<00:00:35.910> work<00:00:36.200> even<00:00:37.200> though<00:00:37.290> you're<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.590> playing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the work even though you're not playing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.479 
the work even though you're not playing
many<00:00:38.670> notes<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.809> lick<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:41.100> very

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
many notes in a lick like this it's very

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.709 
many notes in a lick like this it's very
difficult<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.329> playing<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
difficult when you're playing with a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.069 
difficult when you're playing with a
track<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:44.010> pick<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> notes<00:00:45.329> right<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
track to pick the notes right and to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.630 
track to pick the notes right and to
stay<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> pocket<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> delay

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
stay in the pocket so that the delay

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.959 
stay in the pocket so that the delay
remains<00:00:48.200> sounding<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.379> time<00:00:49.670> because<00:00:50.670> one

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
remains sounding in time because one

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.720 
remains sounding in time because one
late<00:00:51.239> note<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:52.410> rushed<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:53.430> phrase

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
late note or one rushed little phrase

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.959 
late note or one rushed little phrase
and<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.050> deal<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and you have to deal with that as the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
and you have to deal with that as the
delay<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.300> repeating<00:00:57.750> ok<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.480> have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> dotted

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
delay is repeating ok so I have a dotted

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.609 
delay is repeating ok so I have a dotted
8th<00:01:01.170> delay<00:01:02.690> setup<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.110> some<00:01:04.379> reverb

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
8th delay setup and some reverb

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.690 
8th delay setup and some reverb
obviously<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:07.170> has<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.680> number<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.340> repeats

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
obviously and it has a number of repeats

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.830 
obviously and it has a number of repeats
but<00:01:10.040> there's<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.280> definite<00:01:11.909> primary<00:01:12.450> repeat

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but there's one definite primary repeat

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.679 
but there's one definite primary repeat
that<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.470> hear<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.090> timed<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that you can hear and this is timed to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.450 
that you can hear and this is timed to
the<00:01:15.900> backing<00:01:16.229> track<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.710> heard<00:01:16.950> again

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the backing track that you heard again

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
the backing track that you heard again
it's<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.790> dotted<00:01:18.240> eighth<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.380> cool<00:01:19.650> thing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it's in dotted eighth the cool thing

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820 
it's in dotted eighth the cool thing
about<00:01:19.890> dotted<00:01:20.490> eighth<00:01:20.700> delays<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.710> if

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
about dotted eighth delays is that if

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
about dotted eighth delays is that if
you<00:01:23.100> play<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> guitar<00:01:24.420> plays<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you play or if the guitar plays a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.370 
you play or if the guitar plays a
straight<00:01:25.650> eighth<00:01:25.860> note<00:01:26.390> riff<00:01:27.390> whatever<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
straight eighth note riff whatever it is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.429 
straight eighth note riff whatever it is
you<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> feeling<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.570> constant

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
you get this feeling of constant

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.350 
you get this feeling of constant
sixteenth<00:01:31.950> notes<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
sixteenth notes and that's what you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
sixteenth notes and that's what you
heard<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> track<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.350> lot<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.100> guitar

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
heard on the track and a lot of guitar

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.620 
heard on the track and a lot of guitar
players<00:01:35.369> use<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.390> cool

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
really cool thing David Gilmour's used

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
really cool thing David Gilmour's used
it<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.140> edge<00:01:40.460> uses<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:42.350> Buckethead<00:01:43.350> does<00:01:43.560> some

really cool things with it
ok<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> want<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.360> want

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
ok but what you want to do is you want

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
ok but what you want to do is you want
to<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.350> tempo<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> whatever<00:01:49.979> you're

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to get the tempo of whatever you're

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
to get the tempo of whatever you're
doing<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.119> set<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.450> delay<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.170> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
doing and then set your delay to that so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.719 
doing and then set your delay to that so
the<00:01:52.530> tempo<00:01:52.829> we're<00:01:52.979> dealing<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.579> this

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the tempo we're dealing with on this

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:07.290 
the tempo we're dealing with on this
track<00:01:54.030> is

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.219 

so<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.390> can<00:02:08.479> see<00:02:08.540> what<00:02:08.630> I'm<00:02:08.720> doing<00:02:08.930> there<00:02:09.080> I'm

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
so you can see what I'm doing there I'm

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.970 
so you can see what I'm doing there I'm
doing<00:02:09.500> straight<00:02:10.160> eighths<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:10.790> then<00:02:11.660> it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
doing straight eighths and then it's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.170 
doing straight eighths and then it's
filling<00:02:12.980> in<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.190> sixteenth<00:02:13.580> note<00:02:13.790> gap<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.090> let

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
filling in the sixteenth note gap so let

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.710 
filling in the sixteenth note gap so let
me<00:02:14.270> do<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.420> one<00:02:14.630> more<00:02:14.750> time

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
me do that one more time

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.600 
me do that one more time
one<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.020> two<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.290> three<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.800> four<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.520> one

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
one and two and three and four and one

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.460 
one and two and three and four and one
and<00:02:19.820> two<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.270> three<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.990> four<00:02:21.110> hands

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.870 

you<00:02:27.470> notice<00:02:27.770> if<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.190> off<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.550> that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
you notice if I get off that that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.240 
you notice if I get off that that
eighth-note<00:02:29.570> pattern<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.710> pay<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.190> with

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
eighth-note pattern you pay for it with

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.100 
eighth-note pattern you pay for it with
the<00:02:31.370> delay<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.610> terrible<00:02:38.090> one<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.960> cool

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
the delay so terrible one of the cool

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.780 
the delay so terrible one of the cool
things<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.860> with<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.370> dotto<00:02:40.580> dates

we're<00:03:04.850> playing<00:03:05.150> an<00:03:05.300> A<00:03:05.830> Lydian<00:03:06.830> okay<00:03:07.760> so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.890 

we<00:03:10.500> have<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.709> major<00:03:11.069> scale<00:03:11.459> with<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.819> sharp<00:03:12.209> four

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.210 

all<00:03:15.900> right<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.049> normal<00:03:16.439> major<00:03:16.620> scale<00:03:16.950> would

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
all right a normal major scale would

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.929 
all right a normal major scale would
would<00:03:17.519> would<00:03:17.939> do<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.629> two<00:03:19.019> three<00:03:19.939> four

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 
would would do this one two three four

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.569 
would would do this one two three four
we're<00:03:21.810> doing<00:03:22.110> this<00:03:24.890> over<00:03:25.890> an<00:03:26.189> a<00:03:26.250> major<00:03:26.430> chord

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
we're doing this over an a major chord

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.110 
we're doing this over an a major chord
so<00:03:26.849> you<00:03:27.000> get<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.189> nice<00:03:29.400> sharp<00:03:29.760> four

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
so you get you get that nice sharp four

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.110 
so you get you get that nice sharp four
sort<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:30.989> flat<00:03:31.260> five<00:03:31.500> feel<00:03:32.040> or<00:03:32.430> sound<00:03:32.790> and

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
that's it let's let's get our tempo with

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.600 
that's it let's let's get our tempo with
the<00:04:07.450> track<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:07.900> then<00:04:08.770> we'll<00:04:08.950> start<00:04:09.160> employing

the track and then we'll start employing

notes kind of lie in the track as a

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.520 
notes kind of lie in the track as a
rhythm<00:05:27.520> part<00:05:27.790> and<00:05:28.000> then<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.390> hear<00:05:28.630> these<00:05:28.780> cool

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.350 
the top of it so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:05:35.320> going<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.470> play<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.890> same<00:05:36.670> notes<00:05:36.970> I'm

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
I'm going to play the same notes I'm

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.540 
I'm going to play the same notes I'm
going<00:05:37.840> to<00:05:37.900> go<00:05:38.110> between<00:05:38.290> palm<00:05:38.740> muting<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:39.250> not

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
going to go between palm muting and not

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.160 
going to go between palm muting and not
palm<00:05:39.790> muting<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.540> you<00:05:40.600> can<00:05:40.720> kind<00:05:40.870> of<00:05:40.900> hear<00:05:41.020> the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
palm muting so you can kind of hear the

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.510 
palm muting so you can kind of hear the
difference<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:41.590> how<00:05:41.650> well<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:42.130> lays<00:05:42.310> in<00:05:42.460> the

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
difference and how well it lays in the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:06:11.900 
difference and how well it lays in the
track

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.360 

[Music]

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
[Music]

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.700 
[Music]
so<00:06:14.370> a<00:06:14.400> huge<00:06:14.700> difference<00:06:15.090> in<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:16.080> next<00:06:16.350> lesson

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
so a huge difference in the next lesson

so a huge difference in the next lesson
we're<00:06:17.280> going<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:17.760> take<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.090> look<00:06:18.330> at<00:06:18.510> another

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
we're going to take a look at another

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.629 
we're going to take a look at another
idea<00:06:19.590> with<00:06:19.800> this<00:06:19.919> dotted<00:06:20.250> eighth<00:06:20.370> but<00:06:20.520> we're

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
idea with this dotted eighth but we're

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.430 
idea with this dotted eighth but we're
going<00:06:20.730> to<00:06:20.790> be<00:06:20.970> employing<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.630> greater<00:06:21.870> range<00:06:22.169> of

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
going to be employing a greater range of

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.400 
going to be employing a greater range of
notes<00:06:22.620> so<00:06:23.389> hope<00:06:24.389> you<00:06:24.570> join<00:06:24.780> me<00:06:24.900> for<00:06:24.930> that<00:06:25.139> one
