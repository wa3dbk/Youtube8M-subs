certain sort of iridescent to it and

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.510 
certain sort of iridescent to it and
it's<00:05:09.479> a<00:05:09.599> little<00:05:10.080> bit<00:05:10.229> more<00:05:10.469> cotton<00:05:10.830> candy<00:05:11.370> than

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
it's a little bit more cotton candy than

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.309 
it's a little bit more cotton candy than
that<00:05:11.699> this<00:05:11.909> has<00:05:12.090> more<00:05:12.300> blue<00:05:12.659> undertones<00:05:13.169> and

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
that this has more blue undertones and

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.869 
that this has more blue undertones and
this<00:05:13.469> has<00:05:13.620> much<00:05:13.860> more<00:05:13.889> pink<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.580> it's<00:05:14.699> more

this has much more pink and it's more
sheer<00:05:15.349> so<00:05:16.349> I<00:05:16.979> think<00:05:17.279> the<00:05:17.400> quality<00:05:17.639> of<00:05:17.909> all<00:05:18.300> of

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
sheer so I think the quality of all of

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.510 
sheer so I think the quality of all of
the<00:05:18.779> lorac<00:05:19.139> fake<00:05:19.500> matte<00:05:19.770> satin<00:05:20.009> blushes<00:05:20.490> are

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
the lorac fake matte satin blushes are

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.119 
the lorac fake matte satin blushes are
awesome<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:21.479> definitely<00:05:22.229> go<00:05:22.319> try<00:05:22.710> them<00:05:22.919> and

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
awesome so definitely go try them and

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.279
