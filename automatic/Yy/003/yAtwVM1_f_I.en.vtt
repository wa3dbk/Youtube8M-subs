00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hey guys it's me cubics and today we're

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.360 
hey guys it's me cubics and today we're
going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.890> review<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.250> more<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.520> alsoo<00:00:07.370> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
going to review the more you alsoo the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.549 
going to review the more you alsoo the
more<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.670> alsoo<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> 62<00:00:09.660> millimeter<00:00:10.170> puzzle

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
more you alsoo is a 62 millimeter puzzle

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.230 
more you alsoo is a 62 millimeter puzzle
and<00:00:10.740> was<00:00:10.830> released<00:00:11.130> shortly<00:00:11.519> after<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> way

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
and was released shortly after the way

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.509 
and was released shortly after the way
sooo<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.320> relatively<00:00:13.740> expensive<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
sooo it is relatively expensive for a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.730 
sooo it is relatively expensive for a
four<00:00:14.700> by<00:00:14.820> four<00:00:14.849> coming<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.690> $27<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
four by four coming in at $27 at the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.240 
four by four coming in at $27 at the
cubicle<00:00:17.130> us<00:00:17.750> in<00:00:18.750> comparison<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> way<00:00:19.710> su<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
cubicle us in comparison the way su a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.099 
cubicle us in comparison the way su a
solid<00:00:20.699> four<00:00:20.850> by<00:00:20.970> four<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.449> twenty<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:21.840> dollars

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
solid four by four is twenty one dollars

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.500 
solid four by four is twenty one dollars
so<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.220> price<00:00:23.430> difference<00:00:23.760> warranted<00:00:24.330> in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
so is the price difference warranted in

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.529 
so is the price difference warranted in
short<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.769> answer<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.130> yes<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:26.760> nothing<00:00:27.510> but

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
short the answer is yes I'm nothing but

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
short the answer is yes I'm nothing but
good<00:00:27.840> things<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.140> say<00:00:28.260> about<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.800> cube<00:00:29.160> as

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
good things to say about this cube as

sounds swishy and feels crisp if you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
sounds swishy and feels crisp if you

the swishy sound has mostly gone away
but<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> still<00:00:46.559> feels<00:00:46.680> terrific<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
but it still feels terrific and I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.760 
but it still feels terrific and I
haven't<00:00:47.730> found<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> need<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> lubricate<00:00:48.420> it
