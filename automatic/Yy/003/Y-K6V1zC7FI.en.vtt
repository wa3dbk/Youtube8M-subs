everybody that worked on this project

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.080 
everybody that worked on this project
had<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.380> great<00:00:32.710> time<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:33.730> is<00:00:33.850> something

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
had a great time and it is something

had a great time and it is something
that<00:00:34.300> we<00:00:34.450> are<00:00:34.570> all<00:00:34.780> excited<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.440> watch<00:00:35.680> develop

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
that we are all excited to watch develop

00:00:36.220 --> 00:01:19.399 
that we are all excited to watch develop
over<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.550> next<00:00:36.670> few<00:00:37.120> years

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:50.120 

Oh

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:25.780 

Oh

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:45.150 

so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.800 

after<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> monsoon<00:02:46.730> season<00:02:46.850> we<00:02:47.450> returned<00:02:47.780> to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
after the monsoon season we returned to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.330 
after the monsoon season we returned to
the<00:02:48.080> site<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.680> see<00:02:48.920> how<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.190> has<00:02:49.310> been

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the site to see how it has been

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.390 
the site to see how it has been
progressing<00:02:50.210> over<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.540> last<00:02:50.720> five<00:02:51.020> months

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
progressing over the last five months

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.430 
progressing over the last five months
already<00:02:52.400> there<00:02:53.030> are<00:02:53.150> many<00:02:53.330> other<00:02:53.600> species<00:02:54.080> of

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
already there are many other species of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.770 
already there are many other species of
fish<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.070> other<00:02:55.190> organisms<00:02:55.310> living<00:02:56.300> on<00:02:56.570> and

fish and other organisms living on and
around<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.230> structures

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.559 

this<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.470> underwater<00:03:14.769> transform<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.849> is

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
this is the underwater transform it is

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.360 
this is the underwater transform it is
the<00:03:16.690> first<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.110> its<00:03:17.230> kind<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:17.800> saves<00:03:18.220> us

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
the first of its kind and saves us

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.160 
the first of its kind and saves us
energy<00:03:18.819> and<00:03:19.000> cost<00:03:19.180> compared<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:19.810> existing

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
collect on the destructions you can see

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.530 
collect on the destructions you can see
that<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.160> working<00:03:45.519> because<00:03:45.849> of<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.329> little

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
that it is working because of the little

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:55.589 
that it is working because of the little
bubbles<00:03:46.720> coming<00:03:47.290> off<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.680> structure<00:03:54.599> it

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
bubbles coming off of the structure it

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.539 
bubbles coming off of the structure it
took<00:03:55.780> us<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.079> few<00:03:56.110> months<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.680> get<00:03:56.799> approval<00:03:57.310> to

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
took us a few months to get approval to

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.880 
took us a few months to get approval to
transplant<00:03:58.180> corals<00:03:58.599> onto<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.989> site<00:03:59.260> so<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.799> is

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
transplant corals onto the site so it is

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.699 
transplant corals onto the site so it is
not<00:04:00.069> that<00:04:00.099> full<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.879> corals<00:04:01.239> yet<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:02.590> we

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
not that full of the corals yet but we

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.500 
not that full of the corals yet but we
can<00:04:02.739> see<00:04:03.250> how<00:04:03.370> healthy<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.910> corals<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.390> are

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
can see how healthy the corals that are

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.780 
can see how healthy the corals that are
on<00:04:04.660> it<00:04:04.690> are<00:04:05.019> and<00:04:05.319> how<00:04:05.980> much<00:04:06.040> they<00:04:06.459> have<00:04:06.579> grown

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
on it are and how much they have grown

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:35.820 
on it are and how much they have grown
up<00:04:06.970> around<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.390> structure

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.290 

generally<00:04:36.830> corals<00:04:37.220> grow<00:04:37.370> about<00:04:37.580> 1<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.090> 3

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
generally corals grow about 1 to 3

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.020 
generally corals grow about 1 to 3
centimeters<00:04:38.570> per<00:04:39.140> year<00:04:39.410> but<00:04:40.280> we<00:04:40.400> can<00:04:40.580> see<00:04:40.820> more

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
centimeters per year but we can see more

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.700 
centimeters per year but we can see more
than<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.420> in<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.720> last<00:04:41.900> few<00:04:42.170> months<00:04:42.350> as<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
than that in the last few months as the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.590 
than that in the last few months as the
corals<00:04:43.190> are<00:04:43.280> beginning<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.820> attach<00:04:44.120> around

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
corals are beginning to attach around

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.290 
corals are beginning to attach around
the<00:04:44.780> metal<00:04:45.490> after<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.520> few<00:04:46.790> more<00:04:46.940> years<00:04:47.180> of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
the metal after a few more years of

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.060 
the metal after a few more years of
growth<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.900> structures<00:04:48.380> will<00:04:48.530> be<00:04:48.620> completely

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
growth the structures will be completely

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.850 
growth the structures will be completely
covered<00:04:49.550> in<00:04:49.640> corals<00:04:50.090> surrounded<00:04:51.050> by<00:04:51.200> fish<00:04:51.560> and

covered in corals surrounded by fish and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.220 
covered in corals surrounded by fish and
