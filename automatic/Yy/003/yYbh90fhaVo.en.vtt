00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 at the beginning it was terribly out of tune what happened 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.160
 even though 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.029
 it would not be clarisol taras 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.759
 he said happening the same 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.159
 you start was fatal as you wanted to straighten 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.359
 and the end was terrible 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.230
 that my brothers spend that constantly happens to you the concerts outside of 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.509
 everything that happens 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.300
 we are going to focus on what happens on stage 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.649
 let's focus on your interpretation 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.319
 both body and vocal how do you feel you think you have improved 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.720
 yes I have improved because it has lost a lot 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.620
 min 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.740
 and it stays and who is going to conform against who 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.560
 and sometimes I feel that he 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.840
 I am about to find something are because I feel that now generates fear me 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.690
 It gives me scary cerval give it to four 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 but for example when I loosed sing the bathroom anywhere 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.420
 every other incident I want to find I know it's difficult 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.020
 but that's why I'm here could not be there we're going to twelve concerts of 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.720

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.360
 james cameron 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.110
 the Mexican in the concert to grow 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.110

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.850

 but the cold 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.680
