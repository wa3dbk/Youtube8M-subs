00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
like that that's the right way and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.210 

it's<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.160> little<00:02:29.340> bit<00:02:29.459> hard<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> play<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.870> um

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
it's a little bit hard to play but um

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.449 
it's a little bit hard to play but um
you<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.940> Wario<00:02:33.440> stage<00:02:36.980> some<00:02:37.980> riche

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
you know this is Wario stage some riche

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.780 
you know this is Wario stage some riche
it's<00:02:38.760> always<00:02:39.030> funny

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
it's always funny

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
it's always funny
so<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.849> was<00:02:41.970> breathe<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.140> that's<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.890> story

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
so it was breathe so that's the story

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.809

mode<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.790> essence<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.580> then<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.790> have

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
mode in essence you and then you have

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.130 
mode in essence you and then you have
the<00:02:50.970> spin<00:02:51.269> necks<00:02:51.510> where<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.989> basically

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the spin necks where you can basically
