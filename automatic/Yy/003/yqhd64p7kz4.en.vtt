00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.460 
low as 25 below zero by morning now
looking<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> record<00:01:54.750> book<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.170> for

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
looking at the record book here for

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
looking at the record book here for
tomorrow<00:01:55.860> morning<00:01:56.190> our<00:01:56.280> record<00:01:56.610> low<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:56.970> 14

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
tomorrow morning our record low is at 14

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.300 
tomorrow morning our record low is at 14
below<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.140> standard<00:01:58.560> field<00:01:58.860> will

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
below I think that standard field will

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
below I think that standard field will
drop<00:01:59.580> to<00:01:59.729> about<00:01:59.940> 15<00:02:00.570> below<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> all-time

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
drop to about 15 below so the all-time

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.640 
drop to about 15 below so the all-time
record<00:02:01.950> low<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.100> 20<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.610> probably<00:02:03.210> hold<00:02:03.650> but

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
record low of 20 will probably hold but

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.610 
record low of 20 will probably hold but
still<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.880> very<00:02:06.330> close<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.470> you're

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
still very very close to it when you're

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.740 
still very very close to it when you're
out<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.799> temperatures<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.700> how<00:02:09.239> how

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
out in temperatures like that how how

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
out in temperatures like that how how
fast<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:10.769> frostbite<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.610> your<00:02:11.760> skin

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
fast can you get frostbite can your skin

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.960 
fast can you get frostbite can your skin
well<00:02:12.540> usually<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.200> rule<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.470> thumb<00:02:13.620> is

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
well usually the rule of thumb is

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.240 
well usually the rule of thumb is
anything<00:02:14.970> under<00:02:15.180> 10<00:02:15.420> degrees<00:02:15.810> below<00:02:16.260> zero<00:02:16.860> it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
anything under 10 degrees below zero it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.039 
anything under 10 degrees below zero it
can<00:02:17.549> happen<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.000> matter<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.299> minutes<00:02:18.659> and

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
can happen in a matter of minutes and

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.920 
can happen in a matter of minutes and
then<00:02:19.140> much<00:02:19.980> faster<00:02:20.519> you<00:02:20.849> know<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.239> seconds

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
then much faster you know just seconds

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.110 
then much faster you know just seconds
once<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.379> get<00:02:22.530> down<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.739> 30<00:02:23.340> 40<00:02:23.670> below<00:02:23.879> of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
once you get down to 30 40 below of

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
back there at his the water now when the

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.860 
back there at his the water now when the
water<00:03:38.609> company<00:03:39.209> came<00:03:39.389> out<00:03:39.480> here<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.720> begin

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
water company came out here to begin

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.140 
water company came out here to begin
working<00:03:40.230> on<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.739> problem<00:03:41.010> they<00:03:41.280> had<00:03:41.519> was

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
working on this the problem they had was

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 
working on this the problem they had was
that<00:03:42.209> they<00:03:42.510> could<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.319> turn<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.829> water

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
that they could not just turn the water

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.710 
that they could not just turn the water
main<00:03:44.310> off<00:03:44.489> like<00:03:44.730> they<00:03:44.880> would<00:03:45.060> normally<00:03:45.420> do<00:03:45.569> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
main off like they would normally do to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.809 
main off like they would normally do to
stop<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.230> from<00:03:46.410> seeping<00:03:47.160> up<00:03:47.280> into<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.639> road

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
stop it from seeping up into the road

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.430 
stop it from seeping up into the road
the<00:03:48.030> reason<00:03:48.389> they<00:03:48.480> couldn't<00:03:48.750> it's<00:03:48.930> because<00:03:49.290> of

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the reason they couldn't it's because of

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.020 
the reason they couldn't it's because of
the<00:03:49.500> plants<00:03:49.829> back<00:03:49.980> there<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.370> water's<00:03:50.700> used

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the plants back there the water's used

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.599 
the plants back there the water's used
in<00:03:51.239> boilers<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.380> can't<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:53.220> cut<00:03:53.489> the

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
in boilers and you can't just cut the

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.520 
in boilers and you can't just cut the
water<00:03:53.790> off<00:03:53.910> now<00:03:54.540> what<00:03:54.690> they've<00:03:54.870> done<00:03:55.049> now<00:03:55.109> is

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
water off now what they've done now is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.259 
water off now what they've done now is
they're<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.950> process<00:03:56.549> of<00:03:56.700> turning<00:03:56.940> water

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
they're in the process of turning water

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.229 
they're in the process of turning water
off<00:03:57.510> finally<00:03:58.049> about<00:03:58.950> two<00:03:59.250> hours<00:03:59.400> after<00:04:00.120> they

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
off finally about two hours after they

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.569 
off finally about two hours after they
got<00:04:00.419> here<00:04:00.690> they've<00:04:01.049> talked<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.500> BASF<00:04:02.370> which

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
got here they've talked to BASF which

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.430 
got here they've talked to BASF which
they<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.510> company<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.200> water

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
they think is the company that the water

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.860 
they think is the company that the water
was<00:04:04.680> supplied<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.760> they<00:04:06.150> find<00:04:06.510> out<00:04:06.720> that

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
was supplied to if they find out that

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.110 
was supplied to if they find out that
that<00:04:07.049> was<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.709> main<00:04:07.950> they<00:04:08.190> think<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.609> is<00:04:08.760> and

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
that was the main they think it is and

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.720 
that was the main they think it is and
that<00:04:09.660> BASF<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.829> company<00:04:11.099> owned<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.609> was

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
that BASF is the company owned that was

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.610 
that BASF is the company owned that was
affected<00:04:12.239> then<00:04:12.630> they<00:04:12.780> can<00:04:12.900> proceed<00:04:13.260> ahead

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
affected then they can proceed ahead

affected then they can proceed ahead
with<00:04:13.970> repairs<00:04:14.970> they<00:04:15.209> hope<00:04:15.419> it's<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.810> small

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
with repairs they hope it's a small
