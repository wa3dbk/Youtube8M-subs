the<00:01:10.619> black<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.340> changes<00:01:11.790> Bing<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.450> can

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
the black be changes Bing but we can

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.289 
the black be changes Bing but we can
toggle<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> little<00:01:14.640> tab<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> top

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
toggle that as a little tab at the top

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
toggle that as a little tab at the top
there<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.259> mean<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:16.890> google<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
there so I mean it's on google at the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
there so I mean it's on google at the
Munk<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.580> obvious<00:01:17.820> using<00:01:18.210> Google<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
Munk was obvious using Google but it is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.370 
Munk was obvious using Google but it is
automatically<00:01:19.979> sent<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> ping<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:22.229> can

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
automatically sent to ping but you can
