00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
he was afraid of it adjust their dodging

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.290 
he was afraid of it adjust their dodging
it<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.160> something<00:01:11.340> lame<00:01:11.610> happened<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.210> a

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
seemed a little obvious Vinny was

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.120 
seemed a little obvious Vinny was
looking<00:04:02.990> for<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.230> phantasm<00:04:03.770> you<00:04:03.800> know<00:04:03.980> what<00:04:04.070> I

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
looking for the phantasm you know what I

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.920 
looking for the phantasm you know what I
mean<00:04:04.160> move<00:04:04.730> Benny<00:04:04.940> definitely<00:04:05.420> hard<00:04:05.600> read<00:04:05.810> it

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
mean move Benny definitely hard read it

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.720 
mean move Benny definitely hard read it
but<00:04:06.050> I<00:04:06.110> think<00:04:06.200> Larry<00:04:06.650> they're<00:04:07.250> just<00:04:07.280> one<00:04:07.610> for

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
but I think Larry they're just one for

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.370 
but I think Larry they're just one for
the<00:04:07.820> phantasm<00:04:08.360> because<00:04:08.570> if<00:04:08.690> he<00:04:08.780> did<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.080> go<00:04:09.260> in

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
the phantasm because if he did so go in

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.140 
the phantasm because if he did so go in
the<00:04:09.470> air<00:04:09.590> it's<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.860> 50-50<00:04:10.460> on<00:04:10.490> a<00:04:10.580> drug<00:04:10.850> or<00:04:10.940> trap

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the air it's a 50-50 on a drug or trap
