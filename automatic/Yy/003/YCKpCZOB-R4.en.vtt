00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
have a look at it in Depot and we'll get

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
have a look at it in Depot and we'll get
started<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> tutorial<00:00:47.190> ok<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
started on the tutorial ok so this is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
started on the tutorial ok so this is
what<00:00:48.359> it<00:00:48.449> looks<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> default<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
what it looks like in a default so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.189 
what it looks like in a default so
obviously<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> cobblestone<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> little

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
obviously the cobblestone is a little

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.330 
obviously the cobblestone is a little
bit<00:00:52.289> different<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.620> my<00:00:52.679> text<00:00:52.980> backers<00:00:53.190> more

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
alright you know you could obviously

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.930 
alright you know you could obviously
choose<00:00:57.809> any<00:00:58.079> color<00:00:58.559> mint<00:00:58.800> whatever<00:00:59.339> you<00:00:59.429> want

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
anything anyway let's switch over to my

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.219 
anything anyway let's switch over to my
texture<00:01:16.710> pack<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.159> we'll<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.430> started

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
texture pack and we'll get started

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
texture pack and we'll get started
ok<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.040> first<00:01:20.189> thing<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
then built this center section right

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.819 
then built this center section right
there<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.590> by<00:01:25.680> one

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
an upside-down Stegen after that's the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
an upside-down Stegen after that's the
ground<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.600> stare

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
ground right here I'm so don't stare
