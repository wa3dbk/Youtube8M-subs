00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello you greet Shcherbakov 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.319
 Tatyana Vitalevna 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.759
 and dubovitskaya olga vladimirovna today 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.380
 we will create a collage and the simplest 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 the way to create a collage is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.480
 using the picasso program simple 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.970
 and multifunctional editor 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.109
 of images 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.310
 collage allows you to connect together 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.920
 several photos in one picture 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.189
 add an inscription and much more and we 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.690
 show it by example 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.280
 pre- prepared photos 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.570
 who want to say so temper fat 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 press the collage button after that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.840
 There is such a window where 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.030
 photos are already arranged randomly 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:03.680
 they are scattered and you can do everything with them 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.680
 move anything 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:14.759
 scale up scale down 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.759
 in size and so on 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:27.710
 we can move these photos down 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:31.010
 on the contrary, we can move them up to 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 principle, at any stage, you can already collage 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.710
 create but we will continue to work 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.600
 farther 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.870
 slightly different place our 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 Photo 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:50.510
 select the grid and increase the grid spacing 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.200
 so that we have seen the background background 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.630
 quite grim we can with you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.710
 change it use as 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.710
 background image 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.750
 we can make the background solid 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.740
