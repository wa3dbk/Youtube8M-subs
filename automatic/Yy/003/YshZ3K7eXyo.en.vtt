00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
hair with a usually darker however I

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.119

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.670 
again I also felt I really like the
consistency<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.849> consistency<00:02:26.720> was<00:02:26.900> very

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
consistency the consistency was very

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.119 
consistency the consistency was very
plant<00:02:28.579> protein<00:02:29.239> based<00:02:29.650> would<00:02:30.650> look<00:02:30.890> at<00:02:31.099> it

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
plant protein based would look at it

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.089 
plant protein based would look at it
seemed<00:02:31.519> like<00:02:31.819> egg<00:02:32.090> white<00:02:32.689> that<00:02:33.650> was<00:02:33.829> the

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
seemed like egg white that was the

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.940 
seemed like egg white that was the
consistency<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:36.290> was<00:02:36.409> like<00:02:36.590> two

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
consistency and it was like two

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.309 
consistency and it was like two
different<00:02:37.609> kinds<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:40.510> liquid<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.719> the<00:02:41.900> harvest

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
different kinds of liquid so the harvest

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.979 
different kinds of liquid so the harvest
egg<00:02:42.500> mighty<00:02:42.829> kind<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.579> products<00:02:44.540> which<00:02:44.870> you

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
egg mighty kind of products which you

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.740 
egg mighty kind of products which you
will<00:02:45.139> see<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.409> the<00:02:45.739> video<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.389> have

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
will see in the video and then you have

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.339 
will see in the video and then you have
like<00:02:48.469> a<00:02:49.040> very<00:02:49.459> funny<00:02:49.909> version<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.659> molasses

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
like a very funny version of molasses

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.099 
like a very funny version of molasses
which<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.340> believe<00:02:52.549> was<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.819> dye<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.480> pansy

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
which I believe was the dye a pansy

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.910 
which I believe was the dye a pansy
pigment<00:02:55.040> probably<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:56.689> order<00:02:57.139> was<00:02:57.379> okay

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
pigment probably the order was okay

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.220 
pigment probably the order was okay
there's<00:02:58.189> a<00:02:58.310> very<00:02:58.760> very<00:02:59.239> food<00:03:00.579> shuttle<00:03:02.230> board

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
there's a very very food shuttle board

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.619 
there's a very very food shuttle board
of<00:03:03.409> of<00:03:03.620> light<00:03:04.189> peroxide<00:03:04.939> so<00:03:05.329> it<00:03:05.419> definitely

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
of of light peroxide so it definitely

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.080 
of of light peroxide so it definitely
has<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.079> have<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> little<00:03:06.409> bit<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.919> all<00:03:07.909> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
has to have a little bit of it all the

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
than that and I feel because of the

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.980 
than that and I feel because of the
consistency<00:04:47.039> if<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.460> did<00:04:47.759> just<00:04:48.030> applies<00:04:48.660> to

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
consistency if you did just applies to

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.370 
consistency if you did just applies to
your<00:04:49.229> hair<00:04:49.410> probably<00:04:49.740> would<00:04:50.009> squirt<00:04:50.460> soon<00:04:51.380> but

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
your hair probably would squirt soon but

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.790 
your hair probably would squirt soon but
I<00:04:52.410> think<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.979> packet<00:04:53.340> or<00:04:53.460> two<00:04:53.819> will<00:04:54.539> do<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:55.770> I

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
I think that packet or two will do but I

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.950 
I think that packet or two will do but I
