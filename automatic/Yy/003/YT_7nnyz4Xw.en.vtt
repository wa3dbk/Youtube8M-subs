00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
recently they've been doing that to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.120 
recently they've been doing that to
tombs<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:25.780> you<00:04:26.350> know<00:04:26.470> probably<00:04:26.590> thirties<00:04:27.040> and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
tombs and you know probably thirties and

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.290 
tombs and you know probably thirties and
forties<00:04:27.430> against<00:04:27.730> team<00:04:27.880> so<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:28.150> know<00:04:28.270> that

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
forties against team so we know that

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.910 
forties against team so we know that
they<00:04:28.540> were<00:04:28.630> they're<00:04:29.110> good<00:04:29.290> with<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.500> ball<00:04:29.680> but

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
they were they're good with the ball but

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.350 
they were they're good with the ball but
I<00:04:30.070> thought<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.400> snuffed<00:04:30.640> out<00:04:30.790> pretty<00:04:31.060> much<00:04:31.180> do

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
I thought we snuffed out pretty much do

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.390 
I thought we snuffed out pretty much do
everything<00:04:32.080> they<00:04:32.440> had<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.590> throw<00:04:32.830> us<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
everything they had to throw us and the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.470 
everything they had to throw us and the
first<00:04:33.580> fifteen<00:04:33.940> minutes<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.210> thought<00:04:34.330> we

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
first fifteen minutes I thought we

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.350 
first fifteen minutes I thought we
control<00:04:34.810> them<00:04:34.960> pretty<00:04:35.170> good<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:37.060> that's<00:04:37.180> why

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
control them pretty good and that's why

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.490 
control them pretty good and that's why
we're<00:04:37.540> in<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.720> game<00:04:37.870> because<00:04:38.110> we're<00:04:38.350> in<00:04:38.470> a

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
we're in the game because we're in a

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.140 
we're in the game because we're in a
good<00:04:38.650> amorous<00:04:38.980> or<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:39.430> we<00:04:39.940> stopped

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
good amorous or and then we stopped

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.370 
good amorous or and then we stopped
putting<00:04:40.300> numbers<00:04:40.510> in<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.840> tackle<00:04:41.230> and

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
putting numbers in the tackle and

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.560 
putting numbers in the tackle and
control<00:04:41.740> in<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:41.980> rack<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:43.360> know<00:04:43.450> we

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
control in the rack and you know we

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.000 
control in the rack and you know we
clocked<00:04:43.810> off<00:04:43.990> on<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.170> couple<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.470> short<00:04:44.710> sides

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
clocked off on a couple of short sides

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.290 
clocked off on a couple of short sides
and<00:04:45.310> then<00:04:45.400> they've<00:04:45.580> got<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.790> speed<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.090> the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
and then they've got the speed on the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.570 
and then they've got the speed on the
fringes<00:04:46.690> it'll<00:04:46.930> just<00:04:47.080> burn<00:04:47.230> any<00:04:47.500> team<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:48.010> don't

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
fringes it'll just burn any team I don't

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.220

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
to achieve it but the interesting fact

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.890 
to achieve it but the interesting fact
is<00:05:26.770> he<00:05:26.890> wasn't<00:05:27.130> first-choice<00:05:27.900> goalkeeper
