00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.950
 very good people that such many of the 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.349
 that you play Assassin's Creed II 'view 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.750
 and for pc you have noticed that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.170
 you do not have the option to start a new 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.449
 Failed game by ubisoft 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.029
 maybe but from here we're going to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.240
 show how to correct this and be able 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.099
 start from scratch in the game of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.550
 Assassin's believe the first thing we have 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.749
 what to do is in new play in the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.749
 implementation of new play 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.239
 from ubisoft we go to the settings 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.370
 and here we deactivate as you see it is 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.220
 now it is activated now has disabled 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.920
 the synchronization of data saved in 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.550
 the cloud is worth we give to save 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.550
 all right 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.530
 and then we go 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.530
 the folder 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.090
 this that we are going to teach you 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.660
 here it is 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.790
 by default it would be in our team 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.360
 Local disk and program files 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.500
 ubisoft 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 ubisoft game launcher 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.150
 and here we have six games worth 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.530
 as you can see the last one there is this one 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.350
 here 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.570
 and this is the recording of the last 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.470
 I started with assassin's 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.290
 believe what we can do is if you want 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.690
 keep it just in case and go back to 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.259
 restore this saved item what 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.590
 be it the short jce the pegÃ¡is in another 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 site 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.299
 and then you can restore it with this 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.590
 what do we do very simple with this 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.590
 we get that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.329
 has to start assassin's creed instead 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.049
 to load the game of the cloud and 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.049
 restore 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.400
 the games that we have saved 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.400
 will start a zero 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.110
 and I had already started a game that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.840
 I was at 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.090
 very 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.130
 very little started just to see 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.840
 how was the game like 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.690
 as they were 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.820
 the graphics if my team moved it 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.060
 you see this is when move shows the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.060
 icon 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.599
 when you keep 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.599
 and if we start the game 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.240
 and as you see starts from scratch 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.270
 the past is not lost 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.400
 nothing in our so you can see the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.920
 Four test to close 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.840
 directly 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.569
 what I'm going to do is restore the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.360
 heading to the folder that we have 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.360
 left here so you can see the difference 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.950
 as we see there what provision 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.120
 in a play of 4 that was what we had 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.019
 saved before 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.019
 I want to remember 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.270
 what yes once the folder is deleted 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.430
 is starting again what you can is 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.680
 activate synchronization again in the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.190
 cloud and will keep you in the cloud and the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:52.050
 older version that is the most modern 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.810
 sorry the later so when activating it 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.220
 after starting the new game what 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.680
 what you will get is that in the cloud 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.680
 save the current game 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.620
 as you see the place now instead of 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.620
 start with the intro 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.510
 should we start 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.980
 no longer leaves to continue the game in 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.170
 place of 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.710
 start if I'm going to give I give 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.710
 continue 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.050
 a game that requires quite a machine 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.310
 truth and as you see 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.920
 we have already started 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.550
 with the started game 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.550
 OK 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.139
 we went out 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:14.080
 and if now we would give you here adjustments and 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.449
 activate synchronization what would 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.139
 would save us this new item in 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.810
 Cloud 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.090
 I hope it has helped you like 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.210
 if you liked it or if it has served you 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.650
 It helps to subscribe if you are more interested 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.500
 videos about videogames 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.790
 there is no passing through joserra gaming
