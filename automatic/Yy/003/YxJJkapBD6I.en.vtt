00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.790
 verdi of the scratching process that can 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.010

 most peak chile over the whole world is not 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.890
 he grows neither in mexico nor in any other 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.470
 country is grown in the USA, drain is the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.140
 know the world record of having the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.450
 spicy chile over the world or of 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.540
 cultivate well 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.180
 is to show us a tour as I have 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.160
 of the lines decided last month that 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.190
 The cardinal and strong are the most 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.530
 spicy of the earth putting an end to 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.599
 campaign of more than four years to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.849
 show that he has the most chili peppers 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.410
 spicy around the world some said 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.660
 that you can never know is the most 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.580
 spicy with others does not depend on the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.800
 genetic but also where it 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.860
 cultivates but says an idea the chile 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.110
 jalapeÃ±o that is two thousand to eight thousand more or 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.720
 less than five thousand scoville units 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.540
 indicated that it is good spicy to some 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.610
 it causes a lot of ardor was a question demos 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.040
 an idea when the peppers of the core 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:53.519
 got to have three points 2 million 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.099
 typical scoville units obviously what 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.140
 let's try the chile because you 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.569
 she undoes the tongue but if I want anything 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.670
 even more an idea there is a gas that 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.220
 occupy for delicate self-defense 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.130
 in chile that as many say or what 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.739
 they call that gas has around two 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.220
 millions of scoville units now 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.520
 imagine if that 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.590
 one chile represented 2 points 2 million 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.040
 of units I discovered typical rather it 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.040
 they deserve 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.510
