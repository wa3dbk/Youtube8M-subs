00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
all we can do is just try to replicate

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.110 
all we can do is just try to replicate
the<00:01:07.170> success<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.650> had<00:01:07.740> last<00:01:07.890> year<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.730> biggest

mistake in talking about a national

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.460 
mistake in talking about a national
championship<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.650> won<00:01:13.890> last<00:01:14.160> year<00:01:14.730> is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
championship that we won last year is

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.110 
championship that we won last year is
talking<00:01:16.470> about<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.760> singular

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
talking about it in a very singular

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.530 
talking about it in a very singular
moment<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.410> happened<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.540> weekend

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
moment as if it happened in a weekend

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
moment as if it happened in a weekend
and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> reality<00:01:22.410> of<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.980> that<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.640> takes<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and the reality of it is that it takes a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.050 
and the reality of it is that it takes a
whole<00:01:24.300> season<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:25.650> develop<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.820> takes<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
whole season to develop that it takes a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.440 
whole season to develop that it takes a
lot<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> integration<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.170> our<00:01:28.380> older<00:01:29.100> guys

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.110 
their own unique spin to that I think we
benefit<00:01:51.840> from<00:01:51.870> a<00:01:52.830> lot<00:01:53.160> of<00:01:53.310> guys<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.520> have

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
benefit from a lot of guys that have

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.290 
benefit from a lot of guys that have
experienced<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:55.080> winning<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> national<00:01:55.770> title

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
experienced and winning a national title

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.260 
experienced and winning a national title
like<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:57.480> did<00:01:57.690> in<00:01:58.250> 2012<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.760> again<00:01:59.970> in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
like we did in 2012 and then again in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.530 
like we did in 2012 and then again in
2014<00:02:00.980> which<00:02:01.980> with<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> same<00:02:02.880> group<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
2014 which with the same group that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.940 
2014 which with the same group that
didn't<00:02:04.500> win<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> national<00:02:04.920> title<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.670> 2013

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
didn't win a national title and 2013

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
didn't win a national title and 2013
that<00:02:07.950> has<00:02:08.160> some<00:02:08.369> different<00:02:08.550> experiences<00:02:09.479> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
that has some different experiences to

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.059 
that has some different experiences to
it<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.679> they<00:02:10.800> still<00:02:11.220> remember

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
it and I think they still remember

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.179 
it and I think they still remember
what<00:02:13.060> they<00:02:13.239> went<00:02:13.510> through<00:02:13.629> this<00:02:14.349> past<00:02:14.709> year

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
what they went through this past year

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.789 
what they went through this past year
and<00:02:15.310> 2014<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.420> win<00:02:16.629> as<00:02:16.870> well<00:02:16.930> as<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:17.680> they

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
and 2014 to win as well as what they

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.819 
and 2014 to win as well as what they
went<00:02:17.980> through<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.340> 2013<00:02:19.150> when<00:02:20.079> they<00:02:20.230> lost<00:02:20.469> and

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
went through in 2013 when they lost and

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.059 
went through in 2013 when they lost and
they<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.219> couple<00:02:21.609> those<00:02:21.969> two<00:02:23.069> really

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
they can couple those two really

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.459 
they can couple those two really
different<00:02:24.389> contrasting<00:02:25.469> experiences

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
different contrasting experiences

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.140 
different contrasting experiences
together<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:27.310> create<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.760> best<00:02:27.969> environment

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
together to create the best environment

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.140 
together to create the best environment
for<00:02:28.930> our<00:02:29.650> group<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.159> underclassmen<00:02:30.549> coming<00:02:31.060> in
