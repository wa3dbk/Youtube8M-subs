00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.780
 but such history presents 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.090
 I'm learning to draw and recognize 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.929
 shapes 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.330
 today I propose you to make a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.670
 pretty drawing with colors of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.090
 brushes and pencils and also a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.100
 white sheet of paper 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.359
 we start with a pink circle 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.119
 it will be the guy's head like that a 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.540
 round pink that's fine and now 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.090
 we will make an orange circle for the body 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.969
 from man to a little bigger than the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.300
 head is fine like that and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:52.260
 now a green line for the arm 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 left the right arm a leg and then 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.800
 another join here it is good 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.010
 like that but if we put a little 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 blue dot to make the eyes go 1-2 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.560
 it is missing 1 but we will make a line 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.520
 blue for the nose we'll put it there little 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.780
 near here and mariette labrusse at the look 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.430
 illegals so much the man 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.869
 this is a nice drawing I propose 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.390
 now that we make a small house 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.390
 next to the guy with a brown square 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.860
 or associate a very nice square 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.720
 now you have to make a roof on the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 house the roof we will do it in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.420
 red triangle up there on the joined 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 this is pretty it even put put 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.350
 small windows and yes a quarter and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.060
 purple it will do very well to make a 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.520
 window and then a second 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.159
 wallah but he misses a door 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.820
 go we add a door it will be a 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.350
 blue rectangle and we will put it here 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.539
 nice little house is the house of 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.450
 fellow 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.620
 and if we added a yellow star it is 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.469
 difficult alger mapic stars like 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.840
 it's like that it's a pretty and 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:24.829
 you even go there yellow coloring like 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.510
 it will shine in the sky must do 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.840
 as if I'm reading a house a man 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.230
 was born canvas to see again says the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:40.120
