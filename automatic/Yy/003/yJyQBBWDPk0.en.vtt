00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hi I'm sue with ribbon print and this

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.349 
hi I'm sue with ribbon print and this
video<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:05.040> talking<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.609> how<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.879> use<00:00:06.120> your

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
video is talking about how to use your

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.200 
video is talking about how to use your
foils<00:00:07.230> most<00:00:07.529> efficiently<00:00:08.069> I'd<00:00:08.910> say<00:00:09.059> that's

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
foils most efficiently I'd say that's

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.820 
foils most efficiently I'd say that's
the<00:00:09.330> number<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.900> question<00:00:10.320> we<00:00:10.349> get<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the number one question we get at the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.520 
the number one question we get at the
trade<00:00:11.070> shows<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.670> how<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.000> if<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.080> only<00:00:13.230> print

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
trade shows is how do if we only print

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.680 
trade shows is how do if we only print
on<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> left<00:00:13.950> side<00:00:14.190> how<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:14.940> i<00:00:15.089> efficiently

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
on the left side how do i efficiently

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.170 
on the left side how do i efficiently
use<00:00:15.929> all<00:00:16.139> my<00:00:16.289> foils<00:00:16.770> there's<00:00:17.520> actually<00:00:17.910> two

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
use all my foils there's actually two

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.000 
use all my foils there's actually two
ways<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.289> I'm<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.800> through

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
ways to do it so I'm going to go through

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.010 
ways to do it so I'm going to go through
both<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.369> those<00:00:20.460> ways<00:00:20.699> right<00:00:21.000> now<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.720> first

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
both of those ways right now the first

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.740 
both of those ways right now the first
way<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.039> very<00:00:23.310> simple<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.150> basic<00:00:24.330> way

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
way is the very simple and basic way

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.410 
way is the very simple and basic way
that<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.800> any<00:00:26.130> demo<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.269> we're

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that you see at any demo that we're

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.140 
that you see at any demo that we're
doing<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> show<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.160> printer<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
doing at a show on this printer is a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.319 
doing at a show on this printer is a
left<00:00:30.510> printing<00:00:31.320> printer<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.880> other<00:00:33.030> words

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
left printing printer so in other words

left printing printer so in other words
when<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.380> design<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> print

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
when you do a design it's going to print

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.600 
when you do a design it's going to print
on<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.780> left<00:00:36.989> hand<00:00:37.200> side<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> foil<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:38.190> you

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
in use and print and what that's done is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.040 
in use and print and what that's done is
it<00:03:03.410> shifted<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.040> print<00:03:04.430> over<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.540> use<00:03:05.720> another

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
it shifted the print over to use another

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.650 
it shifted the print over to use another
section<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.709> foil<00:03:06.950> now<00:03:07.400> as<00:03:08.209> we<00:03:08.420> had<00:03:08.630> just

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
section of the foil now as we had just

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.290 
section of the foil now as we had just
done<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.650> take<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:10.070> out<00:03:10.280> another<00:03:10.850> time

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
done you can take this out another time

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.650 
done you can take this out another time
and<00:03:11.720> flip<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.260> foil<00:03:12.530> over<00:03:12.950> one<00:03:13.370> more<00:03:13.610> time<00:03:13.670> so

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
and flip the foil over one more time so

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.949 
and flip the foil over one more time so
you<00:03:14.750> actually<00:03:15.020> can<00:03:15.410> get<00:03:15.650> four<00:03:16.130> passes<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.209> your

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
you actually can get four passes of your

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.130 
you actually can get four passes of your
foil<00:03:18.290> okay<00:03:18.950> most<00:03:19.250> foils<00:03:19.640> are<00:03:19.760> about<00:03:19.910> 165<00:03:20.810> feet

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
foil okay most foils are about 165 feet

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.860 
foil okay most foils are about 165 feet
so<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.560> can<00:03:21.950> design<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.910> by<00:03:23.269> four<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.750> you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
so you can design that by four and you

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.280 
so you can design that by four and you
can<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.260> here<00:03:24.650> we've<00:03:25.340> used<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:25.790> two<00:03:26.630> three
