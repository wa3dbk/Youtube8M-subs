ICS<00:03:02.170> rom<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.340> probably<00:03:03.550> as<00:03:03.760> close<00:03:03.850> as

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
ICS rom so this is probably as close as

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.140 
ICS rom so this is probably as close as
to<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.290> as<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.740> gets<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.250> i'll<00:03:06.490> have<00:03:06.640> there's

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to it as it gets and i'll have there's

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.450

another<00:03:07.390> ICS<00:03:07.870> rom<00:03:07.960> but<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.010> problem<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.430> think

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
another ICS rom but the problem I think

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.190

is<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.940> same<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.210> back<00:03:10.630> button<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.020> the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
is the same the back button and the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.540 
is the same the back button and the
search<00:03:11.470> button<00:03:11.710> I'll<00:03:11.890> have<00:03:12.010> review<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.520> that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550
