00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
made the set very hard to complete the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.830

course this full metal dialga the only

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.250 
course this full metal dialga the only
thing<00:03:56.730> i<00:03:56.820> don't<00:03:56.880> like<00:03:57.030> about<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.630> these<00:03:57.989> full

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
thing i don't like about the these full

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.800 
thing i don't like about the these full
gold<00:03:58.620> or<00:03:59.250> silver<00:03:59.430> cards<00:03:59.910> it's<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.660> really

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
gold or silver cards it's just really

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.010 
gold or silver cards it's just really
hard<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.200> see<00:04:01.470> what<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.770> actual<00:04:02.040> Pokemon<00:04:02.520> is

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
hard to see what the actual Pokemon is

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.870 
hard to see what the actual Pokemon is
that's<00:04:04.020> really<00:04:04.260> my<00:04:04.410> only<00:04:04.440> complaint<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.190> then

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
that's really my only complaint and then

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.130 
that's really my only complaint and then
we'll<00:04:06.030> just<00:04:06.180> flip<00:04:06.390> really<00:04:06.750> quick<00:04:06.930> through<00:04:07.080> the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
we'll just flip really quick through the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.360 
we'll just flip really quick through the
reverse<00:04:07.440> set<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:07.950> said<00:04:08.130> I've<00:04:08.220> already

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
reverse set like I said I've already

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.940 
reverse set like I said I've already
showed<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.820> off<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.150> another<00:04:09.330> video<00:04:09.830> so<00:04:10.830> it's

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
showed this off in another video so it's

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.820 
showed this off in another video so it's
not<00:04:11.100> anything<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.300> spectacular<00:04:13.230> but

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
not anything really that spectacular but

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.940 
not anything really that spectacular but
the<00:04:14.550> reverses<00:04:15.030> are<00:04:15.300> pretty<00:04:15.840> difficult<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.470> get

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
the reverses are pretty difficult to get

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.409 
the reverses are pretty difficult to get
in<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.220> complete<00:04:17.609> set<00:04:17.850> just<00:04:17.970> because<00:04:18.270> there's

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
in a complete set just because there's

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.170 
in a complete set just because there's
so<00:04:18.600> many<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.080> if<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.799> didn't<00:04:20.130> have<00:04:20.310> all<00:04:20.970> the

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
so many and if I didn't have all the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.810 
so many and if I didn't have all the
fantastic<00:04:21.570> traders<00:04:22.140> on<00:04:22.320> YouTube<00:04:22.820> I'd

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400
