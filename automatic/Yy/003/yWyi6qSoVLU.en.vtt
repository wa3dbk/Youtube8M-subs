00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 but 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:20.539
 But I have a question 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.239
 Recently there has been a tendency to 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.169
 increase employee activity 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.220

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.340
 identify 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.680
 the apartments are rented out and 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.589
 application of appropriate sanctions 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.970
 owners who split and 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.620
 entrepreneurship mouth is it so or not 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.170
 and how this topic is relevant now 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.269
 for those who are engaged in iron 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.220
 and further with observed activity and teach 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.739
 with local number you are assigned brothers 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.379
 apartments that may be rented in 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.350
 rent with appearance and payer 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.229

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:04.640

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.460
 consequences for the owner of the same me 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.170
 bitches come if if Hector will 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.979
 parallel revealed naturally that 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.710
 the proprietor knows illegally does not pay 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.710

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.950
 three years in prison for 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.200
 illegal renting an apartment over the eyes 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.540
 legs and calm everything is very revealing 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.660
 slice of taxes there 20 percent over 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.890
 platinum agitation percent up if 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.979
 amount too large 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 one and a half million should have told you how 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.590
 a specialist could say well about 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.110

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.149
 stored on the role unfortunately we don't have 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.399
 such information because companies 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.210
 concluded doing a contract 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.670
