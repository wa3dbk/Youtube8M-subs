 social networks let's start gentlemen 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.029
 what they are and compare the size in a video 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.950
 of the playstation 4 and the playstation3 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.629
 the company power has been destroyed a u 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.510
 another one on the envelope his new console in 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.579
 this occasion as a comparison between this 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.589
 and the current platform to do where 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.899
 the reduction in the dimensions of the 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.370
 playstation 4 with what the playstation3 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.190
 It is clear that gentlemen I was not

 that the old one to the first one that came out 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.960
 and it is not no big surprise 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.780
 make them to be so that whenever they go to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.999
 be a new console are always being 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.800
 comparing the console either to the 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.190
 different companies or within the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.640
