 Good 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:12.590

 say it began to design the panel to accommodate the 8-inch monitor I n series by vehicle type 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.750
 It is from 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.470
 I think from the 7-inch monitor punishment and say Tsu Na or not it that you do not have to prepare to Zassho 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.670
 but 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.670
 The attractiveness of the Noh l series is not only 8 type large screen 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.440
 At first , fit with the instrument panel is good 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 Aqua of the instrument panel is Kedomo'm left and right non-symmetrical 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 A pit that really courages because it is a dedicated pre-system 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.260
 If you look closely at this panel, it will round slowly 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.180
 This is easy to turn on the operation switch seen from the driver 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.960
 And it is a device to make it easy to do 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.230
