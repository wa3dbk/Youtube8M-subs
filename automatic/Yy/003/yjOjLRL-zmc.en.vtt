00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
subscribe now there's two ways of doing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
subscribe now there's two ways of doing
this<00:01:24.479> i'm<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> show<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.110> both<00:01:25.409> ways

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this i'm going to show you both ways

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
this i'm going to show you both ways
because<00:01:26.310> sometimes<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
because sometimes this way of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.789 
because sometimes this way of
downloading<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.110> doesn't<00:01:28.380> work<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.650> people

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
downloading it doesn't work for people

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
downloading it doesn't work for people
and<00:01:29.130> sometimes<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.970> other<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.270> doesn't<00:01:30.479> work

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and sometimes the other way doesn't work

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.600 
and sometimes the other way doesn't work
so<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:31.200> i<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.040> i'll<00:01:32.220> hit<00:01:32.369> subscribe

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
so the way i do it is i'll hit subscribe

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
so the way i do it is i'll hit subscribe
