00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.530
 hp and I got ready for that 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.419
 means she made me up and me 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.679
 have her hair hairdressed and if you 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.639
 then want to know what we afterwards 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.839
 to have experienced 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.549
 then you should necessarily 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.289
 Once again , this video has to be watched 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.520
 linked in the infobox and I hope 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.630
 you have a lot of fun now 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 our get ready or 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 we go first with my make 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.140
 up to because she has one 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.280
 great use of benefit to easy 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.410
 my face and my skin 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.410
 prepare and had afterwards 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 a foundation of bosch was used and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.230
 the one with a level beauty on mine 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 Face spread with a concealer 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.860
 she also has bourgeois 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.110
 also my dark circles and a few 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 redness and then also 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.580
 again knocked her finger 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 because she loves to knock one because he 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.739
 always thought that it was just how long 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.119
 holds and I have to give real right 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.740
 the whole thing was fixed with one 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.740
 brother this was from rimmel london 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.690
 with the hula bronze she then 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.950
 my face contoured and what i do 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.630
 I learned that you are also under the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.790
 neck has to compete because there will be 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.500
 her head shadow therefore helps 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.600
 just a lot and makes it all 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.370
 a little bit more round a flush from 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.180
 patrice she then hunger 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.180
 browser set 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.810
 and married a little bit 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.130
 and then his eyebrows came 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.540
 just pulled her a little bit 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.540
 and then brushed off 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.890
 there 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.890
 there 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.780
 Why 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.550
 and on we went with an eyeshadow 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.190
 primer she has very cautious 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.650
 worn and also important at the bottom 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.750
 eyelash wreath and off we went 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.670
 she has the eyeshadow first 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.130
 married under the eyebrows and 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.470
 then the color is raging from the lok 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.000
 program palette on the whole song 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.960
 applied with a blind brush 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.760
 then the color was stable 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.680
 which one uses them especially in the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.230
 However, eyeliner has also applied 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.060
 always blending gently that's what she is called 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.470
 Apply with one brush and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.960
 dazzling with the other brush over it 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.090
 it's a bit fluffy the color ghana 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.470
 she used next and she has 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.310
 she on the whole moving lid 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.560
 applied 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.690
 has given this bronze worse 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.580
 and I think it's very blatant 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.260
 because this color has my eyes like that 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.460
 you can see that you are really blue 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.230
 a bit too here too 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.790
 the whole thing a bit too 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.370
 So tomorrow at the lower lash line 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.970
 follow suit with a kajal 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.190
 emphasize waterline 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.290
 she also has the inner corner of her eye 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.030
 married again a little bit 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.440
 and then with a 1 1 after me one 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.440
 drawn normal eyeliner 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.990
 Nevertheless, turn the eyelashes and with one 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.990
 mascara showering 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.680
 we have everything again on 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.420
 another eye and also 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.590
 again at the end of the eyes and on the shower 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.080
 Finally she has to rimmel London 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.050
 the lip gloss in the farm music clips 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.700
 applied and a little bit of 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.700
 Essens natural beauty about it 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.310
 so here the focus is clearly on 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.550
 the eyes 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.920
 and as I said and my eyes 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.690
 act really extreme blue I 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.060
 really blatant think that's because 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.860
 that this reddish bronx colored the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.990
 complementary color is too blue and that 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.520
 act all the glaring can be passed 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.230
 However, it with hair 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.030
 I have the first h partie first 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.040
 roughly divided and then I have 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.040
 started to attack her behind the head 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.070
 then I put the strands afterwards 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.170
 forward so they do not get in the way 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.400
 are and then just get all the hair 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.650
 back and brush the surface 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.410
 a bit smooth and turn the hair 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.430
 a little bit and then 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.050
 I push that up a bit 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.790
 by a little bit more volume too 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.070
 to have 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.050
 and then when it arrives with everything firmly 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.640
 was it her here to act looks for this 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.180
 I have an extra tutorial in the 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.130
 infobox 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.690
 namely, a small strand parts 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.390
 put her back in two and actually do 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.340
 the whole time normal knots so 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.990
 are really why shoe ties knot 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.960
 Here I go slowly I just go 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.460
 with two fingers in this bend purely 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.630
 and many that by that one sees 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.880
 a bit more complicated with me though 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.950
 It's just easier with hair too 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.930
 work when you knot that is 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.970
 just pass each other through 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.450
 stuck and the strand partie and 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.450
 pull through 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.849
 So basically just knot 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.530
 make floods after knots and then have 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.740
 I wrapped this around my hand like you did 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.240
 can see 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.580
 That rolled against her head 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.979
 pressed and again on the head a little 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.030
 a little bit screwed in just like it was nice 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.530
 looked and then as possible 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.280
 pinned over cross so that too 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.319
 really well we do the same 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.270
 now with a next strand so 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.569
 just lots knot back inside 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.569
 do 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.180
 and here, for example, I have one 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.740
 I have used other technique 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.870
 just a normal knot 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.620
 I did not do that completely 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.270
 I can and I can do it now 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.180
 drape as I like and to the 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.600
 press the head and tighten accordingly 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.180
 tie 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.040
 like I said the video is in the 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.630
 infobox then you understand that we are 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.630
 really could be stuck perfectly 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.750
 then we can already do the front 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.950
 partie to make that we put away 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.930
 had on the side of the crest where I 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.040
 have more hair I log now first 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.040
 all hair thoroughly 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.759
 it simply has a funny human the 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.809
 you have to let her and then I have 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.330
 the hair a little bit 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:34.399
 combed through and slightly backwards 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.069
 Just screw it in so it's from the front 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:38.539
 and looked nice from the rear that is 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.749
 not a bit loose, either 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.749
 strict 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.360
 and then scared the other one over the other 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.310
 I'll just fix it 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.419
 I did not lure the other side 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.520
 Of course you can do that if you 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.199
 but just want it relatively 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.509
 stream taken back and also 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.509
 stuck and fixed with hairspray 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.320
 And that's how the whole hairstyle looks 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.440
 I think the hairstyle stands out 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.430
 so much fun and then it worked 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.720
 already going for us 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.490
 and if they know it now 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.300
 what we want because after that so 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.500
 have experienced 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.450
 then you should definitely do that 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.850
 watch video of hp i have it here 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.750
 linked on the screen or 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.030
 of course in the infobox for 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.100

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.750
 subscribe to the next video reunion 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.650

 bye then
