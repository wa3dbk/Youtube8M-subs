the<00:01:29.159> current<00:01:29.460> rate<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.240> awesome

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the current rate I think that is awesome

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
the current rate I think that is awesome
it's<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> nice<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:31.020> nifty<00:01:31.290> touch<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.770> number

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's a nice little nifty touch so number

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's a nice little nifty touch so number
two<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.670> notification<00:01:33.240> panel<00:01:33.420> itself<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
two is the notification panel itself and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
two is the notification panel itself and
this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.680> actually<00:01:35.070> legitimately<00:01:35.640> redesigned

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this is actually legitimately redesigned

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.429 
this is actually legitimately redesigned
I<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.960> take<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.290> bit

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
I think it's going to take a little bit

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.140 
I think it's going to take a little bit
of<00:01:37.530> getting<00:01:37.680> used<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.820> definitely

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
of getting used to and it's definitely

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
of getting used to and it's definitely
the<00:01:39.329> biggest<00:01:39.689> change<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> notifications

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
things will behave what I'm getting out

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.910 
things will behave what I'm getting out
of<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.150> basically<00:03:00.750> now<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.770> able

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
of it is you basically now will be able

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.700 
of it is you basically now will be able
to<00:03:02.160> see<00:03:02.400> with<00:03:02.850> animations<00:03:03.480> where<00:03:04.200> everything

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
to see with animations where everything

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.340 
to see with animations where everything
came<00:03:05.190> from<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.850> where<00:03:06.330> everything<00:03:06.660> goes<00:03:07.140> so

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
came from and where everything goes so

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.080 
came from and where everything goes so
every<00:03:07.560> time<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.740> new<00:03:07.860> element<00:03:08.370> appears<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.060> your

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
every time a new element appears on your

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.820 
every time a new element appears on your
screen<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.630> doesn't<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:09.960> explode<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:10.620> your

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
screen it doesn't just explode on your

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.410 
screen it doesn't just explode on your
screen<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.310> appear<00:03:11.610> out<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.790> nowhere<00:03:12.030> it

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
screen and appear out of nowhere it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.350 
screen and appear out of nowhere it
slides<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.650> from<00:03:13.860> somewhere<00:03:14.280> or<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.700> expands

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
slides in from somewhere or it expands

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.900 
slides in from somewhere or it expands
or<00:03:15.510> grows<00:03:15.870> out<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.410> something<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.790> new

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
or grows out of something so it's a new

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.120 
or grows out of something so it's a new
it's<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.270> new<00:03:18.300> look<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:19.350> course<00:03:19.620> all<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
it's a new look and of course all of the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.070 
it's a new look and of course all of the
stock<00:03:20.490> apps<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:21.120> Android<00:03:21.270> L<00:03:21.690> will<00:03:21.959> be

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
stock apps in Android L will be

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.110 
stock apps in Android L will be
redesigned<00:03:22.620> when<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:22.980> fully<00:03:23.280> complete<00:03:23.760> but

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
redesigned when it's fully complete but

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.610 
redesigned when it's fully complete but
in<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.270> developer<00:03:24.660> preview<00:03:24.840> only<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.320> couple

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
in this developer preview only a couple

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.440 
in this developer preview only a couple
of<00:03:25.800> them<00:03:25.980> are<00:03:26.160> done<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:26.970> can<00:03:27.090> take<00:03:27.240> a<00:03:27.270> look

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
of them are done but we can take a look

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.060 
of them are done but we can take a look
at<00:03:27.600> them<00:03:27.780> obviously<00:03:28.170> checking<00:03:28.740> out<00:03:28.920> the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
at them obviously checking out the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.710 
at them obviously checking out the
calculator<00:03:29.610> this<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:29.940> one<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.300> most<00:03:30.450> basic

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
calculator this is one of the most basic

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.990 
calculator this is one of the most basic
looks<00:03:31.260> at<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.040> again<00:03:32.220> everything<00:03:32.459> slides

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
looks at it but again everything slides

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.460 
looks at it but again everything slides
in<00:03:33.240> from<00:03:33.450> somewhere<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.990> all<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.200> movement

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
in from somewhere and all this movement

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.260 
in from somewhere and all this movement
and<00:03:34.740> animation<00:03:35.220> gives<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.580> confidence<00:03:35.910> about

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
and animation gives you confidence about

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.699 
and animation gives you confidence about
what<00:03:36.390> you're<00:03:36.780> doing<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.200> where<00:03:37.350> things<00:03:37.590> are

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
what you're doing and where things are

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.770 
what you're doing and where things are
going<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.730> also<00:03:38.850> see<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.270> new<00:03:39.390> people

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
going you also see it in the new people

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.090 
going you also see it in the new people
app<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.200> new<00:03:40.290> dialer<00:03:40.739> all<00:03:40.950> these

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
app and the new dialer all these

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.580 
app and the new dialer all these
animations<00:03:41.400> are<00:03:41.850> super<00:03:42.720> smooth<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.410> guess

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
animations are super smooth and I guess

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.199 
animations are super smooth and I guess
intuitive<00:03:44.220> even<00:03:44.520> if<00:03:44.610> they're<00:03:44.760> not<00:03:44.940> totally

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
intuitive even if they're not totally

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.510 
intuitive even if they're not totally
necessary<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:46.080> Google<00:03:46.860> mentioned<00:03:47.220> its<00:03:47.340> goal

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
necessary and Google mentioned its goal

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.130 
necessary and Google mentioned its goal
is<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.820> have<00:03:47.970> all<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.540> these<00:03:48.660> animations

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
is to have all of these animations

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.830 
is to have all of these animations
happen<00:03:49.680> at<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> smooth<00:03:50.220> 60<00:03:51.060> frames<00:03:51.270> per<00:03:51.360> second

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
happen at a smooth 60 frames per second

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.240 
happen at a smooth 60 frames per second
so<00:03:51.959> you'll<00:03:52.080> never<00:03:52.260> noticed<00:03:52.560> any<00:03:52.680> stutter<00:03:53.040> or

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
so you'll never noticed any stutter or

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.830 
so you'll never noticed any stutter or
lag<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.790> got<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.000> say<00:03:54.120> I'm<00:03:54.239> actually<00:03:54.450> pretty

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
lag and I got to say I'm actually pretty

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.300 
lag and I got to say I'm actually pretty
impressed<00:03:55.170> with<00:03:55.230> how<00:03:55.380> consistently<00:03:55.980> smooth

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
impressed with how consistently smooth

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.610 
impressed with how consistently smooth
it's<00:03:56.489> been<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:57.270> far<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:57.780> Nexus<00:03:58.140> 5<00:03:58.350> so

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
it's been so far on this Nexus 5 so

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.720 
it's been so far on this Nexus 5 so
honestly<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.250> probably<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.700> most

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
honestly this is probably the most

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.670 
honestly this is probably the most
important<00:04:00.420> change<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.170> new<00:04:01.320> version<00:04:01.500> of

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
important change of this new version of

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.080 
important change of this new version of
Android<00:04:01.860> as<00:04:02.220> things<00:04:02.400> move<00:04:02.610> forward<00:04:02.640> I'm

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
Android as things move forward I'm

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.180 
Android as things move forward I'm
pretty<00:04:03.300> pumped<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.570> see<00:04:03.630> more<00:04:03.989> apps<00:04:04.200> moving<00:04:05.100> in

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
pretty pumped to see more apps moving in

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.590 
pretty pumped to see more apps moving in
this<00:04:05.250> direction<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.940> we'll<00:04:06.030> see<00:04:06.239> what<00:04:06.480> this

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
this direction and we'll see what this

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.090 
this direction and we'll see what this
ends<00:04:06.840> up<00:04:06.900> looking<00:04:06.989> like<00:04:07.200> when<00:04:07.530> Android<00:04:07.830> L<00:04:07.980> is

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
ends up looking like when Android L is

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.220 
ends up looking like when Android L is
done<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.520> number<00:04:08.730> four<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.510> new<00:04:09.690> Settings

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
done so number four is the new Settings

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.410 
done so number four is the new Settings
app<00:04:10.500> in<00:04:10.800> Android<00:04:11.040> L<00:04:11.370> it's<00:04:12.030> actually<00:04:12.300> been

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
app in Android L it's actually been

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.570 
app in Android L it's actually been
completely<00:04:12.660> redesigned<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.950> actually<00:04:14.550> a

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
completely redesigned and actually a

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.159 
completely redesigned and actually a
little<00:04:14.730> bit<00:04:14.880> reorganized<00:04:15.420> so<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.840> course<00:04:15.959> it

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
little bit reorganized so of course it

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
little bit reorganized so of course it
starts<00:04:16.470> with<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> new<00:04:16.830> icon<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.580> when<00:04:18.030> you

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
starts with the new icon and when you

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.820 
starts with the new icon and when you
open<00:04:18.330> it<00:04:18.390> up<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> totally<00:04:19.530> different

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
open it up it is a totally different

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.110 
open it up it is a totally different
look<00:04:19.950> almost<00:04:20.340> looks<00:04:20.520> like<00:04:20.580> someone<00:04:20.940> put<00:04:20.970> a

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
look almost looks like someone put a

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.719 
look almost looks like someone put a
theme<00:04:21.450> on<00:04:21.479> top<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.169> old<00:04:22.289> Settings<00:04:22.770> app<00:04:22.979> the

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
theme on top of the old Settings app the

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.140 
theme on top of the old Settings app the
scroll<00:04:24.030> effect<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.570> different

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
scroll effect is different

4.4 KitKat besides the fact that it's

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.899

switched entirely over to the new art

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.969 
switched entirely over to the new art
runtime<00:05:52.419> but<00:05:52.599> it's<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.840> new<00:05:53.080> different<00:05:53.470> polish

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.350 
runtime but it's a new different polish
now<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:54.250> know<00:05:54.490> it's<00:05:54.639> a<00:05:54.699> different<00:05:54.849> type<00:05:55.180> of

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
now you know it's a different type of

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.540 
now you know it's a different type of
feel<00:05:55.630> for<00:05:56.199> stock<00:05:56.470> Android<00:05:56.919> definitely<00:05:57.310> very

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
feel for stock Android definitely very

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.360 
feel for stock Android definitely very
different<00:05:57.970> from<00:05:58.419> the<00:05:58.780> typical<00:05:59.110> Android<00:05:59.740> 4.4

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
different from the typical Android 4.4

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.029 
different from the typical Android 4.4
KitKat<00:06:00.760> holo<00:06:01.479> look<00:06:01.990> that<00:06:02.229> we're<00:06:02.380> used<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.740> it's

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
KitKat holo look that we're used to it's

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.700 
KitKat holo look that we're used to it's
basically<00:06:03.639> a<00:06:03.729> departure<00:06:04.150> from<00:06:04.449> holo<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.560> it

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
basically a departure from holo and it

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.770 
basically a departure from holo and it
definitely<00:06:05.860> feels<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:06.760> looks<00:06:06.970> that<00:06:07.150> way<00:06:07.389> it

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
definitely feels and looks that way it

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.870 
definitely feels and looks that way it
even<00:06:08.110> kind<00:06:08.380> of<00:06:08.440> reminds<00:06:08.800> me<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:08.949> HTC<00:06:09.400> Sense<00:06:09.669> the

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
even kind of reminds me of HTC Sense the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.089 
even kind of reminds me of HTC Sense the
way<00:06:10.000> HTC<00:06:10.630> Sense<00:06:10.900> has<00:06:11.080> been<00:06:11.260> flattening<00:06:11.740> itself

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
way HTC Sense has been flattening itself

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.860 
way HTC Sense has been flattening itself
out<00:06:12.280> over<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:12.610> past<00:06:12.699> couple<00:06:12.940> of<00:06:13.120> years<00:06:13.180> we're

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
out over the past couple of years we're

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.080 
out over the past couple of years we're
starting<00:06:14.260> to<00:06:14.320> see<00:06:14.380> Android<00:06:14.979> in<00:06:15.159> this<00:06:15.760> version

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
starting to see Android in this version

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.420 
starting to see Android in this version
of<00:06:16.180> Android<00:06:16.479> L<00:06:16.659> flattened<00:06:17.199> itself<00:06:17.500> out<00:06:17.710> and
