00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.280 

so<00:00:14.470> what's<00:00:14.710> happened<00:00:15.130> because<00:00:15.490> this<00:00:16.290> is

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
so what's happened because this is

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.560 
so what's happened because this is
hooked<00:00:17.590> into<00:00:17.800> here<00:00:18.160> so<00:00:18.670> when<00:00:18.850> I<00:00:18.970> switch<00:00:19.330> this

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
hooked into here so when I switch this

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.030 
hooked into here so when I switch this
on<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.430> exhaust<00:00:21.900> vacuum<00:00:22.900> starts<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.529> work<00:00:23.710> so

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
on the exhaust vacuum starts to work so

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.760 
on the exhaust vacuum starts to work so
it<00:00:24.099> takes<00:00:24.340> all<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.580> dust<00:00:24.880> out<00:00:25.090> as<00:00:25.270> well<00:00:25.770> this

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
it takes all the dust out as well this

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.700 
it takes all the dust out as well this
has<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:26.980> little<00:00:27.250> depth<00:00:27.520> gauge<00:00:27.820> on<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.180> front

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
has a little depth gauge on the front

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.870 
has a little depth gauge on the front
and<00:00:29.710> I'm<00:00:29.829> going<00:00:29.860> to<00:00:30.040> put<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.340> down<00:00:30.489> to<00:00:30.640> about

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
and I'm going to put it down to about

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.100 
and I'm going to put it down to about
one<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.300> half<00:00:32.130> mil<00:00:33.130> deep<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.810> be<00:00:34.930> able

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
one and a half mil deep just to be able

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.180 
one and a half mil deep just to be able
to<00:00:35.410> take<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:36.060> skin<00:00:37.060> off<00:00:37.090> here<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.070> idea

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
to take the skin off here and the idea

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.349 
to take the skin off here and the idea
of<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.350> my<00:00:41.559> depth<00:00:41.859> here<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:43.149> this

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
of that this is my depth here and this

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.080 
of that this is my depth here and this
is<00:00:43.510> my<00:00:43.660> guide<00:00:43.899> plate<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:45.370> by<00:00:45.519> taking<00:00:45.760> this

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
is my guide plate so by taking this

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.259 
is my guide plate so by taking this
changing<00:00:47.079> this<00:00:47.199> up<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.590> down<00:00:47.769> I<00:00:48.269> have

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
changing this up and down I have

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.389 
changing this up and down I have
different<00:00:49.510> depths<00:00:49.989> on<00:00:50.379> through<00:00:50.710> on<00:00:50.949> my<00:00:51.100> planer

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
different depths on through on my planer

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.119 
different depths on through on my planer
okay<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:53.379> planer<00:00:54.219> here<00:00:55.589> actually<00:00:56.589> by

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
okay this planer here actually by

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.459 
okay this planer here actually by
switching<00:00:57.609> this<00:00:57.699> over<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.390> can<00:00:59.199> have<00:00:59.350> the

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
switching this over I can have the

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.329 
switching this over I can have the
exhaust<00:00:59.829> going<00:01:00.250> left<00:01:00.460> or<00:01:00.670> right<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.620> it's<00:01:03.129> good

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
exhaust going left or right so it's good

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.030 
exhaust going left or right so it's good
for<00:01:03.370> left-handed<00:01:04.089> people<00:01:04.300> as<00:01:04.629> well<00:01:04.980> it's<00:01:05.980> a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
for left-handed people as well it's a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.490 
for left-handed people as well it's a
good<00:01:06.190> idea<00:01:07.260> right

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:25.340 

you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.060 

the<00:01:26.350> problem<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.630> curve<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
the problem is because of that curve the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.969 
the problem is because of that curve the
plane<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.549> not<00:01:30.700> going<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:31.030> sit<00:01:31.590> into<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.740> Oh

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
plane is not going to sit into this Oh

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.590 
plane is not going to sit into this Oh
what<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.130> have<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.460> do<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.820> have<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.149> turn<00:01:34.390> it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
what I have to do is I have to turn it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.969 
what I have to do is I have to turn it
sideways<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.070> planer<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:37.570> scoops

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:51.480 

so<00:01:41.979> my<00:01:42.159> planner<00:01:42.490> angles<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:51.159> going<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.429> be

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
so my planner angles are going to be

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:03.760 
so my planner angles are going to be
like<00:01:51.789> that<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.799> board

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.560 

okay<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:08.100> get<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> really<00:02:08.369> good<00:02:08.820> rocker

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
okay so to get a really good rocker

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.380 
okay so to get a really good rocker
through<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.350> board<00:02:10.710> here<00:02:11.120> I'm<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
through this board here I'm going to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.960 
through this board here I'm going to
pull<00:02:12.600> his<00:02:12.750> nose<00:02:13.050> over<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.280> I'm

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
pull his nose over a little bit I'm

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.840 
pull his nose over a little bit I'm
actually<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.540> create<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:16.170> nose<00:02:16.500> rocker

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
actually going to create a nose rocker

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.480 
actually going to create a nose rocker
down<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.970> about<00:02:18.270> here<00:02:18.720> from<00:02:19.680> about<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.190> area

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
down to about here from about this area

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.630 
down to about here from about this area
so<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:22.740> just<00:02:23.070> take

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
so what I'm going to do is just take

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.290 
so what I'm going to do is just take
that<00:02:23.850> little<00:02:24.090> piece<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.480> foam<00:02:25.070> out<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.220> there

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.020 

and<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:31.110> pull<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.040> last<00:02:32.400> little<00:02:32.550> nose<00:02:32.820> down

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and just pull that last little nose down

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.320 
and just pull that last little nose down
and<00:02:33.270> also<00:02:33.690> thin<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> nose<00:02:34.760> okay<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.150> first

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
and also thin the nose okay so the first

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.580 
and also thin the nose okay so the first
thing<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.170> take<00:02:37.410> this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
thing I'm going to do is take this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.950 
thing I'm going to do is take this
little<00:02:37.650> area<00:02:38.040> off<00:02:38.340> here<00:02:38.700> I'm<00:02:39.600> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> use

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
little area off here I'm going to use

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.090 
little area off here I'm going to use
the<00:02:40.200> same<00:02:41.120> setting<00:02:42.120> which<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.510> not<00:02:42.870> not<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.860> lot

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
the same setting which is not not a lot

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.400 
the same setting which is not not a lot
but<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.550> just<00:02:44.790> enough<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.330> I'm<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.660> do

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
but it's just enough and I'm going to do

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.140 
but it's just enough and I'm going to do
a<00:02:46.440> bit<00:02:46.650> here<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> bit<00:02:47.190> there<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.580> work<00:02:47.790> my<00:02:47.970> way

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
a bit here a bit there and work my way

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:56.630 
a bit here a bit there and work my way
through<00:02:54.530> I'm<00:02:55.530> going<00:02:55.710> to<00:02:55.770> do<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> same<00:02:56.250> down<00:02:56.490> on

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
through I'm going to do the same down on

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.180 
through I'm going to do the same down on
the<00:02:56.760> tail<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.450> I'm<00:02:58.380> going<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.560> pull<00:02:58.770> this<00:02:58.920> last

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the tail and I'm going to pull this last

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.120 
the tail and I'm going to pull this last
little<00:02:59.430> piece<00:02:59.730> off<00:02:59.970> here<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:01.770> thin<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
little piece off here just to thin the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.660 
little piece off here just to thin the
tail<00:03:02.340> down<00:03:03.380> exactly<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.590> same<00:03:04.800> way<00:03:05.070> so

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
tail down exactly the same way so

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.940 
tail down exactly the same way so
pulling<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> tail<00:03:06.989> off<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.320> end<00:03:07.410> about<00:03:07.530> here

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.440 

the<00:03:13.950> next<00:03:14.100> thing<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.459> going<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> do<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.270> I'm

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.560 
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> put<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> single<00:03:16.140> concave<00:03:16.830> in<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:18.209> so

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
going to put a single concave in here so

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.020 
going to put a single concave in here so
this<00:03:18.780> single<00:03:18.959> concave<00:03:19.550> is<00:03:20.550> going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> run

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
this single concave is going to run

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.740 
this single concave is going to run
through<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.420> area<00:03:22.160> through<00:03:23.160> here<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:24.600> then

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
through this area through here and then

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.590 
through this area through here and then
I'm<00:03:24.870> going<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.050> do<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> double<00:03:25.470> concave<00:03:26.600> which

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
I'm going to do a double concave which

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.500 
I'm going to do a double concave which
is<00:03:27.750> going<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.989> run<00:03:28.140> through<00:03:28.440> here<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.360> is

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
is going to run through here so this is

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.100 
is going to run through here so this is
going<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:31.820> like<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.540> this<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.930> going

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
going to be like that and this is going

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.800 
going to be like that and this is going
to<00:03:34.200> be<00:03:34.380> like<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.430> obviously<00:03:36.120> not<00:03:36.300> as<00:03:36.420> big<00:03:36.660> as

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
to be like that obviously not as big as

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:48.230 
to be like that obviously not as big as
that

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.900 

you

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.280 

got<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.030> I've<00:03:57.210> got<00:03:57.240> this<00:03:57.540> little<00:03:57.720> concave

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
got this I've got this little concave

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.500 
got this I've got this little concave
that<00:03:58.530> I've<00:03:58.620> actually<00:03:58.800> cut<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.370> and<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.360> can

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that I've actually cut in and you can

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.810 
that I've actually cut in and you can
see<00:04:00.690> I've<00:04:00.840> done<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.290> steps<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:05.610> then<00:04:05.730> it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
see I've done it in steps and then it

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.750 
see I've done it in steps and then it
come<00:04:06.030> through<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.540> nose<00:04:06.720> rocker<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:08.520> same

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
come through the nose rocker the same

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.360 
come through the nose rocker the same
thing<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.210> back<00:04:09.830> I've<00:04:10.830> got<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:11.040> little<00:04:11.250> bit

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
thing in the back I've got a little bit

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.190 
thing in the back I've got a little bit
of<00:04:11.459> concave<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.150> we're<00:04:12.300> not<00:04:12.390> clean<00:04:12.780> all<00:04:12.959> this

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
of concave so we're not clean all this

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.410 
of concave so we're not clean all this
up<00:04:13.260> take<00:04:14.130> all<00:04:14.310> these<00:04:14.459> lines<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:15.030> I'll<00:04:15.180> end<00:04:15.330> up

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
up take all these lines that I'll end up

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.020 
up take all these lines that I'll end up
with<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.660> nice<00:04:16.070> smooth<00:04:17.070> concave<00:04:17.670> running

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
with a nice smooth concave running

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.900 
with a nice smooth concave running
through<00:04:18.299> all<00:04:18.420> of<00:04:18.540> these<00:04:18.720> bits<00:04:18.989> here<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.910> the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
through all of these bits here and the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.750 
through all of these bits here and the
idea<00:04:21.540> of<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.750> planer<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:23.370> have<00:04:23.520> cut

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
idea of the planer is that have cut

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.520 
idea of the planer is that have cut
cleaner<00:04:24.120> than<00:04:24.390> what<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.690> shaping<00:04:25.140> machines

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
cleaner than what the shaping machines

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.850 
cleaner than what the shaping machines
or<00:04:25.770> cut<00:04:26.660> makes<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.840> really<00:04:28.020> quick<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.530> finish

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
or cut makes it really quick to finish

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.440 
or cut makes it really quick to finish
off<00:04:29.120> turn<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.330> one<00:04:30.570> on<00:04:30.750> and<00:04:31.110> change<00:04:32.040> the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
off turn this one on and change the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.330 
off turn this one on and change the
bottom<00:04:33.450> look<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.260> what's<00:04:34.680> going<00:04:34.919> on<00:04:35.130> on<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
bottom look of what's going on on the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.790 
bottom look of what's going on on the
board<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:35.760> now<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.970> can<00:04:36.210> see<00:04:36.419> any<00:04:36.630> little<00:04:36.930> marks

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
board so now I can see any little marks

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.770 
board so now I can see any little marks
and<00:04:38.070> dips<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.550> things<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.060> need<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:39.720> to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
and dips and things that I need you to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:55.559 
and dips and things that I need you to
take<00:04:39.990> off<00:04:40.370> start<00:04:41.370> from<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.640> front

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.629 

you
