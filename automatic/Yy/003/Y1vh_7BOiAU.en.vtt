00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.000
 what does people do at the start and 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.920
 I hope you all are fine 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.250
 Today I will talk about the new weapon 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.690
 Talk about the teleporter 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.689
 First of all, that's worth it 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.310
 exclusive so an explosive replaces that 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.720
 de facto means that the passage to 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.119
 example either with it or with the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.520
 tank tinkering around or with the rtl 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.480
 but that does not matter or for example the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.070
 Soldier whose grenade replaces the leads 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.600
 me directly to say that 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.270
 this weapon actually my opinion 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.370
 the most meaningful for men is there 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.859
 As a man, you are usually in mg l 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.530
 and that one uses it to ghana or 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.460
 runner to counter 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.980
 But you do not need that one anymore 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.019
 then can still teleport away 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.539
 so that works so you're throwing 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.550
 your teleporter somewhere and soon 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.230
 you press right click opens up so 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.390
 One year, a little blue one will appear 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.940
 animation and 12 seconds later 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.270
 teleport to place and place me 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.020
 just can see very well 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.980
 Worth knowing is that you are doing it 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.740
 can move 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.900
 which is good that you elixir it 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.340
 can use what are mostly the 1 2 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.960
 Seconds still needed to get around 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.250
 so extremely practical and what to run 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.590
 yes, I have seen synonymous stop here 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.409
 The whole story is told you can just do that 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.700
 Part of hanging on vehicles, for example 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.560
 and then if you go behind it 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.200
 you have to deport a spam around 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.280
 enter and you are immediately in it 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.500
 or you can also get an unattainable 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.360
 If he knows, he will not go there 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.170
 unreachable forest is just easier 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.729
 data to come 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.950
 You can even do the things 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.530
 enemy car chuck something extreme 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.180
 only one has to be careful 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.920
 that you rather throw it on the back 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.500
 because you are in the vaart behind it 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.159
 deported then you become more often 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.750
 rothschild attaches to my friend and 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.270
 worth knowing is in any case like you 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.759
 See a friend of the counseling colleague 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.990
 from me can pick up your teleporter 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.130
 with a vehicle and now 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 I teleport and am easy 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.440
 sometimes 100 employees in the air so that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 offers so many choices 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.190
 here would enumerate all individually 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.660
 frame of the video blow up but you see 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.569
 I am very excited about this 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.659
 thing especially from the enders 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.569
 ass brings him so much as a runner and 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.260
 As a nakba brink is such an extremely much 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.599
 if you just hold his position quickly 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.599
 can change and especially as a mandy 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.609
 escaping from ever-present situations 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.250
 can 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.450
 and yes, for example, if you kilt 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.639
 with a knife, I'm not the one 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.750
 defector but if you do that then 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.370
 you can right after out 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.079
 Teleport or if you hurt a lot 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.620
 gets because it was back quickly 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.989
 and has become full again 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.349
 my tip is that you have his 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.450
 Teleporter always throws you with it later 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.790
 Just look back in an emergency 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.019
 can actually go where ever 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.069
 this shows one to be destroyed by the enemy 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.730
 So rather somewhere where you do not 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.769
 looks 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.620
 and here you can see it coming 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.939
 I have four hp and I'm running 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.669
 am i going to alex her blood call me 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.560
 me and escaped so that's just the 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.400
 Advantage of this weapon I am pleased 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.870
 really 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.909
 to have bought this weapon and become 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.230
 you may play more often in the future 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.489
 come later again comments about it 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.799
 if i have more experience from this 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.250
 weapon but for now it was that 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.269
 from me 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.959
 Here you can see in what the fuck 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.849
 moment I have that just that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.190
 teleporter into the car and wonder 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.609
 me what's going on colorless and see 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.810
 because it depends on the mature I am so 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.939
 thought broken I was with a friend 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.659
 in the skate contest was so loud that 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.970
 but had to leave so well I hope 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.260
 next time you look nice 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.260
 weekend and skin in
