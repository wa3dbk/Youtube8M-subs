make to how to paint a rusty surface so
we<00:00:08.610> lost<00:00:08.940> left<00:00:09.150> off

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
we lost left off

we lost left off
I<00:00:10.250> have<00:00:11.269> created<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.690> scratches<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:14.309> can

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
I have created the scratches and you can

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.320 
I have created the scratches and you can
now<00:00:14.700> see<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.389> rust<00:00:15.660> underneath<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:17.880> we

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
now see the rust underneath and now we

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.740 
now see the rust underneath and now we
will<00:00:18.480> go<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.140> give<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.510> surface<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> little

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
will go and give this surface a little

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.740 
will go and give this surface a little
bit<00:00:22.020> more<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.470> three-dimensional<00:00:23.460> look<00:00:23.750> for

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750

bit more of three-dimensional look for
this<00:00:24.869> instance<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.230> triple<00:00:28.230> zero<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
very tiny brush and what I do now is I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.729 
very tiny brush and what I do now is I

then Charlotte blue so and a nice and
liquid<00:01:12.750> version<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.770> colors<00:01:14.840> good<00:01:15.840> start

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.580 

and<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.430> course<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:23.659> good<00:01:24.979> point<00:01:25.979> on

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
complaining about this tutorial that

complaining about this tutorial that
have<00:01:48.980> stolen<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.510> from<00:01:50.540> massive<00:01:51.290> food<00:01:51.530> oh<00:01:52.180> yeah

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
have stolen it from massive food oh yeah

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.360 
have stolen it from massive food oh yeah
where<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.960> be<00:01:54.110> honest<00:01:54.640> yes<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:55.940> did<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.370> the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
where to be honest yes I did and the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.090 
where to be honest yes I did and the
reason<00:01:58.700> why<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:58.910> did<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.800> simply<00:02:00.800> for<00:02:01.010> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
reason why I did this is simply for the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.090 
reason why I did this is simply for the
fact<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:02.720> video<00:02:02.840> from<00:02:03.260> Meza<00:02:03.500> Fudo<00:02:03.890> is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
fact that the video from Meza Fudo is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.410 
fact that the video from Meza Fudo is
only<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.640> German<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:06.610> well<00:02:08.560> only<00:02:09.790> 10%<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:11.210> my

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
only in German and well only 10% of my

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.870 
only in German and well only 10% of my
subscribers<00:02:12.050> are<00:02:12.200> German<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:14.320> in<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.530> whole

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
subscribers are German and in this whole

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.010 
subscribers are German and in this whole
YouTube<00:02:16.880> community<00:02:18.760> they're<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:20.120> mess<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.750> more

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
YouTube community they're a mess of more

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.630 
YouTube community they're a mess of more
amount<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.440> people<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.830> are<00:02:22.390> not<00:02:23.390> German<00:02:23.810> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
amount of people that are not German and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.690 
amount of people that are not German and
so<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.670> thought<00:02:26.090> well<00:02:26.870> why<00:02:27.820> should<00:02:28.820> we<00:02:30.700> don't

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
so I thought well why should we don't

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.360 
so I thought well why should we don't
let<00:02:32.030> everybody<00:02:32.540> else<00:02:33.020> know<00:02:33.590> how<00:02:34.160> this

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
let everybody else know how this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.790 
let everybody else know how this
technique<00:02:34.970> works<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.370> thought<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.360> myself

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
technique works so I thought to myself

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.130 
technique works so I thought to myself
well<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.130> can<00:02:40.640> do<00:02:40.820> this<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.240> translate<00:02:41.780> this

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
well I can do this I can translate this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.600 
well I can do this I can translate this
and<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.120> did<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.420> reason<00:02:47.750> why<00:02:47.900> I'm<00:02:48.610> so

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
and so I did and the reason why I'm so

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.210 
and so I did and the reason why I'm so
close<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.360> original<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.110> simply<00:02:51.950> for<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
close to the original is simply for the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.020 
close to the original is simply for the
fact<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.060> change<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.600> running<00:02:53.900> system<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
fact have a change of running system the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.630 
fact have a change of running system the
video<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.420> good<00:02:56.660> from<00:02:56.959> massive<00:02:57.290> ATO<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.610> I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
video is good from massive ATO and so I

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.490 
video is good from massive ATO and so I
did<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.660> stage<00:03:02.959> here<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.500> very<00:03:04.250> very<00:03:05.500> time

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
did so this stage here is very very time

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.760 
did so this stage here is very very time
intensive<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:09.100> well<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:11.120> make<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.450> real<00:03:11.770> the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
intensive and well to make it real the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.770 
intensive and well to make it real the
real<00:03:12.800> deal<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:14.239> you're<00:03:15.700> well<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.970> must

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
real deal and you're well you must

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.080 
real deal and you're well you must
highlight<00:03:18.050> almost<00:03:18.590> every<00:03:18.920> of<00:03:19.610> these

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
highlight almost every of these

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.940 
highlight almost every of these
scratches<00:03:22.180> but<00:03:23.180> in<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.989> end<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.530> worth<00:03:24.950> it

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
scratches but in the end it is worth it

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:49.500 
scratches but in the end it is worth it
so<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:27.980> hope<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:28.610> already<00:03:29.540> see<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.260> effect

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.000 

I<00:03:51.120> think<00:03:52.120> for<00:03:52.569> demonstration<00:03:53.230> purposes<00:03:53.680> this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
I think for demonstration purposes this

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.270 
I think for demonstration purposes this
is<00:03:54.159> enough<00:03:54.989> what<00:03:55.989> we<00:03:56.140> do<00:03:56.290> now<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:58.709> giving<00:03:59.709> this

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
is enough what we do now is giving this

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.449 
is enough what we do now is giving this
even<00:04:00.670> more<00:04:00.909> three-dimensional<00:04:01.840> look<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:03.220> a

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
even more three-dimensional look with a

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.699 
even more three-dimensional look with a
little<00:04:03.629> bit<00:04:04.629> of<00:04:04.659> ink

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
little bit of ink

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.600 
little bit of ink
well<00:04:05.920> massive<00:04:06.430> route<00:04:06.900> mixes<00:04:07.900> up<00:04:08.079> other<00:04:09.010> colors

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
well massive route mixes up other colors

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.050 
well massive route mixes up other colors
but<00:04:10.319> I've<00:04:11.319> prefer<00:04:11.890> wash<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.709> can<00:04:14.890> go<00:04:15.819> for

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
but I've prefer wash you can go for

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.129 
but I've prefer wash you can go for
yourself<00:04:16.150> what<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:17.019> prefer<00:04:17.590> now<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:19.750> are<00:04:19.930> now

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
yourself what you prefer now you are now

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.370 
yourself what you prefer now you are now
darken<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:21.549> upper<00:04:21.970> part<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:24.930> these<00:04:25.930> rust

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
darken the upper part of these rust

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:39.479 
darken the upper part of these rust
spots

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:39.489 

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:46.449 

you<00:04:40.489> might<00:04:40.669> lead<00:04:40.879> on<00:04:41.119> it<00:04:41.360> with<00:04:41.689> water<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:45.459> so

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:46.459 
you might lead on it with water and so

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:48.459 
you might lead on it with water and so
you<00:04:46.519> have<00:04:46.989> already<00:04:47.989> a<00:04:48.079> more

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
you have already a more

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:53.249 
you have already a more
three-dimensional<00:04:48.919> look<00:04:49.489> to<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:51.519> so<00:04:52.519> and<00:04:53.059> I

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
three-dimensional look to it so and I

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.129 
three-dimensional look to it so and I
think<00:04:54.259> that<00:04:54.529> for<00:04:55.599> demonstration<00:04:56.599> purpose<00:04:56.989> is

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
think that for demonstration purpose is

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.459 
think that for demonstration purpose is
also<00:04:57.379> enough<00:04:58.509> what<00:04:59.509> you<00:04:59.629> also<00:04:59.839> can<00:05:00.229> do<00:05:00.439> is<00:05:00.679> now

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
also enough what you also can do is now

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:08.709 
also enough what you also can do is now
create<00:05:03.469> a<00:05:04.209> water<00:05:05.209> line<00:05:06.819> rust<00:05:07.819> is<00:05:08.059> running<00:05:08.479> down

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
create a water line rust is running down

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.269 
create a water line rust is running down
the<00:05:09.110> surface<00:05:09.559> I<00:05:10.389> thought<00:05:11.389> that<00:05:11.509> instance<00:05:11.869> also

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 
the surface I thought that instance also

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.089 
the surface I thought that instance also
like<00:05:13.279> to<00:05:13.459> use<00:05:13.489> washes<00:05:14.139> on<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:15.529> masa<00:05:15.739> photo

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
like to use washes on the masa photo

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.850 
like to use washes on the masa photo
video<00:05:16.579> you<00:05:17.029> will<00:05:17.209> see<00:05:17.239> the<00:05:18.079> people<00:05:18.889> use<00:05:19.839> oil

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
video you will see the people use oil

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.669 
video you will see the people use oil
paints<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:22.099> that<00:05:22.539> but<00:05:23.539> I<00:05:23.569> think<00:05:23.899> that's<00:05:24.469> not

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:24.679 
paints for that but I think that's not

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.540 
paints for that but I think that's not
important

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:35.709 

simply<00:05:30.369> darken<00:05:31.369> the<00:05:31.519> surface<00:05:32.059> here<00:05:34.539> with<00:05:35.539> this

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
simply darken the surface here with this

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:41.829 
simply darken the surface here with this
wash<00:05:37.449> boom<00:05:39.789> always<00:05:40.789> in<00:05:40.939> straight<00:05:41.269> lines<00:05:41.569> down

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:41.839 
wash boom always in straight lines down

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.729 
wash boom always in straight lines down
and<00:05:42.819> for<00:05:43.819> this<00:05:43.939> instance<00:05:44.389> I'm<00:05:44.899> taking<00:05:45.379> Griffin

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:45.739 
and for this instance I'm taking Griffin

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:50.649 
and for this instance I'm taking Griffin
sepia<00:05:48.399> let<00:05:49.399> the<00:05:49.550> first<00:05:49.819> coat<00:05:49.939> dry<00:05:50.089> a<00:05:50.389> little

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
sepia let the first coat dry a little

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.959 
sepia let the first coat dry a little
bit<00:05:50.809> and<00:05:51.079> then<00:05:52.329> you<00:05:53.329> go<00:05:53.539> back<00:05:54.039> also<00:05:55.039> with<00:05:55.459> fine

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
bit and then you go back also with fine

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.179 
bit and then you go back also with fine
lines<00:05:56.179> but<00:05:56.689> not<00:05:57.489> the<00:05:58.489> whole<00:05:58.729> surface<00:05:59.119> now<00:05:59.449> me

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:00.189 
lines but not the whole surface now me

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:10.090 
lines but not the whole surface now me
let<00:06:01.189> me<00:06:01.339> save<00:06:01.579> three<00:06:02.469> water<00:06:03.469> lines

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:21.680 

so<00:06:12.110> like<00:06:13.110> this<00:06:14.390> let<00:06:15.390> this<00:06:15.600> dry<00:06:16.050> game<00:06:20.510> then<00:06:21.510> the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
so like this let this dry game then the

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.440 
so like this let this dry game then the
third<00:06:21.900> time<00:06:22.760> or<00:06:23.760> fourth<00:06:23.970> time<00:06:26.090> or<00:06:27.090> as<00:06:27.270> many

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
third time or fourth time or as many

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.230 
third time or fourth time or as many
times<00:06:27.810> as<00:06:28.020> you<00:06:28.170> wish

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
times as you wish

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.000 
times as you wish
and<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.330> more<00:06:30.510> often<00:06:30.720> you<00:06:30.900> do<00:06:31.140> this<00:06:31.350> the<00:06:31.830> more

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
and the more often you do this the more

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.180 
and the more often you do this the more
intense<00:06:32.460> this<00:06:32.970> work<00:06:33.420> at<00:06:33.740> what<00:06:34.740> you<00:06:34.860> can<00:06:35.040> do

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
intense this work at what you can do

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.390 
intense this work at what you can do
also<00:06:35.400> is<00:06:36.290> take<00:06:37.290> a<00:06:37.320> little<00:06:37.590> bit<00:06:37.740> of<00:06:37.800> wash<00:06:40.340> on<00:06:41.340> a

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
also is take a little bit of wash on a

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.520 
also is take a little bit of wash on a
black<00:06:41.910> and<00:06:42.770> Griffin<00:06:43.770> sip<00:06:44.010> your<00:06:44.190> mixed<00:06:45.500> okay

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
black and Griffin sip your mixed okay

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.820 
black and Griffin sip your mixed okay
and<00:06:46.860> then<00:06:47.100> you<00:06:47.220> can<00:06:47.960> tap<00:06:48.960> down<00:06:49.260> here<00:06:49.650> the

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
and then you can tap down here the

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.480 
and then you can tap down here the
rivets<00:06:50.790> and<00:06:50.970> bolts<00:06:51.770> give<00:06:52.770> it<00:06:52.860> more<00:06:53.280> of

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
rivets and bolts give it more of

00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:10.150 
rivets and bolts give it more of
three-dimensional<00:06:57.020> so<00:06:58.020> here<00:06:58.230> this<00:06:58.380> parts<00:07:05.510> so

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.470 

okay<00:07:11.160> and<00:07:11.430> I<00:07:11.700> hope<00:07:11.850> this<00:07:12.720> video<00:07:12.960> tutorial<00:07:14.480> has
