00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.020
 moments of panic and despair 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 lived the passengers of flight 241 of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.490
 the airline line that came out of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.860
 mazatlán at 11 45 in the morning of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.320
 Sunday bound for the city of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 Mexico had just taken off from 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.910
 rafael buelna airport took less 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.740
 of 10 minutes when the captain reported 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 that there was a failure in the train 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.750
 landing immediately activating 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 the emergency protocol to both 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.789
 inside the aircraft as in the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.010
 airport they flew aslam little more 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.620
 of one hour in order to consume 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.069
 fuel and try to have a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.859
 emergency landing with less weight 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:45.089
 after some failed attempts 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.449
 fortunately the plane managed to land 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:51.220
 at one in the afternoon with 20 minutes but 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.590
 at least the beach was my companion 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.600
 and we had already done two laps and he 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.050
 saw more other times twice and that was not 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.300
 normal the icesi yes indeed if it is not 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.790
 normal and then we saw running at 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.170
 flight attendants to the cabin and then saw 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.030
 the announcement that there was a problem with 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.620
 the landing gear that we have to 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 consume us the fuel for that 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.220
 we keep flying for an hour around there 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.060
 medical attention and I already lost attention 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.490
 I asked for a spiritual study 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.780
 I do not know what will happen is that I 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.080
 I tell you it can be stressful 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.480
 nothing more very afraid 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.190
 ahead of anticipation and that is going to 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.860
 sell fuel when we go to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.180
 use and not know what equation we 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.180
 I was in the right society 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.490
 your first fear and then we continue 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.530
 buying that will come out and that there was a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.030
 fence in intendente thought that but that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.490
 it was nothing serious 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.390
 we are calm we did what we 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.630
 they were saying and the aircraft was traveling 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.720
 84 passengers among them the six queens 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.409
 of the carnival and the floral games of 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.210

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.830
 state fear and panic too 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.760
 invaded some of the members of 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.400
 the crew mentioned 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.860
 I'm more 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.250
 and mortifying to see them when 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.250
 they 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:39.310
 study 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:41.630
 the pilot's voice came out with everyone and 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.900
 The truth is that nobody knew what it was 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.470
 that happened but but if we were true 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.470
 that from what 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.690
 and the protocols were pushing for 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.880
 reasons that if there was any emergency 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.160
 the consequences were the least 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.990
 possible paramedics of the red cross 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.780
 they checked each of the passengers and 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.090
 crew the airline version to 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.700

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.310
 a bird caused the affectation in the train 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.580
