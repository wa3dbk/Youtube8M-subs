of knowing what I have to leave art that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.070 
of knowing what I have to leave art that
I've<00:00:24.510> chosen<00:00:24.779> from<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> collection

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.220 

but<00:00:48.530> for<00:00:48.890> me<00:00:49.040> it's<00:00:49.820> cars<00:00:50.150> compared<00:00:50.780> with

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
but for me it's cars compared with

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.920 
but for me it's cars compared with
another<00:00:51.410> Egyptian<00:00:52.280> work<00:00:52.489> that<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.510> not<00:00:53.720> only

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
another Egyptian work that is not only

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
another Egyptian work that is not only
small<00:00:54.520> but<00:00:55.520> Birkin

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.020

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
there are some works of art that are so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.290 
there are some works of art that are so
purely<00:01:04.110> beautiful<00:01:05.110> like<00:01:05.920> this<00:01:06.220> Egyptian<00:01:07.060> head

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
purely beautiful like this Egyptian head

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.010 
purely beautiful like this Egyptian head
of<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.570> queen<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.830> all<00:01:09.130> we<00:01:09.340> want<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.700> do<00:01:09.940> is<00:01:10.450> just

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
of a queen but all we want to do is just

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.590 
of a queen but all we want to do is just
to<00:01:11.229> look<00:01:11.409> at<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.619> in<00:01:12.430> silence<00:01:18.149> but<00:01:19.149> there<00:01:19.450> were

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
to look at it in silence but there were

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.940 
to look at it in silence but there were
three<00:01:20.110> things<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.770> occur<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.909> me<00:01:22.950> it's

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
three things that occur to me it's

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.469 
three things that occur to me it's
carved<00:01:24.490> out<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.360> yellow<00:01:26.009> Jasper<00:01:27.149> which<00:01:28.149> is<00:01:28.330> one

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
carved out of yellow Jasper which is one

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.180 
carved out of yellow Jasper which is one
of<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.750> hardest<00:01:29.380> stones<00:01:29.950> known<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.789> us<00:01:30.940> and

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
of the hardest stones known to us and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.270 
of the hardest stones known to us and
look<00:01:33.190> at<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.580> apparent<00:01:33.940> ease<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.990> grace<00:01:35.350> with

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
look at the apparent ease and grace with

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.389 
look at the apparent ease and grace with
which<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.820> unknown<00:01:37.600> genius<00:01:38.399> has

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
which that unknown genius has

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.139 
which that unknown genius has
accomplished<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.789> then<00:01:45.789> all<00:01:45.970> those

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
accomplished it and then all those

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.770 
accomplished it and then all those
scholars<00:01:46.690> still<00:01:47.020> think<00:01:47.410> that<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:49.210> genius

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
scholars still think that this genius

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.899 
scholars still think that this genius
lived<00:01:50.080> about<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.710> middle<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.460> second

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
lived about the middle of the second

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.380 
lived about the middle of the second
millennium<00:01:52.140> BC<00:01:53.140> they<00:01:53.860> no<00:01:54.250> longer<00:01:54.280> feel<00:01:55.119> they

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
millennium BC they no longer feel they

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.040 
millennium BC they no longer feel they
know<00:01:55.600> who<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.960> Queen<00:01:56.229> was<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.039> I<00:01:57.909> wonder<00:01:58.360> if

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
know who the Queen was and I wonder if

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.280 
know who the Queen was and I wonder if
the<00:01:59.560> Queen<00:01:59.830> was<00:02:00.450> whether<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.810> not<00:02:01.990> just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
the Queen was whether this is not just

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.090 
the Queen was whether this is not just
an<00:02:02.470> ideal<00:02:03.070> head<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.810> sculptor<00:02:05.350> made<00:02:05.770> as

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
an ideal head that the sculptor made as

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.930 
an ideal head that the sculptor made as
the<00:02:06.549> perfect<00:02:07.380> ideal<00:02:08.380> wife<00:02:08.739> for<00:02:09.399> His<00:02:09.549> divine

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
the perfect ideal wife for His divine

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:19.729 
the perfect ideal wife for His divine
Pharaoh<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.250> thought<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:18.269> terrible

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
Pharaoh and then I thought this terrible

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.630 
Pharaoh and then I thought this terrible
mutilation<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.940> breaking<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:24.070> happened

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
mutilation the breaking that happened

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.710 
mutilation the breaking that happened
hundreds<00:02:25.390> thousands<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.290> years<00:02:26.530> ago<00:02:26.680> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
hundreds thousands of years ago and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.970 
hundreds thousands of years ago and
where<00:02:28.720> perhaps<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.530> first<00:02:29.860> people<00:02:31.709> living<00:02:32.709> at

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
where perhaps the first people living at

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.229 
where perhaps the first people living at
the<00:02:33.130> beginning<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.120> 21st<00:02:34.720> century<00:02:36.239> who

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
the beginning of the 21st century who

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.130 
the beginning of the 21st century who
can<00:02:37.480> see<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:38.019> crack<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:39.630> something<00:02:40.630> they<00:02:40.930> can

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
can see that crack as something they can

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.300 
can see that crack as something they can
respond<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:43.470> because<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.799> world<00:02:45.040> is

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
respond to and because the world is

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.580 
respond to and because the world is
clearly<00:02:45.790> not<00:02:46.630> what<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.079> should<00:02:47.350> be

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
clearly not what it should be

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.810 
clearly not what it should be
it's<00:02:48.579> an<00:02:48.760> aggressive<00:02:49.440> unloving<00:02:50.440> world<00:02:50.709> we<00:02:51.549> are

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
it's an aggressive unloving world we are

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.199 
it's an aggressive unloving world we are
frightened<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.780> perfection<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:55.000> many

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
frightened of perfection and in many

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.180 
frightened of perfection and in many
contemporary<00:02:55.959> artists<00:02:56.410> who<00:02:56.500> make<00:02:56.739> things<00:02:57.040> on

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
contemporary artists who make things on

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.979 
contemporary artists who make things on
nearly<00:02:57.370> they<00:02:57.820> break<00:02:58.150> them<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.600> they<00:02:58.690> twist

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
nearly they break them and they twist

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.560 
nearly they break them and they twist
them<00:02:59.290> they<00:02:59.470> mutilate<00:03:00.070> them<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.760> gives<00:03:01.299> them

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
them they mutilate them it gives them

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.229 
them they mutilate them it gives them
control<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:02.560> takes<00:03:02.890> their<00:03:03.130> terrible<00:03:03.519> fear<00:03:03.970> of

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
control it takes their terrible fear of

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.650 
control it takes their terrible fear of
the<00:03:05.200> unreality<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.400> perfection<00:03:07.180> away<00:03:07.389> from

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
the unreality of perfection away from
