I copy okay ray will be using four
teaspoons<00:00:37.990> of<00:00:38.530> organic<00:00:39.280> coffee

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.439 

next<00:00:47.989> row<00:00:48.289> we<00:00:48.530> using<00:00:48.920> four<00:00:49.219> teaspoons<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:50.120> raw

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
next row we using four teaspoons of raw

next row we using four teaspoons of raw
cane<00:00:50.930> sugar

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.910 

when<00:01:04.820> Ray<00:01:05.150> will<00:01:05.390> be<00:01:05.510> using<00:01:05.900> 40<00:01:06.260> mils<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.710> hot

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
when Ray will be using 40 mils of hot

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:25.200 
when Ray will be using 40 mils of hot
water<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.610> solve<00:01:08.540> two<00:01:09.260> ingredients

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.120 

make<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> fool<00:01:26.630> blend<00:01:27.020> right<00:01:27.560> hands<00:01:27.799> with<00:01:28.040> a

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
make a fool blend right hands with a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.640 
make a fool blend right hands with a
spoon

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.660 

twisting<00:01:34.980> her<00:01:35.130> mouth<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> doesn't<00:01:36.180> spill

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 

and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:39.240> basically<00:01:39.600> we'll<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.410> turn<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and then basically we'll just turn the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:02:00.470 
and then basically we'll just turn the
twist<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:41.310> Burma<00:01:41.700> gone

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.110 

what<00:02:01.080> we<00:02:01.260> can<00:02:01.440> say<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> liquid<00:02:02.730> is

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
what we can say is that the liquid is

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.170 
what we can say is that the liquid is
increasing<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.080> volume<00:02:04.490> what<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> cord

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
increasing in volume what this is cord

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.100 
increasing in volume what this is cord
is<00:02:06.420> stretching

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
is stretching

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.100 
is stretching
and<00:02:08.200> basically<00:02:09.160> by<00:02:09.820> stretching<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.750> liquid

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
and basically by stretching the liquid

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:22.290 
and basically by stretching the liquid
we<00:02:11.620> are<00:02:11.830> creating<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.490> creamy<00:02:12.970> froth

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.340 

and<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:23.080> ensure<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.740> smooth<00:02:24.160> consistency<00:02:25.350> raise

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
and to ensure a smooth consistency raise

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.950 
and to ensure a smooth consistency raise
now<00:02:26.680> tilting<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.580> twister<00:02:28.000> forum<00:02:28.330> mug<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
now tilting the twister forum mug to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.630 
now tilting the twister forum mug to
ensure<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.290> all<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.890> ingredients<00:02:30.010> are

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
ensure that all the ingredients are

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.020 
ensure that all the ingredients are
blended<00:02:30.760> together<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:33.280> increase<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
blended together and to increase the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.860 
blended together and to increase the
stretching<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.780> liquid<00:02:37.710> as<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:39.340> see

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
stretching of the liquid as you can see

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.940 
stretching of the liquid as you can see
the<00:02:41.310> coffee<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.760> creamy<00:02:43.270> texture<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.320> very

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the coffee is a creamy texture and very

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.690 
the coffee is a creamy texture and very
smooth<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.640> consistent

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.660 

this<00:02:51.270> finished<00:02:51.720> product<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.500> full<00:02:53.160> servings

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
this finished product is full servings

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.630 
this finished product is full servings
and<00:02:54.239> our<00:02:54.569> Rey<00:02:54.840> will<00:02:55.379> prepare<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.099> iced<00:02:56.430> coffee

so this is going to be forward to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.449 
so this is going to be forward to
something

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
