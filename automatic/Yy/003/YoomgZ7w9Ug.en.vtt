00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
inch to five eighths inch thick material

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.839 
inch to five eighths inch thick material
which<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:25.900> what<00:02:26.530> I'm<00:02:26.650> using<00:02:26.860> today<00:02:27.099> it's<00:02:27.459> just

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
which is what I'm using today it's just

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.339 
which is what I'm using today it's just
under<00:02:28.180> five<00:02:28.690> eighths<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.050> an<00:02:29.200> inch<00:02:29.290> thick<00:02:31.349> the

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
under five eighths of an inch thick the

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.800 
under five eighths of an inch thick the
system<00:02:33.099> works<00:02:33.310> by<00:02:33.459> making<00:02:33.849> two<00:02:33.880> pockets<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
system works by making two pockets the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.350 
system works by making two pockets the
joint<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:38.019> held<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.410> place<00:02:38.440> by<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:39.310> clamping<00:02:40.030> jig

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
joint is held in place by a clamping jig

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.039 
joint is held in place by a clamping jig
and<00:02:40.769> then<00:02:41.769> with<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:43.200> driving<00:02:44.200> bit<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.720> drive

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
and then with the driving bit you drive

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.520 
and then with the driving bit you drive
the<00:02:47.290> pocket<00:02:47.860> screw<00:02:48.630> into<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.870> pocket<00:02:50.319> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
the pocket screw into the pocket the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.850 
the pocket screw into the pocket the
screws<00:02:51.310> actually<00:02:51.730> drive<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.590> material<00:02:53.590> down

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
screws actually drive the material down

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.430 
screws actually drive the material down
a<00:02:53.890> little<00:02:54.220> bit<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.819> when<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.180> clamp<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.810> what

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
a little bit so when you clamp it what

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.270 
a little bit so when you clamp it what
happens<00:02:56.829> is<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.519> drives<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.150> flat<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.599> flush

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
happens is it drives it flat and flush

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.339 
happens is it drives it flat and flush
making<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.370> very<00:03:00.549> tight<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.150> smooth<00:03:01.989> join

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
making a very tight and smooth join

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.440 
making a very tight and smooth join
though<00:03:02.620> this<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:02.950> n<00:03:03.130> great<00:03:03.370> I'd<00:03:03.610> like<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.090> apply

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
though this is n great I'd like to apply

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:18.560 
though this is n great I'd like to apply
a<00:03:04.480> little<00:03:04.750> bit<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.959> glue

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.990 

basically<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.690> line<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.080> brain<00:03:20.350> up<00:03:21.000> where

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
basically you line the brain up where

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.080 
basically you line the brain up where
you<00:03:22.120> want<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.510> go<00:03:26.130> clamp<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.310> down<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:30.090> then

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
you want it to go clamp it down and then

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:48.530 
you want it to go clamp it down and then
with<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.360> long<00:03:31.540> driving<00:03:34.140> describe<00:03:35.140> it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.740 

there's<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.780> joint<00:03:50.080> my<00:03:50.650> little<00:03:51.750> secret

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
there's the joint my little secret

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
there's the joint my little secret
weapon<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.500> quickly<00:03:53.740> use<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.960> baby<00:03:55.960> wipe<00:03:56.140> to

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
weapon is I quickly use a baby wipe to

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.760 
weapon is I quickly use a baby wipe to
remove<00:03:57.040> this<00:03:58.030> glue<00:03:58.360> real<00:03:58.630> fast<00:03:59.050> before<00:03:59.380> it

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
remove this glue real fast before it

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:10.830 
remove this glue real fast before it
causes<00:04:02.770> a<00:04:02.980> problem<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.480> think<00:04:10.720> you'll

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
causes a problem but I think you'll

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.310 
causes a problem but I think you'll
agree<00:04:10.960> it's<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.380> nice<00:04:11.530> quick<00:04:11.920> joint
