00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
Galaxy s5 etc it seems like the norm for

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.030 
Galaxy s5 etc it seems like the norm for
these<00:03:31.450> screen<00:03:31.720> sizes<00:03:31.959> is<00:03:32.470> incrementally

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
these screen sizes is incrementally

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.309 
these screen sizes is incrementally
guard<00:03:33.819> getting<00:03:34.209> larger<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:34.720> larger<00:03:34.810> and

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
guard getting larger and larger and

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.589 
guard getting larger and larger and
although<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.590> don't<00:03:35.799> expect<00:03:36.310> Apple<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.150> go<00:03:37.299> with

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
although I don't expect Apple to go with

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.770 
although I don't expect Apple to go with
a<00:03:37.810> five-inch<00:03:38.440> version<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:39.010> think<00:03:39.459> for<00:03:39.670> set<00:03:39.940> 4.7

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
a five-inch version I think for set 4.7

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.930 
a five-inch version I think for set 4.7
is<00:03:40.989> definitely<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.500> fair<00:03:41.829> bet<00:03:42.040> as<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.609> what<00:03:42.849> we

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
is definitely a fair bet as to what we

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.270

could<00:03:43.180> see<00:03:43.419> for<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.079> screen<00:03:44.349> size<00:03:44.530> on<00:03:44.829> the

leaks<00:05:09.850> yet<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.690> iWatch<00:05:11.140> and<00:05:11.350> stuff<00:05:11.530> there

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
leaks yet of the iWatch and stuff there

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.260 
leaks yet of the iWatch and stuff there
have<00:05:11.890> definitely<00:05:11.920> been<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.370> ton<00:05:12.640> of<00:05:12.670> concepts

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
have definitely been a ton of concepts

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.180 
have definitely been a ton of concepts
and<00:05:13.690> I<00:05:13.900> think<00:05:14.170> that<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.590> category<00:05:14.950> that

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
and I think that it is a category that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.700 
and I think that it is a category that
Apple<00:05:15.730> is<00:05:15.820> going<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.180> jump<00:05:16.420> into<00:05:16.720> as<00:05:17.140> you<00:05:17.470> know

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
Apple is going to jump into as you know

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.710 
Apple is going to jump into as you know
Android<00:05:18.130> wear<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.340> expected<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.180> day<00:05:19.330> beat<00:05:19.510> the

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
Android wear is expected to day beat the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.440 
Android wear is expected to day beat the
summer<00:05:19.960> I'm<00:05:20.320> extremely<00:05:20.890> excited<00:05:21.310> for<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.700> so

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
summer I'm extremely excited for that so

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.600 
summer I'm extremely excited for that so
I<00:05:22.480> wouldn't<00:05:22.840> be<00:05:22.930> surprised<00:05:23.290> at<00:05:23.440> all<00:05:23.650> if<00:05:24.130> Apple

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
I wouldn't be surprised at all if Apple

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.310 
I wouldn't be surprised at all if Apple
actually<00:05:24.790> does<00:05:25.180> come<00:05:25.450> out<00:05:25.570> with<00:05:25.720> an<00:05:25.870> iWatch

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
actually does come out with an iWatch

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.170 
actually does come out with an iWatch
and<00:05:26.730> although<00:05:27.730> I<00:05:27.760> haven't<00:05:27.910> really<00:05:28.150> thought

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
and although I haven't really thought

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.300 
and although I haven't really thought
about<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.810> in<00:05:28.930> full<00:05:29.170> I<00:05:29.380> think<00:05:29.410> that<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.800> iWatch

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
about it in full I think that the iWatch

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.350 
about it in full I think that the iWatch
would<00:05:30.940> be<00:05:31.240> cool<00:05:31.540> if<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:31.810> had<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:31.990> curved<00:05:32.530> display

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
would be cool if it had a curved display

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.330 
would be cool if it had a curved display
have<00:05:34.360> its<00:05:34.540> own<00:05:34.660> interface<00:05:34.960> that<00:05:35.470> is<00:05:35.650> able<00:05:36.190> to

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
have its own interface that is able to

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.390 
have its own interface that is able to
be<00:05:36.550> convenient<00:05:37.180> on<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.750> wrist<00:05:38.230> form<00:05:38.650> factor<00:05:39.100> and

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
be convenient on a wrist form factor and

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.300 
be convenient on a wrist form factor and
in<00:05:40.150> terms<00:05:40.360> of<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:40.600> iPhone<00:05:40.990> 6<00:05:41.350> like<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.860> did<00:05:42.070> kind

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
in terms of the iPhone 6 like I did kind

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.270 
in terms of the iPhone 6 like I did kind
of<00:05:42.370> mention<00:05:42.760> before<00:05:42.790> in<00:05:43.860> Coleman's<00:05:44.860> question

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
of mention before in Coleman's question

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.820 
of mention before in Coleman's question
is<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:46.180> do<00:05:46.330> really<00:05:46.750> want<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.050> see<00:05:47.230> a<00:05:47.260> larger

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
is that I do really want to see a larger

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.620 
is that I do really want to see a larger
display<00:05:48.160> which<00:05:48.520> is<00:05:48.550> fair<00:05:48.910> enough<00:05:49.120> by<00:05:49.390> now<00:05:49.419> to

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
display which is fair enough by now to

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.990 
display which is fair enough by now to
say<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:49.960> we<00:05:50.350> will<00:05:50.590> see<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:50.980> but<00:05:51.550> of<00:05:51.700> course

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
say that we will see that but of course

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.720 
say that we will see that but of course
a<00:05:52.240> larger<00:05:52.720> battery<00:05:53.169> on<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.650> iPhone<00:05:54.040> 5s<00:05:54.310> I

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
a larger battery on the iPhone 5s I

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.940 
a larger battery on the iPhone 5s I
really<00:05:55.150> struggled<00:05:55.690> to<00:05:55.810> get<00:05:55.990> through<00:05:56.290> even<00:05:56.890> a

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
really struggled to get through even a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.800 
really struggled to get through even a
full<00:05:57.160> day<00:05:57.190> at<00:05:57.460> school<00:05:57.760> on<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.120> battery<00:05:58.540> charge

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
full day at school on a battery charge

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.510 
full day at school on a battery charge
so<00:05:59.230> I<00:05:59.470> hope<00:06:00.010> that<00:06:00.160> they<00:06:00.250> will<00:06:00.340> definitely

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
so I hope that they will definitely

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.610 
so I hope that they will definitely
improve<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.270> battery<00:06:01.480> drastically<00:06:02.350> and

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
improve the battery drastically and

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.890 
improve the battery drastically and
hopefully<00:06:03.040> have<00:06:03.250> it<00:06:03.370> on<00:06:03.520> par<00:06:03.850> with<00:06:03.880> some<00:06:04.810> of

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
hopefully have it on par with some of

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.480 
hopefully have it on par with some of
the<00:06:04.960> flagship<00:06:05.380> Android<00:06:05.740> phones<00:06:06.040> out<00:06:06.280> there

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.340 
the flagship Android phones out there

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
which I have experienced very good

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.530 
which I have experienced very good
battery<00:06:08.800> life<00:06:08.830> moving<00:06:09.669> on<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:09.940> our<00:06:09.970> last<00:06:10.210> and

the Nikon root I've been sticking with

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.080 
the Nikon root I've been sticking with
canon<00:06:31.510> ever<00:06:31.810> since<00:06:32.200> I<00:06:32.380> jumped<00:06:32.890> on<00:06:33.040> to<00:06:33.280> DSLRs<00:06:34.000> I

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
canon ever since I jumped on to DSLRs I

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.570 
canon ever since I jumped on to DSLRs I
did<00:06:34.240> start<00:06:34.450> with<00:06:34.539> the<00:06:34.630> Canon<00:06:35.110> t3i<00:06:35.140> and<00:06:36.010> that<00:06:36.460> is

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
did start with the Canon t3i and that is

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.510 
did start with the Canon t3i and that is
actually<00:06:36.760> great<00:06:37.210> for<00:06:37.240> recording<00:06:37.930> video<00:06:38.260> but<00:06:38.740> I

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
actually great for recording video but I

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.619 
actually great for recording video but I
now<00:06:39.940> there's<00:06:40.449> 84<00:06:41.110> I<00:06:41.139> the<00:06:41.289> t5i<00:06:42.280> but<00:06:43.060> I<00:06:43.090> would<00:06:43.360> say

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
now there's 84 I the t5i but I would say

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.170 
now there's 84 I the t5i but I would say
if<00:06:43.960> you<00:06:44.229> do<00:06:44.530> have<00:06:44.770> the<00:06:44.949> money<00:06:45.099> to<00:06:45.370> spend<00:06:45.699> the

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
if you do have the money to spend the

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.559 
if you do have the money to spend the
best<00:06:46.509> option<00:06:47.110> to<00:06:47.440> go<00:06:47.710> for<00:06:48.009> all<00:06:48.340> round<00:06:48.729> would<00:06:49.360> be

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:49.569 
best option to go for all round would be

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:52.680 
best option to go for all round would be
the<00:06:49.750> canon<00:06:50.110> 70d<00:06:51.060> mainly<00:06:52.060> because<00:06:52.210> it<00:06:52.539> is<00:06:52.569> a

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
the canon 70d mainly because it is a

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.809 
the canon 70d mainly because it is a
very<00:06:52.990> practical<00:06:53.319> consumer<00:06:54.190> camera<00:06:54.580> it<00:06:54.729> is

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:54.819 
very practical consumer camera it is

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:57.360 
very practical consumer camera it is
able<00:06:55.060> to<00:06:55.150> get<00:06:55.300> get<00:06:55.780> some<00:06:55.990> great<00:06:56.229> photos<00:06:56.590> but

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
able to get get some great photos but

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.580 
able to get get some great photos but
most<00:06:57.610> of<00:06:57.729> all<00:06:57.909> if<00:06:58.210> video<00:06:58.690> is<00:06:58.900> your<00:06:59.020> priority<00:06:59.560> I

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
most of all if video is your priority I

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.890 
most of all if video is your priority I
think<00:06:59.889> that<00:07:00.009> the<00:07:00.129> 70d<00:07:00.789> is<00:07:01.060> just<00:07:01.330> such<00:07:01.599> a<00:07:01.629> great

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
think that the 70d is just such a great

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.050 
think that the 70d is just such a great
option<00:07:02.110> because<00:07:02.800> it<00:07:03.069> does<00:07:03.220> have<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:03.759> dual

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
option because it does have the dual

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.290 
option because it does have the dual
pixel<00:07:04.360> autofocus<00:07:04.690> so<00:07:05.610> you<00:07:06.610> have<00:07:06.789> live<00:07:07.090> view

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
pixel autofocus so you have live view

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.350 
pixel autofocus so you have live view
autofocus<00:07:07.990> and<00:07:08.349> touch<00:07:09.099> autofocus<00:07:09.759> it<00:07:10.030> is<00:07:10.150> just

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
autofocus and touch autofocus it is just

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.290 
autofocus and touch autofocus it is just
very<00:07:10.629> handy<00:07:11.229> and<00:07:11.669> personally<00:07:12.669> a<00:07:12.699> camera<00:07:13.120> that

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
very handy and personally a camera that

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.809

camera to use I would like to say and it
definitely<00:07:18.460> gets<00:07:18.789> a<00:07:18.849> job<00:07:19.060> done<00:07:19.120> in<00:07:19.509> terms<00:07:19.720> of

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870

little bit cheaper than these seven

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.010 
little bit cheaper than these seven
ideas<00:07:26.229> that<00:07:26.620> does<00:07:26.800> come<00:07:27.069> over<00:07:27.460> $1000<00:07:28.449> you

could definitely pick up something like
the<00:07:30.430> canon<00:07:30.849> t3i<00:07:31.080> although<00:07:32.080> that<00:07:32.229> is<00:07:32.349> the<00:07:32.440> older
