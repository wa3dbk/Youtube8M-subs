00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.509
 dress and i'm so we will now 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.189
 clothes have changed our statistics 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.710
 a little bit here now with us 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.780
 I understand life to bring you to and other things 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.670
 now we have 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.209
 body fill the heat 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.110
 hall on 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.319
 and this lightness is called this 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.810
 How are we with you on the links and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.390
 got wet ie now if we fall in 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.390
 water or let's say 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:34.160
 wing well and now i'm a spout here and so 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:38.600
 very wet yourself and we 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.880
 whether owners will get wet and wet 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.370

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.840
 friends rain and for now it went and on 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.660
 light box is filled with another 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.120
 we are still wet now from rain and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.690
 from the water, that is now not so much so 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.850
 take a walk 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.630
 because we got wet in our 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.060
 first we are harder to walk we are cold and 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 clothes we quickly fear and if not 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.570
 clothes but again quickly freezing cold overall 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.980
 complicate renoshka so we all 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:14.840
 the game means clothes 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:19.310
 we have it both from fabric and from 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.940
 iron from the skin and 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.760
 from diamonds she has you kamaz on this 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.680
 even call yourself diamond armor clothing 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.600
 the same thing I 'll show it here 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.190
 we dress over clothes in principle 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.700
 that is, how much I understood and let's say armor 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.870
 he has 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.430
 and a bib diamond it can be on top 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.100
 shirts we will walk not only in 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.870
 clothes but also in armor 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.910

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.880

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:55.900

00:03:49.880 --> 00:04:00.400
 your tonashin here I think you can see it 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:05.950
 so I would also like to say well 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.290
 changed a little craft a little bit 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.210

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.580
 square right now he saw us 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:21.800
 such a table such as a regular table 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:27.320
 spoon but craft craft remained the most 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:29.960
 former you plan Julie has also changed 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.150
 Firstly, we added this paw 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.250

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.350
 whom we love not to be cotton to 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.510
 make a fabric button to make clothes 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.930
 in general, that's how we have it 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.850

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.250

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.800
 small hand it grows with us grows and 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.610
 It seems to be famous for the usual and earlier in you to 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.450
 which we are all accustomed to ourselves like this 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.980

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.070
