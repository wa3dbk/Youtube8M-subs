so<00:06:03.880> let's<00:06:04.150> actually<00:06:04.300> play<00:06:04.930> this<00:06:05.230> now<00:06:05.460> if<00:06:06.460> you

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
so let's actually play this now if you

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.730 
so let's actually play this now if you
back<00:06:06.790> out<00:06:06.970> you<00:06:07.300> can<00:06:07.450> just<00:06:07.500> tap<00:06:08.500> this<00:06:08.680> to

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
back out you can just tap this to

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
back out you can just tap this to
animate<00:06:09.250> it<00:06:10.860> and<00:06:11.860> as<00:06:11.980> you<00:06:12.130> can<00:06:12.220> see<00:06:12.370> they<00:06:12.520> drop

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.850 
animate it and as you can see they drop
back<00:06:12.940> and<00:06:13.870> you<00:06:13.990> can<00:06:14.140> do<00:06:14.230> this<00:06:14.410> much<00:06:14.620> more

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
back and you can do this much more

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.560 
back and you can do this much more
smoothly<00:06:15.220> by<00:06:15.550> just<00:06:15.820> messing<00:06:16.120> around

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
smoothly by just messing around

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.690 
smoothly by just messing around
and<00:06:16.660> then<00:06:17.350> let's<00:06:17.530> back<00:06:17.770> out<00:06:17.920> of<00:06:17.980> this<00:06:18.220> and<00:06:18.490> you

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
let's hit record recording started and

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.500 
let's hit record recording started and

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
then you can just play this back and

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.450 
then you can just play this back and
also<00:06:31.510> you<00:06:31.570> can<00:06:32.020> increase<00:06:32.410> the<00:06:32.710> size<00:06:32.920> of<00:06:33.310> like

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
bigger whatnot and you can move this

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.000 
bigger whatnot and you can move this
around<00:06:38.700> to<00:06:39.700> get<00:06:39.850> it<00:06:39.970> out<00:06:40.120> of<00:06:40.240> your<00:06:40.360> way<00:06:40.570> so
