00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:10.449 
storm had fractured time and displaced a

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:11.789 
storm had fractured time and displaced a
lot<00:00:10.600> of<00:00:10.690> ghosts<00:00:11.170> and<00:00:11.410> they<00:00:11.559> were<00:00:11.650> all

and<00:00:14.230> disoriented<00:00:14.650> and<00:00:15.129> I<00:00:15.190> thought<00:00:15.369> that<00:00:15.490> was<00:00:15.580> a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:15.609 
and disoriented and I thought that was a

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.179 
and disoriented and I thought that was a
very<00:00:15.850> interesting<00:00:16.180> idea<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:17.770> so<00:00:18.009> necessary

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
very interesting idea not so necessary

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.159 
very interesting idea not so necessary
believed<00:00:18.759> it<00:00:18.910> but<00:00:19.029> I<00:00:19.060> was<00:00:19.210> very<00:00:19.390> intrigued<00:00:19.960> by

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:20.169 
believed it but I was very intrigued by

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.130 
believed it but I was very intrigued by
it<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.789> I<00:00:21.820> came<00:00:22.060> up<00:00:22.240> with<00:00:22.359> this<00:00:22.539> idea<00:00:22.720> that

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
it so I came up with this idea that

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.169 
it so I came up with this idea that
Rebecca<00:00:23.560> and<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:23.800> main<00:00:23.949> character<00:00:24.490> would

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
Rebecca and the main character would

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.429 
Rebecca and the main character would
have<00:00:25.269> be<00:00:25.329> able<00:00:25.419> to<00:00:25.599> hold<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.900> hand<00:00:26.169> of<00:00:26.320> the

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
ghost and be taken into that
