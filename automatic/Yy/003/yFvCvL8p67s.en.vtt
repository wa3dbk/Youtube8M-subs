website<00:00:20.550> development<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> we're<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
website development and we're going to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.330 
website development and we're going to
begin<00:00:21.869> making<00:00:22.410> links<00:00:23.660> now<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:25.439> links<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:25.949> if

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
begin making links now what links are if

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.339 
begin making links now what links are if
you<00:00:26.580> don't<00:00:26.820> know<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> click<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
you don't know it's what you click and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
you don't know it's what you click and
it<00:00:28.470> takes<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.070> another<00:00:29.099> website<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> it's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
it takes you to another website so it's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
it takes you to another website so it's
what<00:00:31.470> everyone<00:00:31.769> uses<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> navigate<00:00:33.030> around

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
what everyone uses the navigate around

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.900 
what everyone uses the navigate around
the<00:00:33.630> internet<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:36.920> let's<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.129> begin<00:00:38.280> making

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the internet so let's just begin making

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.389 
the internet so let's just begin making
one<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.410> tag<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> link<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.399> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
one the tag to make a link is a and the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.970 
one the tag to make a link is a and the
ending<00:00:44.820> tag<00:00:46.309> is<00:00:47.309> typical<00:00:47.969> ending<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
ending tag is typical ending a and

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.180 
ending tag is typical ending a and
anything<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.190> between<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.199> my<00:00:52.770> link

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
anything in between it this is my link

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
anything in between it this is my link
is<00:00:53.510> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.780> become<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.500> link<00:00:57.020> but<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:58.440> now

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
is going to become a link but right now

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.369 
is going to become a link but right now
we<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> link<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.809> taking<00:01:01.109> us

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
we have a link and it's not taking us

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.240 
we have a link and it's not taking us
anywhere<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.110> saved<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.010> took<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
anywhere so if we saved it and took a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
anywhere so if we saved it and took a
look<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:07.880> what<00:01:08.880> we'd<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.510> is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
look at it right now what we'd see is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.520 
look at it right now what we'd see is
just<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.280> link<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.090> can't<00:01:12.450> click<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.409> if

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
just a link that we can't click and if

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.780 
just a link that we can't click and if
we<00:01:13.590> click<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:14.850> anywhere<00:01:16.790> so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
we click it then we don't go anywhere so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.380 
we click it then we don't go anywhere so
to<00:01:18.509> make<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> another<00:01:19.860> website<00:01:20.390> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
to make it go to another website you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
to make it go to another website you
need<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> H<00:01:21.990> ref<00:01:22.830> attribute<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:24.390> h<00:01:24.869> r<00:01:25.350> e<00:01:26.009> f

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
need the H ref attribute that's h r e f

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
need the H ref attribute that's h r e f
and<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:28.829> type<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.490> title<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> website

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and you type in the title of the website

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.050 
and you type in the title of the website
that<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> want<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> link<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> in

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that you want the link to go to in

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600 
that you want the link to go to in
between<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> code<00:01:33.869> quotation<00:01:34.680> marks<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
between the code quotation marks so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
between the code quotation marks so
let's<00:01:35.909> say<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.329> want<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.720> link<00:01:37.049> take<00:01:37.409> us<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
let's say we want this link take us to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.560 
let's say we want this link take us to
google<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.880> type<00:01:39.180> HTTP

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.640 

WWD<00:01:43.680> cool<00:01:44.680> calm<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:46.320> end<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.440> with<00:01:47.470> the

WWD cool calm and end it with the
quotation<00:01:48.220> marks<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:50.140> if<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.620> saved<00:01:50.890> it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
quotation marks and now if we saved it

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.110 
quotation marks and now if we saved it
and<00:01:51.340> we<00:01:51.550> looked<00:01:51.790> at<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.240> Internet<00:01:52.960> Explorer

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
and we looked at it in Internet Explorer

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.940 
and we looked at it in Internet Explorer
you<00:01:55.120> could<00:01:55.270> see<00:01:55.480> that's<00:01:55.720> now<00:01:56.110> underlined<00:01:56.530> and

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
you could see that's now underlined and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.550 
you could see that's now underlined and
when<00:01:57.190> we<00:01:57.340> hover<00:01:57.550> over<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.660> finger<00:01:59.080> pops<00:01:59.320> up

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
when we hover over it the finger pops up

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.740 
when we hover over it the finger pops up
and<00:01:59.830> if<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.490> actually<00:02:00.700> clicked<00:02:01.240> on<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.420> it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
and if we actually clicked on it it

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.550 
and if we actually clicked on it it
would<00:02:01.870> take<00:02:02.110> us<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.470> Google<00:02:04.050> now<00:02:05.050> this<00:02:05.350> is

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
would take us the Google now this is

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.560 
would take us the Google now this is
useful<00:02:05.860> when<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.670> want<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.970> create<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.270> link

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
useful when you want to create a link

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.740 
useful when you want to create a link
that's<00:02:07.900> taking<00:02:08.320> you<00:02:08.500> away<00:02:08.920> from<00:02:08.979> your<00:02:09.369> site

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that's taking you away from your site

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.390 
that's taking you away from your site
but<00:02:10.750> let's<00:02:10.960> say<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.230> have<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.740> site<00:02:12.130> with<00:02:12.370> a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
but let's say you have a site with a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.610 
but let's say you have a site with a
couple<00:02:12.820> pages<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.140> wanted<00:02:14.440> to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
couple pages on it and you wanted to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.060 
couple pages on it and you wanted to
navigate<00:02:15.190> from<00:02:15.730> one<00:02:15.790> page<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.270> another<00:02:17.070> well

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
navigate from one page to another well

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.630 
navigate from one page to another well
the<00:02:18.280> first<00:02:18.550> thing<00:02:18.700> we<00:02:19.090> would<00:02:19.240> need<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:19.840> is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the first thing we would need to do is

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.020 
the first thing we would need to do is
actually<00:02:21.640> make<00:02:21.990> another<00:02:22.990> website<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.030> right

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
actually make another website so right

actually make another website so right
in<00:02:25.180> notepad<00:02:25.830> file<00:02:26.830> new<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:29.760> again<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:31.000> need

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
in notepad file new and again we need
