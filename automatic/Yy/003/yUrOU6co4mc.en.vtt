bagging in halo only you know this 2014
this<00:01:31.439> album<00:01:31.650> definitely<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.310> able<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
this album definitely is able to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
this album definitely is able to
accomplish<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.299> because<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
accomplish this because of the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
accomplish this because of the
blistering<00:01:34.290> grips<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.770> also<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.490> its

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
blistering grips but also because of its

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
blistering grips but also because of its
pacing<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.780> doesn't<00:01:37.079> take<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
pacing it's one that doesn't take the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.990 
pacing it's one that doesn't take the
foot<00:01:37.500> off<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.799> accelerator<00:01:37.829> instead<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.970> just

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
foot off the accelerator instead it just

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.870 
foot off the accelerator instead it just
decides<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.509> ramp<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.530> acceleration<00:01:41.220> even

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
decides to ramp up the acceleration even

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450 
decides to ramp up the acceleration even
further<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.049> hurt<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> track<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.100> felt

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
further if you hurt a track that felt

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460 
further if you hurt a track that felt
like<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:44.970> 60<00:01:45.420> miles<00:01:45.659> per<00:01:45.899> hour<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like it was going 60 miles per hour the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.569 
like it was going 60 miles per hour the
next<00:01:46.770> track<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.159> we're<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> feel

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
next track because we're going to feel

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.940 
next track because we're going to feel
like<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:47.909> 70<00:01:48.390> 70<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.439> 80<00:01:49.680> 80<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.280> 140<00:01:51.270> and

like it's 70 70 then to 80 80 to 140 and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.249 
like it's 70 70 then to 80 80 to 140 and
142<00:01:52.950> levels<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.420> make<00:01:54.600> morning<00:01:54.930> McFly

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
142 levels that would make morning McFly

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
fact that this album really really

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.380 
fact that this album really really
really<00:02:03.810> does<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.530> fuck<00:02:05.189> around<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.240> one

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
really does not fuck around this is one

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
really does not fuck around this is one
that<00:02:06.509> definitely<00:02:06.719> maintains<00:02:07.500> itself<00:02:07.890> it's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that definitely maintains itself it's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.460 
that definitely maintains itself it's
one<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> does<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:09.030> decide<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.259> going

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
one that does not decide that it's going

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.740 
one that does not decide that it's going
to<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:11.250> slow<00:02:11.610> down<00:02:11.640> its<00:02:11.970> pace<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:12.569> at<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
to really slow down its pace but at the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.180 
to really slow down its pace but at the
same

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
same

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.550 
same
also<00:02:13.700> does<00:02:13.910> not<00:02:14.060> sacrifice<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.750> ability<00:02:15.410> of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
also does not sacrifice the ability of

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.490 
also does not sacrifice the ability of
its<00:02:16.190> musicians<00:02:16.880> in<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.150> process<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.320> not

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
its musicians in the process this is not

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.470 
its musicians in the process this is not
a<00:02:18.530> band<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.160> definitely<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.330> not<00:02:20.420> a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
a band that definitely this is not a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.520 
a band that definitely this is not a
band<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.810> feels<00:02:20.990> like<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.320> they<00:02:21.410> are

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
band it feels like that they are

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.560 
band it feels like that they are
repeating<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.070> same<00:02:22.220> idea<00:02:22.580> twice<00:02:22.940> or<00:02:23.240> thrice

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
repeating the same idea twice or thrice

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.330 
repeating the same idea twice or thrice
this<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.960> instead<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.380> band<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:25.100> really

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
this is instead of band that really

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.280 
this is instead of band that really
seems<00:02:25.790> like<00:02:26.180> they<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:26.510> their<00:02:26.660> controlled

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
seems like they have their controlled

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.010 
seems like they have their controlled
technicality<00:02:28.190> very<00:02:28.580> very<00:02:28.910> well<00:02:29.450> well
