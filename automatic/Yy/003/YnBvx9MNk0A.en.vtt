goodbye<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> time<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.690> thought<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.170> but

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
goodbye at the time I thought that but

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.369 
goodbye at the time I thought that but
it<00:00:44.010> technically<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.840> completely

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it technically is just a completely

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.590 
it technically is just a completely
different<00:00:46.649> position<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> sem<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
different position really in a sem and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
different position really in a sem and
then<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:48.930> gonna<00:00:49.020> convert<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> CM<00:00:49.920> 2<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070

strike<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.550> i<00:00:50.610> thought<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> time<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
strike out i thought at the time it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.299 
strike out i thought at the time it
would<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.570> good<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:51.960> then<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:53.100> didn't<00:00:53.250> work

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
