00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
all right I just wanted to do a quick

all right I just wanted to do a quick
video<00:00:04.230> here<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.180> Lincoln

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
video here I have a Lincoln

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.450 
video here I have a Lincoln
autodarkening<00:00:06.750> helmet<00:00:07.350> it's<00:00:07.500> made<00:00:07.770> by<00:00:07.919> Viking

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
autodarkening helmet it's made by Viking

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.450 
autodarkening helmet it's made by Viking
and<00:00:08.730> that's<00:00:09.360> just<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.660> typical

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
and that's just a typical

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.180 
and that's just a typical
autodarkening<00:00:11.460> uses<00:00:12.090> an<00:00:12.330> LCD<00:00:12.750> screen<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.530> I

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
autodarkening uses an LCD screen and I

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.369 
autodarkening uses an LCD screen and I
was<00:00:14.759> having<00:00:15.030> issues<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.690> not<00:00:15.839> darkening

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
was having issues with it not darkening

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.099 
was having issues with it not darkening
it<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:16.590> all<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.760> kind<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.210> suspected<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it at all and I kind of suspected that I

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.630 
it at all and I kind of suspected that I
knew<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:19.680> had<00:00:19.830> some<00:00:20.039> type<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> battery

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
knew they had some type of battery

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.890 
knew they had some type of battery
backup<00:00:20.880> inside<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.400> basically<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.330> kind

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
backup inside so basically this I kind

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.640 
backup inside so basically this I kind
of<00:00:24.960> used<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.350> knife<00:00:26.510> similar<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.320> here

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
of used a knife similar to this one here

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.569 
of used a knife similar to this one here
and<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> use<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.609> edge<00:00:31.340> like<00:00:32.340> right

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and I use this this edge like right

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.090 
and I use this this edge like right
about<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.420> use<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> edge<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
about here I use this edge to kind of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910 
about here I use this edge to kind of
you<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.180> go<00:00:36.660> along<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.140> line<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
you know go along this line here and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.010 
you know go along this line here and
widen<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:39.059> gap<00:00:39.390> these<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.809> glued

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
widen that that gap these are glued

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.709 
widen that that gap these are glued
together<00:00:40.200> pretty<00:00:40.739> pretty<00:00:41.670> heavily<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> kind

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
together pretty pretty heavily so I kind

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.479 
together pretty pretty heavily so I kind
of<00:00:42.809> saw<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.110> along<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> gap<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.280> can

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
of saw it along that gap so that I can

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.819 
of saw it along that gap so that I can
use<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.850> edge<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.090> kind<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.600> torque<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
use this edge to kind of torque it and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.590 
use this edge to kind of torque it and
slowly<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.640> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.090> went<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.480> way

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
slowly just kind of went all the way

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.049 
slowly just kind of went all the way
around<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> until<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.430> had<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> entire

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
around and did it until I had the entire

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.200 
around and did it until I had the entire
face<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.930> open<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.850> basically<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.059> has

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
face of it open so basically it has

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.790 
face of it open so basically it has
these<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.750> small<00:00:55.739> batteries<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:57.800> they're

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
these these small batteries here they're

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
these these small batteries here they're
they're<00:00:59.039> three<00:00:59.340> volt<00:00:59.520> batteries<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.420> they're

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
they're three volt batteries and they're

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
they're three volt batteries and they're
actually<00:01:01.050> soldered<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.620> place<00:01:02.390> ones<00:01:03.390> like

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually soldered in place ones like

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.260 
actually soldered in place ones like
here<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.229> ones<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:06.030> kind

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
here and ones like here and that's kind

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.929 
here and ones like here and that's kind
of<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.450> you'll<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.619> basically<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.909> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939

of what you'll see so basically what I
did<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.930> got<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> way

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
did is just I got those out of the way

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.679 
did is just I got those out of the way
just<00:01:12.900> basically<00:01:13.909> kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.240> used<00:01:15.509> my

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
just basically kind of like used my

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
just basically kind of like used my
knife<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.009> pry<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
knife to to just pry them off the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.219 
knife to to just pry them off the
surface<00:01:18.119> they're<00:01:18.270> kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.689> soldered<00:01:19.110> in

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
surface they're kind of like soldered in

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
surface they're kind of like soldered in
place<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.200> I

place kind of like that and so what I
ended<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.530> doing<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.280> went<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> RadioShack

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
ended up doing was I went to RadioShack

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.819 
ended up doing was I went to RadioShack
and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.259> got<00:01:25.470> these<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.119> three<00:01:27.299> volt<00:01:27.829> I'm

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and I got these it's a three volt I'm

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.710 
and I got these it's a three volt I'm
trying<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.400> my<00:01:29.490> camera<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.479> cell

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
trying to get my camera this is a cell

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
trying to get my camera this is a cell
phone<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.290> trying<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.979> focus

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
phone so I'm trying to get this to focus

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.120 
phone so I'm trying to get this to focus
here<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:34.009> basically<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.130> got<00:01:35.310> these<00:01:35.520> these

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
here but basically I got these these

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.210 
here but basically I got these these
triple<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.810> little<00:01:39.810> cases<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.380> RadioShack<00:01:40.740> for

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
triple a little cases at RadioShack for

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.560 
triple a little cases at RadioShack for
like<00:01:41.340> two<00:01:41.549> dollars<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.850> piece<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.360> come

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
like two dollars a piece and they come

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
like two dollars a piece and they come
with<00:01:42.750> two<00:01:43.470> leads<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.250> basically<00:01:44.430> when

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
with two leads and I just basically when

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789 
with two leads and I just basically when
you<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.270> these<00:01:45.450> batteries<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.079> positive

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
you take these batteries the positive

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.100 
you take these batteries the positive
side<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.159> facing<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.000> tell<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
side is facing up so you can tell that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
side is facing up so you can tell that
this<00:01:49.320> side<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.950> side<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this side and this side here is the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
this side and this side here is the
positive<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.329> side<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.810> side<00:01:51.869> here

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
positive in this side and this side here

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.350 
positive in this side and this side here
is<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> negative<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.850> heated<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.180> my

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
is the negative so I just heated up my

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.959 
is the negative so I just heated up my
soldering<00:01:54.810> iron<00:01:54.950> wherever<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.460> just

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
soldering iron wherever it is here just

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.850 
soldering iron wherever it is here just
a<00:01:57.119> temple<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.630> typical<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.500> soldering

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
a temple little typical little soldering

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.670 
a temple little typical little soldering
iron<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> just<00:02:00.180> heated<00:02:00.960> those<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.290> until<00:02:01.439> they

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
iron and just heated those up until they

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.289 
iron and just heated those up until they
were<00:02:01.740> hot<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.219> obviously<00:02:02.369> tinned<00:02:02.850> these<00:02:03.000> wires

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
were hot I obviously tinned these wires

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
were hot I obviously tinned these wires
tinning<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.930> basically<00:02:04.380> where<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> load<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
tinning is basically where you load the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.080 
tinning is basically where you load the
end<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> wire<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.969> bit<00:02:06.060> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
end of the wire with a little bit of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.749 
end of the wire with a little bit of
solder<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:07.920> kept<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.610> kind

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
solder and you know kept it on just kind

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
solder and you know kept it on just kind
of<00:02:08.819> dipped<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.149> there<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.899> thought<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
of dipped it in there and so I thought I

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.820 
of dipped it in there and so I thought I
was<00:02:10.860> good

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
was good

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.670 
was good
my<00:02:12.400> batteries<00:02:12.820> were<00:02:12.850> definitely<00:02:13.360> weak<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.900> so

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
my batteries were definitely weak and so

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.140 
my batteries were definitely weak and so
I<00:02:14.710> kind<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.130> thought<00:02:15.310> well<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.730> know<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.850> got<00:02:16.030> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
I kind of thought well you know I got it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150 
I kind of thought well you know I got it
I<00:02:16.330> got<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.600> done<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.590> there's<00:02:17.740> another<00:02:17.950> video

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
I got it done and there's another video

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
I got it done and there's another video
on<00:02:18.310> YouTube<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.730> will<00:02:19.000> kind<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.270> show<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
on YouTube that will kind of show the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.440 
on YouTube that will kind of show the
similar<00:02:20.880> outcome<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.060> where<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.300> just

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
similar outcome to where you just

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.060 
similar outcome to where you just
replace<00:02:22.810> these<00:02:22.990> batteries<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.740> you're<00:02:23.860> good

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
replace these batteries and you're good

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.550 
replace these batteries and you're good
to<00:02:24.160> go<00:02:24.190> well<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.820> actually<00:02:25.510> put<00:02:25.990> my<00:02:26.110> batteries

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
to go well I actually put my batteries

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.000 
to go well I actually put my batteries
in<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:29.020> know<00:02:29.140> thought<00:02:29.380> I'd<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.650> good<00:02:29.800> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
in and you know thought I'd be good and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.440 
in and you know thought I'd be good and
kind<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.250> put<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.490> up<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.760> light<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.330> it's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
kind of put it up to light and it's

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.540 
kind of put it up to light and it's
still<00:02:31.660> wasn't<00:02:31.840> working<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.500> was<00:02:33.250> kind<00:02:33.490> of

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
still wasn't working so I was kind of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.790 
still wasn't working so I was kind of
disappointed<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:35.080> thought<00:02:35.260> wow<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.530> know

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
disappointed and I thought wow you know

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.790 
disappointed and I thought wow you know
I<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.840> know<00:02:37.960> thought<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.260> was<00:02:38.410> going<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.590> save

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
I you know thought I was going to save

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.090 
I you know thought I was going to save
my<00:02:38.950> $300<00:02:39.490> welding<00:02:39.880> helmet<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.740> then<00:02:41.740> found

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
my $300 welding helmet and then found

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.730 
my $300 welding helmet and then found
out<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.520> wasn't<00:02:42.910> going<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.060> be<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.270> case<00:02:43.420> so

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
out that wasn't going to be the case so

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.350 
out that wasn't going to be the case so
basically<00:02:44.740> these<00:02:44.950> are<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.250> an<00:02:45.400> LCD<00:02:45.730> TV<00:02:45.850> they

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
basically these are like an LCD TV they

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.930 
basically these are like an LCD TV they
have<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:47.020> series<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.950> little<00:02:48.310> windows<00:02:48.640> that

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
have a series of little windows that

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.390 
have a series of little windows that
when<00:02:49.420> activated<00:02:49.600> will<00:02:50.260> well<00:02:50.950> act<00:02:51.280> like

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
when activated will well act like

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.640 
when activated will well act like
shutters<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.120> they'll<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.020> start<00:02:53.440> to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
shutters and they'll just start to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.250 
shutters and they'll just start to
progressively<00:02:54.550> darken<00:02:55.030> out<00:02:55.150> light<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:55.660> what

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
progressively darken out light so what

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.200 
progressively darken out light so what
mine<00:02:56.470> was<00:02:56.680> doing<00:02:56.950> was<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.400> would<00:02:57.550> momentarily

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
mine was doing was it would momentarily

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.180 
mine was doing was it would momentarily
flicker<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:59.020> would<00:02:59.230> if<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.710> moved<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
flicker it would if I moved the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.890 
flicker it would if I moved the
darkening<00:03:00.670> knob<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.150> side<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.600> helmet

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
darkening knob on the side of the helmet

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.980 
darkening knob on the side of the helmet
it<00:03:02.710> would<00:03:02.950> flicker<00:03:03.310> dark<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.870> would

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
it would flicker dark and then it would

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.960 
it would flicker dark and then it would
come<00:03:05.020> back<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.560> if<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.710> moved<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.100> again<00:03:06.370> I'd

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
come back and if I moved it again I'd

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.340 
come back and if I moved it again I'd
put<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.330> up<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.570> Sun<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.020> would<00:03:08.110> flicker

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
put it up to the Sun it would flicker

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.400 
put it up to the Sun it would flicker
darken<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:08.920> shut<00:03:09.190> back<00:03:09.400> off<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.410> know

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
darken and shut back off so you know

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.020 
darken and shut back off so you know
kind<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:11.860> figured<00:03:12.220> ah<00:03:12.370> well<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:12.820> going<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.970> be

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
kind of figured ah well it's going to be

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.460 
kind of figured ah well it's going to be
somewhere<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.540> board<00:03:13.750> something's<00:03:14.290> not

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
somewhere in the board something's not

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.930 
somewhere in the board something's not
you<00:03:14.800> know<00:03:14.920> hold<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.250> voltage<00:03:15.550> or<00:03:15.700> something

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
you know hold and voltage or something

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.430 
you know hold and voltage or something
like<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.239> but<00:03:16.480> getting<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.320> little

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
like that but getting a little

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.110 
like that but getting a little
discouraged<00:03:18.070> so<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.520> was<00:03:18.730> kind<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.000> looking

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
discouraged so I was kind of looking

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.060 
discouraged so I was kind of looking
around<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.750> internet<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.680> different

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
around on the internet to different

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.810 
around on the internet to different
companies<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.300> make<00:03:22.480> these<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.610> all<00:03:24.610> these

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
companies that make these and all these

all these these these autodarkening

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.479 
all these these these autodarkening
units<00:03:29.290> they<00:03:29.470> come<00:03:29.680> if<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:29.980> see<00:03:30.130> these<00:03:30.250> little

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
units they come if you see these little

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.240 
units they come if you see these little
squares<00:03:30.880> there's<00:03:31.810> one<00:03:32.080> there<00:03:32.380> there's<00:03:33.130> one

there<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:34.120> see<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.420> two<00:03:34.540> little<00:03:34.570> squares

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
there you see the two little squares

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.520 
there you see the two little squares
those<00:03:35.739> are<00:03:35.920> actually<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.459> light<00:03:36.640> sensors<00:03:37.120> for

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
those are actually the light sensors for

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.960 
those are actually the light sensors for
the<00:03:38.530> auto<00:03:38.680> darkening<00:03:39.070> helmet<00:03:39.430> then<00:03:39.550> obviously

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
the auto darkening helmet then obviously

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.310 
the auto darkening helmet then obviously
you<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.270> solar<00:03:40.480> panel<00:03:40.900> on<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.020> LCD

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
you have the solar panel on the LCD

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.979 
you have the solar panel on the LCD
display<00:03:41.610> itself<00:03:42.610> but<00:03:42.910> these<00:03:43.540> two<00:03:43.750> little

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
display itself but these two little

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.540 
display itself but these two little
sensors<00:03:44.410> here<00:03:44.680> they<00:03:44.950> didn't<00:03:45.220> look<00:03:45.310> like<00:03:45.370> they

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
sensors here they didn't look like they

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.650 
sensors here they didn't look like they
had<00:03:45.790> anything<00:03:46.209> wrong<00:03:46.450> with<00:03:46.660> them<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:47.080> all<00:03:47.260> and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
had anything wrong with them at all and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.030 
had anything wrong with them at all and
you<00:03:49.660> know<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.840> could<00:03:50.170> barely<00:03:50.380> I'm<00:03:50.830> just

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
you know you could barely I'm just

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.560 
you know you could barely I'm just
trying<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.310> see<00:03:51.550> in<00:03:51.640> there<00:03:51.820> like<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.390> could

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
trying to see in there like you could

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.699 
trying to see in there like you could
barely<00:03:52.810> tell<00:03:53.110> there<00:03:53.260> was<00:03:53.350> anything<00:03:53.560> wrong

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
barely tell there was anything wrong

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.220 
barely tell there was anything wrong
with<00:03:53.920> them<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.280> mean<00:03:54.810> nothing<00:03:55.810> was<00:03:55.930> dirty

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
with them I mean nothing was dirty

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.160 
with them I mean nothing was dirty
nothing<00:03:56.590> was<00:03:56.890> smoky<00:03:57.340> but<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.690> know<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:58.989> for

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
nothing was smoky but you know just for

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.630 
nothing was smoky but you know just for
the<00:03:59.230> heck<00:03:59.350> of<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.590> since<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.190> already<00:04:00.280> had<00:04:00.520> it

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
the heck of it since I already had it

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.410 
the heck of it since I already had it
apart<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:02.890> ended<00:04:03.640> up<00:04:03.700> taking<00:04:03.910> this<00:04:04.209> whole

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
apart I I ended up taking this whole

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.990 
apart I I ended up taking this whole
board<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:05.020> lifted<00:04:05.440> it<00:04:05.560> up<00:04:05.650> out<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:06.010> there<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.340> I

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
board I lifted it up out of there and I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.960 
board I lifted it up out of there and I
just<00:04:07.239> wiped<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.650> sensors<00:04:09.160> down<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:09.880> it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
just wiped the the sensors down and it

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.310 
just wiped the the sensors down and it
really<00:04:10.180> didn't<00:04:10.510> make<00:04:10.600> them<00:04:10.810> any<00:04:10.930> cleaner

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
really didn't make them any cleaner

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.820 
really didn't make them any cleaner
looking<00:04:11.769> at<00:04:11.890> all<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.870> was<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.170> issue<00:04:14.290> so

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
looking at all but that was the issue so

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.729 
looking at all but that was the issue so
I<00:04:15.160> kind<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.150> had<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.330> combined<00:04:16.780> issue<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.230> the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
I kind of had a combined issue of the

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.440 
I kind of had a combined issue of the
lack<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:17.950> battery<00:04:18.400> power<00:04:18.519> but<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.030> guess<00:04:19.239> just

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
lack of battery power but I guess just

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.159 
lack of battery power but I guess just
welding<00:04:19.900> smoke

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
welding smoke

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.290 
welding smoke
had<00:04:21.919> just<00:04:21.949> created<00:04:22.310> some<00:04:22.669> type<00:04:22.879> of<00:04:22.909> haze<00:04:23.270> on

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
had just created some type of haze on

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.869 
had just created some type of haze on
the<00:04:23.930> light<00:04:24.259> sensor<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:25.039> wasn't<00:04:25.400> allowing<00:04:25.639> it

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:25.879 
the light sensor it wasn't allowing it

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.559 
the light sensor it wasn't allowing it
to<00:04:25.909> tell<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.479> LCD<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.229> shut<00:04:27.470> so<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:29.030> that's<00:04:29.210> a

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
to tell the LCD to shut so so that's a

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.689 
to tell the LCD to shut so so that's a
quick<00:04:29.990> video<00:04:30.289> there<00:04:30.560> if<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:31.039> are<00:04:31.340> doing<00:04:31.580> your

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
quick video there if you are doing your

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.939 
quick video there if you are doing your
battery<00:04:32.090> replacement<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.560> still<00:04:33.770> doesn't

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
battery replacement and it still doesn't

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.339 
battery replacement and it still doesn't
work

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
work

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.689 
work
definitely<00:04:36.349> while<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.800> have<00:04:36.949> it<00:04:37.069> apart<00:04:37.340> clean

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
definitely while you have it apart clean

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.330 
definitely while you have it apart clean
the<00:04:37.909> front<00:04:38.090> of<00:04:38.300> all<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.599> sensors<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:40.099> solar

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
the front of all the sensors the solar

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.189 
the front of all the sensors the solar
display<00:04:40.759> everything<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.659> then<00:04:41.840> hopefully

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
display everything and then hopefully

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.140 
display everything and then hopefully
that<00:04:42.379> will<00:04:42.440> solve<00:04:42.710> your<00:04:42.770> issue<00:04:42.979> and<00:04:43.370> that's<00:04:43.970> it

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
that will solve your issue and that's it

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.960 
that will solve your issue and that's it
hope<00:04:44.599> it<00:04:44.720> helped
