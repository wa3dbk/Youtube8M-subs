it which has a plug for charging the
trek<00:01:02.550> fot<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.090> plug<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> into<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> back<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
trek fot I plug it into the back of the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.929 
trek fot I plug it into the back of the
bot<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.040> controller<00:01:05.400> itself<00:01:05.610> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
bot but then the controller itself is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
bot but then the controller itself is
actually<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.720> charger<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> slide<00:01:07.770> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
actually not the charger you slide this

out and that is a USB adapter you have
to<00:01:11.040> plug<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> into<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> computer<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.479> other

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
to plug that into a computer or other

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
to plug that into a computer or other
device<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.320> has<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> USB<00:01:14.100> port<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.760> is

powered an LED light on this adapter
will<00:01:17.880> let<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.320> done

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
will let you know when it's done

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:32.130 
will let you know when it's done
charging<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.520> ready<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> drive

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.540 

the<00:01:33.140> trek<00:01:33.380> bot<00:01:33.590> kind<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:33.980> has<00:01:34.130> an<00:01:34.310> interesting

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the trek bot kind of has an interesting

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.550 
the trek bot kind of has an interesting
way<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.270> drives<00:01:35.540> around<00:01:35.900> since<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.440> only

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
way that it drives around since it only

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.830 
way that it drives around since it only
has<00:01:36.800> two<00:01:37.100> wheels<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:37.700> they<00:01:37.820> are<00:01:38.000> side<00:01:38.390> by<00:01:38.660> side

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
has two wheels and they are side by side

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.170 
has two wheels and they are side by side
it<00:01:39.740> tends<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.070> get<00:01:40.250> into<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.580> rocking<00:01:41.150> motion

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
it tends to get into a rocking motion

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.450 
it tends to get into a rocking motion
and<00:01:41.750> if<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:42.020> time<00:01:42.230> it<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:42.410> right<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.400> will

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
and if you time it just right it will

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.330 
and if you time it just right it will
just<00:01:43.640> spin<00:01:44.030> within<00:01:44.420> its<00:01:44.600> own<00:01:44.840> size<00:01:45.290> it's<00:01:46.070> sort

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
just spin within its own size it's sort

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.940 
just spin within its own size it's sort
of<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.610> signature<00:01:47.300> trick<00:01:47.900> if<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.320> will<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
of a signature trick if you will of the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.320 
of a signature trick if you will of the
trek<00:01:49.250> box

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.210 

ultimately<00:02:00.330> what<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.900> see<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.440> what<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:01.890> get

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
ultimately what you see is what you get

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.000 
ultimately what you see is what you get
it<00:02:02.760> has<00:02:02.970> one<00:02:03.420> speed<00:02:03.810> forward<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:04.470> reverse<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
it has one speed forward and reverse and

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.640 
it has one speed forward and reverse and
it<00:02:05.550> has<00:02:05.700> no<00:02:05.910> digital<00:02:06.150> proportional<00:02:06.960> control

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
it has no digital proportional control

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.010 
it has no digital proportional control
and<00:02:07.950> steering<00:02:08.310> left<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.820> right<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.210> one

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
and steering left and right as one

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.350 
and steering left and right as one
signature<00:02:10.440> trick<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.130> that's<00:02:11.640> about<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.000> it's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
signature trick and that's about it it's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.450 
signature trick and that's about it it's
just<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.780> cool<00:02:13.200> fun<00:02:13.590> little<00:02:13.860> gadget<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> play

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
just a cool fun little gadget to play

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.250 
just a cool fun little gadget to play
around<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.850> sometimes<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:16.080> those

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
around with sometimes because those

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.690 
around with sometimes because those
wheels<00:02:16.500> are<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:16.920> large<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.550> actually

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
wheels are so large you can actually
