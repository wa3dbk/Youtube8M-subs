labeled<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:20.909> caustic<00:01:21.450> soda<00:01:22.340> once<00:01:23.340> I've

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
labeled as caustic soda once I've

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.279 
labeled as caustic soda once I've
weighed<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:24.090> caustic<00:01:24.539> soda<00:01:24.749> I<00:01:25.079> very

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
weighed out my caustic soda I very

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.950 
weighed out my caustic soda I very
carefully<00:01:25.560> add<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:26.969> water<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.929> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
carefully add that to my water so I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
carefully add that to my water so I
start<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.499> really<00:01:28.859> diluted<00:01:29.759> solution

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
start with a really diluted solution

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.139 
start with a really diluted solution
that<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:31.140> slightly<00:01:31.499> stronger<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
that just get slightly stronger now the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.179 
that just get slightly stronger now the
water<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.689> heat<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.649> will<00:01:34.740> start<00:01:35.039> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
water will heat up and it will start to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.609 
water will heat up and it will start to
set<00:01:35.369> off<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> few<00:01:35.850> fumes<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.600> always<00:01:36.869> do<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.439> in

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
set off a few fumes so always do this in

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
set off a few fumes so always do this in
a<00:01:37.710> ventilated<00:01:38.009> room<00:01:38.549> otherwise<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.450> might

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
a ventilated room otherwise you might

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
a ventilated room otherwise you might
find<00:01:39.810> yourself<00:01:39.990> breathing<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> fumes

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
find yourself breathing in the fumes

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
find yourself breathing in the fumes
which<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.759> unpleasant<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> make<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
which can be unpleasant and make you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.919 
which can be unpleasant and make you
cough<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.499> stir<00:01:44.460> my<00:01:44.670> sodium<00:01:44.999> hydroxide<00:01:45.630> into

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
cough I stir my sodium hydroxide into

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.050 
cough I stir my sodium hydroxide into
the<00:01:46.229> water<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.100> fully<00:01:47.310> dissolves<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the water so that it fully dissolves and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.179 
the water so that it fully dissolves and
doesn't<00:01:48.359> feel<00:01:48.539> gritty<00:01:48.869> anymore<00:01:49.499> this

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
doesn't feel gritty anymore this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.399 
doesn't feel gritty anymore this

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
solution is very alkali and which is why

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980
