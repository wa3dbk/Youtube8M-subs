00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.270
 hello to all the crossover segment 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.770
 urban is in full development 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.850
 the nissan juke was one of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.170
 precursors but has to face 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.810
 today to many competitors 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.640
 to try the best- endowed here 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.640
 today the nissan juke restylÃ©e 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.820
 the nissan juke retains its strong 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.620
 personality is what makes it the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.489
 notice in the street but he receives 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.830
 today what evolutions 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.360
 aesthetic that focuses mainly on 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.750
 the front with a new shield 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.520
 fires that is inspired by the 370z you have 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.900
 also rear optics that have 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.350
 been redesigned just like the shield 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.570
 back 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.850
 you've understood it evolves but in 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.370
 sweetness with thirsty the hymn of the stream 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.479
 nissen are capitalized on the phenomenon 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.729
 customization 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.470
 this was already the case on the previous one 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.540
 been strengthened today we see it 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.340
 with our test models so not 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.820
 always good taste but we're going 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.619
 good here 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.990
 the customization you have more than 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.820
 300 outdoor and indoor possibility 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.979
 you have the entourages of strong at 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.840
 level of the front and rear shield 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.580
 rims of the rearview mirror hulls but 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.960
 you can also indoors to you from 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.310
 make your cheek with please 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.049
 a little more taste than this one 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.729
 no major changes inside 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.110
 this restyled juke the dashboard 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.600
 remains similar to the previous one 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.610
 generation regains the universe of the front 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.630
 tour we would have liked a climb in 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.729
 range at the level of plastics 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.600
 unfortunately this is not the case but 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.280
 for the rest it's a little bit 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.090
 disappointing s is clearly below a 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.830
 peugeot 2008 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.420
 we are going pretty much before our catches 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.310
 when you can see it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.570
 the rear habitability of the juke is just 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.220
 in the category average 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.590
 we would have liked progress 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.820
 not the case however there is really 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.409
 work that is being done at the level of 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.140
 cargo volume that is growing 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.179
 40% to reach 352 liters so a 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.500
 big defect of the game correct is good 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.190
 pity they had not been the same 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.190
 for habitability 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.640
 by the nissan juke have four 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.690
 engines you have three gasoline in them 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.870
 wind powers of 90/100 15 590 horses 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.010
 and a diesel the dci 110 horses which 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.780
 represent the majority of sales 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.860
 is often wrong we have today to 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.930
 the engine test we know well 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.370
 present many vehicles from 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.650
 nissan but also from renault 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.570
 motor coupleux and who show themselves 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.340
 also quite reasonable in terms of 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.959
 consumption so a package rather 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.910
 alluring more than the little one 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.430
 crossover from nissan has a 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.690
 rather dynamic behavior nice to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.550
 use whether it's in town or on 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.209
 road there is not really big 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.250
 cash movements 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.230
 to report yet a little bit dynamic 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.730
 a driving can set through 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.560
 two modes normal and sport 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.720
 so we have a very nice vehicle to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.140
 drive and that confirms success at 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.850
 conditional sales level line scene 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.680
 we ride the power of passion his juke 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.390
 at the level of the lines as his 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.580
 equipment that gets richer it keeps 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.530
 its dynamic qualities but remains a 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.360
 problem its positioning since the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.610
 Japanese builder considers it as 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.709
 a premium crossover and so above 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.120
 catches and Peugeot 2008 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.290
 that's where we at caradisiac we are 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.360
 disagree because he did not see 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.150
 benefits are interesting but not 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.920
 higher than catches or 2008 all the way 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.730
 more than the prices are they are 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.090
 between 15 1990 euros and 28.50 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.070
 euros 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.070
 that is where the problem lies
