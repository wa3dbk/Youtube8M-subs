work on iOS very buggy but it's maybe

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.150 
work on iOS very buggy but it's maybe
because<00:06:03.130> it's<00:06:03.340> developed<00:06:03.700> for<00:06:03.850> at<00:06:04.530> 3.1.3<00:06:05.530> and

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
because it's developed for at 3.1.3 and

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.790 
because it's developed for at 3.1.3 and
also<00:06:06.670> a<00:06:07.440> lower<00:06:08.520> so<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:10.110> I'll<00:06:11.110> have<00:06:11.290> more
