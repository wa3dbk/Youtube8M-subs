00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
i think it's around 350 FPS and I'm if

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.050 
i think it's around 350 FPS and I'm if
I'm<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.699> mistaken<00:01:03.500> Maximus<00:01:04.500> taken<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.850> um

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'm not mistaken Maximus taken but um

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
I'm not mistaken Maximus taken but um
yeah<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.260> good<00:01:07.380> gun<00:01:07.740> except<00:01:08.189> it's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
yeah it's a really good gun except it's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.910 
yeah it's a really good gun except it's
just<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.790> little<00:01:09.000> bit<00:01:09.119> pricey<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
just a little bit pricey and not of the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.190 
just a little bit pricey and not of the
next<00:01:11.189> gun<00:01:11.369> oh<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.360> extreme<00:01:12.689> mine<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
next gun oh it's not extreme mine but I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
next gun oh it's not extreme mine but I
thought<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:14.040> make<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.820> bit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
thought it would make it a little bit

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.679 
thought it would make it a little bit
more<00:01:15.119> fun<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.310> more<00:01:17.310> guns<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:18.270> right

shoots<00:03:21.840> about<00:03:22.050> 400<00:03:22.590> FPS<00:03:23.450> also<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:25.260> grip<00:03:25.470> you

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
shoots about 400 FPS also the grip you

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.479 
shoots about 400 FPS also the grip you
saw<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.129> was<00:03:26.760> from<00:03:27.150> my<00:03:27.180> javelin<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.900> poor<00:03:28.140> I

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
saw in it was from my javelin and poor I

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.920 
saw in it was from my javelin and poor I
the<00:03:29.489> reason<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.879> had<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.120> front<00:03:30.330> rail<00:03:30.480> system

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
the reason I had the front rail system

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.020 
the reason I had the front rail system
it<00:03:31.650> would<00:03:31.830> look<00:03:32.040> cool<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.549> i<00:03:32.760> could<00:03:32.819> have<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it would look cool and i could have a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.960 
it would look cool and i could have a
grip<00:03:33.360> on<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.959> has<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.110> grip<00:03:34.379> on<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.970> all

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
grip on it so it has a grip on it all

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.759 
grip on it so it has a grip on it all
right<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:38.420> right<00:03:39.420> here<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.140> my<00:03:40.590> javelin

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
right and right here we have my javelin

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.300

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
has no wires in it whatsoever so I have

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:19.480 
has no wires in it whatsoever so I have

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
to rewire the whole thing it's an

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.999 
to rewire the whole thing it's an
