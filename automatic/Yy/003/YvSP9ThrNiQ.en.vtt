00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hello there I have the post again 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.570
 for you, and quite fast 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.059
 made frosting when is one 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.670
 fresh cheese frosting, however, already 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 So a few fresh frosts is so much for me 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.420
 schnick schnack with in there now fruit or 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.160
 Of course I have other things as well 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.960
 still chilly for you only for it 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 example, fruit is in there with this is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 Now, this simple cream cheese from 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.610
 what's in the krongut so many 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.550
 various pies and cupcakes pass 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 It is in the right that you have to each 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 If so, then who does not do that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.719
 quite as fast as he thinks he should 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 maybe a little different because of that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.010
 is really cute but I have 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.840
 then hopefully enough frosting for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.760
 then you choose somehow 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.530
 But now you can choose that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.170
 I would like to do that now 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.230
 here the defects years in any case 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.579
 for twelve cupcakes if you have a big one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.170
 pie makes it then you need of course 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 with exact input I write it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.110
 of course in the video description with 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.670
 pure and now we want of course 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.890
 request our frosting 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.010
 the ingredient needs to be brought together 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.439
 150 grams of powdered sugar 225 grams of fresh cheese 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.479
 110 grams of butter and a couple of 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.950
 close sugar is really not much 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.689
 and it's really super fast 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.509
 made the first of so far 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.689
 powdered sugar butter and cream with sugar 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.689
 one 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.890
 that's made a start I greet 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.479
 you need it only long enough 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.760
 beat then you have such a right 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.930
 nice scary mass and now easy 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:54.910
 spoon but the cream cheese 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:56.470
 underlined and well stirred and if 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.540
 it has been revealed then that is 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.210
 already finished and I ready right 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.680
 to the to inject the cupcakes or 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.479
 to provoke pie 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.880
 you should always the same 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.140
 connect because there is butter in there and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.670
 if you say that he falls step by step 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.110
 The relatively firm one can do everything 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.300
 not so good at squirting on the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.250
 cupcakes or not so good anymore 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.610
 emphasize the pie and it indeed like 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.110
 that would be great 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.120
 alternative if somehow times 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.130
 fast something just needs me 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.780
 just want to bake dry cake 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.440
 but somehow the medium 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.570
 to do so as sting or 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.640
 not just cream or other that 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.650
 really like you are super fast 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.000
 Just make a little mix 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.040
 a bit touching together ingredients 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.959
 ready and you can do that too 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.330
 cupcakes pack or their pie 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.010
 I like that it really like for 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.269
 some, it's really sweet because you must 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.160
 of course, then pay attention to it or 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.920
 Just hold on a little less 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.390
 inject the capex on it because otherwise 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.280
 really always a bit too much 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.010
 A lot is when you do that a mountain 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.450
 Cream cheese on top of it will lubricate it well 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.400
 that with this cream cheese cream the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.260
 can you colorize in every color give 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.280
 want because you can indeed quite bright her 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.110
 then just any 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.910
 come to food coloring or the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.920
 Colorize in different colors and 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.660
 then somehow bunch also your cupcakes 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.940
 inject or EUR pie happen so 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.930
 I hope you like that percent me 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.220
 Of course, I am always happy about it 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.600
 comments and photos 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.640
 make exceptions or their own 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.350
 creations he makes it the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.580
 exact quantities are available and in the 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.290
 description with in it 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.700
 and then of course we wanted to flow 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.750
 Although there is little again and turns 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.750
 then say it
