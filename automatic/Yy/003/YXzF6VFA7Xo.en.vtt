00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
amount of paint and I believe I've got

amount of paint and I believe I've got
to<00:02:49.820> get<00:02:49.940> some<00:02:50.390> more<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:52.300> all<00:02:53.300> of<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.510> even

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
to get some more of all of it even

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.110 
to get some more of all of it even
though<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.870> ordered<00:02:54.260> an<00:02:54.350> extra<00:02:54.680> quart<00:02:55.120> recently

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
though I ordered an extra quart recently

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.030 
though I ordered an extra quart recently
just<00:02:56.570> for<00:02:56.720> test<00:02:56.900> panels<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.530> do<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.770> jams

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
just for test panels and to do the jams

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.449 
just for test panels and to do the jams
and<00:02:58.250> all<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:59.570> mean<00:03:00.530> I'll<00:03:00.650> have<00:03:00.770> enough<00:03:01.040> so

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
and all I mean I'll have enough so

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.640 
and all I mean I'll have enough so
rather<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.480> some<00:03:02.690> extra<00:03:03.020> than<00:03:03.200> not<00:03:03.620> enough

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
rather have some extra than not enough

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.930 
rather have some extra than not enough
so<00:03:04.130> we'll<00:03:04.310> see<00:03:05.320> about<00:03:06.320> that

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
so we'll see about that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.760 
so we'll see about that
so<00:03:07.940> anyway<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.480> turned<00:03:08.690> out<00:03:08.810> pretty<00:03:09.260> good<00:03:09.500> it's

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
so anyway it turned out pretty good it's

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.530

oh yeah first coat of candy on there and
yeah<00:05:11.330> pretty<00:05:11.840> much<00:05:12.110> sucked<00:05:16.960> supposed<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.080> be

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
yeah pretty much sucked supposed to be

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.950 
yeah pretty much sucked supposed to be
75<00:05:18.890> percent<00:05:18.920> overlap<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.360> was<00:05:20.510> doing<00:05:20.750> more

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
75 percent overlap and I was doing more

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.450 
75 percent overlap and I was doing more
like<00:05:21.110> 50<00:05:21.500> percent<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.130> I<00:05:24.130> really<00:05:25.130> wasn't<00:05:25.310> even

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
like 50 percent and I really wasn't even

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.430 
like 50 percent and I really wasn't even
consistent<00:05:26.120> at<00:05:26.210> that<00:05:26.390> and<00:05:26.660> it<00:05:26.900> looks<00:05:27.170> like<00:05:27.320> I

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
consistent at that and it looks like I

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.210 
consistent at that and it looks like I
got<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.620> little<00:05:27.890> bit<00:05:27.980> of<00:05:28.070> striping<00:05:28.490> in<00:05:28.580> there<00:05:30.220> so

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
got a little bit of striping in there so

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.100 
got a little bit of striping in there so
it's<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.880> first<00:05:32.000> coat<00:05:32.300> hopefully<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:32.720> can<00:05:32.840> go

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
it's the first coat hopefully I can go

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.770 
it's the first coat hopefully I can go
wetter<00:05:34.040> with<00:05:34.280> this<00:05:34.400> next<00:05:34.730> coat<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.180> something
