00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
all but the great thing about this is if

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.219 
all but the great thing about this is if
you<00:01:06.190> can<00:01:06.640> see<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.920> really<00:01:09.250> expands<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:11.020> wide

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
you can see it really expands to a wide

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.080 
you can see it really expands to a wide
opening<00:01:12.539> so<00:01:13.539> what<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.200> would<00:01:14.320> do<00:01:15.090> you're

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
opening so what you would do you're

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.550 
opening so what you would do you're
going<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.270> start<00:01:16.630> down<00:01:16.869> at<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.170> one<00:01:17.350> end<00:01:17.380> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
going to start down at the one end and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.690 
going to start down at the one end and
we're<00:01:20.560> going<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.740> start<00:01:20.979> right<00:01:21.189> in<00:01:21.430> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
we're going to start right in the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.120 
we're going to start right in the
opening

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.330 

and<00:01:27.640> then<00:01:28.590> simply<00:01:30.780> pushing<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.869> fly<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.470> smooth

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
and then simply pushing a fly and smooth

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
and then simply pushing a fly and smooth
it<00:01:33.549> into<00:01:33.790> place

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
