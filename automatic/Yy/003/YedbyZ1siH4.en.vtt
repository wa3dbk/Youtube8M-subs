my never before seen which so yeah let's
get<00:00:27.200> started

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
get started

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.929 
get started
so<00:00:30.290> I<00:00:30.320> guess<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.829> might<00:00:31.070> as<00:00:31.130> well<00:00:31.369> start<00:00:31.790> with

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
so I guess I might as well start with

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.410 
so I guess I might as well start with
the<00:00:32.059> tank<00:00:32.360> um<00:00:33.370> so<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.610> main<00:00:34.790> reason<00:00:35.270> why<00:00:35.390> I

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
the tank um so the main reason why I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.810 
the tank um so the main reason why I
decided<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.989> update<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:36.800> guy<00:00:37.070> was<00:00:37.460> because

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
um quite a few people who watched the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
accurate enough and I actually agree

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.819 
accurate enough and I actually agree
with<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:53.329> it<00:00:53.510> wasn't<00:00:53.690> very<00:00:53.960> accurate<00:00:54.290> at<00:00:54.680> all

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
couldn't really think of another color

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.310 
couldn't really think of another color
that<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.740> would<00:02:00.950> work<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:08.630> legs<00:02:08.899> are<00:02:09.110> still

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320

exactly the same and the the overall

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.190 
exactly the same and the the overall
design<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.730> minifigure<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.390> still<00:02:14.690> the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
really look that good they could be a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.850 
really look that good they could be a
lot<00:03:19.400> better<00:03:25.390> well<00:03:26.390> these<00:03:26.570> are<00:03:26.840> details<00:03:27.470> in<00:03:27.739> her

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860

t-shirt thing and - the underwear I

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.270 
t-shirt thing and - the underwear I
guess<00:03:38.450> that's<00:03:38.810> what<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.050> call<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:42.280> side

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
guess that's what you call it a side

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.920 
guess that's what you call it a side
detail<00:03:44.830> in<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.280> back<00:03:46.540> um<00:03:48.520> yeah<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.930> that's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
detail in the back um yeah that that's

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.199 
detail in the back um yeah that that's
that<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:52.040> outline<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.580> a<00:03:52.610> little<00:03:52.880> bit<00:03:53.000> too

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
that that outline is a little bit too

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.430 
that that outline is a little bit too
thick<00:03:53.599> I<00:03:53.900> did<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.830> with<00:03:54.980> um<00:03:55.190> paint<00:03:56.290> instead<00:03:57.290> of

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
thick I did it with um paint instead of

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.280 
thick I did it with um paint instead of
a<00:03:57.790> sharpie<00:03:58.790> because<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.150> didn't<00:03:59.420> have<00:04:00.260> a

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
a sharpie because I didn't have a

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.970 
a sharpie because I didn't have a
Sharpie<00:04:00.739> when<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> made<00:04:01.129> this<00:04:02.230> um<00:04:05.379> has<00:04:06.379> actually

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
Sharpie when I made this um has actually

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.869 
Sharpie when I made this um has actually
sculpted<00:04:07.550> out<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.790> an<00:04:07.879> air<00:04:08.090> dry<00:04:08.360> modeling<00:04:08.870> clay

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
sculpted out of an air dry modeling clay

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.490 
sculpted out of an air dry modeling clay
I<00:04:10.879> guess<00:04:11.629> if<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.900> wanted<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.260> do<00:04:12.379> this

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
I guess if you wanted to do this

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.860 
I guess if you wanted to do this
yourself<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:13.129> could<00:04:13.280> just<00:04:13.459> use<00:04:13.670> um<00:04:13.970> Thor's

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
yourself you could just use um Thor's

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.310 
yourself you could just use um Thor's
hair<00:04:15.319> from<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.739> Avengers<00:04:16.010> sets<00:04:16.810> but<00:04:17.810> uh<00:04:17.870> I

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
hair from the Avengers sets but uh I

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.190 
hair from the Avengers sets but uh I
think<00:04:18.470> clay<00:04:18.950> works<00:04:19.310> just<00:04:19.640> as<00:04:19.760> well<00:04:20.200> it's

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
think clay works just as well it's

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.820 
think clay works just as well it's
pretty<00:04:21.410> good<00:04:21.530> clay<00:04:22.030> dries<00:04:23.030> up<00:04:23.240> pretty<00:04:23.450> good

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
pretty good clay dries up pretty good

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.570 
pretty good clay dries up pretty good
really<00:04:24.830> solid<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:27.010> I<00:04:28.010> think<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.280> color<00:04:28.490> I

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
really solid and I think the color I

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.050 
really solid and I think the color I
painted<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.210> looks<00:04:29.450> pretty<00:04:30.169> accurate<00:04:32.830> um<00:04:34.060> her

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
painted it looks pretty accurate um her

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.570 
painted it looks pretty accurate um her
face<00:04:35.300> looks<00:04:35.570> okay<00:04:35.990> it's<00:04:36.770> not<00:04:36.950> that<00:04:37.310> impressive

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
face looks okay it's not that impressive

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.089 
face looks okay it's not that impressive
but<00:04:38.090> it's<00:04:38.599> got<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.780> basic<00:04:39.169> look<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.710> got<00:04:40.070> a

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
but it's got the basic look you got a

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.800 
but it's got the basic look you got a
eyes<00:04:40.729> mouth<00:04:41.390> eyebrows<00:04:42.080> cheekbones<00:04:42.970> so<00:04:43.970> yeah

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
eyes mouth eyebrows cheekbones so yeah

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.360 
eyes mouth eyebrows cheekbones so yeah
that's<00:04:45.140> pretty<00:04:45.470> much<00:04:45.800> all<00:04:46.039> I<00:04:46.099> had<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.340> say

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
that's pretty much all I had to say

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.480 
that's pretty much all I had to say
about<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.849> witch<00:04:47.030> so<00:04:47.740> yeah<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.770> might<00:04:49.039> update

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
her in future as I said but I think for

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.130 
her in future as I said but I think for
now<00:04:51.950> she's<00:04:52.250> fine<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:54.110> yeah<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.880> guess<00:04:55.880> I'll<00:04:56.180> just

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
now she's fine so yeah I guess I'll just

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.960 
now she's fine so yeah I guess I'll just
finish<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.680> video<00:04:57.919> with<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:59.110> comparison<00:05:00.110> of
