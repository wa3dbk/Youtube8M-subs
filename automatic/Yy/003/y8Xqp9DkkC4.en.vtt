their beat this is really very nice game

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.290 
their beat this is really very nice game
because<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.630> work<00:00:09.950> most<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.429> time<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:12.090> try

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
because you work most of the time we try

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.820 
because you work most of the time we try
car<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.500> drive<00:00:14.389> what<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> call<00:00:15.719> Mucha<00:00:16.529> bike

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
car we drive what you call Mucha bike

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.790 
car we drive what you call Mucha bike
right<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.359> about<00:00:18.779> driving<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.560> bus

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.460 
right so this is about driving the bus
so<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.580> pretty<00:00:21.000> difficult<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.600> us<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.960> drive

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
so it's pretty difficult for us to drive

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.040 
so it's pretty difficult for us to drive
because<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.189> are<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.640> bus<00:00:24.180> driver

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
because we are not a bus driver

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.250 
because we are not a bus driver
