00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.210
 the guys wanted to explain a little today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.389
 why the history paper of the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 because loose frame at the bottom 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.590
 first place we explained 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.439
 that richer composition more awaits 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.720
 also does not strengthen much in the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
 draw paper stayed very wet 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 not safe 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.810
 usually paper make history row 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.810
 Exit only generally used this recall here 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 the rock black chains 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.600
 this is a very good glue she is more 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.640
 delicious 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 she did not but the composition is better 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 second step because it bursts 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.239
 generally have the mania to do 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:58.649
 what 'plate plate on silk pulled one 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 hook only firm japan signed the show of the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.080
 hook that was already how person will be 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.980
 Bahia started its plate affirms do the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 finger and it will provoke rain in secret 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.950
 It's good that I also do the following is 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.950
 like this 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.270
 usually school because at the time of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.130
 glue is always a failure 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.320
 personal but that rolled very fast 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.350
 pass glue too fast 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 leaves off the sticking it facilitates 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.570
 time to burst because the heat will go 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.570
 pulling the paper will pull the line too 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.510
 what will happen is a failure in the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.430
 the tip of the date on the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.520
 any step where at the time the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.160
 expand paper or pick up here to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.649
 drop that will happen with paper heat 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.340
 but godard totally because that with 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.070
 failure an air bubble 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.180
 he was here in the center or in the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 hood tip 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.660
 will brush pop for just 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.640
 Because he talks about putting the mind on 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.080
 other and others 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.930
 Another problem is also usually the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.879
 guys do it 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.879
 the plate 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.670
 go pro bush passed and do not buy fix 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.430
 on my glue it will prune just like that but the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.570
 I held the paper for more than 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.900
 beauty 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.630
 so begins at the top that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.520
 locks the paper by hand over 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.190
 here is going to happen I will lock up with the 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.210
 paper will maintain the paper's firmness 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.680
 and then go down 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.380
 poison hat lap spent at the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.360
 from below and running your hand over the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.390
 area who was a teenager affirms the role 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.390
 information on paper and glue on which 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.530
 scatters a question if they punish 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.620
 peace love happens stay air bubbles 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.630
 The cup does not take the same kiss even if 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.720
 passing over this point is not picking up 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.510
 the button calmly and will go-pull the 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.460
 paper that will come 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.410
 This is really what happens in 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.570
 speed too who wants to do too much 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.280
 fast has factory down or else 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.590
 usually will always have this problem 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.050
 conflict in history none here with 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.900
 glue beavers for even the lines that 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.050
 they will burst generally, no problem 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.570
 makes them companies in the 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.490
 history is also a matter of making the 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.800
 The question of putting a hand is a matter of 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.010
 hygiene treatment 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.630
 a person if totally a luxury not 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.120
 need I realized it really is 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.000
 very well manufactured I think that for my 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.760
 Finishing system with glue 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.430
 said yesterday at the beach of frame already goes 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.430
