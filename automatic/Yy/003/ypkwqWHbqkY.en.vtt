vigilance and she has have been vital
for<00:01:47.250> them<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.610> been<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> team<00:01:48.030> effort<00:01:48.890> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
for them but it's been a team effort to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.230 
for them but it's been a team effort to
wear<00:01:50.040> attacks<00:01:50.340> being<00:01:50.549> pretty<00:01:50.759> much<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.090> best

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
wear attacks being pretty much the best

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.840 
wear attacks being pretty much the best
form<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> defence<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.890> Mesut<00:01:53.430> resile

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
form of defence and that Mesut resile

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609 
form of defence and that Mesut resile
because<00:01:54.149> Brazil<00:01:54.270> Brazil<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.320> able<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
because Brazil Brazil will be able to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.590 
because Brazil Brazil will be able to
hit<00:01:56.460> them<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.729> counter<00:01:57.149> attack<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
hit them on the counter attack and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
hit them on the counter attack and
that's<00:01:57.719> where<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> feel<00:01:58.350> Vidal<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.920> vital<00:01:59.670> for
