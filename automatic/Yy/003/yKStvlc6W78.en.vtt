you're going to change that to a six so
I<00:02:50.180> should<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.569> like<00:02:50.750> little<00:02:51.130> two<00:02:52.130> little

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
I should see like little two little

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.410 
I should see like little two little
sticky<00:02:53.690> majiggy<00:02:54.140> there<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.030> then<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.239> rest

sticky majiggy there and then the rest

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.059 
sticky majiggy there and then the rest
of<00:02:56.630> them<00:02:56.750> make<00:02:57.380> them<00:02:57.680> zeros<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:00.380> as<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.950> can

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069

see<00:03:01.310> here<00:03:01.580> making<00:03:01.940> long<00:03:02.120> zeros<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.220> so

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
see here making long zeros like that so

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.130 
see here making long zeros like that so
when<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.030> go<00:03:05.150> over<00:03:05.330> here<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.569> service<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.959> call
