all the pros and cons of the different
engine<00:00:14.219> configurations<00:00:15.179> but<00:00:15.420> each<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.690> good

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
engine configurations but each is good

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.490

how each major engine layout is done and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.550 
how each major engine layout is done and
give<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> some<00:00:30.539> conventional<00:00:31.170> wisdom<00:00:31.500> on

what its benefits are okay the inline

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.220 
what its benefits are okay the inline
engine<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.000> perhaps<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> simplest<00:00:39.870> most

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
engine is perhaps the simplest most

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.229

this<00:00:45.059> gets<00:00:45.329> its<00:00:45.539> name<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.559> cylinders

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
this gets its name because the cylinders

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
this gets its name because the cylinders
are<00:00:47.250> arranged<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> line<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.140> down

in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> front<00:01:33.750> you've<00:01:34.110> got<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.590> set<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.979> four

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250

this<00:01:39.150> way<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.960> took<00:01:40.200> two

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this way it's kind like you took two

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
crankshaft and just tilted them apart so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
crankshaft and just tilted them apart so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
they could live in one space the key

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
they could live in one space the key
here<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.369> you're<00:01:47.520> fitting<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.880> lot<00:01:48.180> of

got six cylinders on each side as you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.260 
got six cylinders on each side as you
can<00:04:25.710> kind<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.130> see<00:04:26.340> there<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.970> on<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> other

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
can kind of see there and on the other

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.510 
can kind of see there and on the other
side<00:04:27.390> are<00:04:27.780> six<00:04:28.020> more<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.440> they<00:04:28.710> are<00:04:28.740> exactly

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520

apart<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:33.150> point<00:04:33.479> here<00:04:33.750> is<00:04:33.780> you've<00:04:34.050> got<00:04:34.169> a

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
apart the point here is you've got a

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.930 
apart the point here is you've got a
very<00:04:34.260> low<00:04:34.740> engine<00:04:35.130> because<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.460> thing<00:04:35.610> sticks

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
very low engine because the thing sticks

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.330 
very low engine because the thing sticks
up<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.780> be<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:36.960> low<00:04:37.229> motor<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.770> sits<00:04:38.130> low

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
up it can be a low motor that sits low

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.340 
up it can be a low motor that sits low
in<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.640> car<00:04:38.880> giving<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.510> a<00:04:39.539> lower<00:04:39.840> center<00:04:40.320> of

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
in the car giving you a lower center of

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.140 
in the car giving you a lower center of
gravity<00:04:40.470> great<00:04:41.220> for<00:04:41.400> performance<00:04:42.000> and

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
gravity great for performance and

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.850 
gravity great for performance and
cornering<00:04:42.570> it's<00:04:43.080> also<00:04:43.229> an<00:04:43.440> engine<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.740> is

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
cornering it's also an engine that is

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.290 
cornering it's also an engine that is
good<00:04:44.130> if<00:04:44.280> you're<00:04:44.400> trying<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.669> package<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
good if you're trying to package the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.960 
good if you're trying to package the
body<00:04:45.510> low<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> low<00:04:46.680> sleek<00:04:47.100> design<00:04:47.520> take<00:04:47.940> a

body low for a low sleek design take a

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.510 
body low for a low sleek design take a
look<00:04:48.210> at<00:04:48.300> let's<00:04:48.450> say<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:48.690> Subaru<00:04:49.350> BRZ<00:04:49.560> they<00:04:50.460> were

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
look at let's say a Subaru BRZ they were

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.100 
look at let's say a Subaru BRZ they were
able<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.940> get<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.090> low<00:04:51.300> center<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.660> gravity<00:04:51.750> and

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
able to get a low center of gravity and

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.080 
able to get a low center of gravity and
alone<00:04:52.710> knows<00:04:52.919> because<00:04:53.190> they've<00:04:53.580> got<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.789> flat

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
alone knows because they've got a flat

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.390 
alone knows because they've got a flat
engine<00:04:54.479> in<00:04:54.600> there<00:04:54.780> these<00:04:55.380> are<00:04:55.560> called<00:04:55.800> boxers

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
engine in there these are called boxers

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.090 
engine in there these are called boxers
