00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.730
 now let's clean the mazzancolle mazzancolle 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.490
 they are inside there they are raised there 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.690
 here in the Venetian lagoon in the only one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.590
 brand are beautiful to see each other again 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.699
 clean them just it will be a little water in 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.580
 correspondence of the pieces if there are 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.699
 of the traces of recycling vis with silvia 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 leather but few service comoros enough 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 the thing a feature to see 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.630
 that the fish the crustacean is fresh and of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.489
 look at your back on the side of the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.690
 back 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.320
 they do a level of the back a 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.329
 just the duct that shines faeces 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.370
 from the final part 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.340
 as the shrimp glazes it 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.620
 paste or any shellfish becomes 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 old this pipe that now does not 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 let's see why they are so fresh it becomes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.230
 black 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 you understand you have caught some fish 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.820
 cool when the back part 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.150
 as in this case you see there is done 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.400
 fatigue there is a very small stretch those 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.710
 of is practically a kind of gut 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 that brings the faeces to the prosecution these 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.020
 here they are very fresh and cannot be seen 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.479
 anything 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.060
 this is not a characteristic sign 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.020
 to understand if you have the weight you choose or 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.579
 fresh shellfish or scale plan are 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 very good the plate after maybe 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.840
 we can influence if we affect the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.900
 body 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.390
 we have the advantage of not staying long 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.810
 take care of it but we have the disadvantage that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 all the liquid in the body comes out 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.750
 of the animal loses and also loses becomes 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.759
 harder so I suggest we treat it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.250
 always whole and eat and prepare it 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.969
 cook it this way and after a little patience 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.969
 opens
