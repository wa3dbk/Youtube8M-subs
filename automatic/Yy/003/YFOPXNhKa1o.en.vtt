00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.859
 beauty gal is making a video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
 now about the clutch just arrived 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.219
 for me here 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.869
 the plateau by 1200 pounds of max power from 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.750
 Friend paulo helio in goiÃ¢nia 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.300
 Let's use plates of 1,200 books 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.519
 with six games without a ball 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.050
 so here pick in the steering wheel 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.989
 we did a cleaning service here 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.140
 there is the ancient plateau that occurs 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.950
 when the guy was with me the original 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.050
 was using the actor luke original line 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.879
 mounting bracket of 1.8 or 2.0 that the same 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.039
 rapporteur was being used with 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 reacting this day 6 tablets in timbre 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.010
 Mora was walking with him six in the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.760
 turbine master power model r 474 that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.299
 missed 47 middle 49 axis 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 I believe that between 233 40 horses and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.259
 that it's expression did not slip 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 endured beauty so the tip for those who do not 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.830
 want to put a stronger normal plateau 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.280
 to keep the pedal hard 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.020
 a good request is the original dish look 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.250
 1.8 and 2.0 which is the same for both 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.590
 6- disk drive 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.110
 no group move is legal 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.759
 sometimes a little bit of trepidation 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.939
 first and second also when you 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.320
 walking is good will have to take a 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:56.759
 little more nothing too excessive and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:08.810
 arrived for me is today the actor thousand and 200 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:14.380
 pounds here plus one and the parts design 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.020
 and we are going to wait for the moment of 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.390
 assembly here to read what you have to 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:27.530
 notion I rode approximately 1300 and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.170
 1400 kilometers in the car walking with 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.760
 pressure on you at the beginning after I 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:39.980
 I came back to that 4 because the suspension 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.560
 It's a little more comfortable with that. 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.360
 is trailing too late 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.069
 marches is not to have to 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.540
 car suspension gets tougher already 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.540
 that car to the street 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.880
 at that time he decided to download pre sal pl 4 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.610
 so it was cool and it was not even 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.459
 selecting third test at high 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.640
 third rotation downtown chapter 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.180
 demand may pressure the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.530
 still shares according to measurement side 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.970
 of max power galera spent 1 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.540
 millimeters only 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:21.739
 or that nothing the matches are in state 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:24.170
 New York also takes into account that 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:32.829
 the original plateau does not have as much load 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:34.670
 but one did not use good touches 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.959
 short 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.680
 taking into account that my 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.250
 original can not also reinforce the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.109
 too much bug 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.579
 Now, this whole set here says that six 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:52.880
 matches without ball is agile and 200 free 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:59.239
 now you can push a little more 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:06.069
 wind is going to be the end of the joke is 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.069
 That's it folks to show you here 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.090
 logo and lux logo and this is the 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:20.239
 model is that she is arrested by 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.820
 by locks that here in this place 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.610
 are proofs 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.920
 somewhat less resistant in the case and was 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.220
 turn into 200 pounds of our 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.780
 province that the difference is this here is 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:42.040
 the model a little older but here it is 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.680
 by pim is locked by pina controlled 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.930
 with horribilis pins I do not know what to say 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.060
 that's right 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:56.070
 it has a much greater resistance than 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.070
 this younger model he found 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:05.340
 with engine power 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.340
 This lock has opened and she starts the game. 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:16.210
 People, I had to be passing by. 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:18.250
 You information today is this. 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.260
 so another thing I walked 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:26.590
 Searching the galera is using a lot of 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.840
 cut the fork and lengthen a little 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.570
 or use original santana 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.460
 that is greater than that of the goal gives 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.580
 to achieve also serves would be the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:41.620
 between the goal and the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.680
 santana getting lighter 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.890
 even admitting 200 pounds with fork 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.080
 stretched to get cooler but more 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.070
 light in goias will increase slightly 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.590
 course reminds us but this is it for 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.290
 who does not like heavy team that uses the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:04.300
 car on a daily basis is a good request there 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.780
 to make the trip lighter 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.730
 cool, cool, that's it, guys 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.730
 I hug everyone and see you
