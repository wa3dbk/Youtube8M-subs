00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:35.820 

your<00:04:28.200> file<00:04:29.200> like<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.160> deadline

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.269 

so<00:04:36.830> I'm<00:04:37.249> just<00:04:37.399> gonna<00:04:37.610> double-click<00:04:38.569> on<00:04:38.839> it

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.309 

this<00:04:43.279> is<00:04:43.520> kind<00:04:43.939> of<00:04:43.969> hard<00:04:44.180> I'm<00:04:44.449> not<00:04:44.659> real<00:04:44.930> good

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
this is kind of hard I'm not real good

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:51.100 
this is kind of hard I'm not real good
at<00:04:45.860> this<00:04:47.139> like<00:04:48.139> did<00:04:48.409> with<00:04:48.649> the<00:04:49.839> right<00:04:50.839> there

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
at this like did with the right there

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.200 
at this like did with the right there
that's<00:04:51.289> why<00:04:51.559> because<00:04:52.069> my<00:04:52.279> wife<00:04:52.639> eyes<00:04:52.939> off

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
that's why because my wife eyes off

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.600 
that's why because my wife eyes off
that's<00:04:53.449> why<00:04:53.629> it's<00:04:53.779> not<00:04:53.809> connected<00:04:54.520> so<00:04:55.520> you

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
that's why it's not connected so you

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.980 
that's why it's not connected so you
just<00:04:55.759> want<00:04:55.969> to<00:04:56.029> make<00:04:56.119> sure<00:04:56.180> Wi-Fi<00:04:56.719> is

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
just want to make sure Wi-Fi is

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:05.230 
just want to make sure Wi-Fi is
connected<00:04:57.589> before<00:04:57.979> doing<00:04:58.339> it<00:05:03.189> all<00:05:04.189> right<00:05:04.399> no

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
connected before doing it all right no

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.010 
connected before doing it all right no
longer<00:05:05.719> I'll<00:05:06.709> reconnect<00:05:07.339> that<00:05:07.819> is<00:05:10.569> so<00:05:11.569> it'll

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
longer I'll reconnect that is so it'll

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.469 
longer I'll reconnect that is so it'll
come<00:05:12.199> up<00:05:12.229> tell<00:05:12.949> you<00:05:13.009> to<00:05:13.099> put<00:05:13.639> password<00:05:14.149> in<00:05:14.270> just
