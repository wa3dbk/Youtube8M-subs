00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
not the Cassiopeia that shows up image

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
not the Cassiopeia that shows up image
the<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> beginning<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the one for in the beginning for the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.969 
the one for in the beginning for the
wallpapers<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.299> actual<00:01:07.229> gameplay

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
wallpapers but the actual gameplay

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.460 
wallpapers but the actual gameplay
Cassiopeia<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.150> she<00:01:09.900> has<00:01:10.080> her<00:01:10.110> face<00:01:10.500> contoured

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
Cassiopeia so she has her face contoured

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.980 
Cassiopeia so she has her face contoured
with<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.820> actually<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
with some well it's actually not the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
with some well it's actually not the
face<00:01:16.409> contouring<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> thought<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.060> would

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
face contouring but I thought it would

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
face contouring but I thought it would
just<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:18.840> realistic<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.710> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
just look more realistic if I just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
just look more realistic if I just
picture<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.430> face<00:01:20.670> instead<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.119> adding<00:01:21.750> more

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
picture my face instead of adding more

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.580 
picture my face instead of adding more
probably<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.630> comfortable

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
probably because it's not comfortable

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.819 
probably because it's not comfortable
and<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.600> sleep<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and actually you know it can sleep so I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
and actually you know it can sleep so I
just<00:01:29.220> decided<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> control<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.270> face<00:01:30.509> with

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
just decided to control my face with

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.830 
just decided to control my face with
something<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.610> once<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.479> green

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
