 hi there, you are watching geonics members and 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.910
 we continue on server silver 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.300
 blade regular reporting episode about 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.170
 what i'm doing actually on the server but 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.480
 Firstly here it is a mill run up not 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.000
 I will go there because basically nothing 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.730
 quite special about it in itself is not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.439
 Well, I can't do anything 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.720
 build mills but nonetheless 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.929
 the mill asked the mill I wanted well and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 here is something like her I tried 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.750
 here to portray 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.770
 what happened then came out in general then curve 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.840
 slanting well, but I built it myself of course 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.680
 it contrasts strongly with the house 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.629
 for example, how can you not do anything 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.039
 able to build the police and everything is stupid 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.350
 I generally did not want to copy it 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.570
 secondly of course the field while I'm 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 the mill without field this field is decorative 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.770
 the plant will be harvested by wheat 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.640
 decreases and yellow beautiful this 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.460
 the process maybe it will only expand but i 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.840
 won't him 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.030
 all the same with him nothing to collect me 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 there will be a separate wheat firm somewhere 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 elsewhere the manufacturer on 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.390
 automatic everything as it should be 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.119
 and then that's the one that's here all the same 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.159
 let's go up or lamp lamp lanka everywhere 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.380
 lamps by the way my horse died so 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:33.409
 everything is very sad and there someone from 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.720
 players walk it seems clavel to 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.140
 maybe maybe someone from the guys I 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.060
 I see that it is on the radar but who is it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 not sure what this company is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.240
 cane which brings me very 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.540
 a lot but actually cane and paper and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.710
 sugar common chest stray about 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.780
 1 double collection box which is enough for me 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.290
 just for the eyes that is i don't collect it 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.780
 constantly only occasionally 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.600
 really needed well and since we 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:14.610
 Here came the mill such a lamb 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.830
 before entering the door inside dark oak here 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.040
 such here about fat sight 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:26.060
 well, it looks a bit like a cafe nightmare 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.800
 khz and they are 100 since this one here 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.470
 I like what to call it and do not even know 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.010
 it is not centered but a little shifted I am not 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.250
 took into account the fact that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.140
 design 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.049
 these circles themselves are from even numbers 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.070
 blocks, so they donâ€™t have a center 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.440
 there are only two blocks to do this 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.799
 a pole of two deck blocks is very strange 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.140
 and so pay should not be this kabul 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.100
 I just asked removes all put it 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.900
 when built in general, the squirrel is simple 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.750
 as I said it is made of white 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.209
 clay but I basically like her 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.799
 not bad here will be anything too 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.110
 such a small area can be 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:15.829
 do something I don't know bakery will 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.670
 sell here loaves closely put 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:23.000
 Nosatova I will not be well, like that here and so 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.620
 this half 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.370
 here are the flashlights as single player exactly 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.230
 nothing 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.629
 new here put nothing 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.010
 new did not occur mines 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.150
 now under reconstruction 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.390
 sorry there gareta is poured yes and then 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.110
 what am i on the body and here are four hours 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.790
 on the stream on the recent po moemu from 24 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.470
 March is not that there were many 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.390
 built but i want a little nakosyachil 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.780
 little had to rebuild in general 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.629
 It turned out such here in my opinion 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.030
 pretty first floor of my building 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.970
 which is called building because 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.290
 that I have no idea what will be in it 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.200
 now i have some thoughts on 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.750
 about this but something specific I 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.229
 I have not yet invented this building 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.090
 buildings it exists to 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.100
 exist laugh with this 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.070
 someday it will be anything but 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.320
 yet like this and of course it 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.280
 only the walls are only the first floor 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.150
 there will be another 2 floor at that time I already have it 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.490
 He built in principle the same as 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.139
 first only here and big go 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.660
 will see later there will be cosmetic 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.610
 changes between floors 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.630
 should patrick is a septum and i have her 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.030
 I think about her little by little 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.070
 better to do otherwise without a septum she 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.750
 It will look very strange and 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.750
 after the second floor forest roof too 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.490
 I will not do there will be the third floor 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.139
 the final stage is that it will 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.590
 will become a three-story third floor this 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.590
 something like an attic of just such a very 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.180
 large scoop and some roof with 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.599
 roof of course the most difficult question 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:20.360
 because the roofs of such a plan are not 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:23.150
 suitable for this building maybe i 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.550
 I will make just such a roof that is all the same 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.620
 maybe i will come to this option here 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:34.310
 this part it will be like this it will be 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.129
 go to the center and in the center 13 more 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.719
 as if 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.099
 I do not know what his name is without him and there it is 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:44.969
 here's the thing right over the center 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:48.129
 let's be already run things 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:52.899
 to be like this, and here the rest 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:55.749
 the roof is turned the other way 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:58.089
 Generally it is easier to show later than you 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:00.749
 now explain on the fingers because i 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:03.819
 I still do not know how the entrance will be made 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:05.979
 naturally it won't just be a hole 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.610
 naturally it will not arch the entrance to 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.319
 such a building should be matched to him he 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.300
 should be beautiful it should be 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.689
 great he should be interesting he 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.779
 should be it should work and of course 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:22.889
 I have not put any lighting 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.999
 this building will be interesting enough 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.429
 illumination illuminated it will be stupid 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:30.459
 Lamps naturally stitched stones 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:33.459
 words naturally she will be lit 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:35.589
 lamps but not around the perimeter 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:38.679
 the lamps will be just down somewhere here 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:42.309
 somewhere here here alone there 2 in general 

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:45.240
 it will be lit from the bottom up and if 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:49.179
 I will succeed I will even exclude 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.409
 lighting around maybe i will succeed 

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:52.419
 somehow direct the light 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:54.579
 exclusively up but for now i'm not 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.309
 I know how to do it if you have 

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:58.809
 what options write to the group in 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:59.619
 contact there is a special album for 

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:03.249
 offers 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:04.899
 Well, so far that's something like this on this 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:09.339
 Today, all this is all that I managed to do 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:13.300
 March 24 for stream and up to 23 in my 

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:17.619
 23 we did this here is the mill 25 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.869
 March twitch did not want to either come to life in 

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:20.439
 connection with what I had to stream 

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:24.159
 to transfer 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:25.659
 the show just an hour fell twitch fell all 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.550
 it was very bad I did not have time 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.810
 build otherwise it would not be natural 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:35.120
 naturally 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:38.090
 more I would have to show besides 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.590
 here are these two buildings on this on 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.169
 today everything and I hope that you 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:47.740
 liked it all thanks for watching 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:47.740
 sign up thumbs up bye
