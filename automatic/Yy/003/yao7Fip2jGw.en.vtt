00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
asked that how to even join as a command

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.209 
asked that how to even join as a command
that<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.750> said<00:00:36.809> before<00:00:37.020> not<00:00:37.829> every

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that so as I said before not every

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
that so as I said before not every
server<00:00:38.460> has<00:00:38.579> come<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> mount<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.629> not<00:00:39.960> all

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
server has come on the mount and not all

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
server has come on the mount and not all
of<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.500> available<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.180> some

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
of them are available and there are some

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
of them are available and there are some
conditions<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.410> first<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
conditions to it so first of all you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.520 
conditions to it so first of all you
have<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.789> level<00:00:45.120> 10<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> least<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.410> be

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
have to be level 10 at the least to be

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
have to be level 10 at the least to be
able<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.800> join<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.219> server<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> commander

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
able to join a server as a commander

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
able to join a server as a commander
when<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.840> become<00:00:49.590> level<00:00:49.800> 10<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> reach

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
when you become level 10 when you reach

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.020 
when you become level 10 when you reach
rank<00:00:50.820> 10<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.920> join<00:00:53.309> servers<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
rank 10 then you can join servers as a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.959 
rank 10 then you can join servers as a
commander<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.559> other<00:00:55.860> than<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.940> can

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
commander but other than that you can

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.599 
commander but other than that you can
just<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> example<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> server<00:00:59.399> who

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
just there see a example of a server who

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
just there see a example of a server who
didn't<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> commander<00:01:00.809> mode<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.500> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
didn't have a commander mode and now you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.529 
didn't have a commander mode and now you
can<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:01.980> example<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> server<00:01:02.699> which<00:01:02.969> has<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
can see example of a server which has a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
can see example of a server which has a
commander<00:01:04.110> mode<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.790> there's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
commander mode as you can see there's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
commander mode as you can see there's
the<00:01:06.420> button<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> join<00:01:07.140> server<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> click

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the button to join server when you click

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.820 
the button to join server when you click
the<00:01:08.130> server<00:01:08.400> under<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.240> says<00:01:09.960> commander<00:01:10.619> so

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the server under that says commander so

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
the server under that says commander so
basically<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.520> join<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> commander

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
basically you can join as a commander

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.670 
basically you can join as a commander
and<00:01:12.540> below<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.530> how<00:01:13.650> many

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and below there you can see how many

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
and below there you can see how many
commanders<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> game<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.720> atom

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
commanders are in the game which atom

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.719 
commanders are in the game which atom
and<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> 0<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.770> 2<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.310> means<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> can

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and the 0 of 2 so that means you can

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.450 
and the 0 of 2 so that means you can
join<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> commander<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> teams

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
join as a commander of one of the teams

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
join as a commander of one of the teams
basically<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.939> simple<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.479> other

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
basically it's as simple as that other

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499 
basically it's as simple as that other
than<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> servers<00:01:24.060> have

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
than that some of the servers have

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.749 
than that some of the servers have
spectator<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.590> comes<00:01:25.920> under<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.400> command

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
spectator which comes under the command

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
spectator which comes under the command
as<00:01:26.909> well<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.659> doesn't<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
as well which this one doesn't and you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
as well which this one doesn't and you
can<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> next<00:01:29.310> example<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:30.350> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
can see in the next example here that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.840 
can see in the next example here that
there's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.799> commander<00:01:32.220> mode<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> there's<00:01:32.729> no

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there's a commander mode and there's no

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.550 
there's a commander mode and there's no
spectator<00:01:33.390> mode<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> next<00:01:34.259> one

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
spectator mode so in the next one

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
spectator mode so in the next one
actually<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.689> pictures<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:36.810> flip

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
actually that the pictures actually flip

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually that the pictures actually flip
through<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
through you can see that there is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
through you can see that there is
spectator<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> commanders<00:01:40.920> who<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> join

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
spectator and commanders who can join

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
spectator and commanders who can join
the<00:01:41.579> spectator<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.150> well<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.570> for

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the spectator as well which for

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.660 
the spectator as well which for
spectators<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
spectators I think that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.999 
spectators I think that
or<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.270> respect<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.900> not<00:01:46.140> exactly<00:01:46.500> sure<00:01:46.650> but

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
or to respect it's not exactly sure but

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.510 
or to respect it's not exactly sure but
can<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> server<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.900> same<00:01:49.080> time<00:01:49.520> so

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
can be in the server at the same time so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670 
can be in the server at the same time so
the<00:01:51.119> reason<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.540> actually<00:01:51.810> put<00:01:52.229> these<00:01:52.439> as

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the reason I actually put these as

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.350 
the reason I actually put these as
pictures<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> didn't<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.090> any

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
pictures is because I didn't have any

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
pictures is because I didn't have any
kind<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> recording<00:01:55.380> program<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> would

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
kind of recording program that would

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.389 
kind of recording program that would
record<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.649> desktop<00:01:58.649> screen<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.220> did

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
record my desktop screen actually I did

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
record my desktop screen actually I did
have<00:01:59.430> fraps<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.299> some<00:02:00.420> reason<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.810> didn't

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
have fraps but for some reason it didn't

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.840 
have fraps but for some reason it didn't

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.539 
and as I said the only rule is that you
have<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:27.019> level<00:02:28.019> ten<00:02:28.230> at<00:02:28.410> least<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.220> there

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549
