of<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.650> graph<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.100> facing<00:02:16.730> down<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.330> will<00:02:17.930> just

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
of the graph is facing down I will just

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.680 
of the graph is facing down I will just
position<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.130> where<00:02:19.550> we<00:02:19.850> would<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.660> be

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
position it where we would like it to be

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.410 
position it where we would like it to be
and<00:02:21.650> then<00:02:22.430> we'll<00:02:22.610> secure<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and then we'll secure it with the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.900 
and then we'll secure it with the
masking<00:02:23.810> tape<00:02:23.840> right<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.040> let's<00:02:25.220> trace<00:02:25.640> on

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
masking tape right so let's trace on

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.699 
masking tape right so let's trace on
this<00:02:26.060> side<00:02:26.300> now

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.530 

you<00:02:34.709> can<00:02:34.920> press<00:02:35.129> quite<00:02:35.459> firmly<00:02:35.819> don't<00:02:36.299> worry

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.149 
you can press quite firmly don't worry
if<00:02:36.719> the<00:02:36.870> tracing<00:02:37.260> paper<00:02:37.290> gets<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.950> little<00:02:38.219> torn

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
if the tracing paper gets a little torn

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.599 
if the tracing paper gets a little torn
there<00:02:41.159> we<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.609> all<00:02:42.030> done<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.590> let's<00:02:43.799> remove<00:02:44.280> the
