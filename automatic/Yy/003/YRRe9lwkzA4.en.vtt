00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.660
 do not 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.020
 alive 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.020
 i 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.139
 welcome to your science segment and 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.450
 technology today we are going to 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.759
 explain the function of a very fungus 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.099
 characteristic a fungus that makes function 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.410
 of fertilization a fungus that also 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.660
 has the function that the plants are 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.820
 more resistant to drought and a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.769
 fungus that has another characteristic that 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.870
 is to move nutrients from the soil 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.090
 towards the roots of the plants we are 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.449
 talking about mycorrhiza fungus 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.620
 Mycorrhizae is a fungus that is present 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.690
 from thousands of years ago so a symbiosis 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.830
 permanent between the plants and the fungus 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.920
 Mycorrhizal mushroom means fungus 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.739
 and root curls is a fusion a symbiosis 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.330
 between fungus and root this fungus has come 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.850
 developing with the plants from their 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.269
 existence the first plants that did not 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.519
 they had roots already had the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.400
 fungus criticized me there was there 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.810
 this fungus where he did root actions 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.909
 then it features 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.700
 characterized by being an extension of 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.680
 root the mycorrhiza fungus is a 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.610
 biotechnology that is not new is coming 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.700
 developing from 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.590
 many years ago since the year 1900 the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.130
 Mr. Albert Berhard started 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.280
 develop and discover this fungus and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.040
 began to use it and separate it and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.350
 began to characterize it later in the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.560
 year 1900 a specialist in orchids 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.050
 managed to characterize the fungus criticized me and 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.479
 discovered that orchids do not 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.700
 develop the seeds do not germinate if 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.280
 this fungus is not present in the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.619
 roots or on the ground this fungus has 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.160
 great functionalities within the 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.410
 crops today companies do not develop 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.840
 they multiply it and market it but 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.250
 today we want to teach this biotechnology 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.410
 so that the peasants of the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.770
 producers can develop it how 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.649
 produce or multiply mushrooms I criticize 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.410
 handcrafted I put in 1955 the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.209
 it was biotechnological and the barbarous lady 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.150
 moss begins a new era 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.420
 biotechnology in which it begins to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.520
 discover that these mushrooms can be 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.950
 multiplied in situ in one place 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.250
 and then be applied in a crop 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.350
 so you have a better production this 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.290
 this go gogh my critic are characterized 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.820
 for being mycorrhiza hector are a 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.010
 feature of the fungus that are 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.600
 wrapping the root the this is so 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.790
 present in most of the majority of 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.970
 the trees and they are in 2000 runs 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.340
 muscles that are those that are introduced 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.600
 in the roots and there are other 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.180
 characteristics are these endemic laughs 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.830
 that have the two functions these are these 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.200
 michelle spores and some muscles 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.880
 vesicles are introduced into the root and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.490
 they make the roots bigger 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.900
 bringing nutrients to the plant this 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.340
 I put my critic have the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.380
 characteristics of carrying the match 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 towards the roots the micro elements 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.000
 like zinc and copper that are 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.980
 present not to fail to reach 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.460
 the roots then this mushroom does the 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.590
 function of connecting the roots with those 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.080
 microelements are also produced other 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 and other nutritional elements such as 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.460
 idr or forums that are the ones that transfer the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.890
 iron towards the roots then it 's a 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.200
 function when they are I put my critics 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.720
 present in the roots aig lomallin a 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.120
 other substances 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.390
 that does great function and keeps great 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.040
 amount of water in the roots then 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.540
 these fungi are characterized by being one 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.250
 of the best biofertilizers 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.560
 existing is who fertilize the 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.800
 nature today technology can be 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.630
 remove fungi from the soil 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.580
 multiply them and then apply them to 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.860
 the floors to enrich how badly 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.510
 they work like mushrooms I ran ticos the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.960
 first step of multiplication of 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.830
 mycorrhizas what we are going to do is 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.500
 select a place where there 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.830
 presence of grass this can be a 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.340
 wild grass can be corn sorghum 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.400
 rice and we will select the plant 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.160
 that is larger than the most 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.100
 amazing have the majors wood shoulders 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.100
 aya the time you have a stop to mccoy a 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.959
 ment in this case of this plant 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.180
 let's extract us is a great 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.759
 mine called vetiver we extract it 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.500
 we extract it with the whole house that is 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:32.330
 with all the earth and where they are 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.220
 sheltered its roots after the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.129
 we extract we are going to make a second step 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.729
 and is to wrap it in a cloth 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:43.399
 this rag has to be a firm rag 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.089
 that is not too dense that you can have 

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:49.759
 that can have an oxygenation and we're going 

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:51.709
 to select between 8 to 10 pounds those 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.459
 10 pounds we are going to put in this rag 

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:58.699
 we are going to tie the cloth and this cloth 

00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:01.849
 let's hang up as a third step what 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.290
 let's hang in a ventilated place that 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.940
 there is not 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.860
 presence or that does not have direct light 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.900
 of the sun we are going to leave it hanging there 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:16.380
 between eight to 12 months without touching it 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.440
 rag with that with that rooted earth 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.770
 It has the inoculum mycorrhizae to no 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.660
 having water makes this fungus 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.360
 start multiplying the next step 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.490
 what are we going to do now at 6 months 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.590
 when this product is already ready as 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.870
 we can see these two shows that 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.510
 we have here these samples have a 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.930
 year of age these samples are going to 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.050
 go down 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.729
 let's chop it as we can see there 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.759
 presence of fungi there are others 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.970
 microorganisms but which to me more 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.590
 predominated problem is the mycorrhiza by 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.860
 the presence of root then we 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.110
 we prick the roots we grind the soil and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.530
 this is the product that we are going to 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.210
 apply to start a first 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.199
 multiplication of mycorrhiza way 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.440
 craft and we will place 50 pounds of 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.650
 this product in 10 square meters of 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.710
 ground 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.229
 here we have a 10- meter bed 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.720
 long by one meter wide we have 10 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.639
 square meters and here we go to 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.680
 do a craft multiplication of 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.090
 mycorrhizas that what we need to 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.580
 that mycorrhizae multiply 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.970
 Gramineae are the favorite plants 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.479
 so that they begin to develop 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:35.509
 then we started to apply between 60 to 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:38.270
 100 grams of this mycorrhiza product gives 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:41.330
 naturally artisanally captured 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.789
 for each planting point as we can 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.860
 see here we are planting corn and 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.200
 later we are adding 100 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.590
 grams 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.340
 of the soil product that goes to 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.610
 mycorrhizae at six months when in 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.470
 grass with one of a sacate one sacate 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.820
 for the production of animals to 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:05.110
 six months we can multiply and extract 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.720
 again as we did in the first 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.480
 step the multiplication of mycorrhizae and 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.280
 in this and in these 10 square meters 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.510
 by land where we have the crops 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:19.810
 between 60 to 100 grams per point of 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.660
 sowing we can also apply it to 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.360
 5 and after 15 days after 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.700
 maize predominated a second dose 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.340
 with 60 grams of mycorrhized product 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.820
 this mycorrhizal product when it 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.620
 multiply in getting you out for production 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.510
 of animals multiplication can 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.040
 last six months here with the corn 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:44.860
 we have 60 days from 60 to 70 days 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.110
 this multiplication and we leave the ground and 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.600
 we go back to do a second planting 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.060
 to try to follow the multiplication 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.190
 of mycorrhizas is all for today 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.750
 I was waiting for you in your agro tv program and 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.750
 science and technology segment
