00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
okay now our battery is off so let's

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.390 
okay now our battery is off so let's
start<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.860> APU<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.619> I'll<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.799> put<00:01:17.220> up

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
start out APU so I'll actually put up

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.020 
start out APU so I'll actually put up
the<00:01:18.210> whole<00:01:18.570> battery<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:20.000> everything<00:01:21.000> just

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the whole battery on so everything just

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.740 
the whole battery on so everything just
turns<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:23.630> now<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.690> are<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:26.369> turn<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.570> an

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
turns out now we are going to turn on an

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.120 
turns out now we are going to turn on an
APU<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:30.140> trying<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> close<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.649> but<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
APU and trying to close it but it

APU and trying to close it but it
doesn't<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:32.580> work<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.530> we'll<00:01:35.390> start<00:01:36.390> up

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
doesn't really work so we'll start up

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.930 
doesn't really work so we'll start up
the<00:01:36.690> AP<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.740> pull<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.070> once<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.670> pull

can't find the Y you pull your speed
back<00:02:56.780> down<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:58.250> can<00:02:58.400> push<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.640> back<00:02:58.849> up<00:03:02.080> okay

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
back down you can push it back up okay

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.490 
back down you can push it back up okay
but<00:03:03.470> why<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:04.130> one<00:03:04.810> push<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.930> back<00:03:06.080> up<00:03:06.260> on

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
but why is this one push it back up on
