00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.900
 the new destinations big wave surfer 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.030
 is located in portugal 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 whoever is here is fighting against 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.740
 untamable forces of nature in the middle of the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.750
 giant wave of mazar-e-sharif too 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.410
 sebastian steudtner a young german 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.210
 with a faible for water masses 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.850
 I really have to feel at the moment 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.380
 okay the wave comes i have to go now 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.550
 maybe just to avoid it 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 I now ride in the Rhine wave too 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.520
 if i then sebastian this crashes 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.450
 waves like a navigation device 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.410
 following directions for the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.829
 accompanying eric let us left 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.000
 stay 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.000
 the second wave on the left 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.380
 now he has to rule only with the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 rope in the wave alone would have 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.830
 The server does not stand a chance with the tempo 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.510
 to absorb the water masses 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.550
 with an average of 70 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.180
 kilometer-long, nature is easy 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180
 too fast 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 wayport call it the surfer if you 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.550
 Torn from a ball into the deep 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.690
 become 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.340
 I would not compare it 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.870
 that is to say that we are in one 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.430
 avalanche to be buried because I move 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.410
 me so I'm under 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.870
 we are holding 500,000 tons of water 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.490
 but I moved all the time and 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.350
 it only has the question when will turn up again 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 on 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.560
 Meanwhile, eric becomes parallel to the turnaround 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.560
 and picks up his partner again 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.820
 about 15 to 20 seconds left for 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:46.100
 the flight the next crusher is already 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.510
 behind the surfers still sebastian 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.070
 must have something on his last ride 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.070
 crucial lost 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.580
 It is dangerous for the two directly 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.149
 behind the place where the waves are 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.590
 break the so-called white water the 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.990
 there trapped air prepares for that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.000
 drive big difficulties because of 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.830
 Jetski needs pure water around his 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.890
 Strengthen whole horses to play 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.890
 can 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.720
 sebastian decides to jump 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.800
 he really wants his board to have that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.800
 suspected on the beach
