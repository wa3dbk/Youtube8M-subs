00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
how I prefer it I think that just looks

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
how I prefer it I think that just looks
better<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.030> face<00:00:57.210> structure<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
better with like my face structure and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
better with like my face structure and
stuff<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
stuff like that which is what I really

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.569 
stuff like that which is what I really
love<00:00:59.910> about<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.660> Julia<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.770> has<00:01:02.010> these

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
love about the Julia it has these

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.189 
love about the Julia it has these
shorter<00:01:03.000> layers<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.809> has<00:01:03.960> shorter

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
shorter layers this one has shorter

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.630 
shorter layers this one has shorter
layers<00:01:04.350> too<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.769> they're<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.010> unsure<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
layers too but they're not unsure and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120 
layers too but they're not unsure and
not<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.090> many<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.140> even<00:01:07.590> though<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
not as many so even though I like the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.760 
not as many so even though I like the
length<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.760> era<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.710> julia<00:01:11.130> has<00:01:11.640> i<00:01:12.119> think

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
length on this era the julia has i think

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
length on this era the julia has i think
for<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.310> her<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.790> face<00:01:15.030> tips<00:01:15.299> might<00:01:15.540> have

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
for me and her some face tips might have

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.340 
for me and her some face tips might have
better<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.439> flattering<00:01:16.920> layers<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
frame and stuff and i find it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.429 
frame and stuff and i find it
the<00:01:23.520> julia<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.540> easier<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.020> take<00:01:25.080> care

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the julia a little easier to take care

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
the julia a little easier to take care
of<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.250> big<00:01:26.460> deal<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.689> because

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
of like not a big deal but this because

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.100
