00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
well this new HIV is front-wheel drive

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.160 
well this new HIV is front-wheel drive
only<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.730> previous<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.480> was<00:02:39.630> all<00:02:39.930> wheel

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
only and the previous one was all wheel

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.070 
only and the previous one was all wheel
drive<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.750> substantially<00:02:42.750> better

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
drive this is a substantially better

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.040 
drive this is a substantially better
handling<00:02:43.710> car<00:02:44.040> which<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:45.000> course<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.840> would

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
handling car which of course it would

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.930 
handling car which of course it would
want<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.410> be<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.750> original<00:02:48.990> HIV<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.340> terms<00:02:50.730> of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
want to be the original HIV in terms of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.960 
want to be the original HIV in terms of
the<00:02:51.060> dynamics<00:02:51.630> mistakes<00:02:52.440> well<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.550> was<00:02:53.760> pretty

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the dynamics mistakes well it was pretty

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.590 
the dynamics mistakes well it was pretty

guess<00:03:28.280> if<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:28.970> like<00:03:29.150> things<00:03:29.480> have<00:03:29.600> been<00:03:29.690> funky

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
guess if you like things have been funky

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.940 
guess if you like things have been funky
it's<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.440> sort<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.370> cool

it's<00:04:04.360> not<00:04:04.510> quite<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:05.080> revolutionary<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.400> it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
it's not quite so revolutionary and it

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.490 
it's not quite so revolutionary and it
has<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.700> lot<00:04:07.030> more<00:04:07.060> competitors<00:04:07.780> like<00:04:08.350> the
