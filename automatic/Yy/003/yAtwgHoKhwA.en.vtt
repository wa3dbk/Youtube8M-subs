00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 iatos today the find you you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.970
 present my ten favorite polish for 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.020
 socrates years so of the year 2013 which 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.269
 would be that it's a little bit fashionable 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.490
 woman even a lot devani fashion 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.809
 pastel some pretty sweet colors and so 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 that's it but it's true that I do not have 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.020
 I do not really have too much varnish 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.640
 that kind and it's not too much 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.529
 my thing but I can show you the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 colors that I appreciate so we're going 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.160
 start towards a nail polish is in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.710
 this is the one I leave on the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.869
 nails so this is the number 01 fuchsia 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.789
 ramin was serving last polish in front that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 that I bought myself and I am 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.000
 totally fan I really like 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.460
 color of which five sailboats actually there are 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.170
 a little difference between the in the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.730
 in the pot made of varnish and on the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
 on the nail but I really like 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 it's a color not a little pest but 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 which at the same time is not too much 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.600
 flash is true that I like a lot 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
 much worn inside it is very soft 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.809
 and I find that it is acquired rather 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.850
 well with the season this is it's a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.039
 rather rather sweet fuchsia the 24 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 are not there 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.910
 then I have a nail polish here 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.829
 present I wanted to already presented but 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.199
 I still love them so much it's the one 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.390
 it together and it's a pretty pale pink 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.820
 which is not too much too much 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 fade really more than he has a little bit 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.470
 not really very pretty and you have some 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.119
 light purple iridescent blue in it but who 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.530
 do not go too much on the nail 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 but I really love it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 a very soft color whether for 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.240
 winter or spring I like 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.270
 really wear a lot and still a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.400
 time it goes with the season then other 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 varnish that I really like it's a va 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.960
 bare feet that caused the number 2 184 and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.520
 it's really a lot more fuchsia 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.329
 peps that first I showed you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.970
 previously 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.110
 and if he is really very pretty 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 what again is a nail polish 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.400
 cream so there is no realizing but 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 but he is really very very pretty 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 we are the son evan kiko I am 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 never disappointed holding the price all and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 everything and opts so here we are ah well he 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.600
 was hot for this season then a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 Another varnish is a varnish peace 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 this time it's the lovely 130 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.970
 mommens is actually I really hope 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.100
 you will see by white because it does 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.050
 no ex tipp effect on children I like 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.180
 really not in the varnish 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.040
 the and this one actually makes it really 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.660
 the pale pink is clear it's once 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.010
 again my friends very sweet for 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.520
 for spring I find it's 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.470
 very pretty 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.820
 a cream varnish so that's it if you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.500
 want something nude enough is 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.180
 enough goes everywhere on the airwaves 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.440
 that he is good however he is pretty 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.210
 hard to apply as it's a rally 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.580
 very clear so that it is quite opaque 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.780
 who you have a result a little 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.550
 uniform is pretty complicated but good 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.690
 it's his only flaw but he's 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.030
 really very pretty so at number 130 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.810
 then still a varnish in Catrice 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.370
 it's the wine meet me at corey island and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.510
 it's true for me so if you 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.120
 want a real coral for me it's 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.190
 really a coral it is not too much 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.010
 flash but at the same time I find very 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.180
 pretty i have not yet wear 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.260
 for this season because I speak 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.760
 bought it is not very long but 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.530
 here I know it's a color that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.640
 I love all the more about the spring 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.440
 and I think for the summer it will be 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.840
 also very pretty but here it is 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.370
 once again a cream polish so no 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.630
 glitter anything but 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.010
 that's it if we wanted a little touch of 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.160
 color on the nails I find that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.090
 it's very nice so the number 20 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.440
 then I have friends from where 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.580
 run again but this one I 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.050
 believe I would put it in everything 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.700
 finally for all seasons and I 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.670
 find that it goes everywhere it's the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.680
 number 371 it's really a pretty mole 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.450
 with golden reflections that he sees himself who 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.630
 do not see much on the nail 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.000
 but really it is very nice here 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.530
 the same I wanted something 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.060
 fairly discreet neutral on nails 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.570
 it is perfect in one layer it is 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.850
 opaque 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.590
 he holds extremely well and now that 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.030
 I find that for spring it's 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.970
 not necessarily that flash colors or 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.550
 the colors here is the rate goes also everything 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.600
 as well after shackle from home 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.090
 essence is the 0 1 bis flower fuld and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.590
 this one is really a fishing yeah 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.720
 for me it really prevents it in 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.280
 done is really very pretty very sweet 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.930
 on the other hand on forgetting makes a small 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.010
 a little more flash than in the pole of 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.320
 polish actually but it's still 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.600
 very very pretty so that's it 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.520
 no reflection may 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.560
 beautiful I think it's really 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.820
 here is the cream floral collection 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.200
 did that gasoline did for the 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.580
 spring is really I think it 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.290
 is reminiscent of the color of flowers end 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.530
 it's something very pretty for the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.940
 season this is then another low news 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.680
 he's simply called a muse 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.250
 glam actually from gasoline there is 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.380
 no number 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.390
 and it's really a nude that pulls more 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.560
 to Belgian compared to roses 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.750
 pale that I showed you all the air 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.810
 from at p 2 yesterday's one this one pulls 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.820
 much more towards the pech and it goes back 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.840
 very pretty here as I too 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.640
 want to take my head 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.170
 on the other hand it takes two or three 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.490
 layers so that again it is 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.440
 really opaque and you have a 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.820
 clean result what but but it is 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.180
 really very pretty i like them a lot 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.850
 then to your polish from p2c lesson 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.100
 0.31 by whose love letter and who is a 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.140
 powdery pink for me this is it 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.730
 really a very pretty pink powder a little 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.280
 old rose like that I find I 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.480
 find very nice book is beautiful and 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.850
 that's it for spring it's still a 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.160
 both very soft and discreet and password 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.390
 everywhere but a varnish here I think 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.710
 that you can find dukes 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.970
 because p2 it's a marchioness have 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.080
 only in germany so it's a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.520
 little bit complicated if you are not 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.690
 but I think you 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.420
 can find dukes from another 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.320
 mark quite easily but but that's it 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.390
 it's really a last I like 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.160
 a lot so the 31 and finally last 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.240
 polish when I want a little touch 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.270
 madness on my nails 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.650
 I learned that this one so it's for 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.440
 to make nail art makes it special 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.250
 effecto afraid of in essence etc the salt 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.450
 the cede pardon cool breeze is actually 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.150
 it's full of glitter with 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.460
 orange and purple and blue pink highlights and 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.470
 here I find it very pretty a meter 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.030
 on a nail on one of the nails more 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.440
 I'm really hungry 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.090
 pretty of course not on every year I 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.770
 think it's a little too much but 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.360
 from time to time and then that counts 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.650
 really see with this Tuesday there by 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360
 example with all colors 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.980
 I think it's a combo that works 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.650
 pretty good so so here's a pretty 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.390
 effect it has not been on the nails 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.930
 bah listen to my video is over and 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.940
 I hope it can give you 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.110
 idea if you're ever in need of 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.520
 varnish or inspiration 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.199
