00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hi hello to all friends with you and a spike 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.029
 today we'll play akinator in 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.189
 minecraft akinator minecraft for a long time 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.349
 appeared your own akinator here 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.179
 he you will not believe but this is him though why 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.790
 do not believe well, and actually today we 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.350
 try to play with him a little yes he 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 only guesses from minecraft to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.080
 Unfortunately you have a coat hanger or other he did not 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.250
 guess it's bad but do not care Well, what 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 let's start to get started you need 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.150
 turn around press the button and we start 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 so this mob is peaceful ie it could 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.790
 some kind of hostile or not this 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 mob.ua By the way they would guess who 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.700
 guessing let's guess the cow 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 why there is no cow this is cool cow 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.829
 quite peacefully and to a height of 2 blocks 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.770
 or more or like villagers 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.719
 or a horse but not like a cow you probably 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.860
 understand the question but I did not understand you either 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.910
 to answer this question for me 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.910
 will have to change the cow 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.870
 no, she is definitely not in two blocks so 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.850
 that click no drops the weight of your mob 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.100
 and oh well, sort of like you can 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.760
 dye your mob dye round 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.860
 Well, as if there is no probably all the same to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.100
 Sorry but no, this could be the size of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.920
 chicken but he sure can be the size 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.110
 from chicken to no no no it's not chicken 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.290
 this mob crown oh my god it seems to you 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.600
 close to what i clicked 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.430
 wrong yes he guessed dude you can't 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.960
 use magic outside the room he guessed 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.910
 first both let abraham no one 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 another oh well I think I know how 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.220
 find out if winning quietly damn 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.920
 now we will try it play this could 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.380
 not peaceful but hirobrin here is one peaceful he 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.290
 uses weapons for the same I don't know but 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.720
 probably not 2 blocks or zombies 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.960
 Well, take as two blocks so yes I 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.840
 I think that hirobrin two blocks 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.640
 he spawns in mr or wendy i don't 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 I know without memory hirobrin but probably not 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.660
 he can jump like celine 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.910
 well remember only sl you can 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.750
 jump as a slime so I think not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.130
 this could explode I don't know for sure 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.360
 hirobrin doesn't explode and zombies what 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.590
 hirobrina seems still not maynkrafte 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.300
 there is well let's try 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.770
 anyone else so let's 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.540
 try to order something simpler 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.220
 for example ender dragon 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.110
 yes why not ender dragon 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.150
 damn angry dude so I think that 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.880
 pir question we answer so he doesn't 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.550
 uses weapons to attack he is not tall 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.470
 zombies he will not spawn carries underground 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.989
 he doesn't live in water is it possible 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.970
 tame allen tame dragon well 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.349
 it seems like on the one hand you can but in 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.700
 minecraft is kind of impossible 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.019
 so I don’t know if it’s right 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.450
 but it seems to me he guessed endermen and 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.069
 quantile inter something there still okay 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.630
 we will assume that you were close 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.489
 okay let's try to guess the horse 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.380
 the latter in each is kind of nice 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.450
 copes and so this time let's 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.489
 guessing my favorite one just 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.049
 beloved mob if i play the creeper then 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.730
 I think that is typed 2 seconds therefore 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.690
 let's make the horse more difficult 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.390
 why oh why not this mob like 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.849
 how peaceful this mob 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.519
 what he is tall well he does not like 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.120
 like a zombie and here he is a little bigger 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.299
 or 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.280
 I do not know shorter but probably they do not have 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.070
 two block stand it does not fall 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.650
 edible drop he lives in food and 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.329
 it's too fast okay 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.890
 Again, it was easy for him Well 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.510
 that's all about me and that akinator to you 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.430
 I liked by my it was enough 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.620
 cool and pretty good all 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.120
 guessed and if hadis to play with him 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.410
