00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
title of this video we are layering a

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.190 
title of this video we are layering a
poly<00:01:06.580> metric<00:01:07.000> melody<00:01:07.570> over<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:08.770> 4/4<00:01:09.580> groove<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
poly metric melody over a 4/4 groove so

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.140 
poly metric melody over a 4/4 groove so
what<00:01:11.710> does<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:11.830> mean<00:01:12.100> basically<00:01:12.729> we're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
what does that mean basically we're

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.090 
what does that mean basically we're
layering<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.869> rhythm<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.530> I've<00:01:14.650> chosen<00:01:14.920> for

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
layering the rhythm that I've chosen for

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.380 
layering the rhythm that I've chosen for
this<00:01:15.280> is<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.610> 5/8<00:01:16.410> melody<00:01:17.410> or<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.310> 5/8<00:01:18.729> rhythm<00:01:19.149> and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
this is a 5/8 melody or a 5/8 rhythm and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.810 
this is a 5/8 melody or a 5/8 rhythm and
I've<00:01:20.380> broken<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.920> down<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.520> two

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
I've broken that down and the two

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.880 
I've broken that down and the two
distinct<00:01:22.270> rhythms<00:01:22.539> or<00:01:22.660> an<00:01:22.780> A<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.380> B<00:01:23.410> phrase

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
distinct rhythms or an A and a B phrase

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.760 
distinct rhythms or an A and a B phrase
just<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.490> combine<00:01:24.759> them<00:01:25.300> so<00:01:25.509> we<00:01:26.050> have<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.680> know

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
just to combine them so we have you know

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.400 
just to combine them so we have you know
find<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.399> rhythm<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.880> one<00:01:28.300> rhythm<00:01:28.450> 5/8<00:01:29.140> rhythm

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
find a rhythm and one rhythm 5/8 rhythm

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.080 
find a rhythm and one rhythm 5/8 rhythm
and<00:01:29.530> another<00:01:29.740> rhythm<00:01:29.920> together<00:01:30.610> that<00:01:30.789> makes<00:01:31.000> a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
and another rhythm together that makes a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.760 
and another rhythm together that makes a
whole<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:31.570> can<00:01:31.600> think<00:01:31.899> about<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.320> 1080<00:01:32.710> or

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
whole you can think about it the 1080 or

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.730 
whole you can think about it the 1080 or
5'4<00:01:33.369> but<00:01:33.690> bottom<00:01:34.690> line<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.869> that<00:01:35.289> this<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.560> a

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
5'4 but bottom line is that this is a

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.260 
5'4 but bottom line is that this is a
poly<00:01:36.009> metric<00:01:36.399> idea<00:01:36.640> because<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:36.880> doesn't

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
poly metric idea because that doesn't

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.990 
poly metric idea because that doesn't
line<00:01:37.450> up<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.899> 4/4<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.890> takes<00:01:39.160> five<00:01:39.490> measures

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
line up and 4/4 it takes five measures

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.580 
line up and 4/4 it takes five measures
of<00:01:40.180> four<00:01:40.509> before<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.590> lines<00:01:41.860> on<00:01:42.190> one<00:01:42.610> again<00:01:42.940> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
of four before it lines on one again and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.960 
of four before it lines on one again and
this<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.649> different<00:01:44.979> from<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.280> polyrhythmic

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
this is different from a polyrhythmic

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.700 
this is different from a polyrhythmic
idea<00:01:46.420> because<00:01:46.720> if<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:47.050> was<00:01:47.170> like<00:01:47.259> polyrhythm

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
idea because if this was like polyrhythm

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.640 
idea because if this was like polyrhythm
we'd<00:01:47.979> be<00:01:48.070> landing<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.490> one<00:01:48.729> every<00:01:49.630> measure<00:01:49.869> so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
we'd be landing on one every measure so

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.940 
we'd be landing on one every measure so
the<00:01:51.250> rhythm<00:01:51.460> i've<00:01:51.729> chosen<00:01:52.000> 4<00:01:52.270> 5<00:01:52.479> 8<00:01:52.659> i<00:01:52.950> spacing

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
the rhythm i've chosen 4 5 8 i spacing

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.510 
the rhythm i've chosen 4 5 8 i spacing
here's<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.400> phrase<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.119> have<00:01:55.270> this<00:01:56.520> that's

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
here's the a phrase you have this that's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.920 
here's the a phrase you have this that's
our<00:01:57.670> 5/8<00:01:58.060> feel<00:01:59.729> alright<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:00.850> then<00:02:01.329> our<00:02:01.509> second

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
our 5/8 feel alright and then our second

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.600 
our 5/8 feel alright and then our second
or<00:02:02.079> our<00:02:02.350> B<00:02:02.590> phrase<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.189> 5/8<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:06.430> know<00:02:06.520> you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
or our B phrase of 5/8 is you know you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.980 
or our B phrase of 5/8 is you know you
can<00:02:06.759> think<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.119> as<00:02:07.270> one<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.689> two<00:02:07.810> and

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
can think of that as one and two and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.749 
can think of that as one and two and
three<00:02:08.049> four<00:02:08.229> five<00:02:08.860> okay

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
three four five okay

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.600 
three four five okay
now<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.899> one<00:02:11.350> thing<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.739> I<00:02:11.799> want<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.100> point

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
now the one thing I that I want to point

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.460 
now the one thing I that I want to point
out<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.329> that<00:02:13.360> when<00:02:13.989> you're<00:02:14.140> chained

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
out here is that when you're chained

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.170 
out here is that when you're chained
when<00:02:14.799> you're<00:02:14.920> counting<00:02:15.310> or<00:02:15.459> changing<00:02:15.820> meters

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
when you're counting or changing meters

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.210 
when you're counting or changing meters
like<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:17.230> important<00:02:17.829> that<00:02:17.860> you're

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
like this it's important that you're

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.220 
like this it's important that you're
eighth<00:02:18.400> note<00:02:18.640> speed<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.269> County<00:02:19.600> stays<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
eighth note speed and County stays the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.050 
eighth note speed and County stays the
same<00:02:20.489> regardless<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.670> how<00:02:21.880> you're

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
same regardless of how you're

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.819 
same regardless of how you're
verbalizing<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:23.230> count<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.650> if<00:02:23.680> you're

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
verbalizing this count so if you're

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.819 
verbalizing this count so if you're
going<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.579> two<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.360> three<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.049> four<00:02:26.110> and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
going one and two and three and four and

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.190 
going one and two and three and four and
that's<00:02:27.760> our<00:02:27.940> eighth<00:02:28.090> know<00:02:28.239> speed<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.750> if

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
that's our eighth know speed the if

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
that's our eighth know speed the if
we're<00:02:29.350> counting<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.829> five<00:02:30.040> eight<00:02:30.310> or<00:02:30.579> tempo

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
we're counting in five eight or tempo

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.580 
we're counting in five eight or tempo
say<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.329> same<00:02:31.630> just<00:02:31.870> how<00:02:31.959> we<00:02:32.019> verbalize<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
say the same just how we verbalize it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.890 
say the same just how we verbalize it
it's<00:02:32.860> different<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.150> changes<00:02:34.420> from<00:02:34.480> one

tripe<00:04:28.020> tongue<00:04:28.200> sound<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.950> our<00:04:29.220> rhythm<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.669> can

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
tripe tongue sound so our rhythm you can

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.659 
tripe tongue sound so our rhythm you can
hear<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.300> bump<00:04:30.570> bump<00:04:30.900> bump<00:04:31.350> bump<00:04:31.710> bump<00:04:32.520> up

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
hear so it's bump bump bump bump bump up

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.490 
hear so it's bump bump bump bump bump up
up<00:04:32.850> up<00:04:33.000> up<00:04:33.180> buff<00:04:33.510> buff<00:04:33.840> right<00:04:34.110> that's<00:04:34.350> our

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
up up up buff buff right that's our

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.909 
up up up buff buff right that's our
rhythm

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.040 

and<00:04:41.340> right<00:04:41.759> there<00:04:41.939> we<00:04:42.120> changed<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.659> a<00:04:42.840> minor

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
and right there we changed the a minor

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.070 
and right there we changed the a minor
so<00:04:43.289> we<00:04:43.409> have<00:04:43.560> this<00:04:43.740> C<00:04:44.460> Lydians<00:04:44.879> type<00:04:45.389> melody

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.890 

then<00:04:49.080> over<00:04:49.259> the<00:04:49.349> e-<00:04:49.740> cord<00:04:50.129> we<00:04:50.219> go<00:04:53.629> but<00:04:54.629> I've<00:04:54.749> got

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
then over the e- cord we go but I've got

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.600 
then over the e- cord we go but I've got
an<00:04:54.960> outlining<00:04:55.289> a<00:04:55.529> minor<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.249> then<00:04:56.430> when<00:04:56.520> we

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
an outlining a minor and then when we

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.309 
an outlining a minor and then when we
switch<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.909> the<00:04:57.060> b7<00:04:57.629> the<00:04:57.779> only<00:04:57.960> thing<00:04:58.139> that's

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
switch to the b7 the only thing that's

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.080 
switch to the b7 the only thing that's
changing<00:04:58.650> harmonically<00:04:59.249> is<00:04:59.370> I'm<00:04:59.550> changing

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
changing harmonically is I'm changing

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.269 
changing harmonically is I'm changing
I'm<00:05:00.210> adding<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.990> D<00:05:01.169> sharp<00:05:01.560> in<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:01.979> I'm<00:05:02.099> a

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:02.279 
I'm adding the D sharp in so I'm a

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.540 
I'm adding the D sharp in so I'm a
harmonic<00:05:03.120> minor<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.930> HoloNet<00:05:04.439> b7<00:05:05.039> sound<00:05:05.310> you

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
harmonic minor to HoloNet b7 sound you

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.790 
harmonic minor to HoloNet b7 sound you
could<00:05:05.699> think<00:05:05.819> about<00:05:05.939> it<00:05:06.240> as<00:05:06.449> you<00:05:06.990> know<00:05:07.080> B

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
could think about it as you know B

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.650 
could think about it as you know B
Phrygian<00:05:08.310> dominant

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.070 

but<00:05:13.410> it's<00:05:13.680> just<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:14.070> harmonic<00:05:14.580> minor<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.150> you

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
but it's just a harmonic minor and you

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.549 
but it's just a harmonic minor and you
can<00:05:16.200> hear<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.500> here

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:20.559 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:22.589 

right<00:05:21.309> so<00:05:21.459> we<00:05:21.519> have<00:05:21.669> again<00:05:21.909> and<00:05:22.149> outlines<00:05:22.449> that

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
right so we have again and outlines that

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:29.340 
right so we have again and outlines that
chord<00:05:22.869> C<00:05:23.079> major<00:05:23.109> seven<00:05:23.649> E<00:05:25.379> minor

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.430 

and<00:05:29.770> then<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.280> b7

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.720 

and<00:05:37.440> that's<00:05:37.590> how<00:05:37.740> our<00:05:37.770> melody<00:05:38.220> outlines<00:05:38.580> the

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
and that's how our melody outlines the

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.000 
and that's how our melody outlines the
harmony<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.960> like<00:05:40.260> doing<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:40.710> kind<00:05:40.770> of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
harmony and I like doing this kind of

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.670 
harmony and I like doing this kind of
stuff<00:05:41.300> with<00:05:42.300> a<00:05:42.330> predetermined<00:05:42.900> rhythmic

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
stuff with a predetermined rhythmic

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.040 
stuff with a predetermined rhythmic
structure<00:05:44.090> instead<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.240> trying<00:05:45.510> to<00:05:45.570> how<00:05:45.810> how

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
structure instead of trying to how how

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.200 
structure instead of trying to how how
do<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.200> play<00:05:46.410> in<00:05:46.440> five<00:05:46.740> eight<00:05:46.920> to<00:05:47.640> all<00:05:47.820> this<00:05:48.000> time

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
do I play in five eight to all this time

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.450 
do I play in five eight to all this time
going<00:05:48.570> on<00:05:48.690> if<00:05:48.870> you<00:05:48.960> give<00:05:49.140> yourself<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.590> defined

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
going on if you give yourself a defined

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.690 
going on if you give yourself a defined
structure<00:05:50.850> to<00:05:51.150> find<00:05:51.360> rhythm<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.530> outline<00:05:53.370> and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
structure to find rhythm to outline and

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.550 
structure to find rhythm to outline and
repeat<00:05:54.120> all<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.480> way<00:05:54.570> through<00:05:54.840> it's<00:05:55.290> almost

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
repeat all the way through it's almost

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.500 
repeat all the way through it's almost
like<00:05:55.770> you're<00:05:55.950> taking<00:05:56.130> a<00:05:56.490> single<00:05:56.910> part<00:05:57.270> or<00:05:57.480> a

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
like you're taking a single part or a

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.420 
like you're taking a single part or a
keyboard<00:05:57.930> part<00:05:58.140> that's<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.650> repetitive<00:05:59.310> nature

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
keyboard part that's a repetitive nature

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.820 
keyboard part that's a repetitive nature
and<00:05:59.850> giving<00:06:00.150> melody<00:06:00.720> which<00:06:01.170> is<00:06:01.320> really<00:06:01.560> fun<00:06:01.740> to

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
and giving melody which is really fun to

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.890 
and giving melody which is really fun to
do<00:06:01.980> and<00:06:02.220> you<00:06:02.730> know<00:06:02.820> great<00:06:03.060> compositional<00:06:03.720> tool

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
do and you know great compositional tool

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.310 
do and you know great compositional tool
so<00:06:04.470> again<00:06:04.880> that<00:06:05.880> rhythm<00:06:06.390> just<00:06:06.600> constantly

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
so again that rhythm just constantly

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.260 
so again that rhythm just constantly
repeats<00:06:13.640> right<00:06:14.640> just<00:06:14.940> as<00:06:15.030> if<00:06:15.090> you<00:06:15.210> were

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
repeats right just as if you were

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.550 
repeats right just as if you were
banging<00:06:15.630> away<00:06:15.690> in<00:06:15.900> a<00:06:15.960> cymbal<00:06:16.290> or<00:06:16.350> anything

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
banging away in a cymbal or anything

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.060 
banging away in a cymbal or anything
like<00:06:16.800> that

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
like that

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.280 
like that

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
okay so we'll listen do it again on the
