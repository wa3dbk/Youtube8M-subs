00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello welcome to the way I am 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.259
 Kim and I explain each one here today 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.929
 festival survived festivals are the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.090
 Biggest you can spend three days out of his 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.190
 Everyday break out and need to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.830
 otherwise worry as music and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.380
 sun but everyone on one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.539
 festival knows that can be one 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.300
 get pretty dirty affair 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.640
 therefore festival tips from profi for you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.410
 now even if the best and greatest 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 weather is announced prepare 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.460
 on it before you through the mud and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 perform zombie-like shape 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.300
 that's why the most important thing on everyone 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 festival rubber boots and in general 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 ever comfortable shoes no high 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 heels and especially not what 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 to which you can hang too much 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.149
 It is very good that you have this school 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 then throw away or out 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.739
 nostalgic reasons against the wall and yes 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.829
 the next point sounds very much 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.539
 But it's important to sunscreen her 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.070
 You can do it all the time of your life 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.079
 but at the festival have such a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.359
 Pale skin just looks like shit 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.189
 off to the optical points too 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.740
 come when the danger exists that it 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.750
 raining then do not wear any jeans 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 that sticks disgusting to yours 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.890
 body and the most important thing it dries 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.299
 just do not matter as ye one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 that makes her in the sun again 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.950
 normal she will not do it anyway 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.080
 smells like the local dixi-klos 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.890
 after three days of festival when she is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.890
 on the festival grounds 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 when on the festival grounds 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.140
 hill is then not camping directly 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 on the slope because you do not have to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 be physically genius to it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.810
 to remember that if it rains 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.490
 whole tailor runs down the slope 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 and everything on your lovingly 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.320
 built tent apropos moisture 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 This info goes above all to the ladies 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.399
 because as you all know they are 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 Toilets established rather questionable 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.390
 especially toilet paper that's 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 a rarity that's why we recommend 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.180
 grab your own reserve paper 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.399
 on 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.070
 and another tip the cardboard of the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.780
 latest step of emancipation women 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 can now pee in the stand 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.459
 that's fun I know you will 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.190
 do not like to hear but worried 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.590
 from this total 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.230
 between chest pockets to deal with things 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.390
 because your phone is in your pants pocket 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.700
 Maybe not the best idea 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.500
 especially at festivals you are close 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.090
 together and to the compelling 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.970
 body contact one gets used to 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.280
 sometime and tactics is the second 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.710
 even take yourselves if you 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.600
 sowas have a mobile battery for mobile with 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.670
 so you can get embarrassing photos of yours 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.470
 make green friends and runs 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.970
 also not in danger sometime no 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.440
 battery to have more and your friends 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.200
 unable to reach anymore 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.850
 It is very important to drink and no 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 alcoholic drinks I mean 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.810
 not with the whole hopped and the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.850
 running around burns yours 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.650
 body very much energy and thereby 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.080
 also water around at the physical 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.940
 needs to stay as dates hear 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.800
 Although it is funny but so 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.690
 such a large onslaught of people 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.520
 you come in constant contact with 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.620
 Bacteria whether voluntarily or 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.090
 involuntarily and your body 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.980
 a little vitamin c with it yours 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.020
 immune system is not completely shocked 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.020
 is now and a little note 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.940
 and now a little bit stranger 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.050
 trip take a dead with what is 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.090
 the good question 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.550
 a dead one is a mystical symbol or 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.709
 in badges in small groups speak 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.660
 take with you some big object 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.430
 that's not too much like for example 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.170
 the umbrella is still under construction 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.030
 practically one of you in the curve 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.890
 can then this beautiful the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.870
 so keep everyone in the group 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.520
 find yourself or you take yourself 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.680
 simply the largest of the group and 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.680
 sets him a showy and funny 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.810
 oops
