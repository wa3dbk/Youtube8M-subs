difficulty<00:00:52.769> would<00:00:53.250> definitely<00:00:53.730> affect<00:00:53.820> AI

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
difficulty would definitely affect AI

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.299 
difficulty would definitely affect AI
the<00:00:54.510> most<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.859> through<00:00:56.219> them

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the most so as I'm going through them

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.540 
the most so as I'm going through them
expecting<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.660> AI<00:00:57.980> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.129> something

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
expecting the AI to do something

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
expecting the AI to do something
familiar<00:01:00.179> like<00:01:00.390> pop<00:01:00.690> their<00:01:00.870> head<00:01:01.019> up<00:01:01.140> twice

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
familiar like pop their head up twice

familiar like pop their head up twice
and<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.429> lot<00:01:02.519> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.179> old<00:01:03.329> days

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and we see that a lot in the old days

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
and we see that a lot in the old days
you<00:01:03.960> know<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.230> those<00:01:04.559> days<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.890> gone<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.489> AI

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you know that those days are gone the AI

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
you know that those days are gone the AI
will<00:01:06.090> pop<00:01:06.300> its<00:01:06.480> head<00:01:06.660> up<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.230> take

it shows off our ghillie suit stuff that
we<00:01:47.240> did<00:01:47.390> last<00:01:47.510> game<00:01:47.810> we've<00:01:48.020> stepped<00:01:48.350> into<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
we did last game we've stepped into the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
them in the bushes the real level the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
them in the bushes the real level the
the<00:02:00.380> favela<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.980> ghetto<00:02:01.220> kind<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.760> really

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
the favela the ghetto kind of really

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.880 
the favela the ghetto kind of really
tight<00:02:02.210> gameplay<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.900> spec<00:02:03.140> offs<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.590> believe

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
tight gameplay and spec offs I believe

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.680 
tight gameplay and spec offs I believe
people<00:02:04.070> get<00:02:04.610> like<00:02:04.730> a<00:02:04.790> kick<00:02:05.030> out<00:02:05.150> of<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.360> because

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
people get like a kick out of it because

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.990 
people get like a kick out of it because
it<00:02:05.990> introduces<00:02:06.620> civilians<00:02:07.460> into<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.760> level

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
it introduces civilians into the level

by single-player rules and stick which
is<00:02:57.260> great<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.459> just<00:02:58.640> lets<00:02:58.820> them<00:02:59.000> flex

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
is great but it just lets them flex

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.330 
is great but it just lets them flex
their<00:02:59.630> designer<00:02:59.959> muscles<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.739> not<00:03:00.980> just

there<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.920> spec<00:03:07.370> up<00:03:07.550> some<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.880> think<00:03:07.910> are

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
there and spec up some that I think are

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.790 
there and spec up some that I think are
just<00:03:08.540> completely<00:03:08.840> unique<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.530> call<00:03:09.709> of

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
just completely unique to the call of

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.830 
just completely unique to the call of
duty

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
duty

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.470

yeah<00:03:11.739> as<00:03:11.860> far<00:03:12.010> as<00:03:12.069> DLC<00:03:12.340> goes<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.970> does<00:03:13.180> seem

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
yeah as far as DLC goes it does seem

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.199 
yeah as far as DLC goes it does seem
logical<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.280> speck<00:03:15.280> off<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.640> just<00:03:15.670> perfect

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
logical that speck off is just perfect

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.530 
logical that speck off is just perfect
for<00:03:16.270> that<00:03:16.450> type<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.660> stuff
