plain<00:00:31.269> repetition<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:38.710> for<00:00:39.190> low-driven<00:00:39.699> shot

I<00:00:40.390> think<00:00:41.289> most<00:00:41.469> importantly<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:43.570> your

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
I think most importantly is your

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.479 
I think most importantly is your
approach<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.679> don't<00:00:44.710> want<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.100> approach<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
approach you don't want to approach the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.029 
approach you don't want to approach the
ball<00:00:45.670> straight<00:00:46.420> on<00:00:46.629> as<00:00:46.870> you're<00:00:47.440> shooting<00:00:48.010> on

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
goal you want to approach it sort of on

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.660 
goal you want to approach it sort of on
an<00:00:49.780> angle<00:00:50.140> maybe<00:00:50.679> like<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.829> 45<00:00:51.309> degree<00:00:51.489> angle

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
an angle maybe like a 45 degree angle

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.479 
an angle maybe like a 45 degree angle
when<00:00:52.600> you<00:00:52.690> approach<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.230> ball<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:54.219> want<00:00:54.399> to

for standing on once you've mastered the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.509 
for standing on once you've mastered the
technique<00:03:01.120> then<00:03:01.659> you<00:03:01.720> can<00:03:01.959> move<00:03:02.110> on<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.799> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
technique then you can move on to the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.699 
technique then you can move on to the
next<00:03:03.640> progression<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.569> I<00:03:04.690> think<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.500> next

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
next progression and I think the next

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.800 
next progression and I think the next
progression<00:03:05.890> would<00:03:06.340> naturally<00:03:06.819> be<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.209> you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
progression would naturally be just you

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.350 
progression would naturally be just you
taking<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.409> little<00:03:08.560> touch<00:03:08.799> maybe<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.489> yard<00:03:10.000> yard

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
taking a little touch maybe a yard yard

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.390 
taking a little touch maybe a yard yard
and<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> half<00:03:10.540> touch<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.230> then<00:03:11.709> striking<00:03:12.040> that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
and a half touch and then striking that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.039 
and a half touch and then striking that
go<00:03:12.519> up<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.299> makes<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.659> little<00:03:13.810> bit<00:03:13.930> more

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
go up it just makes it a little bit more

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.319 
go up it just makes it a little bit more
game<00:03:14.319> realistic<00:03:14.650> because<00:03:15.519> not<00:03:15.879> very<00:03:15.909> often
