00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
you can once you get good at it after

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.110 
you can once you get good at it after
you<00:02:15.120> when<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:17.610> bend<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you when you do this to bend that a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.059 
you when you do this to bend that a
little<00:02:18.450> bit<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:18.989> fourth<00:02:19.500> time<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.920> do<00:02:20.040> it

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
little bit on that fourth time you do it

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.010 
little bit on that fourth time you do it
to<00:02:20.310> bend<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.760> little<00:02:21.030> bit<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.510> mean<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
to bend that a little bit but I mean it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
to bend that a little bit but I mean it
really<00:02:22.380> doesn't<00:02:22.709> make<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.830> difference<00:02:23.040> you're

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
really doesn't make a difference you're
