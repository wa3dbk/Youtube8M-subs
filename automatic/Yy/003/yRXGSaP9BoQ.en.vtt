with the iphone 5s you'd have thought
that<00:04:39.200> have<00:04:39.320> been<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.470> processor<00:04:40.100> speed<00:04:40.400> upgrade

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
that have been a processor speed upgrade

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.890 
that have been a processor speed upgrade
but<00:04:41.360> no<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:42.590> iphone<00:04:43.010> still<00:04:43.550> has<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:43.970> 1.3

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
but no the iphone still has a 1.3

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.430 
but no the iphone still has a 1.3
dual-core<00:04:45.740> whereas<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.400> samsung<00:04:46.910> has<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.440> 1.7

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
dual-core whereas the samsung has a 1.7

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.990 
dual-core whereas the samsung has a 1.7
gigahertz<00:04:48.770> quad-core

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
gigahertz quad-core

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.510 
gigahertz quad-core
so<00:04:51.690> therefore<00:04:51.990> making<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.620> more<00:04:52.920> than<00:04:53.160> double

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
so therefore making it more than double

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.790 
so therefore making it more than double
the<00:04:53.610> speed<00:04:53.850> of<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.150> iphone<00:04:54.780> although<00:04:55.290> Apple

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the speed of the iphone although Apple

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.620 
the speed of the iphone although Apple
users<00:04:56.160> don't<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.910> kind<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.210> say<00:04:57.390> that

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
users don't like you to kind of say that

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.690 
users don't like you to kind of say that
because<00:04:57.810> even<00:04:58.500> though<00:04:58.590> it's<00:04:58.770> obviously<00:04:59.190> true

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
because even though it's obviously true

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.010 
because even though it's obviously true
it<00:05:00.510> somehow<00:05:01.200> in<00:05:01.980> their<00:05:02.490> weird<00:05:02.880> logic<00:05:03.210> isn't

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
it somehow in their weird logic isn't

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.070 
it somehow in their weird logic isn't
possible<00:05:05.060> four<00:05:06.060> times<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.510> speed<00:05:06.750> of<00:05:06.810> the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
possible four times the speed of the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.080 
possible four times the speed of the
processor<00:05:07.340> four<00:05:08.340> times<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.730> speed<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:08.970> the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
processor four times the speed of the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.530 
processor four times the speed of the
processing<00:05:10.070> but<00:05:11.070> according<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.700> Apple<00:05:12.030> users

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
processing but according to Apple users

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.000 
processing but according to Apple users
no<00:05:13.880> dual<00:05:14.880> core<00:05:15.240> is<00:05:15.510> faster<00:05:16.170> than<00:05:16.200> quad<00:05:16.770> core<00:05:17.100> oh

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
no dual core is faster than quad core oh

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.980 
no dual core is faster than quad core oh
and<00:05:20.010> another<00:05:20.250> thing<00:05:20.370> Apple<00:05:21.150> are<00:05:21.330> very<00:05:21.630> keen<00:05:21.930> to

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
and another thing Apple are very keen to

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.390 
and another thing Apple are very keen to
say<00:05:22.320> that<00:05:22.560> your<00:05:22.680> fingerprint<00:05:23.220> information

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
say that your fingerprint information

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.060 
say that your fingerprint information
will<00:05:23.970> be<00:05:24.000> stored<00:05:24.150> only<00:05:24.720> in<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.530> phone<00:05:25.770> and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
will be stored only in the phone and

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.090 
will be stored only in the phone and
won't<00:05:26.669> leave<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.090> phone<00:05:27.300> oh<00:05:27.540> yeah<00:05:28.530> apple<00:05:28.950> we

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
won't leave the phone oh yeah apple we

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.830 
won't leave the phone oh yeah apple we
really<00:05:29.340> believe<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.760> don't<00:05:29.790> we<00:05:30.120> after<00:05:30.750> you

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
really believe you don't we after you

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.440 
really believe you don't we after you
told<00:05:31.050> us<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:32.310> phones<00:05:32.520> were<00:05:32.760> secure<00:05:33.180> and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
told us that the phones were secure and

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.360 
told us that the phones were secure and
then<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:33.930> go<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.110> give<00:05:34.590> all<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.860> information

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
then you go and give all the information

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.560 
then you go and give all the information
about<00:05:35.550> people's<00:05:35.850> tracking<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.540> where

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
about people's tracking and where

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.000 
about people's tracking and where
they've<00:05:36.870> been<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:37.320> you're<00:05:37.680> permanently

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
they've been and you're permanently

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.680 
they've been and you're permanently
feeling<00:05:38.669> out<00:05:38.760> information<00:05:39.060> about<00:05:39.510> the

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
feeling out information about the

believe you so in essence another Apple
fucking<00:05:49.140> bullshit<00:05:49.620> phone<00:05:49.890> coming<00:05:50.340> out<00:05:50.490> with

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
fucking bullshit phone coming out with

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.730 
fucking bullshit phone coming out with
not<00:05:51.060> much<00:05:51.300> that's<00:05:51.660> changed<00:05:52.200> only

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
not much that's changed only

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.530 
not much that's changed only
implementing<00:05:53.640> features<00:05:54.030> that<00:05:54.180> should<00:05:54.419> have

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
implementing features that should have

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.240 
implementing features that should have
been<00:05:54.570> there<00:05:54.930> in<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.229> first<00:05:55.470> place<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:56.190> people

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
been there in the first place and people

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.710 
been there in the first place and people
have<00:05:56.460> been<00:05:56.580> screaming<00:05:56.910> for<00:05:57.240> from<00:05:57.479> the<00:05:57.570> lap

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
have been screaming for from the lap

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.590 
have been screaming for from the lap

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.380 
made them available like bluetooth is it
worth<00:06:06.600> it<00:06:06.840> no<00:06:07.350> would<00:06:07.979> I<00:06:08.010> want<00:06:08.310> one<00:06:08.490> nip<00:06:09.120> and

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
worth it no would I want one nip and

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.840 
worth it no would I want one nip and
would<00:06:10.200> I<00:06:10.229> be<00:06:10.640> recommending<00:06:11.640> that<00:06:11.669> people
