okay<00:00:08.400> what<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.000> heck<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.599> type<00:00:09.960> 3<00:00:10.260> muscle

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
okay what the heck is a type 3 muscle

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.709 
okay what the heck is a type 3 muscle
fiber<00:00:10.950> now<00:00:11.550> like<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.880> said<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.210> last<00:00:12.240> video

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
fiber now like I said in the last video

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.419 
fiber now like I said in the last video
if<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.559> present<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:14.070> body<00:00:14.219> with<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
if you present your body with a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.310 
if you present your body with a
particular<00:00:14.759> type<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> stimulus<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:16.020> going

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
particular type of stimulus it's going

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.529 
particular type of stimulus it's going
to<00:00:16.440> give<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> response<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.390> if

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
to give you a response if you do it if

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
to give you a response if you do it if
you<00:00:18.630> give<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.279> stimulus<00:00:20.279> from<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.640> end<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you give it a stimulus from one end of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.849 
you give it a stimulus from one end of
the<00:00:20.939> spectrum<00:00:21.180> let's<00:00:21.810> call<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.380> call<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the spectrum let's call it call this the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.980 
the spectrum let's call it call this the
speech<00:00:23.189> strength<00:00:23.580> end<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> spectrum<00:00:24.150> it's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
speech strength end of the spectrum it's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
speech strength end of the spectrum it's
going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> respond<00:00:25.949> by<00:00:26.160> getting<00:00:26.519> faster<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
going to respond by getting faster and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.240 
going to respond by getting faster and
stronger<00:00:27.449> if<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.529> present<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
stronger if you present it with a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.380 
stronger if you present it with a
stimulus<00:00:29.699> from<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.000> end<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> spectrum

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
stimulus from this end of the spectrum

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.290 
stimulus from this end of the spectrum
let's<00:00:30.840> call<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.160> endurance<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> fat<00:00:33.059> burning

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
let's call it endurance and fat burning

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.380 
let's call it endurance and fat burning
then<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.559> respond<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.360> like

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
then it's going to respond in a like

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
then it's going to respond in a like
fashion<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.559> let's<00:00:37.739> say<00:00:37.950> what<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.340> want<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
fashion well let's say what we want to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459 
fashion well let's say what we want to
do<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.180> order<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.600> produce<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
do in order to produce and I'm going to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.900 
do in order to produce and I'm going to
show<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.309> means<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> moment

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
show you what this all means the moment

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.630 
show you what this all means the moment
the<00:00:42.450> type<00:00:42.629> 3<00:00:42.840> super<00:00:43.559> biologically<00:00:44.489> superior

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the type 3 super biologically superior

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.630 
the type 3 super biologically superior
muscle<00:00:45.420> fiber<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.050> present<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.250> both

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
muscle fiber is to present it with both

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
muscle fiber is to present it with both
ends<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> spectrum<00:00:48.440> within<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> same

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
ends of the spectrum within the same

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
ends of the spectrum within the same
period<00:00:50.489> eyes<00:00:50.820> program<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:51.930> exactly

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
period eyes program and that's exactly

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.060 
period eyes program and that's exactly
what<00:00:52.530> we'll<00:00:52.680> talk<00:00:52.800> about<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> next<00:00:53.250> video<00:00:54.020> so

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
what we'll talk about the next video so

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
what we'll talk about the next video so
let's<00:00:56.070> talk<00:00:56.340> about<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.730> way<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.390> your

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
let's talk about the way that your

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.700 
let's talk about the way that your
muscle<00:00:58.350> fibers<00:00:58.579> produce<00:00:59.579> energy<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:01.530> they

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
muscle fibers produce energy or how they

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.670 
muscle fibers produce energy or how they
work<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:02.969> two<00:01:03.239> things<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.110> really

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
work so there are two things that really

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.679 
work so there are two things that really
drive<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.339> entire<00:01:05.700> body<00:01:05.970> there<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.540> your

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
drive your entire body there are your

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 
drive your entire body there are your
own<00:01:06.750> hormones<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.740> there's<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.729> nervous

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
own hormones and there's your nervous

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990 
own hormones and there's your nervous
system<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.659> hormones<00:01:10.500> ISM<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.729> more

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
system your hormones ISM or a more

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.120 
system your hormones ISM or a more
primal<00:01:12.390> form<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.400> our<00:01:14.400> ability<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:17.100> what

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
primal form of our ability to to do what

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.789 
primal form of our ability to to do what
we<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> nervous<00:01:19.439> system<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
we have to do and the nervous system is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.950 
we have to do and the nervous system is
a<00:01:19.830> little<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.220> complex<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.479> hormones

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
a little bit more complex the hormones

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560 
a little bit more complex the hormones
are<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.590> slower<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.520> producing<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
are a little bit slower in producing a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
are a little bit slower in producing a
response<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.740> nervous<00:01:25.979> system<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.490> lot

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
response and the nervous system is a lot

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.510 
response and the nervous system is a lot
faster<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.290> electricity<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
faster because it's like electricity and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.789 
faster because it's like electricity and
producing<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> responds<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.990> both<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.680> them

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
producing it responds so both of them

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.160 
producing it responds so both of them
are<00:01:32.040> essential<00:01:32.970> both<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.390> them<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.750> different

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
are essential both of them do different

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.859 
are essential both of them do different
things<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.750> we

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
things and so what we want to do is we

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.609 
things and so what we want to do is we
want<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> increase<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.490> efficiency<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.810> both

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
want to increase the efficiency of both

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.069 
want to increase the efficiency of both
hormones<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> nervous<00:01:42.090> system<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
hormones and nervous system in the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.060 
hormones and nervous system in the
muscle<00:01:43.380> fiber<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> could<00:01:44.880> imagine

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
muscle fiber so if you could imagine

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
muscle fiber so if you could imagine
you've<00:01:47.070> got<00:01:47.100> nerve<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:48.390> motor<00:01:48.780> units<00:01:49.259> these

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you've got nerve or motor units these

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.380 
you've got nerve or motor units these
are<00:01:49.890> basically<00:01:50.250> nerve<00:01:50.610> endings<00:01:51.119> come

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
are basically nerve endings come

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.969 
are basically nerve endings come
stemming<00:01:51.930> from<00:01:51.960> your<00:01:52.259> peripheral<00:01:52.770> nervous

stemming from your peripheral nervous

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.969 
stemming from your peripheral nervous
system<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:54.149> they<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.619> peripheral

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
system or they are your peripheral

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.620 
system or they are your peripheral
nervous<00:01:56.159> systems<00:01:56.549> coming<00:01:57.149> from<00:01:57.390> your

central nervous system it all kind of

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.160 
central nervous system it all kind of
branches<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:03.119> muscle<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.869> that's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
branches out into the muscle so that's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
branches out into the muscle so that's
what<00:02:04.350> you've<00:02:04.469> got<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.430> call<00:02:05.759> each<00:02:06.000> one

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
what you've got here you call each one

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.340 
what you've got here you call each one
of<00:02:06.390> these<00:02:07.520> tendrils<00:02:08.520> a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
of these tendrils a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.120 
of these tendrils a
unit<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.550> motor<00:02:11.940> unit<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.130> what

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
unit this is a motor unit and what

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.630 
unit this is a motor unit and what
happens<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:16.200> brain<00:02:16.980> tells<00:02:17.460> your

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
happens is as your your brain tells your

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580 
happens is as your your brain tells your
body<00:02:18.030> what<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.540> wants<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> sends<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
body what it wants to do it sends a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.280 
body what it wants to do it sends a
message<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.750> flip<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
message just like it and you flip on the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.530 
message just like it and you flip on the
light<00:02:22.470> switch<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.310> lights<00:02:23.520> turn<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.790> well

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
light switch and the lights turn on well

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.210 
light switch and the lights turn on well
the<00:02:24.630> same<00:02:24.840> thing<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.110> your<00:02:25.680> brain<00:02:25.920> tells<00:02:26.160> your

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the same thing is your brain tells your

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.610 
the same thing is your brain tells your
body<00:02:26.430> who<00:02:26.940> we<00:02:27.120> want<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.420> do<00:02:27.510> something<00:02:27.780> I'm

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
body who we want you to do something I'm

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.140 
body who we want you to do something I'm
moving<00:02:29.010> my<00:02:29.100> arms<00:02:29.400> right<00:02:29.550> now<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:29.970> this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
moving my arms right now it's like this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.580 
moving my arms right now it's like this
is<00:02:30.270> what's<00:02:30.450> happening<00:02:30.750> my<00:02:30.870> brain<00:02:31.080> saying<00:02:31.320> move

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
is what's happening my brain saying move

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.920 
is what's happening my brain saying move
your<00:02:31.800> frickin<00:02:32.040> elbow<00:02:32.310> that's<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.570> it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
your frickin elbow that's it so it's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.850 
your frickin elbow that's it so it's
real<00:02:34.530> simple<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.040> happens<00:02:35.400> instantly<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
real simple it happens instantly and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.590 
real simple it happens instantly and
they're<00:02:37.860> more<00:02:38.100> efficient<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.970> part<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
they're more efficient that part of the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.810 
they're more efficient that part of the
muscle<00:02:39.960> gets<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.800> stronger<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.670> become

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
muscle gets the stronger you become

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.880 
muscle gets the stronger you become
that's<00:02:42.480> why<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> lot<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.680> power

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that's why you know a lot of power

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.700 
that's why you know a lot of power
lifters<00:02:44.280> will<00:02:44.460> say<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.790> they've<00:02:44.940> got<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
lifters will say that they've got like a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.790 
lifters will say that they've got like a
CNS<00:02:47.180> fatigue<00:02:48.180> they're<00:02:48.870> burning<00:02:49.470> out<00:02:49.590> their

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
CNS fatigue they're burning out their

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.430 
CNS fatigue they're burning out their
nervous<00:02:50.280> system<00:02:50.760> because<00:02:51.290> powerlifting<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.380> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
nervous system because powerlifting is a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280 
nervous system because powerlifting is a
sport<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.800> strength<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.750> you're<00:02:54.750> they're

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
sport of strength and you're they're

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.960 
sport of strength and you're they're
really<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.680> burning<00:02:56.070> out<00:02:56.250> their<00:02:56.400> muscles<00:02:56.790> too

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
really not burning out their muscles too

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.670 
really not burning out their muscles too
much<00:02:57.180> they're<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.780> rarely<00:02:58.020> will<00:02:58.500> they<00:02:58.530> be

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
much they're very rarely will they be

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.460 
much they're very rarely will they be
really<00:02:59.160> sore<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.850> bodybuilder<00:03:00.480> sore<00:03:00.750> but

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
really sore like a bodybuilder sore but

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.500 
really sore like a bodybuilder sore but
they'll<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:01.860> fatigued<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.700> tired<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.270> burnt

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
they'll be fatigued and tired and burnt

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.810 
they'll be fatigued and tired and burnt
out<00:03:03.780> because<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.230> nervous<00:03:04.440> system<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.100> just

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
out because the nervous system is just

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.480 
out because the nervous system is just
shooting<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:06.960> much<00:03:07.290> energy<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.830> much<00:03:08.010> trick<00:03:08.370> so

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
shooting so much energy so much trick so

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.620 
shooting so much energy so much trick so
much<00:03:08.550> electricity<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.330> muscles<00:03:09.600> to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
much electricity to the muscles to

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.920 
much electricity to the muscles to
produce<00:03:10.100> strength<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.120> burn<00:03:12.420> out<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
produce strength that you burn out the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.780 
produce strength that you burn out the
nervous<00:03:13.230> system<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:14.310> these<00:03:14.460> little

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
nervous system and then these little

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.380 
nervous system and then these little
dudes<00:03:14.940> here<00:03:15.330> are<00:03:16.430> mitochondria<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.700> they're

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
dudes here are mitochondria and they're

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.470 
dudes here are mitochondria and they're
basically<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.960> powerhouses<00:03:19.710> of<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
basically the powerhouses of the of the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.270 
basically the powerhouses of the of the
muscle<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:21.840> work<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.260> lot<00:03:22.410> slower<00:03:22.950> they

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
muscle they work a lot slower they

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.790 
muscle they work a lot slower they
produce<00:03:23.520> enzymes<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.930> break<00:03:24.990> down<00:03:25.290> all

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
produce enzymes that break down all

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.650 
produce enzymes that break down all
types<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.280> chemicals<00:03:26.700> from<00:03:26.910> your<00:03:27.000> food<00:03:27.360> and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
types of chemicals from your food and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.650 
types of chemicals from your food and
stuff<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.380> order<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.950> produce<00:03:29.190> long<00:03:30.180> term

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
stuff in order to produce long term

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.560 
stuff in order to produce long term
energy<00:03:30.960> your<00:03:31.500> ability<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.920> keep<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.520> going<00:03:33.210> so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
energy your ability to keep on going so

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.570 
energy your ability to keep on going so
if<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.810> imagine<00:03:34.020> motor<00:03:34.440> units<00:03:34.800> let's<00:03:35.430> go

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
if you can imagine motor units let's go

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.480 
if you can imagine motor units let's go
now<00:03:35.930> mitochondria<00:03:36.930> let's<00:03:37.290> keep<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:38.070> that

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
now mitochondria let's keep going that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.520 
now mitochondria let's keep going that
all<00:03:38.670> makes<00:03:38.910> sense<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.960> can<00:03:40.170> imagine<00:03:40.320> that

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
all makes sense so you can imagine that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.870 
all makes sense so you can imagine that
if<00:03:40.770> you've<00:03:40.920> got<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.160> type<00:03:41.310> 2<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.550> your<00:03:41.730> type

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
if you've got your type 2 and your type

got some muscle fibers that are really

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.430 
got some muscle fibers that are really

be<00:03:49.500> your<00:03:49.620> type<00:03:49.830> 1<00:03:50.190> muscle<00:03:50.310> fibers<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.880> then

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
be your type 1 muscle fibers and then

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.690 
be your type 1 muscle fibers and then
you've<00:03:51.900> got<00:03:52.080> those<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.590> are<00:03:52.710> really<00:03:53.460> just

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
you've got those that are really just

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.030 
you've got those that are really just
kicking<00:03:54.330> with<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.600> electricity<00:03:55.170> those<00:03:55.800> are

kicking with the electricity those are

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.190 
kicking with the electricity those are
going<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.280> be<00:03:56.370> your<00:03:56.550> type<00:03:57.030> 2<00:03:57.570> muscle<00:03:57.750> fibers

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
going to be your type 2 muscle fibers

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.810 
going to be your type 2 muscle fibers
the<00:03:58.320> ones<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.740> are<00:03:59.100> really<00:03:59.370> tied<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
the ones that are really tied to the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
in their muscles so what we want to do

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.610 
in their muscles so what we want to do
is<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.300> what<00:04:13.450> I'm<00:04:13.540> going<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.690> describe<00:04:13.990> in<00:04:14.380> a

is and what I'm going to describe in a
the<00:04:15.310> next<00:04:15.580> video<00:04:15.880> in<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.120> next<00:04:16.269> segment<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.810> we

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
the next video in the next segment is we

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.880 
the next video in the next segment is we
want<00:04:17.920> to<00:04:17.950> increase<00:04:18.519> both<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.890> mitochondrial

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
want to increase both the mitochondrial

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.930 
want to increase both the mitochondrial
density<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.820> tissue<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:22.620> well<00:04:23.620> as

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
density in the tissue as well as

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.270

building<00:04:24.940> or<00:04:25.270> I'm<00:04:25.930> not<00:04:26.230> even<00:04:26.470> sure<00:04:26.740> correctly

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
building or I'm not even sure correctly

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.070 
building or I'm not even sure correctly
you<00:04:27.520> can<00:04:27.670> let<00:04:28.390> me<00:04:28.420> know<00:04:28.480> if<00:04:28.630> I'm<00:04:28.780> right<00:04:29.020> or

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
you can let me know if I'm right or

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.390 
you can let me know if I'm right or
wrong<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.590> don't<00:04:29.860> know<00:04:29.980> if<00:04:30.040> we<00:04:30.130> could<00:04:30.220> build

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
wrong I don't know if we could build

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.760 
wrong I don't know if we could build
more<00:04:30.610> motor<00:04:31.000> units<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.570> we<00:04:31.630> can<00:04:31.930> increase<00:04:32.500> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
more motor units but we can increase the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.550 
more motor units but we can increase the
efficiency<00:04:32.890> of<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:34.360> nervous<00:04:34.810> response<00:04:34.960> in

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
efficiency of the nervous response in

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.760 
efficiency of the nervous response in
the<00:04:35.680> motor<00:04:36.130> units<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.600> muscle<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.110> the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the motor units to the muscle and the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.240 
the motor units to the muscle and the
way<00:04:38.920> we<00:04:39.070> do<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.640> we<00:04:39.820> produce<00:04:40.020> stimulus<00:04:41.020> ie

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
way we do that is we produce stimulus ie

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.480 
way we do that is we produce stimulus ie
exercise<00:04:42.760> programs<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.950> force<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.250> to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
exercise programs that force this to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.900 
exercise programs that force this to
happen

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
happen

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.070 
happen
more<00:04:46.900> mitochondria<00:04:47.440> if<00:04:48.370> we<00:04:49.030> keep<00:04:49.360> doing<00:04:49.660> the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
more mitochondria if we keep doing the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.040 
more mitochondria if we keep doing the
type<00:04:50.290> of<00:04:50.320> things<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:50.920> we<00:04:51.040> do<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.840> hybrid

training that I'm going to describe you
later<00:04:54.880> your<00:04:55.600> body<00:04:55.980> responds<00:04:56.980> by<00:04:57.160> producing

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
later your body responds by producing

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.040 
later your body responds by producing
more<00:04:58.540> of<00:04:58.840> these<00:04:59.700> mitochondria<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:01.420> that<00:05:01.870> way

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
more of these mitochondria and that way

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.580 
more of these mitochondria and that way
it<00:05:02.200> can<00:05:02.260> continue<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:03.300> go<00:05:04.300> on<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.960> on<00:05:05.140> and<00:05:05.470> on

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
it can continue to go on and on and on

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.440 
it can continue to go on and on and on
and<00:05:05.950> on<00:05:06.100> and<00:05:06.310> on<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.520> produces<00:05:06.880> that<00:05:06.910> endurance

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
and on and on it produces that endurance

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.600 
and on and on it produces that endurance
or<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.900> longevity<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:09.040> we<00:05:09.160> described

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
or that longevity that we described

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.830 
or that longevity that we described
earlier<00:05:09.880> and<00:05:10.560> when<00:05:11.560> we<00:05:11.770> also<00:05:12.610> -<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.480> same

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
earlier and when we also - the same

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.130 
earlier and when we also - the same
muscle<00:05:14.320> within<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.740> same<00:05:15.210> timeframe<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:17.020> is

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
muscle within the same timeframe this is

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.600 
muscle within the same timeframe this is
very<00:05:17.350> important<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.010> I'll<00:05:18.190> talk<00:05:18.370> more<00:05:18.400> about

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
very important and I'll talk more about

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.460 
very important and I'll talk more about
it<00:05:18.760> later<00:05:18.970> but<00:05:19.150> basically<00:05:19.870> within<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.230> same

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
it later but basically within the same

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.980 
it later but basically within the same
week<00:05:20.740> or<00:05:20.980> the<00:05:21.070> same<00:05:21.280> workout<00:05:23.370> we<00:05:24.600> really<00:05:25.600> drive

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
week or the same workout we really drive

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.720

Francisco<00:05:54.490> for<00:05:55.270> like<00:05:55.390> a<00:05:55.420> week<00:05:55.690> that's<00:05:56.650> pretty

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
Francisco for like a week that's pretty

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.470 
Francisco for like a week that's pretty
incredible<00:05:57.070> so<00:05:57.550> we<00:05:57.670> have<00:05:57.850> that<00:05:58.060> within<00:05:58.360> us

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
incredible so we have that within us

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.810 
incredible so we have that within us
let's<00:05:59.170> increase<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.830> efficiency<00:06:00.280> of<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.490> by

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
let's increase the efficiency of it by

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.840 
let's increase the efficiency of it by
having<00:06:01.120> it<00:06:01.210> drive<00:06:01.600> to<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.990> tissue<00:06:02.260> in<00:06:03.010> a<00:06:03.610> more

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
having it drive to the tissue in a more

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.000 
having it drive to the tissue in a more
efficient<00:06:04.690> manner<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.080> if<00:06:05.470> you're<00:06:05.740> wondering

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
efficient manner so if you're wondering

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.430 
efficient manner so if you're wondering
what<00:06:06.310> a<00:06:06.510> superior<00:06:07.510> or<00:06:07.780> biologically<00:06:08.290> superior

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
what a superior or biologically superior

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.490 
what a superior or biologically superior
muscle<00:06:08.950> fiber<00:06:09.100> is<00:06:09.280> or<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.520> type<00:06:09.970> 3<00:06:10.540> muscle<00:06:11.290> fiber

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
muscle fiber is or a type 3 muscle fiber

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.090 
muscle fiber is or a type 3 muscle fiber
it's<00:06:12.100> not<00:06:12.460> some<00:06:13.140> mutant<00:06:14.140> muscle<00:06:14.590> fiber<00:06:14.800> that<00:06:15.040> I

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
it's not some mutant muscle fiber that I

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.970 
it's not some mutant muscle fiber that I
created<00:06:15.490> in<00:06:15.700> a<00:06:15.760> petri<00:06:15.970> dish<00:06:16.380> it's<00:06:17.380> simply<00:06:17.950> a
