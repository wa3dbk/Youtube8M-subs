00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.840
 hi to all and balsan case i hope that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.170
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.610
 nickel 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.139
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.440
 new episode of activity what the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.210
 fuck 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 it goes out of being able to enjoy everything 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.400
 the weekend and we'll start all of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.400
 after 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.339
 and again this ranking of activities 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.449
 what the funk with races so there 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.680
 you see that the system of this 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.419
 race is jumped above the prison 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.760
 so there you have a mega ramp 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.019
 there you fly over the prison for those who 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.790
 have too much speed and who are going too much 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.680
 away with the I missed the line 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.000
 of arrival here you will have a second 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.530
 little rent the story of being able to finish 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.309
 the race 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.570
 so frankly I think it's 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.220
 not bad with a little jump of power 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.699
 skip the whole prison unless you do 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.699
 beautiful waterfalls 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.379
 it is now in the fourth 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.670
 place of this ranking 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.350
 so here this time it will be a 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.059
 clash that's really what the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.870
 fuck you will see my friend a little bit of 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.729
 time to understand what was needed 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.110
 to do and in the end we had fun doing 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.759
 whoever got down the most 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.800
 quickly downstairs without dying had 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.110
 won so you see that there you are 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.330
 enormously to that there are only dragons 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.369
 all you so new yona shine that is 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.170
 fallen the tale and what are we trying to 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.670
 to do is to actually jump from 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.090
 wagon car to land the lowest 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.770
 possible 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.270
 so that's not the main purpose of 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.450
 the good activity is not badly amused like 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.450
 it 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.290
 we now move to third place 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.030
 of this ranking again with a 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.350
 confrontation you will see that the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.880
 decor is really not bad there you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.590
 can climb them buses you have 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.660
 plenty of places not to hide you finally 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.040
 his enemies they have the same thing and at 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.020
 middle one has a good open area 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 and frankly I advise you to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.920
 do this activity to the snipers which 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.620
 is a little funny when even a little 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:07.140
 more fun earlier you see that 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:08.550
 frankly it's true rather not bad 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.290
 now to the second place 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.619
 ranking for an activity what the 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.330
 fuck 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.490
 you will be able to make a match of 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.590
 foot in dingle cases and the ball that 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.310
 will be a trash can 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.620
 frankly it's not bad to type 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.090
 more and more youtuber bars 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.590
 has fun doing his activities live 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.580
 with their subscribers 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:39.720
 but frankly it's really cool 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:40.920
 go for bars and here we come to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.720
 the first place in this ranking with 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.820
 an activity that is a race to 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.300
 loved me mega hard me I did not 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.680
 not completed 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.320
 I did not manage to make this turn there 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.610
 even who so I 'm going to do a canadair 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.140
 so maybe that's what's blocking a 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.250
 I advise you rather than do 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.260
 with motorcycles if it's possible 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.239
 so there you take speed he goes 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.610
 have to try to land on the small 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.840
 platform right in front and in fact you 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.010
 you will have to go around the mass 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.570
 bench only on small platforms 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.160
 like that and frankly it's really 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.420
 very very hard 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.100
 my opinion had to miss dam and on 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.150
 this activity with me 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.200
 so a lot of rage is there you go back 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.730
 you saw you have little tips 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.739
 speed also to you take a 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.090
 speed kibbutz and it's gone 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.540
 after cosa and too much speed 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.830
 hard is good landing and here we go 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.090
 get to the end of this ranking so 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.170
 I will quickly invite you to 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.150
 join our facebook group 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.100
 so if you ever have any tips from 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.840
 questions if you are looking for a crew a 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.370
 duplication do not hesitate too 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.420
 you have been coming to follow me on 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.100
 twitter which is more convenient than 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.640
 facebook at least all the messages are 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.019
 well together 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.760
 There are no messages in the box 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.590
 of receipt in the commentary by ci 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.389
 in the commentary by that I find that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.460
 it's really getting too complicated 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.390
 Facebook 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.860
 and so I put you all the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.420
 links to download in the description 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.920
