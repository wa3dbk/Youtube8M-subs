00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.650 
we're interested in this facility here
is<00:01:50.250> called<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> horizontal<00:01:51.390> integration

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
is called the horizontal integration

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.380 
is called the horizontal integration
facility<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.800> hip<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> where<00:01:54.210> they

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
facility or hip this is where they

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.109 
facility or hip this is where they
actually<00:01:54.649> assemble<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.860> rocket<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.399> side<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
actually assemble the rocket and side is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.210 
actually assemble the rocket and side is
going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> show<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.140> different<00:01:58.560> elements<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
going to show the different elements of

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.999 
going to show the different elements of
the<00:01:59.340> rocks<00:02:00.050> actually<00:02:01.050> right<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.860> can

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the rocks actually right there you can

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
the rocks actually right there you can
see<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.340> launch<00:02:02.550> pad<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> see

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
see the launch pad and as you can see

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
see the launch pad and as you can see
it's<00:02:04.380> close<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.130> hips<00:02:05.550> so<00:02:05.850> when<00:02:06.000> they

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it's close to the hips so when they

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.419 
it's close to the hips so when they
assemble<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.869> rocket<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.440> transport<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
assemble the rocket they transport it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729 
assemble the rocket they transport it
over<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> launch<00:02:09.270> pad<00:02:09.600> then<00:02:10.259> they<00:02:10.440> mount

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
over to the launch pad then they mount

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
over to the launch pad then they mount
the<00:02:10.860> spacecraft<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.640> top<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the spacecraft on top of it in

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.660 
the spacecraft on top of it in
preparation<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.410> launch<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.100> let's<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.519> and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
preparation for launch so let's go and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.800 
preparation for launch so let's go and
take<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.880> look<00:02:15.000> inside<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:18.090> interstage

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
take a look inside this interstage

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.920 
take a look inside this interstage
that's<00:02:19.140> got<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.470> empty<00:02:19.830> spot<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.519> see

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that's got the empty spot that you see

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.720 
that's got the empty spot that you see
that<00:02:21.930> actually<00:02:22.500> holds<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.040> second<00:02:23.459> stage

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that actually holds the second stage

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.810 
that actually holds the second stage
that<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.630> looked<00:02:24.870> at<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.470> dot<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
that we just looked at in the dot the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.610 
that we just looked at in the dot the
greatest<00:02:27.299> structure<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.959> see<00:02:27.989> out<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
greatest structure you see out on the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
greatest structure you see out on the
end<00:02:28.799> of<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> launch<00:02:29.250> vehicle<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:30.180> called<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
end of the launch vehicle is called the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.070 
end of the launch vehicle is called the
LMU<00:02:31.140> launch<00:02:31.739> mount<00:02:32.100> unit<00:02:32.549> LMU<00:02:33.390> holds<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
LMU launch mount unit LMU holds the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.050 
LMU launch mount unit LMU holds the
vehicle<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.769> base<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.549> that's<00:02:35.850> how<00:02:36.000> we

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
vehicle on the base and that's how we

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.380 
vehicle on the base and that's how we
use<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.340> erect<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.459> out<00:02:38.640> at<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.820> launch<00:02:39.120> pad

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
use it to erect it out at the launch pad

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.870 
use it to erect it out at the launch pad
and<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.650> see<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.010> working<00:02:41.489> end<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and you can see the working end of the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.509 
and you can see the working end of the
rocket<00:02:42.269> which<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.630> our<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> 68<00:02:43.440> engine<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:44.370> is

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
rocket which is our a 68 engine this is

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.910 
rocket which is our a 68 engine this is
going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.790> produce<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.269> thrust<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.500> lift<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
going to produce the thrust to lift the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.490 
going to produce the thrust to lift the
launch<00:02:47.130> people<00:02:47.580> into<00:02:48.510> space<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.140> then

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
launch people into space and then

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.590 
launch people into space and then
separate<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.459> second<00:02:50.790> stage<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.269> then

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
separate to the second stage and then

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.120 
separate to the second stage and then
separate<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.170> spacecraft<00:02:52.620> bus<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.920> goes

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
separate the spacecraft bus that goes

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.210 
separate the spacecraft bus that goes
out<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.580> orbit<00:02:53.940> our<00:02:57.650> final<00:02:58.650> stop<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.190> at

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
out to the orbit our final stop is at

of the spacecraft I launched it slip for

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.920 
of the spacecraft I launched it slip for
several<00:03:22.890> reasons<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:24.030> main<00:03:24.180> reason<00:03:24.600> would<00:03:24.780> be

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
several reasons the main reason would be

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.670 
several reasons the main reason would be
a<00:03:25.790> mechanic<00:03:26.790> or<00:03:26.910> electrical<00:03:27.630> anomaly<00:03:28.500> with

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
if any of the vehicle engineering

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.330 
if any of the vehicle engineering
disciplines<00:03:34.260> were<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.590> ready<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.130> for

disciplines were not ready to go for

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.060 
disciplines were not ready to go for
launch<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:35.940> we<00:03:36.090> would<00:03:36.240> certainly<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:38.040> know

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
launch then we would certainly you know

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.500 
launch then we would certainly you know
not<00:03:38.370> being<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.700> posture<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.180> launch<00:03:39.330> the
