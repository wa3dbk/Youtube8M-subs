solutions I'm not sure how the other

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.800 
solutions I'm not sure how the other
ones<00:03:00.430> work<00:03:00.700> if<00:03:00.849> they<00:03:00.940> do<00:03:01.000> something<00:03:01.390> different

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
complicated but network solutions they

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.670 
complicated but network solutions they
do<00:03:06.459> add<00:03:06.849> an<00:03:07.209> index<00:03:07.629> file<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.049> here<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.530> you
