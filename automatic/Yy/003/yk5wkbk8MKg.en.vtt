00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.740
 it's too intense it 's too intense 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.509
 Do you imagine that your life can be 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.179
 intense work I doubt it is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.690
 intense as traveling arrives in the city 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.039
 coursing supplies under a bath 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.609
 quickly comes a deck has a wine 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.939
 That dinner, sleep, get up early to fall. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.300
 on the dizzying road pandiani gives to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.309
 doing this in the understanding is 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.260
 wonderful is that is the thing that is not 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.489
 You'll think the hotel will not think where 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.649
 abbas pc 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.379
 I do not have any problems with the police 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.750
 Toll is rally problem 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.489
 we are not there to think about it there 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 It's just for fun. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.000
 I do not like motorcycles or I'm not a fan of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 motorcycles 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.539
 I stayed a lot in the van and summer 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.210
 the cares the rally had with the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.329
 motorcycle guys back right 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.280
 and to in the shade and wait for the bike and leave 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.769
 just leave the truck after the last bike 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 and gave such great security that I 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.930
 I went on the rump 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.100
 sometimes to see care caring 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.640
 by arne 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.409
 as the staff was really the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 professionalism with which they operate 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.630
 myself a very knowledgeable staff 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 and that it gives us a security what 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 is very important for this type of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 ride that really turns into a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.930
 very nice ride 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:35.190
 the most remarkable experience was I to 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 customer the first time you do not know 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.180
 who wants to travel by motorcycle through 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.179
 california in the mojave desert with 52 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.429
 degrees above under the sides you 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.340
 playing that bike I cried up 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.830
 the bike so beautiful that is why 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.780
 I came back and I told everyone to stay 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.720
 My friends had to travel. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.450
 had to see and feel the experience 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.840
 that I was feeling and that was 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.850
 remarkable that I've been there three times 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.750
 and every time I'm in the truck 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:14.330
 I cry because it's too much link I recommend 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.120
 I think it must be done who did not 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.670
 I do not know that I pardon the end there 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.990
 I was already telling my friends that 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.760
 were on a motorcycle 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.850
 I was already getting addicted to 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.630
 the rally was served later and in the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.030
 moto 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.260
 I loved kaka the whole trip was 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.200
 wonderful a caring of the whole team 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.100
 It was very important for us, it 's the ideal 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.190
 You want to bike to run for the aunt bike 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.190
 landscape and the whole problem it solves
