00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.200
 hello how about friends greetings for good 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.029
 here we are with another video tutorial 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.040
 well in this case I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.750
 we can do to look in our 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.360
 team the files that we have 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.730
 duplicates we already know that most 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.320
 let's go copying and pasting 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.509
 download and copy here we paste there 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.610
 and then they see that we have our disk 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.580
 hard then complete 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.640
 and we need to do a little cleaning 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.410
 and in this case I'm going to show you how 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.390
 be able to do to locate those files 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.770
 duplicates and be able to eliminate them and what 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.410
 let's do with a program already very 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.470
 known probably most already 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.630
 you know what is the cc cleaner and for 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.550
 those people who do not know you 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.280
 well at this moment you are going to know 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.320
 in this case this latest version of this 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.840
 program as I mentioned the cedec 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.790
 liner comes with this little application 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.170
 to find the file are duplicated and 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.240
 to be able to eliminate them in all the ways 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.640
 I have a video tutorial on my channel 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.100
 how to download it install it and start 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.260
 to work with him but I'll leave them at 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.970
 end of this video tutorial a link or 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.180
 a direct link to the video for those 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.140
 people who do not know you and you have 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.909
 some problem when installing it 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.830
 let's start working with him 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.540
 can the service and tutorial 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.600
 well in the description of the video too 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.060
 I 'm going to leave this link you know what 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.460
 the version is the 4th of March 26 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 2013 and this would be the link everything 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.430
 let's select the right mouse 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.020
 we copy it in the address bar of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.630
 our browser 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.579
 a right mouse and we paste we are going to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 give intro will take us to the page 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.909
 official of this program and did not open it 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.310
 this window 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.950
 of the xxi then we would give him save the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.119
 file and in this case I'm not going to do it 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.479
 as I already have that video tutorial 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.069
 complete and most people already 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.860
 we know this this program for 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.030
 You know how I'm going to repeat myself at the end 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.990
 of the video tutorial is going to leave someone 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.990
 for those who have 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.590
 problems when it comes to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.700
 to use download and install it 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.960
 have the first thing we are going to do now 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.640
 let's run the program I'll 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920
 show where this option comes from this 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.530
 version now let's execute either 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.000
 right mouse we execute as 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.700
 administrator or we give you a double click 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.680
 about the cde cleaner icon 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.209
 but this one we already know here this would be 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.250
 the interface we have the cleaner 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.660
 register tools and options we are going to 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.940
 the option that puts tools we give 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 one click and here we have uninstall 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.440
 programs started on restoring the system 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.209
 to delete unit and we go to the option 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.330
 that puts searcher of files we give 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.280
 one click 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.680
 here we see that we have everything already marked 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.150
 well that matches in the search by the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.660
 name by size or date of 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.870
 modification and here by ignoring we're going to 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.360
 ignore zero country files 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.640
 we also mark system files and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.040
 we can mark the reading and the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.390
 hidden files these 3 we can 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 leave them marked me in this case I will 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.959
 mark them all to do the institute 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.510
 so they do not get too long because if 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.190
 we unmarked everything is going to be very long 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.420
 here we have to exclude a folder or 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.560
 a file that we do not want the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.150
 search 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.760
 the selection we would do if we would put it 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.959
 here we are going to mark all the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.940
 units that we have in our team 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.940
 in this case I have four cd 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.890
 and we do not go to the prayer that he puts seek 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.910
 we give you a what to look for and go 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.770
 start doing an analysis in a 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.560
 analysis of our team looking for 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.349
 Duplicate files and fix here already 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.760
 some files start to appear 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.090
 let's let the program do its 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.000
 work in this case I'm going to use so that 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.890
 I do not think the video is too long and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.720
 right away we are again again 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.340
 once you have finished doing the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.230
 search will not come out this little window of 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.450
 the file search has finished 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.610
 let's accept ok we look here already 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.670
 begin to appear files both the 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.870
 unit cc as in the unit then 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.790
 now only what we would have left 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.420
 is to mark in the files that we want 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.250
 that are deleted if we have two files 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.080
 in an 11 and another where we can leave 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 the dt and the tc we can eliminate it and so 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.920
 we will clean the unit in this case to 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.190
 the video tutorial will mark some at 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.050
 chance to make the video as they can be 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.610
 these these two and they were the ones that should 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.530
 give you the option that you set to delete the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.060
 selected below the program to the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.890
 right we give you delete the selected 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.900
 and we will wait for him to do the search 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.910
 of the files that we have marked in the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.200
 duplicate files and the removal of 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.200
 your files 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.950
 we already see what 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.010
 the search of the archives has begun 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.480
 since the percentage and has finished the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.460
 Selected files have been removed 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.210
 correctly then we give to 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.490
 accept and one very important thing not 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.750
 mark the two because without marking you do not 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.450
 will eliminate the two then always 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.130
 leave if you have three leave one the others 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.530
 eliminate them and so what are we going to do 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.930
 it is a file cleaning that we have 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.660
 duplicates in our team if we have 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.980
 the cein we have in so good that 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.020
 space that we have there busy 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.460
 you see that this is super easy 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.500
 small application that they have incorporated to 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.150
 this program very useful at the time of 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.770
 do cleaning on our equipment to 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.940
 better performance good little more nothing 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.760
 remind them that at the end of this video 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.850
 tutorial is to leave the link so they can see 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.230
 the video of how to download it and how 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.750
 use this fantastic program 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.530
 good nothing but a greeting I hope it's 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.790
 of help 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.790
 chao until the next video
