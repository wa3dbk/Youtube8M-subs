do is I recommend making a shortcut to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.670 
do is I recommend making a shortcut to
your<00:00:24.810> flight<00:00:25.170> simulator<00:00:25.650> main<00:00:25.949> folder<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
your flight simulator main folder so you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.019 
your flight simulator main folder so you
don't<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.099> go<00:00:29.220> through<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.519> local<00:00:29.820> disk

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and find it in Program Files and all

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.690 
and find it in Program Files and all
that<00:00:32.850> stuff<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.540> make<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> quick<00:00:33.989> little

that stuff I just make a quick little

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.889 
that stuff I just make a quick little
shortcut<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.059> easy<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.109 
we're going to do is we're going to go
into<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.790> file<00:01:27.409> okay<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.790> file

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
into this file okay so now in this file

last one that you have to worry about is

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.539 
last one that you have to worry about is
the<00:03:34.180> actual<00:03:34.720> background<00:03:35.139> where<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.130> colors

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
the actual background where the colors

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.990 
the actual background where the colors
are<00:03:36.579> I<00:03:37.180> changed<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.079> black<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.859> didn't<00:03:39.760> like

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
are I changed it to black I didn't like

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.449 
are I changed it to black I didn't like
the<00:03:40.269> stock<00:03:40.599> like<00:03:40.930> dark<00:03:41.290> red<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.919> it<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.220> I

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
the stock like dark red that it was I

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.460 
the stock like dark red that it was I
thought<00:03:42.609> it<00:03:42.760> looked<00:03:42.849> kind<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.120> retarded<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.109> I

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
thought it looked kind of retarded so I

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.970 
thought it looked kind of retarded so I
made<00:03:44.919> it<00:03:45.040> black<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.060> that's<00:03:46.209> text<00:03:46.900> BG<00:03:47.530> full<00:03:47.799> so

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
made it black so that's text BG full so

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.490 
made it black so that's text BG full so
that's<00:03:48.130> text<00:03:48.609> background<00:03:48.910> full<00:03:49.599> so<00:03:50.319> that's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
that's text background full so that's

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.670 
that's text background full so that's
the<00:03:50.680> background<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:52.269> numbers<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:53.470> want

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
the background of the numbers you want

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.069 
the background of the numbers you want
to<00:03:53.769> change<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.370> black<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:55.239> did<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.870> looks

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
to change that to black I did it looks

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.110 
to change that to black I did it looks
better<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:57.010> cockpit<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.609> it's<00:03:57.700> easier<00:03:58.060> to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
better in the cockpit and it's easier to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.970 
better in the cockpit and it's easier to
read<00:03:58.419> so<00:03:58.660> that<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:01.000> there<00:04:01.359> is<00:04:01.599> this<00:04:02.380> guy<00:04:02.650> here

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
read so that that there is this guy here

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.759
