00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.350

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.960
 Search Naruto online like many 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.000
 ninjas created by masashi kishimoto was 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.440

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.820
 those that you like the ninjas the 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.640
 origins and all this the truth that is 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.399
 pretty good this figure in particular is 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.460
 a master star peace where Naruto comes out 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.130
 in shippuden modes where they go out to mourning in 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.260
 mode with the orange butane suit and 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.270
 black and good let's proceed to open it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.630
 these figures in the same house than 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.940
 Soro comes with a pedestal although 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.770
 Hold it alone I took it off and like 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.470
 we are not going to have to join the pieces myself 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.860
 I do not hit them but it should be 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.860
 stick 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.550
 to see if we put the hair here better 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.440
 A) Yes 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.350
 good we put the head so that no 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.600
 feel bad the figure is not bad 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.880
 It's quite big, I 'm going to put you now 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.980
 a comparison of two figures that I have 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.150
 the street fighter for you to see 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.130
 you see how my hand is gigantic the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.900
 figure is pretty good in colors and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.520
 of all eyes they have left more 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.480
 clear but I do not know why I like them 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.760
 even more 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.210
 So, this figure is gone 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.190
 slightly glue the hands and give 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.840
 one has a glue there in 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.370
 the arm but I have seen other figures and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.170
 he does not have it so a matter of luck 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.080
