00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.550 
to tickle plenty of paint there's quite
a<00:01:27.649> lot<00:01:27.859> of<00:01:27.889> paint<00:01:28.189> on<00:01:28.310> be<00:01:28.490> hey<00:01:29.270> let's<00:01:30.259> see<00:01:30.380> what

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
a lot of paint on be hey let's see what

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.160 
a lot of paint on be hey let's see what
happens<00:01:30.799> when<00:01:30.859> I<00:01:30.920> hold<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.249> rubber<00:01:31.399> band<00:01:31.670> and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
happens when I hold the rubber band and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.989 
happens when I hold the rubber band and
drag<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.350> up<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.590> canvas<00:01:36.100> makes<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.249> nice<00:01:37.490> thin

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
drag it up the canvas makes a nice thin

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:43.959

line<00:01:40.630> that's<00:01:41.630> all<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.529> so<00:01:42.969> it's

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
line that's all there is to it so it's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.410 
line that's all there is to it so it's
not<00:01:44.029> just<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.659> skill<00:01:45.880> doesn't<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.029> skilled

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
not just the skill doesn't that skilled

range from there to there and it's got

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.160 
range from there to there and it's got
to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.180> somewhere<00:02:27.480> there<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.750> haven't<00:02:27.959> got

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
to be somewhere there you haven't got

to be somewhere there you haven't got
full<00:02:28.410> control<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.160> range<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.550> going

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
full control of what the range is going

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.789 
full control of what the range is going
to<00:02:29.940> look<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:30.780> you're<00:02:30.989> copying<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.470> fan<00:02:31.680> of

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
to look like if you're copying a fan of

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.470 
to look like if you're copying a fan of
breath<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.459> have<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.819> careful<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.360> have

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
breath you have to be careful you have

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.509 
breath you have to be careful you have
to<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> lot<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.049> skill<00:02:34.319> but<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> get<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
to have a lot of skill but to get the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.610 
to have a lot of skill but to get the
brains<00:02:35.760> from<00:02:36.030> there<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:37.080> simply<00:02:37.440> hot

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
brains from there to then you simply hot

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.039 
brains from there to then you simply hot
loosely<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.519> drag<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.690> twist<00:02:39.780> it

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
loosely and drag it up and twist it

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.180 
loosely and drag it up and twist it
around<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.500> move<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.769> over<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.069> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
around and move it over in that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.020 
around and move it over in that
direction<00:02:42.920> what<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.069> prints<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.580> final<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
direction what the prints the final the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.430 
direction what the prints the final the
brains<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.480> gonna<00:02:45.660> look<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.410> no

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
brains is gonna look like you have no

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.180 
brains is gonna look like you have no
idea<00:02:46.620> until<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:48.450> finished<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.739> then<00:02:50.040> if

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
idea until it's finished and then if

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.650 
idea until it's finished and then if
there's<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.430> bit<00:02:50.580> missing<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.239> gives<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.540> an

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
there's a bit missing that gives you an

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.330 
there's a bit missing that gives you an
opportunity<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.319> maybe<00:02:52.620> go<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.010> there<00:02:53.160> and

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
opportunity to maybe go in there and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.250 
opportunity to maybe go in there and
make<00:02:53.489> another<00:02:53.790> piece<00:02:54.060> now<00:02:54.660> you'll<00:02:54.840> notice<00:02:55.049> my

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
make another piece now you'll notice my

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.350 
make another piece now you'll notice my
brush<00:02:55.560> was<00:02:55.769> dirty<00:02:56.160> D<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.910> didn't<00:02:57.209> get<00:02:57.299> a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
dark line okay so the combination of

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
just make the branch go from point A

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.819 
just make the branch go from point A
somewhere<00:03:14.310> near<00:03:14.519> point<00:03:14.970> B<00:03:15.560> reload<00:03:16.560> your<00:03:16.680> brush

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
bare canvas when it's the mail so it's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.650 
bare canvas when it's the mail so it's
just<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.400> matter<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.670> feigning<00:03:48.269> you're<00:03:48.359> playing

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660

just a matter of feigning you're playing
in<00:03:48.810> fact<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.230> cannot<00:03:49.440> move<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.920> on<00:03:50.040> here

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
in fact it cannot move it on here

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.370 
in fact it cannot move it on here
outside<00:03:50.430> now<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.359> can<00:03:51.569> see<00:03:51.810> through<00:03:52.079> it<00:03:52.200> so

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
outside now you can see through it so

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.099 
outside now you can see through it so
the<00:03:52.920> paint<00:03:53.190> needs<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.639> be<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.600> can<00:03:54.750> experiment
