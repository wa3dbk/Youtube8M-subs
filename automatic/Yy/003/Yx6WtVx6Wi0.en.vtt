00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.170
 how can we change his perception of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 taste of food 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.950
 we can quite easily change the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.540
 perception of taste of foods as 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.100
 all perception is something that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 our brain creates and have little influenced 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.039
 what happens and then we all 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.470
 experience 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.180
 I think we all lived moments 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 where we are but not a food can be 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.080
 child and then after we realized that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.250
 finally the taste or perception of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 taste had changed that we liked these 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.160
 foods there it is about learning to the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.260
 to do especially when a person 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.670
 want or not want to like a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.690
 food is often they desire 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.460
 change his diet 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 we know just about everything 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 that we should eat only when 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.870
 a person is at the restaurant by 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.690
 example she's going to order something 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.980
 thing it's not his intellect that will him 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 to choose something or that is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.410
 his body his impulse his envy his 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.430
 desire that will make him make a choice 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 for that you have to change not 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.320
 only taste but the idea of â€‹â€‹taste in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 does if our idea if our perception 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 of the food then changes the taste is going 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.570
 change because a priori we could 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.140
 all liked everything or did not like everything 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.810
 that's still a story 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.159
 of associations of ideas actually often 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.700
 we know that the context plays on our 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.890
 perceptions 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.450
 if you have a very good time 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.759
 with people you love with a 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.880
 music that you like in a good 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.880
 ambience 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.430
 a priori if you eat a dish you 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.110
 do not like it anymore we know for example 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.610
 that the same wine drunk in a goblet 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.939
 plastic is in a good glass in 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.020
 crystal is not going to be quite the same 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.280
 he'll be a little better in the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.829
 crystal glass it's a matter of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.220
 perception to change the taste of 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.140
 food 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.250
 we're going from Saturday and we 're going 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.790
 apply a technique called the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.439
 Sandwich technique is very simple 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.430
 think a superb memory one of 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.500
 best moments of your life 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.659
 got inside remember pictures 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.490
 to remember the sensations of sound 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.530
 people of every detail 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.509
 and when you are completely in his 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.719
 emotions thinking about the food you 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.119
 would like an item that food there 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.880
 his appearance for example remained a few 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.020
 instants on this 10 round food we're going 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.879
 think of our good memories 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.259
 a memory once again very 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.090
 nice can be very different from 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.970
 first 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.810
 remember the smells of the atmospheres 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.269
 once you are inside you 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.310
 think back to the food another detail of 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.280
 this food its texture for example its 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.120
 temperature and you come back in a 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.640
 pleasant memory 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.970
 it's about alternating pleasant memories 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.640
 an element of the souvenir food 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.930
 nice an element of this food there the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.970
 brain after a while we will create a 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.080
 association of ideas between all that at 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.790
 after a while thought about this food 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.849
 will bring you a sense of pleasure from 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.080
 smile will feel good the question 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.579
 we can ask ourselves after doing that 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.170
 when will you get so much 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.480
 of curiosity about this food 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.680
 that would be almost unpleasant 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.829
 frustrating not to taste it all from 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.829
 after
