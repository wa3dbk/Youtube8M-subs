00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
welcome to the best Keurig hack of all

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.500 
welcome to the best Keurig hack of all
I've<00:00:07.170> been<00:00:07.230> using<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:07.919> method<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.880> about<00:00:09.480> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
I've been using this method for about a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.799 
I've been using this method for about a
month<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.260> before<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.420> as<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> permanent

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
month and before that as a permanent

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.200 
month and before that as a permanent
hack<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.950> before<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.549> used<00:00:14.759> it

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
hack and before that I used it

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.150 
hack and before that I used it
occasionally<00:00:17.510> the<00:00:18.510> method<00:00:18.930> uses<00:00:19.320> no<00:00:19.619> magnets

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
occasionally the method uses no magnets

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.109 
occasionally the method uses no magnets
and<00:00:20.430> no<00:00:21.000> k<00:00:21.330> carafe<00:00:21.750> inserts<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.820> unlocks<00:00:23.820> all

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and no k carafe inserts and unlocks all

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.859 
and no k carafe inserts and unlocks all
the<00:00:24.510> features<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.859> device<00:00:26.869> once

the features of the device once

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
the features of the device once
implemented<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.039> get<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> full<00:00:29.609> menu<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
implemented you get the full menu and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.790 
implemented you get the full menu and
it's<00:00:30.720> permanent<00:00:31.380> until<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> remove<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:33.800> now

Keurig Vue is a machine that was

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.930 
Keurig Vue is a machine that was
released<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> United<00:00:51.270> States<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:52.469> Canada

and<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.360> really<00:00:54.660> didn't<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.050> very<00:00:55.079> well<00:00:55.410> because

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and I really didn't do very well because

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.139 
and I really didn't do very well because
it<00:00:56.100> wasn't<00:00:56.579> compatible<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> K<00:00:58.170> Cups

it wasn't compatible with the K Cups
this<00:01:00.149> Curie<00:01:00.480> 2.0<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.010> combines<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this Curie 2.0 really just combines the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.560 
this Curie 2.0 really just combines the
features<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:04.080> both<00:01:04.830> systems<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.670> k-cup<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
features of both systems a k-cup and the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.429 
features of both systems a k-cup and the
view<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:08.030> as<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.270> said<00:01:09.510> there's<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.200> views

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439

can buy some view cups online that are

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.010 
can buy some view cups online that are
now<00:01:20.580> able<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.780> brewed<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> machine

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
now able to be brewed in this machine

now able to be brewed in this machine
the<00:01:25.020> best<00:01:25.320> feature<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.430> opinion<00:01:26.460> about<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the best feature in my opinion about the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
the best feature in my opinion about the
expanded<00:01:27.930> menu<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> brewer<00:01:29.250> heats

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
expanded menu is that the brewer heats

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.929 
expanded menu is that the brewer heats
the<00:01:30.329> water<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> higher<00:01:31.439> temperature<00:01:31.939> making

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the water to a higher temperature making

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
the water to a higher temperature making
for<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> hotter<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.079> taste<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.710> two<00:01:34.979> cup<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
for a hotter and taste your two cup of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.819 
for a hotter and taste your two cup of
coffee<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.780> people<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.650> bigger

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
coffee that people like it for bigger

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.690 
coffee that people like it for bigger
sizes<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:39.630> bigger<00:01:40.259> sized<00:01:40.590> cup<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
sizes a bigger sized cup I like it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.030 
sizes a bigger sized cup I like it
because<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.270> actually<00:01:42.840> heats<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:44.009> water

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
because it actually heats the water

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.719 
because it actually heats the water
hotter<00:01:45.530> now<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.740> order<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> implement<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
hotter now in order to implement the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.039 
hotter now in order to implement the
hack<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.360> will<00:01:48.509> need<00:01:49.220> tape<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
hack you will need tape so I have a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
hack you will need tape so I have a
gorilla<00:01:52.619> branded<00:01:53.220> tape<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:54.030> strong

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
gorilla branded tape it's pretty strong

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.639 
gorilla branded tape it's pretty strong
it's<00:01:55.640> not<00:01:56.640> quite<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> duct<00:01:57.479> tape<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
it's not quite a duct tape but it's a it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.980 
it's not quite a duct tape but it's a it
is<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.280> pretty<00:02:00.119> strong<00:02:00.450> tape<00:02:02.780> you'll<00:02:03.780> need<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
is a pretty strong tape you'll need a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.740 
is a pretty strong tape you'll need a
piece<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> white<00:02:04.829> scrap<00:02:05.340> paper<00:02:05.700> any<00:02:06.119> white

piece of white scrap paper any white
scrap<00:02:07.110> paper<00:02:07.380> will<00:02:07.649> do

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.070 

and<00:02:12.209> you'll<00:02:12.360> also<00:02:12.569> need<00:02:13.040> something<00:02:14.040> called<00:02:14.340> a

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and you'll also need something called a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.309 
and you'll also need something called a
Sharpie<00:02:16.220> yellow<00:02:17.330> neon<00:02:18.500> marker<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.050> key

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
Sharpie yellow neon marker now the key

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.500 
Sharpie yellow neon marker now the key
to<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.620> trick<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.340> actually<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.060> yellow

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
to this trick is actually the yellow

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.259 
to this trick is actually the yellow
neon<00:02:24.840> marker<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.010> won't<00:02:26.340> work<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.819> any<00:02:27.030> other

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
neon marker it won't work with any other

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.009 
neon marker it won't work with any other
sharpie

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
sharpie

other<00:02:28.410> than<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.950> neon<00:02:29.310> one<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:31.680> know

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
other than the neon one and you know

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.710 
other than the neon one and you know
really<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.310> neon<00:02:32.790> marker<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.540> neon

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
really the neon marker of this neon

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.630 
really the neon marker of this neon
marker<00:02:34.110> fluoresce<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.739> under<00:02:35.010> backlight

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
marker fluoresce is under backlight

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.150 
marker fluoresce is under backlight
which<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.840> understand<00:02:37.379> is<00:02:37.500> similar<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.010> how

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
which as I understand is similar to how

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.080 
which as I understand is similar to how
the<00:02:38.220> ink<00:02:38.610> embedded<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> k-cup<00:02:39.930> foil<00:02:40.590> works

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
the ink embedded in the k-cup foil works

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.890 
the ink embedded in the k-cup foil works
and<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.510> also<00:02:42.690> find<00:02:43.049> other<00:02:43.290> fluorescent

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
and you can also find other fluorescent

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.100 
and you can also find other fluorescent
markers<00:02:46.250> at<00:02:47.250> places<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.760> stables<00:02:48.390> or<00:02:48.599> online

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
markers at places like stables or online

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.380 
markers at places like stables or online
I<00:02:49.440> don't<00:02:50.069> know<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:50.519> they<00:02:50.700> work<00:02:50.910> I've<00:02:51.150> only

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
I don't know if they work I've only

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.789 
I don't know if they work I've only
tried<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.720> with<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.930> Sharpie<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.650> that's

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
tried it with the Sharpie and that's

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.530 
tried it with the Sharpie and that's
primarily<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.790> was<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.060> cheapest

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
primarily because it was the cheapest

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.680 
primarily because it was the cheapest
one<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.760> also<00:02:56.760> don't<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.390> any<00:02:57.599> other

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
one I also don't know of any other

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.559 
one I also don't know of any other
colors<00:02:58.379> work<00:02:58.650> other<00:02:58.950> than<00:02:59.220> yellow<00:02:59.579> you<00:03:00.420> could

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
colors work other than yellow you could

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.520 
colors work other than yellow you could
certainly<00:03:00.810> try<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.480> what<00:03:03.840> we're<00:03:04.019> going<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.200> do

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
certainly try so what we're going to do

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.430 
certainly try so what we're going to do
is<00:03:04.860> we're<00:03:05.280> actually<00:03:05.519> going<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.239> start<00:03:06.629> by

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
is we're actually going to start by

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.210 
is we're actually going to start by
taking<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.069> tape<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.019> cutting<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.230> piece<00:03:11.010> of

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
taking the tape and cutting a piece of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.470 
taking the tape and cutting a piece of
tape<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.629> size<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.470> will<00:03:14.129> cover<00:03:14.549> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
tape to the size that will cover the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.870 
tape to the size that will cover the
entire<00:03:17.120> opening<00:03:18.120> where<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.049> sensor<00:03:19.880> senses

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
entire opening where the sensor senses

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.819 
entire opening where the sensor senses
the<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:22.470> foil<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.150> machine<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.650> will

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
the the foil in the machine so I will

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:33.640 
the the foil in the machine so I will
cut<00:03:26.569> over<00:03:27.569> here<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:31.099> now<00:03:32.099> I<00:03:32.160> have<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.519> piece<00:03:32.910> of

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
cut over here and now I have a piece of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.830 
cut over here and now I have a piece of
tape<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.950> size<00:03:35.209> I'm<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.420> going<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.630> put<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
tape this size I'm just going to put it

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.490 
tape this size I'm just going to put it
down<00:03:36.989> over<00:03:37.139> here<00:03:40.069> now<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.130> will<00:03:41.430> take<00:03:41.700> my<00:03:41.970> paper

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
down over here now I will take my paper

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.509 
down over here now I will take my paper
and<00:03:43.849> a<00:03:44.849> sharpie<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:46.650> will<00:03:46.950> color<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:49.519> portion

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
and a sharpie and I will color a portion

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.220 
and a sharpie and I will color a portion
of<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.359> paper<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:54.060> amount<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.510> color<00:03:54.810> is

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
of the paper and the amount of color is

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.020 
of the paper and the amount of color is
really<00:03:55.560> manned<00:03:56.010> again<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:57.359> cover<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.489> the

really manned again to cover and and the
entire<00:04:01.069> portion<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.819> sensor<00:04:04.519> opening

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
entire portion of the sensor opening

inside the machine where the Machine
reads<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.849> sensor<00:04:09.329> now<00:04:10.049> if<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.380> don't<00:04:10.470> know

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
reads the sensor now if you don't know

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.470 
reads the sensor now if you don't know
where<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:10.889> is<00:04:11.040> most<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.700> other<00:04:11.760> hacks<00:04:12.150> show

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
where that is most the other hacks show

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.300 
where that is most the other hacks show
it<00:04:12.720> most<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.470> other<00:04:13.530> hacks<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:13.980> see<00:04:14.160> online

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
it most the other hacks you see online

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.690 
it most the other hacks you see online
involve<00:04:14.970> cutting<00:04:15.329> off<00:04:15.660> some<00:04:15.959> type<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.700> piece

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
involve cutting off some type of a piece

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.350 
involve cutting off some type of a piece
of<00:04:17.910> cake<00:04:18.150> up<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:19.380> tried<00:04:20.340> those<00:04:20.609> but

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
of cake up I tried those but

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.170 
of cake up I tried those but
what<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> didn't<00:04:23.840> do<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.379> get<00:04:25.310> access<00:04:25.819> to<00:04:25.849> the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
what it didn't do is get access to the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.240 
what it didn't do is get access to the
better<00:04:26.389> menu<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.050> that's<00:04:27.620> what<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.830> wanted

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
better menu and that's what I wanted

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.939 
better menu and that's what I wanted
without<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.610> magnet<00:04:29.150> but<00:04:30.050> it's<00:04:30.319> certainly<00:04:30.710> if

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
without a magnet but it's certainly if

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.040 
without a magnet but it's certainly if
you<00:04:31.039> don't<00:04:31.219> have<00:04:31.340> magnets<00:04:31.819> at<00:04:31.939> home<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.389> sharpie

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
you don't have magnets at home a sharpie

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.760 
you don't have magnets at home a sharpie
cost<00:04:33.949> a<00:04:34.129> lot<00:04:34.340> less<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:35.030> buying<00:04:35.689> a<00:04:35.870> magnet<00:04:36.319> so

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
cost a lot less and buying a magnet so

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.649 
cost a lot less and buying a magnet so
I've<00:04:37.009> now<00:04:37.219> colored<00:04:37.669> in<00:04:37.879> this<00:04:38.180> corner<00:04:38.629> over

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
I've now colored in this corner over

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.350 
I've now colored in this corner over
here<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.349> I<00:04:40.039> just<00:04:40.400> cut<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:40.669> I'm<00:04:40.909> going<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.150> cut

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
here and I just cut it I'm going to cut

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.330 
here and I just cut it I'm going to cut
the<00:04:41.539> rest<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.939> I'm<00:04:46.939> going<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.419> take<00:04:47.719> it<00:04:47.960> and

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
the rest and I'm going to take it and

the rest and I'm going to take it and
I'm<00:04:49.340> going<00:04:49.699> to<00:04:49.819> place<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:52.180> on<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.810> tape<00:04:59.199> right

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
I'm going to place it on the tape right

I'm going to place it on the tape right
over<00:05:00.440> here<00:05:02.050> doesn't<00:05:03.050> need<00:05:03.139> to<00:05:03.229> be<00:05:03.349> perfect<00:05:03.620> but

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
over here doesn't need to be perfect but

what I what I want is to be able to put
this<00:05:08.030> up<00:05:08.560> over<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.740> actual<00:05:10.159> sensor<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.840> that

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
this up over the actual sensor so that

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.059 
this up over the actual sensor so that
we<00:05:12.139> can<00:05:12.430> brew<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.289> sensor<00:05:15.710> reads

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
we can brew a so that the sensor reads
