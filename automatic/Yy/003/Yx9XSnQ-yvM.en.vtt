00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
so that is really great you don't need
to<00:01:30.630> worry<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.810> taking<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.409> case<00:01:31.619> off<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to worry about taking your case off and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
to worry about taking your case off and
that's<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.430> huge<00:01:32.759> advantage<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.570> over

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that's one huge advantage I see over

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
that's one huge advantage I see over
apple's<00:01:34.560> doc<00:01:34.860> now<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.299> easy<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.750> use

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
apple's doc now it is really easy to use

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
apple's doc now it is really easy to use
wallets<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> stand<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.159> still<00:01:38.460> totally

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
wallets in the stand it's still totally

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
wallets in the stand it's still totally
usable<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.020> wobbly<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.680> all<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.159> some

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
usable it's not wobbly at all like some

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.889 
usable it's not wobbly at all like some
other<00:01:41.490> stands<00:01:41.820> I've<00:01:42.000> seen<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> does<00:01:42.869> work

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

facetiming everything like that so one

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.710 
facetiming everything like that so one
thing<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.610> did<00:01:53.850> notice<00:01:53.880> while<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> stand

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
thing I did notice while the stand

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
thing I did notice while the stand
wasn't<00:01:55.049> too<00:01:55.170> wobbly<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.219> phones<00:01:56.820> sometimes

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
wasn't too wobbly the phones sometimes

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.719 
wasn't too wobbly the phones sometimes
moved<00:01:57.840> around<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.950> way<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.219> solving<00:01:59.430> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
moved around but a way of solving that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
moved around but a way of solving that
is<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> make<00:02:00.360> sure<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.899> cable

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
is just to make sure you have that cable

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.899 
is just to make sure you have that cable
plugged<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> bottom<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.700> not

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
plugged in the bottom there if it's not

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.700 
plugged in the bottom there if it's not
plugged<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.750> too<00:02:03.960> big<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.290> deal<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
plugged in it's not too big of a deal it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
plugged in it's not too big of a deal it
does<00:02:05.189> kind<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.490> move<00:02:05.670> around<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.240> but

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
does kind of move around a little but

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.050 
does kind of move around a little but
when<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.409> cable<00:02:08.369> plugged<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
when you have that cable plugged in it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.710 
when you have that cable plugged in it
kind<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.330> acts

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
kind of acts

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
kind of acts
like<00:02:09.780> an<00:02:09.930> anchor<00:02:10.170> point<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.800> keeps<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.190> from

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
like an anchor point and keeps it from

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.420 
like an anchor point and keeps it from
moving<00:02:11.520> around<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.470> said<00:02:13.530> earlier<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
moving around so like I said earlier the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.850 
moving around so like I said earlier the
