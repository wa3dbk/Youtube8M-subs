 in movies on television in pubs 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.679
 and in the clips the hip hop was born at the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.929
 late 70s in the black ghetto 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.300
 new york is at the origin of this dance 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.420
 protesters there is the figure circle 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.439
 ancestral communication to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.470
 inside the circle 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.130
 the dancers this challenge are gauging themselves 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.060
 compete in a real 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.460
 conversation 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.730
 the base is the circle even before the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.739
 competition is the circle has 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.710
 totally free that's what happened 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.480
 writes Dutch style in total freedom 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.670
 so we try to be at the actions 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.470
 the adequacy with the atmosphere with the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.839
 dynamic with music with people 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.290
 who surround us and we free ourselves 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.290
 totally releases 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.559
 this quest for the graal encounter and 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.359
 changes in the circle is perpetuated 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.760
 today with the phenomenon of 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.600
 true drummers declination to great 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.259

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.310
 drummers that started both 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.680

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.320
 let's take pure dance without concession and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.420
 fight to impose their own 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.890
 artistic language and try to integrate 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.690
 the closed circle of creation 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.640
 contemporary needs a new wave of 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.149

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.520
 season where the intensity of the effort 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.930
 physical and the rage of conquering rubs shoulders 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.170
 thanks and the inventiveness of the work 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.170
