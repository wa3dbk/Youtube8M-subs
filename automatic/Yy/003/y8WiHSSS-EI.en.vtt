what<00:01:55.409> I'm<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> move<00:01:56.070> into<00:01:56.280> next<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.030> was

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
what I'm going to move into next I was

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
what I'm going to move into next I was
watching<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.140> videos<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
watching one of my little videos that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
watching one of my little videos that
talked<00:01:59.729> about<00:01:59.909> using<00:02:00.060> cream<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.049> over<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
talked about using cream all over the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.770 
talked about using cream all over the
lid<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.430> maybe<00:02:02.909> i<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.180> move<00:02:03.450> into<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
lid and so maybe i will move into that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.030 
lid and so maybe i will move into that
next<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
next and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980

this<00:02:38.070> honestly<00:02:38.520> isn't<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.180> fast<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.630> I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
this honestly isn't going as fast as I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.850 
this honestly isn't going as fast as I
thought<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.350> really<00:02:40.680> thought<00:02:40.800> it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
thought it would I really thought it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.260 
thought it would I really thought it
would<00:02:41.040> go<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> lot<00:02:41.310> quicker<00:02:41.370> than<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.880> has<00:02:42.030> been

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
would go a lot quicker than it has been

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.120 
would go a lot quicker than it has been
and<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.959> been<00:02:43.080> kind<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.560> little<00:02:44.040> bit

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
and it's just been kind of a little bit

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.170 
and it's just been kind of a little bit
disappointing<00:02:44.580> because<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.850> hasn't<00:02:44.970> been

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
disappointing because it hasn't been

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.420 
disappointing because it hasn't been
going<00:02:45.300> as<00:02:45.570> fast<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.050> hoped<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.530> would<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.980> um

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
going as fast as I hoped it would so um

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.210 
going as fast as I hoped it would so um
yeah<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.750> that's<00:02:48.930> where<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.140> am<00:02:49.380> hopefully<00:02:49.950> next

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
yeah so that's where I am hopefully next
