00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.250
 moin moin her extraterrestrial so not 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.569
 wonder moin moin one says with us stop 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.950
 even so is a welcome 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.650
 I somehow have a rare one 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.170
 bird mimicking or so to the blue 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.700
 black ostfriesland not too 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.250
 confused with the gold white east 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.170
 Fiesling that is his opponent so 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.230
 evolutionarily, it also has to be 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.029
 Father yes, the East Frisians have funny 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.320
 Relationships but me 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.650
 digress I had a topic 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.779
 concocted eight it and accept it never 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 get already during the shoot 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.430
 the advertising revenue of the video at the same time 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.760
 is paid out and how cartridge or 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 so at the time money money 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 For aliens, no idea why 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.969
 but apparently also look here on the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.289
 earth people these videos speak to me 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.719
 then always on and say that's full of 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.910
 funny idea is and no idea if the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.949
 the practical use behind the format 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.750
 do not understand or think that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.969
 I also like this youtube dumbest 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.969
 kiddies, these are talking to your camera 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.739
 I'm the only one in the world 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.640
 intergalactic diplomat actually 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.570
 Now , of course, nature is a few 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 these people definitely have 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.570
 I should tell you some money 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.189
 and that's actually pretty 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.439
 After all, that's a good idea 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.020
 this invention that drives us 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.540
 make us and at the same time makes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.689
 which unites and splits us at the same time 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.640
 so money where do we start from there 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.020
 So people are working so the whole day 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.460
 Working means that we work for our 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.210
 ensure survival and if possible 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.890
 comfortable 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 but sometime has a smart man 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 he did not realize that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.770
 his ball at the same time and his horse 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.100
 as a sheep and take care of his family 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.380
 can 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.880
 He was supposed to be a man with the horse 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 not at the same time his 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.409
 There were others in the family 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.360
 falls in quite remote areas and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.860
 That's why work has come and gone 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.899
 specialized and then stop with 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.880
 others swapped the other work 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.829
 you have to do that but you have to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.450
 of course somehow balance because so 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.520
 a cow he too much more work than 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.719
 You only have to have a sheep team 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.119
 feed and shave 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.450
 you have to feed our cows kuli and 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.950
 measure and report and paint purple and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.659
 that's something you have to compensate somehow 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.860
 That's why you often have money 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.569
 So it was agreed 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.250
 agreed that you completely worthless paper 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930
 seems 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.910
 to have a certain value for all 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.350
 same and that one then exchanges 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.570
 city ​​so crooked work 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.220
 to set off against each other and that's the way it is 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.840
 too much work was the thought 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.410
 actually quite a lot at the beginning 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.150
 work a lot of money little work little money 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.670
 only now are a few 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.850
 more factors come in there 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.740
 old sex reach is one 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.240
 apple on the product or not there was 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.100
 then many smart people are in the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.480
 after thought, what have you done 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.940
 money is actually and how it is 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 works for example this marx 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.570
 he did that for so long until he got the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.489
 German market named after him 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.440
 moment is I have to join 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.510
 wikipedia nachgucken today is money 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.989
 one of the main goals of many 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.550
 People 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.320
 I think that's because of that 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.300
 also as a number that can represent it 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.980
 Many would prefer to say it though 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.840
 a lot i would like to experience a lot or 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340
 I want to be happy when you do that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.020
 problem is yes you never know if you do that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.910
 you have reached with money you can 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.520
 Put brands and it works too 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.989
 always upwards plus plus luck 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.459
 You never know when you have reached and 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.680
 you can not compare it either 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.239
 you never know if you have more luck than 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.220
 the neighbors that is relative to us 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.320
 important that makes money in any case 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.570
 easier the rest rather heavy 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.040
 especially if you have no money 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.170
 You never had enough for so long 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.870
 others still have weird clocks 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.180
 how true is that with you? 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.530
 you also experience your money freely or so 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.180
 did you try that but it did not 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.769
 worked and it is not somehow one 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.600
 weird world in money critical 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.980
 books are sold for money 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.630
 How is it with you? 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.100
 little jealous of our idea or 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.110
 we laugh for us 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.220
 still messing with money is you see 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.739
 Maybe that's us 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.880
 frankenstein are and the money is ours 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.900
 monsters and how have the control 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.519
 just completely lost 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.630
 she likes to send me the answers 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.730
 with a little bit of yours 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.269
 intergalactic money on my 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.370
 P.O. Box 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.660
 For example, do not forget the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.250
 address also earth with purely to look 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.970
 I have the feeling of my whole fan post 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.320
 suffers so far only on jupiter moin 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.860
 moin, I think so too 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.860
 say goodbye
