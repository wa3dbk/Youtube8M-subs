00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 the shadoks had solved their problem 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.939
 cultural thanks to the toubel computer 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.710
 the computer was a reasonable animal 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.320
 composed of a soft part of a part 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:32.410
 hard and who lived in the fields all 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.489
 in the mornings he gave his 6 to 7 liters 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.390
 of knowledge cream it was from the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.179
 knowledge guaranteed 0% of material 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.039
 cultural and cerebral obviously 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.460
 since the shadoks did not want 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.339
 too eager on that side 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.109
 the computer cats blogs in principle 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.289
 to rely on two logical bases 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.850
 the first served him to rest the 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.050
 second was hypothetical and he 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.730
 used to make calculations 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.309
 these calculations were made according to the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.530
 so-called method of calculating teachers david 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.380
 added when asked is a 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.490
 addition of more 2 for example it 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.440
 replied that the more likely it is 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.230
 do something there is a chance 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.390
 on two it's 33 and a chance 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.160
 on purpose that it does anything 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.170
 else from zero to infinity counts if we 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000
 asked them to calculate a chance 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.660
 on purpose he answered according to the same 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.280
 principle that a lesson on purpose we had 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.440
 a chance in two to face a sauce of 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.740
 take 3 and a chance on purpose that it 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.910
 do anything we called that the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.650
 uncertainty principle 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.460
 because there was one thing we 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.200
 was sure it was wrong 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.000
 or if it was just it was 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.250
 really by chance or that there was a 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 error somewhere he was also providing 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.240
 of the informal logic of the genre all 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.140
 the cats are deadly socrates is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 deadly so Socrates is a cat that does not 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.720
 did not do so much to shadoks 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.700
 socrates by the way but that 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.569
 was coming out of the computer and it's she 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.569
 inherited 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.640
 besides the shadow that did not have 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.540
 interest to say the opposite 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.000
 that computer took charge started to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.739
 spend longvic the cat to get this 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.250
 is not twice and besides that it him 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.870
 learn politeness that's how the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.630
 cat of oc bin computers that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.570
 did not become the depositary of the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.750
 shadoks principles the most sacred top 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:50.910
 of reason and know everything from the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.910
 wisdom and household arts
