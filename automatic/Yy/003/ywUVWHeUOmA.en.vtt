that the three be three space off
playlist<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.009> modern<00:00:14.340> warfare<00:00:14.460> 3<00:00:14.610> has

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
playlist and modern warfare 3 has

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.880 
playlist and modern warfare 3 has
officially<00:00:15.509> been<00:00:15.660> hacked<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.350> right<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.740> as

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
officially been hacked all right just as

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.830 
officially been hacked all right just as
proof<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.910> guys<00:00:18.029> don't<00:00:18.390> believe<00:00:18.630> me

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
proof so if you guys don't believe me

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290 
proof so if you guys don't believe me
this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.439> obviously<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.279> public<00:00:20.760> magic<00:00:21.119> because

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
this is obviously a public magic because

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
this is obviously a public magic because
when<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> kill<00:00:22.050> yellow<00:00:22.470> letters<00:00:22.830> will

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
when I get a kill yellow letters will

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.450 
when I get a kill yellow letters will
pop<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.519> um<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.810> wasn't<00:00:25.350> yellow<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.279> would

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
pop up um if it wasn't yellow it would

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.339 
pop up um if it wasn't yellow it would
be<00:00:26.580> grey<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.240> green<00:00:27.330> mean<00:00:27.599> since<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.960> private

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
be grey and green mean since in private

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
be grey and green mean since in private
match<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.769> yellow<00:00:29.130> means<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.490> online<00:00:30.119> so

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
match and yellow means this online so

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.720 
match and yellow means this online so
yeah<00:00:31.320> that's<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> proof<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.579> definitely

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
yeah that's the proof this is definitely

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
yeah that's the proof this is definitely
online<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.480> private<00:00:33.840> match<00:00:33.989> just<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
online not private match just so you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.350 
online not private match just so you
guys<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.890> access'<00:00:35.430> know<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> like

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
guys know access' know some of you like

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.410 
guys know access' know some of you like

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
oh my gosh you're such a liar this is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.260 
oh my gosh you're such a liar this is
private<00:00:39.780> match<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.739> such<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> noob<00:00:41.399> but

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
private match you're such a noob but

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
private match you're such a noob but
yeah<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.660> definitely<00:00:42.870> definitely<00:00:43.770> public

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
yeah it's definitely definitely public

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.119 
yeah it's definitely definitely public
match<00:00:44.750> lo<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.780> behold<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.320> joined<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.860> game

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
match lo and behold I joined a game

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.840 
match lo and behold I joined a game
earlier<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.190> hacked<00:00:50.550> now

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
earlier and it actually is hacked now

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.350 
earlier and it actually is hacked now
apparently<00:00:51.480> people<00:00:52.110> turn<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.559> ground<00:00:52.920> war

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
apparently people turn into ground war

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
apparently people turn into ground war
it's<00:00:54.360> 9v9<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> ground<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> erosion<00:00:56.579> which

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it's 9v9 on a ground and erosion which

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
it's 9v9 on a ground and erosion which
are<00:00:57.000> both<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.539> small<00:00:57.899> math<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> sucks

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
are both really small math so it sucks

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
are both really small math so it sucks
because<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.550> spawning<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.090> front<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
because you're just spawning in front of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
because you're just spawning in front of
people<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.600> spawning<00:01:00.899> behind<00:01:01.260> them<00:01:01.440> they're

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
people and spawning behind them they're

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.560 
people and spawning behind them they're
pretty<00:01:02.190> much<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.489> boosting<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.449> they

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
pretty much is boosting because if they

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.969 
pretty much is boosting because if they
get<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> corner<00:01:04.229> they're<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
get in the corner they're just going to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
get in the corner they're just going to
be<00:01:05.070> able<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.430> spawn<00:01:05.820> kill<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.510> days

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
be able to spawn kill you for days

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.390 
be able to spawn kill you for days
you're<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.890> able<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.250> out

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you're not going to be able to get out

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.649 
you're not going to be able to get out
and<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.090> annoying<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and it's just really annoying and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
and it's just really annoying and
frustrating<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.200> people<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.530> hack<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
frustrating that people would hack the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.600 
frustrating that people would hack the

of modern warfare 2 with the ground war
domination<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:19.200> rust<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.820> much<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
domination on rust it's pretty much the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.260 
domination on rust it's pretty much the
exact<00:01:21.540> same<00:01:21.750> thing<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.549> annoying<00:01:23.909> I
