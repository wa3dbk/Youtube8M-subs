00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
analysis psychoanalysis not so much and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.330 
analysis psychoanalysis not so much and
what's<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.200> family<00:03:34.500> making<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.890> all<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.190> how

ultimately<00:03:37.760> their<00:03:38.760> belief<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.209> grounded<00:03:39.630> in

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
ultimately their belief is grounded in

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.110 
ultimately their belief is grounded in
God<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.860> there<00:03:41.070> their<00:03:41.400> hope<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.940> God

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
God and so there their hope is in God

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.470 
and you know I think that they're hoping
that<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> court<00:03:44.670> system<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.030> going<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.299> get<00:03:45.390> it

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
that the court system is going to get it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.259
