be showing you the three strongest

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.520 
be showing you the three strongest
blocks<00:00:09.900> or<00:00:10.400> elements<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.580> all<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.530> Minecraft

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
blocks or elements in all of Minecraft

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.220 
blocks or elements in all of Minecraft
so<00:00:13.769> number<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.420> block<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.690> diamonds

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
so number one is the block of diamonds

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.130 
so number one is the block of diamonds
so<00:00:16.520> this<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.730> really<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.480> hard<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.960> break

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
so this is really like hard to break

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.990 
so this is really like hard to break
it's<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.590> extremely<00:00:19.859> hard<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> break<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.580> um

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
it's very extremely hard to break so um

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
it's very extremely hard to break so um
we're<00:00:21.539> gonna<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.779> showing<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.170> long<00:00:22.740> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
we're gonna be showing you how long it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560 
we're gonna be showing you how long it
takes<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.250> break<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.789> better<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.060> suppose<00:00:24.480> I

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
takes to break it so better I suppose I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.029 
takes to break it so better I suppose I
say<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.289> gonna<00:00:25.380> start<00:00:25.619> breaking<00:00:25.830> it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
say go but it's gonna start breaking it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.580 
say go but it's gonna start breaking it
and<00:00:26.160> I'm<00:00:26.849> gonna<00:00:26.939> start<00:00:27.119> counting<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:28.439> it

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and I'm gonna start counting and if it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.019 
and I'm gonna start counting and if it
takes<00:00:28.740> longer<00:00:29.039> than<00:00:29.160> 30<00:00:29.429> seconds<00:00:29.730> we're<00:00:29.880> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
takes longer than 30 seconds we're just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:45.760 
takes longer than 30 seconds we're just
gonna<00:00:30.119> stop<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.199> 3<00:00:31.700> 2<00:00:32.700> 1<00:00:33.660> go<00:00:34.230> 1<00:00:35.809> 2<00:00:36.809> 3<00:00:38.390> 4<00:00:39.559> 5<00:00:40.879> 6<00:00:42.020> 7<00:00:43.020> 8<00:00:43.670> 9

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
gonna stop so 3 2 1 go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:59.650 
gonna stop so 3 2 1 go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10<00:00:46.770> 11<00:00:48.170> 12<00:00:49.170> 13<00:00:49.850> 14<00:00:51.559> 15<00:00:52.699> 16<00:00:53.699> 17<00:00:54.379> 18<00:00:56.120> 19<00:00:57.120> 20<00:00:57.690> 21<00:00:58.559> 22

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.099 
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
Oh

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
Oh

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
Oh
so<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.500> takes<00:01:01.680> about<00:01:01.829> 22<00:01:02.280> seconds<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.760> break

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
so it takes about 22 seconds to break

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.100 
so it takes about 22 seconds to break
with<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.180> hand<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.840> actually

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
with your hand so which is actually

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.550 
with your hand so which is actually
pretty<00:01:04.320> long<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.799> pretty<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.880> tiring<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pretty long and pretty like tiring so

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
pretty long and pretty like tiring so

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
extremely hard to break what take my

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.250 
extremely hard to break what take my
hand<00:02:24.650> cuz<00:02:25.489> it's<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.450> he<00:02:26.599> said<00:02:26.780> it's<00:02:26.959> like

one<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.590> only<00:02:27.709> ways<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.129> break<00:02:28.250> is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
one of the only ways you can break is

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.809 
one of the only ways you can break is
with<00:02:28.670> uh<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:29.120> think<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.900> was<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.400> diamond<00:02:31.400> pickaxe

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
with uh I think it was a diamond pickaxe

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.089 
with uh I think it was a diamond pickaxe
alright<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.019> yeah<00:02:33.230> that's<00:02:33.440> that's<00:02:33.680> number

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
alright so yeah that's that's number

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.610 
alright so yeah that's that's number
that's<00:02:34.519> number<00:02:34.730> two<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.569> number<00:02:35.599> three<00:02:36.470> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
that's number two and number three the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.240 
that's number two and number three the
hardest<00:02:37.010> element<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.610> bedrock<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.920> reason

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
hardest element is bedrock so the reason

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.650 
hardest element is bedrock so the reason
this<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> hardest<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.879> because<00:02:41.180> if<00:02:41.480> you

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
this is the hardest is because if you

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.559 
this is the hardest is because if you
are<00:02:41.690> if<00:02:42.379> you<00:02:42.560> go<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.220> if<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.060> go<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.299> crap

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
are if you go on the if you go on crap

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.740 
are if you go on the if you go on crap

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
on what's this it says this cannot be

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.080 
on what's this it says this cannot be
broken<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> we're<00:02:52.220> gonna<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.459> seeing<00:02:52.640> if<00:02:52.910> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
broken so we're gonna be seeing if it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.600 
broken so we're gonna be seeing if it
can<00:02:53.120> be<00:02:53.480> broken<00:02:53.780> or<00:02:53.870> not<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.980> within<00:02:55.430> 30

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
hardest is hardest one to break it's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.490 
hardest is hardest one to break it's
another<00:03:32.329> one<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.690> can't<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:32.989> broken<00:03:33.319> up

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
another one it can't be broken up

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.140 
another one it can't be broken up
sitting<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.190> be<00:03:34.310> broken<00:03:34.639> but<00:03:34.790> with<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
sitting in it can be broken but with the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.440 
sitting in it can be broken but with the
diamond<00:03:36.079> pickaxe<00:03:36.549> by<00:03:37.549> hand<00:03:37.790> it's<00:03:38.120> pretty<00:03:38.389> much

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
diamond pickaxe by hand it's pretty much

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.360 
diamond pickaxe by hand it's pretty much
almost<00:03:38.690> pretty<00:03:38.959> much<00:03:39.079> impossible<00:03:39.349> but<00:03:40.160> Rock

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
almost pretty much impossible but Rock

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.379 
almost pretty much impossible but Rock
can't<00:03:40.609> be<00:03:40.700> broken<00:03:40.970> by<00:03:41.060> anything<00:03:41.420> ever<00:03:42.109> ever<00:03:43.389> so

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
can't be broken by anything ever ever so

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.210 
can't be broken by anything ever ever so
yeah<00:03:44.630> those<00:03:44.810> are<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.019> three<00:03:45.290> hardest<00:03:45.470> blocks

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
yeah those are the three hardest blocks

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.819 
yeah those are the three hardest blocks
her<00:03:46.430> elements<00:03:47.019> well<00:03:48.019> let's<00:03:48.200> go<00:03:48.590> through<00:03:48.769> them

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
her elements well let's go through them

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.099 
her elements well let's go through them
again<00:03:49.069> diamonds<00:03:49.870> obsidian<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.049> bedrock<00:03:51.709> and

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
again diamonds obsidian and bedrock and
