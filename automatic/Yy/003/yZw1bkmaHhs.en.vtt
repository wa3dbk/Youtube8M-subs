here<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> an<00:00:37.829> armature<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
here is an armature that I'm just in the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.639 
here is an armature that I'm just in the
process<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.390> barely<00:00:39.780> putting<00:00:40.020> together<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
process of barely putting together is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.700 
process of barely putting together is
just<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.489> piece<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> wire<00:00:42.030> that's<00:00:42.960> down<00:00:43.469> from

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
just one piece of wire that's down from

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.180 
just one piece of wire that's down from
our<00:00:43.829> feet<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.399> loops<00:00:45.300> above<00:00:45.739> comes<00:00:46.739> back<00:00:46.980> down

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
our feet up loops above comes back down

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.740 
our feet up loops above comes back down
and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.640> there's<00:00:47.789> an<00:00:48.000> arm<00:00:48.180> piece<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.629> goes

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and then there's an arm piece that goes

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.110 
and then there's an arm piece that goes
across<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.559> I've<00:00:50.010> secured<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.640> some

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
across and I've secured it with some

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200 
across and I've secured it with some
tape<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.600> also<00:00:51.870> some<00:00:52.050> paper<00:00:52.289> tape<00:00:53.000> then<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
tape and also some paper tape then the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
tape and also some paper tape then the
other<00:00:54.360> thing<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.980> just<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.399> rough

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
other thing I have just a really rough

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.930 
other thing I have just a really rough
piece<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.230> basically<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.739> piece<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.730> foil

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
piece but it's basically a piece of foil

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.900 
piece but it's basically a piece of foil
and<00:01:00.210> tape<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.680> just<00:01:01.680> says<00:01:01.859> one<00:01:02.070> hedonic<00:01:02.579> sits

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and tape that just says one hedonic sits

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.460 
and tape that just says one hedonic sits
the<00:01:03.030> measurement<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:03.809> her<00:01:04.110> head<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the measurement of what her head is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
the measurement of what her head is
basically<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.040> how<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> know<00:01:08.400> how

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
basically and so that's how I know how

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
basically and so that's how I know how
long<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> make<00:01:09.360> her<00:01:09.570> arms<00:01:09.930> how<00:01:10.140> long<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> make

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
long to make her arms how long to make

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.820 
long to make her arms how long to make
her<00:01:10.680> legs<00:01:11.340> where<00:01:11.820> her<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.119> should<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> I'll

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
her legs where her way should be so I'll

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
her legs where her way should be so I'll
show<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> closer<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.750> set<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.049> up

more<00:01:58.020> wire<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.969> don't<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.060> why<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.570> but

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
more wire I don't know why that is but

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.440 
more wire I don't know why that is but
yeah<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> wire<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.640> curb<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
yeah for the wire to curb it's going to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870 
yeah for the wire to curb it's going to
end<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.750> using<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:04.200> wire<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.770> I've<00:02:05.070> given<00:02:05.759> her

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
end up using more wire so I've given her

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.520 
end up using more wire so I've given her
even<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.420> feet<00:02:06.689> down<00:02:06.930> at<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> bottom<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.469> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
even little feet down at the bottom so I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.650 
even little feet down at the bottom so I
can<00:02:07.740> use<00:02:08.069> whatever<00:02:08.399> wire<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> need<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> keep<00:02:09.509> her

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
can use whatever wire I need to keep her

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.500 
can use whatever wire I need to keep her
in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> proportions<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.619> want<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.510> right

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
in the proportions that I want and right

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.930 
in the proportions that I want and right
now

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
now

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.630 
now
arms<00:02:13.210> are<00:02:13.390> quite<00:02:13.630> long<00:02:13.900> because<00:02:14.740> really<00:02:15.340> her

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
arms are quite long because really her

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.820 
arms are quite long because really her
arms<00:02:15.970> will<00:02:16.120> only<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.540> going<00:02:16.840> down<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.500> about

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
arms will only be going down to about

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.170 
arms will only be going down to about
say<00:02:18.190> one<00:02:18.430> two<00:02:19.390> three<00:02:20.640> about<00:02:21.640> four<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> half

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
say one two three about four and a half

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.140 
say one two three about four and a half
heads<00:02:22.570> down<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:23.340> about<00:02:24.340> down<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.610> here

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
heads down here about down to here

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.290 
heads down here about down to here
you<00:02:25.600> want<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.890> fingertips<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.610> be<00:02:27.790> halfway

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
you want the fingertips to be halfway

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.530 
you want the fingertips to be halfway
down<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.080> thigh<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.760> these<00:02:30.970> are<00:02:31.030> too<00:02:31.300> long

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
down the thigh and so these are too long

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.380 
down the thigh and so these are too long
but<00:02:32.320> again<00:02:32.830> as<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.790> put<00:02:33.940> her<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.060> different

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
but again as I put her in different

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.120 
but again as I put her in different
positions<00:02:34.900> I'll<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.350> measure<00:02:35.590> again<00:02:35.890> later

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
positions I'll just measure again later

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.250 
positions I'll just measure again later
and<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:36.550> always<00:02:36.880> easier<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.660> clip<00:02:38.110> off

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and it's always easier to just clip off

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.740 
and it's always easier to just clip off
what<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.070> don't<00:02:39.310> need<00:02:39.520> than<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.570> try<00:02:40.720> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
what you don't need than it is to try to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.710 
what you don't need than it is to try to
add<00:02:40.990> more<00:02:41.020> wire-to-wire<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.490> that's<00:02:43.390> why<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.600> do

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
add more wire-to-wire so that's why I do

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.890 
add more wire-to-wire so that's why I do
that<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.950> um<00:02:45.640> first<00:02:46.210> thing<00:02:46.450> with<00:02:46.570> her<00:02:46.720> we're

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
that so um first thing with her we're

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.450 
that so um first thing with her we're
just<00:02:47.050> going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> bulk<00:02:47.530> her<00:02:47.710> out<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> little<00:02:48.070> bit

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
just going to bulk her out a little bit

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.190 
just going to bulk her out a little bit
and<00:02:49.470> then<00:02:50.640> I'll<00:02:51.640> wrap<00:02:52.330> or<00:02:52.570> some<00:02:52.720> paper<00:02:52.870> tape

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and then I'll wrap or some paper tape

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.110 
and then I'll wrap or some paper tape
and<00:02:53.440> then<00:02:54.190> show<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:54.550> what<00:02:54.610> she<00:02:54.850> looks<00:02:55.030> like

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
and then show you what she looks like

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.930 
and then show you what she looks like
when<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.870> booked<00:02:56.110> her<00:02:56.260> out<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:56.920> use<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
when I booked her out I like to use the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.300 
when I booked her out I like to use the
really<00:02:58.210> thin<00:02:58.570> aluminum<00:02:59.200> foil<00:02:59.440> you<00:03:00.010> don't<00:03:00.190> want

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
really thin aluminum foil you don't want

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.530 
really thin aluminum foil you don't want
the<00:03:00.400> heavy-duty<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:01.120> because<00:03:01.270> with<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
the heavy-duty just because with the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.440 
the heavy-duty just because with the
small<00:03:02.020> stuff<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.790> really<00:03:03.790> condense<00:03:04.210> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
small stuff you can really condense it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.530 
small stuff you can really condense it
easier<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.890> can<00:03:05.920> add<00:03:06.160> smaller<00:03:06.910> portions

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
easier and you can add smaller portions

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.180 
easier and you can add smaller portions
to<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.930> without<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.350> being<00:03:08.500> too<00:03:08.710> bulky<00:03:08.860> and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
to it without it being too bulky and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.650 
to it without it being too bulky and
then<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:09.940> also<00:03:10.210> use<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:11.530> aluminum<00:03:12.070> tape<00:03:12.660> which

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
then I also use this aluminum tape which

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.300 
then I also use this aluminum tape which
you<00:03:13.810> can<00:03:13.960> define<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.440> hardware<00:03:14.800> store<00:03:15.040> and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
you can define in a hardware store and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.530 
you can define in a hardware store and
then<00:03:15.460> I<00:03:15.490> like<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.760> tear<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.210> into<00:03:16.330> little

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
then I like to tear it into little

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.630 
then I like to tear it into little
strips<00:03:16.810> like<00:03:17.050> this<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.190> what<00:03:18.340> I've<00:03:18.459> done

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
strips like this and so what I've done

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.550 
strips like this and so what I've done
right<00:03:18.880> here<00:03:19.270> is<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.510> put<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:20.050> some<00:03:20.350> aluminum

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
right here is I put on some aluminum

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.580 
right here is I put on some aluminum
foil<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.370> then<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.030> have<00:03:22.450> also<00:03:22.630> used<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.230> strip

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
foil and then I have also used a strip

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.040 
foil and then I have also used a strip
of<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:23.860> tape<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.520> helps<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.390> foil<00:03:25.720> to

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
of this tape and that helps that foil to

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.720 
of this tape and that helps that foil to
stay<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.380> place<00:03:26.620> because<00:03:26.890> otherwise<00:03:27.310> when

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
stay in place because otherwise when

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.790 
stay in place because otherwise when
you're<00:03:27.850> making<00:03:28.030> an<00:03:28.270> armature<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:29.560> start

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
you're making an armature it can start

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.920 
you're making an armature it can start
falling<00:03:30.070> off<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:31.120> be<00:03:31.239> annoying<00:03:31.540> so

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
falling off and just be annoying so

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.479 
falling off and just be annoying so
that's<00:03:32.080> what<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.260> found<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.800> make<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.250> much

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
that's what I found to make it a much

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.870 
that's what I found to make it a much
more<00:03:33.520> peaceful<00:03:34.000> process

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
more peaceful process

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.760 
more peaceful process
with<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.030> female<00:03:37.209> doll<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.989> pretty<00:03:38.380> easy<00:03:38.560> to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
with the female doll it's pretty easy to

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.940 
with the female doll it's pretty easy to
remember<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:40.690> want<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.080> front<00:03:41.410> bulked

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
remember that you want the front bulked

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.470 
remember that you want the front bulked
out<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.130> bit<00:03:42.430> because<00:03:42.640> she'll<00:03:42.940> be<00:03:43.150> having<00:03:43.300> her

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
out a bit because she'll be having her

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.979 
out a bit because she'll be having her
breast<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:46.239> way<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> chest

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
breast and the the way that the chest

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.650 
breast and the the way that the chest
the<00:03:47.470> rib<00:03:47.620> cage<00:03:47.800> sits<00:03:48.130> but<00:03:48.910> also<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.269> want<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
the rib cage sits but also you want the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.420 
the rib cage sits but also you want the
bat<00:03:49.870> bulk<00:03:50.230> out<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:50.739> bit<00:03:50.950> too<00:03:51.190> because

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
bat bulk out a little bit too because

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.190 
bat bulk out a little bit too because
the<00:03:51.820> shoulders<00:03:52.239> will<00:03:52.450> sit<00:03:52.660> here<00:03:52.989> in<00:03:53.110> the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
the shoulders will sit here in the

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.040 
the shoulders will sit here in the
middle<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.620> then<00:03:54.070> I'm<00:03:54.730> going<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.910> add<00:03:55.060> more

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
middle and then I'm going to add more

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.130 
middle and then I'm going to add more

her<00:05:55.900> hands<00:05:56.900> yet<00:05:57.140> perhaps<00:05:57.650> on<00:05:57.860> her<00:05:57.950> knees<00:05:58.160> or<00:05:58.580> up

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
her hands yet perhaps on her knees or up

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.780 
her hands yet perhaps on her knees or up
by<00:05:58.790> your<00:05:58.910> face<00:05:59.830> but<00:06:00.830> you<00:06:01.160> can<00:06:01.310> see<00:06:01.460> I've<00:06:01.580> bent

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
by your face but you can see I've bent

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.640 
by your face but you can see I've bent
the<00:06:01.910> wire<00:06:02.060> back<00:06:02.690> about<00:06:03.080> where<00:06:03.260> her<00:06:03.410> hand

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
the wire back about where her hand

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.890 
the wire back about where her hand
length<00:06:04.160> will<00:06:04.460> end<00:06:04.700> so<00:06:05.120> I've<00:06:05.270> got<00:06:05.450> that<00:06:05.570> extra

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
length will end so I've got that extra

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.230 
length will end so I've got that extra
wire<00:06:06.050> but<00:06:06.260> it's<00:06:06.380> not<00:06:06.560> going<00:06:07.250> to<00:06:07.340> be<00:06:07.610> distorting

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
wire but it's not going to be distorting

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.110 
wire but it's not going to be distorting
what<00:06:08.390> I'm<00:06:08.510> trying<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.810> do<00:06:09.430> so<00:06:10.430> that's<00:06:10.910> where

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
what I'm trying to do so that's where

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.680 
what I'm trying to do so that's where
she's<00:06:11.300> at<00:06:11.480> so<00:06:11.690> far<00:06:11.930> and<00:06:12.260> then<00:06:13.450> I'm<00:06:14.450> going<00:06:14.600> to

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
she's at so far and then I'm going to

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.420 
she's at so far and then I'm going to
bulk<00:06:14.840> out<00:06:15.020> her<00:06:15.260> thighs<00:06:15.530> just<00:06:15.830> a<00:06:16.010> little<00:06:16.250> bit

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
bulk out her thighs just a little bit

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.000 
bulk out her thighs just a little bit
probably<00:06:17.060> with<00:06:17.330> just<00:06:17.720> some<00:06:17.900> clay<00:06:18.230> and<00:06:18.530> then

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
probably with just some clay and then

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.140 
probably with just some clay and then
make<00:06:19.460> that<00:06:19.630> do<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:20.780> same<00:06:20.810> with<00:06:21.110> her<00:06:21.230> legs<00:06:21.470> and

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
make that do the same with her legs and

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.760 
make that do the same with her legs and
then<00:06:23.150> she'll<00:06:23.510> be<00:06:23.630> ready<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.960> add<00:06:24.230> her<00:06:24.530> first

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
then she'll be ready to add her first

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.250 
then she'll be ready to add her first
layer<00:06:24.980> of<00:06:25.130> clay<00:06:25.310> -<00:06:27.340> here<00:06:28.340> she<00:06:28.370> is<00:06:28.580> with<00:06:28.850> her

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
layer of clay - here she is with her

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260 
layer of clay - here she is with her
little<00:06:30.260> arm<00:06:30.530> little<00:06:31.220> skinny<00:06:31.550> arms<00:06:31.880> in<00:06:32.060> place

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
little arm little skinny arms in place

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.320 
little arm little skinny arms in place
and<00:06:32.600> this<00:06:32.720> clay<00:06:33.110> will<00:06:33.320> be<00:06:33.470> baked<00:06:33.710> hard<00:06:34.130> and<00:06:34.490> act

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
and this clay will be baked hard and act

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.030 
and this clay will be baked hard and act
as<00:06:35.480> an<00:06:35.570> armature<00:06:35.870> for<00:06:36.169> the<00:06:36.230> arms<00:06:36.500> to<00:06:36.680> bulk<00:06:36.860> them

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
as an armature for the arms to bulk them

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.749 
as an armature for the arms to bulk them
out<00:06:37.190> a<00:06:37.220> little<00:06:37.400> bit

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
out a little bit

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.230 
out a little bit
and<00:06:38.020> when<00:06:39.020> I<00:06:39.050> do<00:06:39.169> this<00:06:39.439> I<00:06:39.680> like<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:40.639> bake<00:06:41.029> it

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
and when I do this I like to bake it

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.909 
and when I do this I like to bake it
I'll<00:06:41.449> take<00:06:41.839> the<00:06:42.020> head<00:06:42.169> off<00:06:42.199> probably<00:06:42.800> and

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
I'll take the head off probably and

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.350 
I'll take the head off probably and
stick<00:06:43.099> the<00:06:43.219> whole<00:06:43.400> doll<00:06:43.610> in<00:06:43.819> the<00:06:43.909> oven<00:06:44.150> again

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
stick the whole doll in the oven again

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.189 
stick the whole doll in the oven again
to<00:06:44.479> make<00:06:44.629> it<00:06:44.809> nice<00:06:45.349> and<00:06:45.379> firm<00:06:45.889> and<00:06:46.129> then<00:06:47.199> I'll

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
to make it nice and firm and then I'll

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.110 
to make it nice and firm and then I'll
look<00:06:48.589> at<00:06:48.710> these<00:06:48.830> arms<00:06:49.069> really<00:06:49.370> close<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:49.849> see

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
look at these arms really close and see

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.409 
look at these arms really close and see
if<00:06:51.110> that<00:06:51.439> dimension<00:06:52.249> is<00:06:52.279> going<00:06:52.490> to<00:06:52.550> work<00:06:52.729> great

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
if that dimension is going to work great

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.790 
if that dimension is going to work great
for<00:06:53.749> me<00:06:53.900> and<00:06:54.020> if<00:06:54.110> not<00:06:54.289> I'll<00:06:54.439> just<00:06:54.469> take<00:06:54.770> my

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
for me and if not I'll just take my

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.649 
for me and if not I'll just take my
little<00:06:55.069> exacto<00:06:55.729> knife<00:06:55.909> and<00:06:56.059> shave<00:06:56.330> them<00:06:56.509> off<00:06:56.599> a

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
little exacto knife and shave them off a

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.290 
little exacto knife and shave them off a
little<00:06:56.900> bit<00:06:57.110> where<00:06:57.319> I<00:06:57.349> need<00:06:57.529> to<00:06:57.819> but<00:06:58.819> again<00:06:59.180> I

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
little bit where I need to but again I

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.110 
little bit where I need to but again I
prefer<00:06:59.569> to<00:06:59.839> have<00:06:59.960> a<00:07:00.020> little<00:07:00.409> bit<00:07:00.699> more<00:07:01.699> than

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
prefer to have a little bit more than

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.779 
prefer to have a little bit more than
necessary<00:07:02.499> that<00:07:03.499> I<00:07:03.529> can<00:07:03.860> shave<00:07:04.249> away<00:07:04.400> and<00:07:04.639> work

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
necessary that I can shave away and work

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:11.909 
necessary that I can shave away and work
with<00:07:07.449> all<00:07:08.449> right<00:07:08.629> here<00:07:08.839> she<00:07:09.050> is<00:07:10.029> all<00:07:11.029> completed

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 
with all right here she is all completed

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.459 
with all right here she is all completed
now<00:07:12.919> when<00:07:13.309> I<00:07:13.339> bake<00:07:13.580> these<00:07:13.899> clay<00:07:14.899> bits<00:07:15.199> on<00:07:15.439> the

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:15.469 
now when I bake these clay bits on the

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.950 
now when I bake these clay bits on the
bottoms<00:07:15.949> I'm<00:07:16.879> going<00:07:17.029> to<00:07:17.089> be<00:07:17.180> able<00:07:17.389> to<00:07:17.509> carve<00:07:17.749> at

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
bottoms I'm going to be able to carve at

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.629 
bottoms I'm going to be able to carve at
them<00:07:18.080> if<00:07:18.229> I<00:07:18.349> need<00:07:18.379> to<00:07:18.649> adjust<00:07:18.740> the<00:07:19.069> length<00:07:19.339> and

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 
them if I need to adjust the length and

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.879 
them if I need to adjust the length and
also<00:07:20.210> they'll<00:07:20.569> slide<00:07:20.899> a<00:07:20.930> little<00:07:21.229> bit<00:07:21.409> up<00:07:21.710> on

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:21.889 
also they'll slide a little bit up on

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.909 
also they'll slide a little bit up on
the<00:07:22.039> wire<00:07:22.330> so<00:07:23.330> I<00:07:23.719> have<00:07:23.960> those<00:07:24.469> things<00:07:24.680> going

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 
the wire so I have those things going

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:26.799 
the wire so I have those things going
for<00:07:25.159> me<00:07:25.189> because<00:07:25.639> sometimes<00:07:25.669> you<00:07:26.419> need<00:07:26.629> to

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:26.809 
for me because sometimes you need to

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:28.809 
for me because sometimes you need to
adjust<00:07:26.960> the<00:07:27.559> link<00:07:27.889> a<00:07:28.009> little<00:07:28.129> bit<00:07:28.339> once<00:07:28.610> you're

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:28.819 
adjust the link a little bit once you're

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:32.369 
adjust the link a little bit once you're
actually<00:07:29.120> in<00:07:29.180> the<00:07:29.210> sculpting<00:07:29.629> process<00:07:30.159> to<00:07:31.159> see

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:32.379 
actually in the sculpting process to see

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:34.510 
actually in the sculpting process to see
what's<00:07:33.379> going<00:07:33.529> to<00:07:33.589> work<00:07:33.710> best<00:07:33.770> for<00:07:34.129> your<00:07:34.339> doll

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
what's going to work best for your doll

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.179 
what's going to work best for your doll
but<00:07:35.389> that<00:07:35.629> is<00:07:35.870> how<00:07:36.020> you<00:07:36.110> do<00:07:36.439> a<00:07:36.740> bulk<00:07:37.009> out

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:37.189 
but that is how you do a bulk out

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:41.800 
but that is how you do a bulk out
armature<00:07:38.529> with<00:07:39.529> the<00:07:40.039> clay<00:07:40.509> bulking<00:07:41.509> out<00:07:41.629> the

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810 
armature with the clay bulking out the

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.989 
armature with the clay bulking out the
arms<00:07:42.020> and<00:07:42.139> legs<00:07:45.189> here's<00:07:46.189> how<00:07:46.399> the<00:07:46.459> armature

00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:46.999 
arms and legs here's how the armature

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:50.019 
arms and legs here's how the armature
looks<00:07:47.209> after<00:07:47.509> it's<00:07:47.779> been<00:07:47.959> baked<00:07:48.229> and<00:07:49.029> here

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:50.029 
looks after it's been baked and here

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:55.600 
looks after it's been baked and here
she's<00:07:50.779> in<00:07:50.990> our<00:07:51.080> seated<00:07:51.740> pose<00:07:54.249> so<00:07:55.249> that's

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.610 
she's in our seated pose so that's
