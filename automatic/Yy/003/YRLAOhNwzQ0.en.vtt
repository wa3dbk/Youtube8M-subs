wireless<00:01:12.689> tethering<00:01:13.909> basically<00:01:15.170> metros<00:01:16.170> pcs

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
wireless tethering basically metros pcs

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.350 
wireless tethering basically metros pcs
then<00:01:16.979> getting<00:01:17.340> more<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:17.790> subscribers

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
then getting more and more subscribers

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.469 
then getting more and more subscribers
every<00:01:18.869> day<00:01:19.189> every<00:01:20.189> single<00:01:20.340> day<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.119> over

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
every day every single day we get over

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.160 
every day every single day we get over
probably<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:23.390> five<00:01:24.390> thousand<00:01:24.990> subscribers

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
probably about five thousand subscribers

probably about five thousand subscribers
some<00:01:25.770> shit<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.159> like

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
some shit like that like

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.310 
some shit like that like
you<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.460> around<00:01:29.729> around<00:01:30.240> world<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:31.110> around

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you know around around world not around

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.910 
you know around around world not around
the<00:01:31.439> world<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.159> around<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.520> nation<00:01:32.880> so

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
the world you know around a nation so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.450 
the world you know around a nation so
basically<00:01:35.960> when<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:36.990> wireless<00:01:37.710> tether<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
basically when you wireless tether this

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
basically when you wireless tether this
is<00:01:38.640> why<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:38.820> don't<00:01:39.060> recruit<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
is why they don't recruit and this is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
is why they don't recruit and this is
another<00:01:40.979> reason<00:01:41.250> why<00:01:41.549> other<00:01:41.790> company<00:01:42.210> like

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
another reason why other company like

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200 
another reason why other company like
verizon<00:01:42.500> wireless<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> companies

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
verizon wireless you know the companies

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.680 
verizon wireless you know the companies
they<00:01:45.420> don't<00:01:45.630> give<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.049> unlimited<00:01:46.289> data

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
they don't give you unlimited data

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.950 
they don't give you unlimited data
basically<00:01:48.690> uh<00:01:50.210> what's<00:01:51.210> happening<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> with

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
basically uh what's happening is with

Metro they're on they're basically

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
Metro they're on they're basically
charging<00:01:57.210> extra<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:58.340> again<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.549> many

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
charging extra for because again so many

they're most likely pulling it for

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.830 
they're most likely pulling it for
wireless<00:02:07.920> tether<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.489> what<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.330> doing<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
wireless tether and what that's doing is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 
wireless tether and what that's doing is
its<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> hurting<00:02:10.799> the<00:02:10.979> towers<00:02:11.549> in<00:02:12.180> so
