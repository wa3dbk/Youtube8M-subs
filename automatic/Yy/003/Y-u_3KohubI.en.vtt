00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
probably started out with just a rock

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.510 
probably started out with just a rock
and<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:10.000> stick<00:02:11.040> started<00:02:12.040> out<00:02:12.130> with<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> rock<00:02:12.490> and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520

this<00:02:15.490> would<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.760> little<00:02:16.000> easier<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.390> swing

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
this would be a little easier to swing

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.100 
this would be a little easier to swing
and<00:02:17.020> smash<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> face<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.250> and

and smash you in the face with it and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and smash you in the face with it and
that<00:02:20.110> we<00:02:20.200> don't<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.530> throw<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.010> can

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
that we don't have to throw it I can

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.260 
that we don't have to throw it I can
just<00:02:21.280> kind<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.490> hit<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:21.940> then<00:02:22.060> we'll<00:02:22.150> have

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
just kind of hit you and then we'll have

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.460 
just kind of hit you and then we'll have
to<00:02:22.360> go<00:02:22.450> get<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:25.480> anyway<00:02:25.840> hammers<00:02:26.230> pretty

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
to go get it but anyway hammers pretty

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.030 
to go get it but anyway hammers pretty
primitive<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.840> let's<00:02:29.110> just<00:02:29.260> check<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.830> out

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
primitive so let's just check that out

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.790 
primitive so let's just check that out
yeah<00:02:30.370> see<00:02:30.790> hammers<00:02:31.620> pretty<00:02:32.620> simple<00:02:34.800> it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
yeah see hammers pretty simple it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.170 
yeah see hammers pretty simple it

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.520 
them you couldn't buy a wrench so
basically<00:04:43.210> went<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.630> blacksmith<00:04:44.140> shop<00:04:44.200> and

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
basically went to a blacksmith shop and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.120 
basically went to a blacksmith shop and
had<00:04:44.650> them<00:04:44.830> made<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:46.530> I've<00:04:47.530> seen<00:04:47.770> them<00:04:47.920> made

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
had them made and I've seen them made

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.910 
had them made and I've seen them made
before<00:04:48.550> but<00:04:49.230> it's<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.290> lot<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.470> work<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.770> make<00:04:50.890> a

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
before but it's a lot of work to make a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.080 
before but it's a lot of work to make a
damn<00:04:51.190> wrench<00:04:53.160> other<00:04:54.160> than<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.760> mean<00:04:54.970> that

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
damn wrench other than that I mean that

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.570 
damn wrench other than that I mean that
was<00:04:55.210> pretty<00:04:55.450> much<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.870> basics<00:04:56.350> of<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.340> best

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
was pretty much the basics of the best

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.970 
was pretty much the basics of the best
tools<00:04:57.850> ever<00:04:58.150> produced<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.780> think<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.290> honestly

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
tools ever produced I think I honestly

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.300 
tools ever produced I think I honestly
believe<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.460> vise<00:05:00.610> grip<00:05:00.880> as<00:05:01.390> far<00:05:01.690> as<00:05:01.840> a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
believe the vise grip as far as a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.790 
believe the vise grip as far as a
somewhat<00:05:03.310> complex<00:05:04.080> but<00:05:05.080> cheap<00:05:05.580> simple<00:05:06.580> tool

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
somewhat complex but cheap simple tool

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.320 
somewhat complex but cheap simple tool
the<00:05:08.800> vise<00:05:08.980> grip<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.700> vice<00:05:09.850> grip<00:05:10.090> wins

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
the vise grip is it the vice grip wins

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.890 
the vise grip is it the vice grip wins
it<00:05:10.510> for<00:05:10.660> me

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
it for me

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.240 
it for me
I've<00:05:11.020> just<00:05:11.290> I've<00:05:11.770> always<00:05:11.890> been<00:05:12.130> impressed

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
next installment in the basic

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.490 
next installment in the basic
blacksmithing<00:05:58.560> series<00:05:59.560> that<00:05:59.740> I<00:05:59.770> was<00:05:59.980> doing<00:06:01.500> I

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
blacksmithing series that I was doing I

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.280 
blacksmithing series that I was doing I
do<00:06:03.130> it<00:06:03.250> all<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.370> time<00:06:03.670> so<00:06:03.940> all<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.780> hairs<00:06:05.110> that

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
do it all the time so all the hairs that

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.960 
do it all the time so all the hairs that
are<00:06:05.380> growing<00:06:05.590> in<00:06:05.680> there<00:06:05.860> kind<00:06:06.130> of<00:06:06.220> I<00:06:06.430> think

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
are growing in there kind of I think

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.220 
are growing in there kind of I think
it's<00:06:07.060> a<00:06:07.120> hat<00:06:07.330> kind<00:06:07.690> of<00:06:07.780> tickles<00:06:08.110> them<00:06:08.400> anyway

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
it's a hat kind of tickles them anyway

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.080 
it's a hat kind of tickles them anyway
