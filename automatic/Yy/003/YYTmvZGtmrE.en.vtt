00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
with the armor it does take more nights

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
with the armor it does take more nights
i<00:01:39.189> believe<00:01:39.460> it's<00:01:39.610> too<00:01:39.880> nice<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.390> kill<00:01:40.600> them<00:01:40.720> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
i believe it's too nice to kill them and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.719 
i believe it's too nice to kill them and

yes see you can jump across there it's a
very<00:01:45.969> large<00:01:46.210> map<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.750> these<00:01:46.869> arrows<00:01:47.229> i<00:01:47.500> don't

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
very large map and these arrows i don't

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.649 
very large map and these arrows i don't
know<00:01:48.159> if<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:48.399> can<00:01:48.520> trust<00:01:48.700> them<00:01:49.030> because<00:01:49.149> as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
know if you can trust them because as

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.780 
know if you can trust them because as
you<00:01:49.840> like<00:01:50.079> i<00:01:50.380> don't<00:01:50.950> know<00:01:51.040> if<00:01:51.070> i'm<00:01:51.310> putting<00:01:51.700> in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
you like i don't know if i'm putting in

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.010 
you like i don't know if i'm putting in
this<00:01:51.969> part<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.299> second<00:01:52.570> part<00:01:52.600> because<00:01:52.960> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
this part the second part because the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.719 
this part the second part because the
arrow<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.619> pointed<00:01:53.920> me<00:01:54.070> down<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.460> i<00:01:54.520> went

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
arrow and it pointed me down and i went

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.270 
arrow and it pointed me down and i went
down<00:01:54.850> now<00:01:55.119> scrapped<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:56.350> I'm<00:01:56.890> not<00:01:57.159> really

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
down now scrapped so I'm not really

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760 
down now scrapped so I'm not really
trusting<00:01:57.729> these<00:01:57.820> arrows<00:01:58.119> too<00:01:58.329> much<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:59.409> you

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
trusting these arrows too much so you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.830 
trusting these arrows too much so you
guys<00:01:59.920> can<00:02:00.189> do<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.520> yourself<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.270> don't

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
guys can do that yourself and I don't

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.510 
guys can do that yourself and I don't
know<00:02:01.990> if<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.320> jump<00:02:02.530> across<00:02:02.680> there<00:02:03.100> yet<00:02:03.280> I

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
know if you can jump across there yet I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.370 
know if you can jump across there yet I
was<00:02:03.880> trying<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.119> find<00:02:04.299> Stampin<00:02:04.780> Up<00:02:04.899> see<00:02:05.140> if<00:02:05.289> I

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
was trying to find Stampin Up see if I

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.450 
was trying to find Stampin Up see if I
could<00:02:05.439> do<00:02:05.649> it<00:02:05.770> see<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.100> would<00:02:06.189> help<00:02:06.280> me

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
could do it see if that would help me

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.279 
could do it see if that would help me
out<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.149> have<00:02:07.329> not<00:02:07.509> found<00:02:07.719> that<00:02:07.990> yet<00:02:08.110> on

things and all my zombie zeros they will

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.709 
things and all my zombie zeros they will
get<00:02:19.609> better<00:02:19.819> though<00:02:20.090> because<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:20.480> don't<00:02:20.599> really

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.069 
much trying to survive and make it to a
higher<00:02:24.859> round<00:02:25.219> at<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.549> point<00:02:25.819> I'm<00:02:26.329> trying<00:02:26.510> to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
be about the same link because if it's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.910 
be about the same link because if it's
too<00:02:44.299> lengthy<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:45.230> guys<00:02:45.379> know<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.620> takes<00:02:45.769> a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
too lengthy you guys know it takes a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.860 
too lengthy you guys know it takes a
long<00:02:46.040> time<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.310> upload<00:02:46.669> and<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.629> not

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
long time to upload and it's just not

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.839 
long time to upload and it's just not
not<00:02:48.230> worth<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.709> i'd<00:02:48.859> rather<00:02:49.040> have<00:02:49.159> two<00:02:49.430> videos

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
not worth it i'd rather have two videos

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.929 
not worth it i'd rather have two videos
and<00:02:50.319> yeah<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.799> then<00:02:51.950> open<00:02:52.280> up<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.489> door<00:02:52.549> and

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
and yeah and then open up this door and

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.309 
and yeah and then open up this door and
it<00:02:53.060> pretty<00:02:53.209> much<00:02:53.299> takes<00:02:53.689> me<00:02:53.900> around<00:02:53.959> into<00:02:54.290> a

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
it pretty much takes me around into a

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.020 
it pretty much takes me around into a
big<00:02:54.470> circle<00:02:54.769> which<00:02:55.159> kind<00:02:55.549> of<00:02:55.639> pissed<00:02:55.819> me<00:02:55.939> off

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
big circle which kind of pissed me off
