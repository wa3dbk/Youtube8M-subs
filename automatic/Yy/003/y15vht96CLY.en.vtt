00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
pruned this weeping pussy-willow it came

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.939 
pruned this weeping pussy-willow it came
as<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> little<00:00:15.059> mail-order<00:00:15.900> plant<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.650> was<00:00:16.770> only

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
as a little mail-order plant it was only

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.900 
as a little mail-order plant it was only
about<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.210> big<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.660> already<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.910> tree

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
about this big it already was in tree

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.590 
about this big it already was in tree
form<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.890> took<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.340> while<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.730> grow<00:00:24.330> it

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
form and it took a while to grow it

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960 
form and it took a while to grow it
wasn't<00:00:24.960> growing<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:26.039> much<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.460> all<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.820> now

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
wasn't growing very much at all but now

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.259 
wasn't growing very much at all but now
it<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.359> starting<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.349> grow<00:00:28.680> taller<00:00:29.609> just

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
it is starting to grow taller just

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.820 
it is starting to grow taller just
because<00:00:30.480> I've<00:00:30.660> been<00:00:30.689> trying<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> force<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.710> up

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
because I've been trying to force it up

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.600 
because I've been trying to force it up
that<00:00:32.009> way<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.420> grows<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:34.250> densely<00:00:35.250> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that way and it grows very densely so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.540 
that way and it grows very densely so
I've<00:00:36.059> thinned<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:37.010> also<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.219> tends<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I've thinned it out also it tends to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.450 
I've thinned it out also it tends to
cover<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> ground<00:00:39.809> too<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.649> keep<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.280> off

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
cover the ground too so I keep it up off

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.869 
cover the ground too so I keep it up off
of<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.239> ground<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.700> see

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
of the ground a bit and as you can see

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.900 
of the ground a bit and as you can see
it's<00:00:45.300> starting<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.140> some<00:00:46.469> some<00:00:47.399> right

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
it's starting to put out some some right

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.439 
it's starting to put out some some right
there<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:50.100> end<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.610> end<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> March

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
there it's a the end of my end of March

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
there it's a the end of my end of March
here<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.289> south<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.649> San<00:00:52.829> Francisco<00:00:53.460> so

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
here I'm just south of San Francisco so

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.180 
here I'm just south of San Francisco so
it's<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.960> put<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.010> these

it's going to put put out these
pussywillows<00:00:57.030> first<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:57.989> it'll<00:00:58.260> put

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pussywillows first and then it'll put

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.799 
pussywillows first and then it'll put
out<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.309> foliage<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.210> gets<00:01:00.359> quite

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
out the foliage and then it gets quite

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.950 
out the foliage and then it gets quite
quite<00:01:01.620> quite<00:01:01.879> dense<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.090> foliage<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.780> it's

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
quite quite dense with foliage so it's

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
quite quite dense with foliage so it's
nice<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.379> keep<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.880> thinned<00:01:06.180> out

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
nice to keep it a little bit thinned out

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.390 
nice to keep it a little bit thinned out
but<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.470> good<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
but this is a good time to see it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.120 
but this is a good time to see it
because<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.130> trunk

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
because as you can see what the trunk

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.789 
because as you can see what the trunk
structure<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.510> oh<00:01:12.720> here's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> little

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
structure of it is oh here's a little

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.520 
structure of it is oh here's a little
foliage<00:01:14.189> coming<00:01:14.520> out<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.259> was

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
foliage coming out there and it was

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.700 
foliage coming out there and it was
really<00:01:17.009> leaning<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> very<00:01:18.750> windy<00:01:19.170> area

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
really leaning this is a very windy area

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
really leaning this is a very windy area
it's<00:01:20.009> only<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.430> seven<00:01:20.820> blocks<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
it's only about seven blocks from the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
it's only about seven blocks from the
beach<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.259> gets<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.830> lot<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.390> wind<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.890> so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
beach so it gets a lot of wind here so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.260 
beach so it gets a lot of wind here so
it<00:01:26.250> had<00:01:26.820> started<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> lean<00:01:27.920> quite<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.159> bit<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it had started to lean quite a bit and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
it had started to lean quite a bit and
so<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.130> restated<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so it had to be restated up and this is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
so it had to be restated up and this is
about<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.540> straight<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.890> now

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
about as straight as we can get it now

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.359 
about as straight as we can get it now
but<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:37.200> beautiful<00:01:38.130> plant

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
but it really is a is a beautiful plant

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.149 
but it really is a is a beautiful plant
and<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.820> getting<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.329> gorgeous<00:01:39.930> form<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.009> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and it's getting a gorgeous form to it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.580 
and it's getting a gorgeous form to it
but<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> does<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.970> does<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.049> does<00:01:43.380> take

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
but it does it does take it does take

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.950 
but it does it does take it does take
some<00:01:43.619> pruning<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.399> some<00:01:44.880> training<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
some pruning and some training to get it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
some pruning and some training to get it
this<00:01:46.140> way

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.240 

and<00:01:51.700> this<00:01:51.910> plant<00:01:52.210> doesn't<00:01:52.690> get<00:01:52.930> any

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and this plant doesn't get any

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.860 
and this plant doesn't get any
fertilizer<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.490> does<00:01:54.670> get<00:01:54.880> punk<00:01:55.150> composting

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
fertilizer it does get punk composting

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.290 
fertilizer it does get punk composting
because<00:01:56.020> this<00:01:56.170> garden<00:01:56.500> does<00:01:56.680> get<00:01:57.300> composted

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
because this garden does get composted

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.050 
because this garden does get composted
but<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.780> an<00:01:59.500> area<00:01:59.980> of<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.190> garden<00:02:00.610> where

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
but this is an area of the garden where

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.970 
but this is an area of the garden where
the<00:02:01.210> water<00:02:01.480> kind<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.930> tends<00:02:02.230> to<00:02:02.410> run<00:02:02.650> down<00:02:02.950> a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
the water kind of tends to run down a

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.400 
the water kind of tends to run down a
little<00:02:03.370> bit<00:02:03.670> anyway<00:02:03.970> because<00:02:04.810> pussywillows

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
little bit anyway because pussywillows

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.520 
little bit anyway because pussywillows
while<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.640> get<00:02:06.880> moist<00:02:07.150> it<00:02:07.720> doesn't<00:02:08.200> get<00:02:08.320> any

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
while I get moist it doesn't get any
