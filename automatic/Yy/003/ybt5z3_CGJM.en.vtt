one<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> very<00:00:16.590> difficult<00:00:17.070> things<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
one of the very difficult things to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.279 
one of the very difficult things to
understand<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:17.970> electric<00:00:18.539> cars<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
understand about electric cars is the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.250 
understand about electric cars is the
fuel<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:20.039> use<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.090> I'll<00:00:21.210> explain<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.810> best<00:00:22.050> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
fuel they use so I'll explain as best I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.700 
fuel they use so I'll explain as best I
can

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
can

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.300 
can
how<00:00:23.039> much<00:00:23.310> electricity<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:24.539> car<00:00:24.869> uses<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
how much electricity my car uses the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
how much electricity my car uses the
battery<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> Nissan<00:00:27.269> Leaf<00:00:27.300> has<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
battery in the Nissan Leaf has a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.790 
battery in the Nissan Leaf has a
capacity<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.519> 24<00:00:29.519> kilowatt<00:00:30.029> hours<00:00:30.679> what<00:00:31.679> does

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
capacity of 24 kilowatt hours what does

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
capacity of 24 kilowatt hours what does
that<00:00:31.830> mean<00:00:32.160> well<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.090> average<00:00:33.239> semi-detached

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that mean well the average semi-detached

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.830 
that mean well the average semi-detached
house<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:35.010> four<00:00:35.309> people<00:00:35.579> living<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> uses

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
house with four people living in it uses

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.490 
house with four people living in it uses
between<00:00:37.200> 10<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.739> 15<00:00:38.370> kilowatt<00:00:38.940> hours<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.329> day

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
between 10 and 15 kilowatt hours a day

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
between 10 and 15 kilowatt hours a day
so<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.710> leaf<00:00:41.040> battery<00:00:41.489> contains<00:00:42.059> more<00:00:42.420> than<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so a leaf battery contains more than a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.470 
so a leaf battery contains more than a
day's<00:00:42.960> worth<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.469> juice<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.850> charge<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> car

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
day's worth of juice if I charge the car

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.260 
day's worth of juice if I charge the car
during<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> day<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.200> pay<00:00:46.620> 19<00:00:47.219> pence<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.789> kilowatt

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
during the day I pay 19 pence a kilowatt

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.200 
during the day I pay 19 pence a kilowatt
hour<00:00:48.510> costing<00:00:49.379> me<00:00:49.500> four<00:00:49.800> pounds<00:00:50.280> fifty<00:00:50.700> six<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
hour costing me four pounds fifty six to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.900 
hour costing me four pounds fifty six to
fill<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.890> if<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.039> charge<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.640> night

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
fill it but if I charge it at night

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.180 
fill it but if I charge it at night
using<00:00:54.270> off-peak<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.260> night<00:00:55.559> tariffs

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
using off-peak or night tariffs

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.310 
using off-peak or night tariffs
electricity<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.059> cost<00:00:57.300> me<00:00:57.449> five<00:00:57.840> pence<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
electricity it cost me five pence a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.439 
electricity it cost me five pence a
kilowatt<00:00:58.649> hour<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.160> costs<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.850> pound<00:01:00.149> 20

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
kilowatt hour so that costs one pound 20

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.200 
kilowatt hour so that costs one pound 20
but<00:01:01.350> he<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.370> rare<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.609> starts<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> get

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
but he is rare it starts to get

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
but he is rare it starts to get
complicated<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:05.159> make<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> batteries<00:01:05.880> last

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
complicated to make the batteries last

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
complicated to make the batteries last
as<00:01:06.479> long<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.869> possible<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.680> battery

as long as possible the battery

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070 
as long as possible the battery
management<00:01:08.369> software<00:01:09.240> makes<00:01:09.689> sure<00:01:09.930> the

actually<00:01:13.110> empty<00:01:13.790> if<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.210> plug<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> car<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.140> when

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
actually empty if I plug the car in when

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
actually empty if I plug the car in when
the<00:01:16.439> battery<00:01:16.770> information<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> car<00:01:17.640> says

the battery information on the car says

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.749 
the battery information on the car says
it's<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:19.259> empty<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.549> how

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it's really really empty and see how

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
it's really really empty and see how
many<00:01:20.820> kilowatt<00:01:21.360> hours<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> takes<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.170> fill<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
many kilowatt hours it takes to fill it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.460 
many kilowatt hours it takes to fill it
absolutely<00:01:23.340> full<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.630> turns<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
absolutely full it turns out to be just

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
absolutely full it turns out to be just
over<00:01:25.830> 18<00:01:26.520> kilowatt<00:01:27.030> hours<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.080> will

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
over 18 kilowatt hours and that will

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
over 18 kilowatt hours and that will
allow<00:01:28.439> me<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.619> drive<00:01:28.950> 65<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.790> 70<00:01:30.150> miles<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
allow me to drive 65 to 70 miles in the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.190 
allow me to drive 65 to 70 miles in the
winter<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> 85<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.100> 90<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> summer<00:01:33.200> so

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
winter and 85 to 90 in the summer so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719 
winter and 85 to 90 in the summer so
what<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.829> means<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.520> doesn't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
what this really means is it doesn't

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
what this really means is it doesn't
cost<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.210> pound<00:01:36.420> twenty<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> charge<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> car

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
cost one pound twenty to charge the car

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.899 
cost one pound twenty to charge the car
overnight<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.100> costs<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.880> like<00:01:39.090> 90<00:01:39.750> P

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
overnight it costs more like 90 P

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.200 
overnight it costs more like 90 P
that's<00:01:41.630> if<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:41.960> pay<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.729> but<00:01:43.729> that's<00:01:43.909> silly

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
that's if I pay for it but that's silly

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.270 
that's if I pay for it but that's silly
how<00:01:44.689> can<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:44.929> get<00:01:45.109> free<00:01:45.439> electricity<00:01:45.829> unless

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
how can you get free electricity unless
