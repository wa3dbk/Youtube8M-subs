from<00:00:40.920> store-bought<00:00:41.309> kombucha<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.090> would

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
from store-bought kombucha I would

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.650 
from store-bought kombucha I would
recommend<00:00:43.230> buying<00:00:43.410> gt's<00:00:44.309> original<00:00:45.030> kombucha

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
recommend buying gt's original kombucha

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.170 
recommend buying gt's original kombucha
and<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.170> fruit<00:00:46.379> flavoured<00:00:46.710> ones<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and not the fruit flavoured ones and it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
and not the fruit flavoured ones and it
has<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> pretty<00:00:48.719> good<00:00:48.870> success<00:00:49.079> rate<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
has a pretty good success rate it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
has a pretty good success rate it
doesn't<00:00:49.950> always<00:00:50.340> work<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.989> viable

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
doesn't always work but it is a viable

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
option it takes a little bit of time it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
option it takes a little bit of time it
can<00:00:55.350> take<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> three<00:00:56.010> weeks<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.550> would

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
can take up to three weeks you would

can take up to three weeks you would
make<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> pot<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> tea<00:00:57.629> according<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
directions you can find that on cultured

and<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.439> would<00:01:04.680> add<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> entire<00:01:05.309> bottle

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and then you would add the entire bottle

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.480 
and then you would add the entire bottle
of<00:01:05.880> gt's<00:01:06.360> synergy<00:01:06.930> kombucha<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.920> then

of gt's synergy kombucha to it and then
it<00:01:08.640> could<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.060> about<00:01:09.240> three<00:01:09.720> weeks<00:01:09.930> maybe<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
it could take about three weeks maybe a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.490 
it could take about three weeks maybe a
little<00:01:11.040> longer<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> depends<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.060> kitchen

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
little longer it depends on your kitchen

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.149 
little longer it depends on your kitchen
but<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.909> work<00:01:15.119> most<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> time<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
but it it will work most of the time and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.530 
but it it will work most of the time and
if<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.759> doesn't<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.210> usually<00:01:18.360> because

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
if it doesn't it's usually because

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
if it doesn't it's usually because
there's<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.900> enough<00:01:19.140> bacteria<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.920> that

eat<00:01:40.380> good<00:01:40.829> bacteria<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.390> thrive<00:01:42.720> because

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
eat good bacteria you thrive because

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
eat good bacteria you thrive because
your<00:01:43.350> body<00:01:43.530> removes<00:01:43.890> pathogens<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.759> makes

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
your body removes pathogens it makes

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.899 
your body removes pathogens it makes
vitamins<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:46.500> doing<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.009> anyway<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.759> when

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
vitamins it's doing this anyway but when

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.870 
vitamins it's doing this anyway but when
you<00:01:48.000> eat<00:01:48.049> more<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> these<00:01:49.560> foods<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you eat more of these foods that that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.340 
you eat more of these foods that that
make<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.299> good<00:01:51.479> bacteria<00:01:51.659> very<00:01:52.170> very

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
make your good bacteria very very

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
make your good bacteria very very
dominant<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.579> they<00:01:53.670> also<00:01:53.820> makes<00:01:54.149> them<00:01:54.240> more

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
dominant and they also makes them more

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810 
dominant and they also makes them more
successful<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.860> communicate<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.670> another

successful to communicate to one another

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.780 
successful to communicate to one another
because<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:58.229> become<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> stronger<00:01:59.369> strains

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
because they become the stronger strains

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.450 
because they become the stronger strains
within<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.329> body<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.320> bad<00:02:02.189> pack

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
within your body and the bad pack

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 
within your body and the bad pack
bacteria<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.270> kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> calmed<00:02:04.079> down<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
bacteria is kind of calmed down and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 
bacteria is kind of calmed down and
moving<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.460> background<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
moving to the background but when you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.059 
moving to the background but when you
first<00:02:07.200> start<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.649> should<00:02:07.829> go<00:02:07.920> very

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
first start out you should go very

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.150 
first start out you should go very
slowly<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.780> detox<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
slowly because it will detox you in a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.370 
slowly because it will detox you in a
very<00:02:11.400> strong<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.540> because<00:02:12.989> your

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
very strong way because your

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.290 
very strong way because your
used<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.890> consuming<00:02:14.460> large<00:02:14.820> amounts<00:02:14.940> of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
used to consuming large amounts of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.870 
used to consuming large amounts of
bacteria<00:02:15.810> which<00:02:16.320> flood<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> body<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.340> then

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
bacteria which flood the body and then

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.880 
bacteria which flood the body and then
start<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.360> remove<00:02:18.630> some<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.440> bad<00:02:19.620> bacteria

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
start to remove some of the bad bacteria

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.220 
start to remove some of the bad bacteria
and<00:02:20.190> pathogens<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.970> large<00:02:21.450> numbers<00:02:21.840> which<00:02:22.020> can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
and pathogens in large numbers which can

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.400 
and pathogens in large numbers which can
make<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.560> feel<00:02:22.740> kind<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.250> bad<00:02:23.430> because<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:25.320> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
make you feel kind of bad because it's a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.800 
make you feel kind of bad because it's a
detox<00:02:25.770> effect<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.180> doesn't<00:02:27.480> take<00:02:27.630> very

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
detox effect but it doesn't take very

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.940 
detox effect but it doesn't take very
long<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.290> get<00:02:28.470> up<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.680> speed<00:02:28.920> with

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
long and then you get up to speed with

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.770 
long and then you get up to speed with
it<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.700> eat<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> lot<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.420> cultured

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it and you can eat a lot of cultured

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
what we are we're good bacteria and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.120 
what we are we're good bacteria and
really<00:02:38.730> nobody's<00:02:39.240> talking<00:02:39.720> about<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.920> fact

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that we are good bacteria and only 1% is

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.990 
that we are good bacteria and only 1% is
bad

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
