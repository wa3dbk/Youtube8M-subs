pretty<00:01:00.059> cool<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.840> always<00:01:01.320> wanted<00:01:01.620> one

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
pretty cool because I always wanted one

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.670 
pretty cool because I always wanted one
in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> gunmetal<00:01:02.969> color<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.470> pretty

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
in the gunmetal color so I was pretty

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
in the gunmetal color so I was pretty
excited<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:05.210> when<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> knew<00:01:06.360> he<00:01:06.450> was<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
excited when when I knew he was going to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.679 
excited when when I knew he was going to
send<00:01:06.900> me<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> exact<00:01:07.770> model<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.360> here

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
send me this exact model so I have here

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.510 
send me this exact model so I have here
just<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> compare<00:01:10.650> side-by-side<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
just to compare side-by-side the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
just to compare side-by-side the
standard<00:01:12.479> model<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.560> they

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
standard model I got this one when they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.260 
standard model I got this one when they
first<00:01:14.010> came<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:16.610> it's<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:17.880> it's

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
first came out and it's a good it's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
first came out and it's a good it's
probably<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> best<00:01:18.860> cheap<00:01:19.860> china<00:01:20.549> made

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
probably the best cheap china made

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.219 
probably the best cheap china made
flipper<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.840> are

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
flipper that you can get if you are

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.429 
flipper that you can get if you are
really<00:01:23.189> looking<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.090> bottom<00:01:24.900> bottom<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
really looking for a bottom bottom and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.670 
really looking for a bottom bottom and
flipper<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:28.200> good<00:01:28.409> enough<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
flipper that will be just good enough to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.819 
flipper that will be just good enough to
not<00:01:29.189> fall<00:01:29.400> apart<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.680> constructed<00:01:31.680> well

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
not fall apart and constructed well

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.690 
not fall apart and constructed well
enough<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.280> actually<00:01:32.460> flip<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.470> so

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
enough where you can actually flip it so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.830 
enough where you can actually flip it so
what<00:01:35.700> Glen<00:01:36.600> did<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.619> he<00:01:38.570> replaced<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
what Glen did was he replaced the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.219 
what Glen did was he replaced the
spacers<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.460> barrel<00:01:41.790> spacers<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
spacers with these barrel spacers the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.670 
spacers with these barrel spacers the
stock<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:43.770> comes<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.680> little

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
stock one comes with these little

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.940 
stock one comes with these little
triangle<00:01:47.430> looking<00:01:48.299> spacers<00:01:49.070> as<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.880> see

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
triangle looking spacers as you can see

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.170 
triangle looking spacers as you can see
so<00:01:52.950> he<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.430> barrel<00:01:54.210> spacers<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
so he got these barrel spacers and

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.040 
so he got these barrel spacers and
replaced<00:01:57.180> them

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
replaced them

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.310 
replaced them
view<00:01:58.650> like<00:01:58.830> this<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.900> think<00:02:00.900> they<00:02:00.990> look<00:02:01.140> really

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
view like this I think they look really

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.800 
view like this I think they look really
nice<00:02:01.620> they<00:02:02.010> make<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.340> knife<00:02:02.970> actually<00:02:03.210> look<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
nice they make the knife actually look a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.050 
nice they make the knife actually look a
lot<00:02:04.440> better<00:02:04.760> but<00:02:05.760> they<00:02:06.090> also<00:02:06.360> serve<00:02:06.870> a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
lot better but they also serve a

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
lot better but they also serve a
function<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.270> well<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:11.480> what<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.720> I'm

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
function as well and what they do I'm

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.570 
function as well and what they do I'm
just<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.710> show<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> outside<00:02:14.220> be

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
just going to show you the outside be

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.030 
just going to show you the outside be
real<00:02:14.760> quick

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
real quick

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.890 
real quick
you<00:02:17.040> can't<00:02:17.250> catch<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.640> camera<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.210> they're

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
you can't catch it on camera but they're

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.990 
you can't catch it on camera but they're
a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.080> bit<00:02:19.230> thinner<00:02:19.410> than<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.550> stock

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
a little bit thinner than the stock

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.540 
a little bit thinner than the stock
spacers<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.660> they<00:02:22.380> hold<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.920> handles<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
spacers so they hold the handles a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.990 
spacers so they hold the handles a
little<00:02:24.210> bit<00:02:24.360> closer<00:02:24.570> together<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:26.220> original

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
little bit closer together the original

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.840 
little bit closer together the original
mtech<00:02:27.510> twist<00:02:30.440> it's<00:02:31.440> hard<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.770> catch<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:32.640> but

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
mtech twist it's hard to catch here but

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.810 
mtech twist it's hard to catch here but
I'll<00:02:32.940> try<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.960> as<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.290> can<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:35.580> has

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
I'll try to get as you can see it has

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.330 
I'll try to get as you can see it has
stacked<00:02:36.270> spacers<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:38.160> got<00:02:38.340> two<00:02:39.240> on<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:40.230> two<00:02:41.100> on

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
stacked spacers it's got two on a two on

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.240 
stacked spacers it's got two on a two on
each<00:02:41.460> side<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:42.710> how<00:02:43.710> many<00:02:43.770> does<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.220> on

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
each side here how many does it have on

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.420 
each side here how many does it have on
this<00:02:44.490> side<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.210> it's<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:46.430> C<00:02:49.430> okay

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
this side here I think it's a C okay

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.500 
this side here I think it's a C okay
it's<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.890> one<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.460> it<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
it's just one it is it is one but it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's just one it is it is one but it
doesn't<00:02:54.720> even<00:02:54.750> look<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.140> same<00:02:55.700> now<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
doesn't even look like the same now it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.350 
doesn't even look like the same now it
is<00:02:56.910> -<00:02:58.070> yeah<00:02:59.070> it's<00:02:59.220> two<00:02:59.460> on<00:02:59.490> each<00:02:59.730> side<00:02:59.760> that's

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
is - yeah it's two on each side that's

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.400 
is - yeah it's two on each side that's
what<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.690> I'm<00:03:00.780> looking<00:03:01.200> through<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
what it is I'm looking through the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.820 
what it is I'm looking through the
viewfinder<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.070> can't<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.520> as<00:03:02.610> well<00:03:02.760> so

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
viewfinder so I can't see it as well so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.790 
viewfinder so I can't see it as well so
these<00:03:04.830> spacers<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:06.510> wider<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.530> they<00:03:07.650> had

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
these spacers a little wider so they had

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.310 
these spacers a little wider so they had
to<00:03:07.890> use<00:03:07.920> two<00:03:08.340> spacers<00:03:08.760> or<00:03:09.030> two<00:03:09.690> washers<00:03:10.050> excuse

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
to use two spacers or two washers excuse

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.860 
to use two spacers or two washers excuse
me<00:03:10.440> two<00:03:10.590> washers<00:03:11.040> two<00:03:11.910> washers<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.510> each<00:03:12.660> side

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
me two washers two washers on each side

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.440 
me two washers two washers on each side
of<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.680> each<00:03:13.830> side<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.190> blade<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:15.300> make

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
of the on each side of the blade to make

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.090 
of the on each side of the blade to make
sure<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:16.020> try<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.410> minimize<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> play

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
sure that to try to minimize the play

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.050 
sure that to try to minimize the play
and<00:03:17.280> even<00:03:17.370> even<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.540> play<00:03:19.610> it's<00:03:20.610> not<00:03:20.850> I

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
and even even then the play it's not I

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.850 
and even even then the play it's not I
mean<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.660> still<00:03:21.900> flip<00:03:22.050> but<00:03:22.410> as<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.770> can

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
mean you can still flip but as you can

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.710 
mean you can still flip but as you can
see<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.100> latch<00:03:23.310> can<00:03:24.209> actually<00:03:24.540> clear<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
see the latch can actually clear the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.410 
see the latch can actually clear the
handles<00:03:28.080> like<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.850> happens<00:03:30.239> sometimes

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
handles like so that happens sometimes

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.000 
handles like so that happens sometimes
when<00:03:30.660> you're<00:03:30.720> flipping<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.530> plays<00:03:31.739> enough

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
when you're flipping so the plays enough

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.350 
when you're flipping so the plays enough
where<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.400> happen<00:03:34.430> with<00:03:35.430> his<00:03:36.090> setup

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
where that can happen with his setup

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.570 
where that can happen with his setup
because<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.110> barrel<00:03:37.470> spacers<00:03:37.890> are<00:03:38.130> more

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
because the barrel spacers are more

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.270 
because the barrel spacers are more
narrow<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:40.520> only<00:03:41.520> needs<00:03:42.090> one<00:03:43.040> washer<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.220> each

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
narrow it only needs one washer on each

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.600 
narrow it only needs one washer on each
side<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.230> blade

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.560 

as<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.360> can<00:03:50.450> see<00:03:51.490> he<00:03:52.490> only<00:03:52.730> had<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.970> use<00:03:53.000> one<00:03:53.330> so

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
as you can see he only had to use one so

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.250 
as you can see he only had to use one so
that's<00:03:53.660> nice

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that's nice

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.360 
that's nice
helps<00:03:55.220> reduce<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.700> play<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:56.180> little<00:03:56.720> bit<00:03:56.990> and<00:03:57.950> I

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
helps reduce the play a little bit and I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.730 
helps reduce the play a little bit and I
just<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:59.080> don't<00:04:00.080> know<00:04:00.230> I'm<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:00.440> more

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
just I don't know I'm just more

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.930 
just I don't know I'm just more
comfortable<00:04:00.950> with<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.400> idea<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:01.730> there's

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
comfortable with the idea that there's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.670 
comfortable with the idea that there's
only<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.180> washer<00:04:02.690> required<00:04:03.200> on<00:04:03.350> each<00:04:03.470> side

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
only one washer required on each side

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.360 
only one washer required on each side
instead<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.060> eight<00:04:05.060> it's<00:04:05.690> big<00:04:05.900> washers<00:04:06.470> you

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
instead of eight it's big washers you

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.060 
instead of eight it's big washers you
only<00:04:07.490> need<00:04:07.670> for<00:04:07.910> like<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> normal<00:04:08.270> balisong<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
only need for like a normal balisong the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.760 
only need for like a normal balisong the
play<00:04:13.280> on<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:13.550> one<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.410> little<00:04:15.410> bit<00:04:15.590> less

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
play on this one is a little bit less

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.949 
play on this one is a little bit less
too<00:04:16.070> because<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.579> that<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.510> I'm<00:04:17.600> sure<00:04:17.750> if<00:04:17.870> I

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
too because of that and I'm sure if I

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.630 
too because of that and I'm sure if I
didn't<00:04:18.410> even<00:04:18.530> tighten<00:04:18.890> this<00:04:19.040> this<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.489> pretty

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
didn't even tighten this this is pretty

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.240 
didn't even tighten this this is pretty
much<00:04:20.290> just<00:04:21.290> me<00:04:21.440> flicking<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:21.890> for<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.070> little

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
much just me flicking it for a little

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.370 
much just me flicking it for a little
while<00:04:22.510> but<00:04:23.510> if<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.690> tighten<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.050> it'll<00:04:24.230> get<00:04:24.350> a

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
while but if you tighten it it'll get a

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.050 
while but if you tighten it it'll get a
little<00:04:24.500> bit<00:04:24.620> better<00:04:24.800> you'll<00:04:25.700> notice<00:04:25.940> there's

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
little bit better you'll notice there's

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.540 
little bit better you'll notice there's
no<00:04:26.150> latch<00:04:26.330> here<00:04:26.570> that's<00:04:26.840> not<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.860> way<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.370> came

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
no latch here that's not the way it came

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.030 
no latch here that's not the way it came
it<00:04:28.669> had<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> latch<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.540> literally<00:04:30.260> today<00:04:30.410> when

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
it had a latch and literally today when

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.770 
it had a latch and literally today when
I<00:04:31.070> was<00:04:31.190> flipping<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.669> I<00:04:31.850> didn't<00:04:32.419> lock<00:04:32.540> plate

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
I was flipping it I didn't lock plate

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.950 
I was flipping it I didn't lock plate
this<00:04:32.900> knife<00:04:33.110> down<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:34.310> latch<00:04:34.490> came<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
this knife down and the latch came the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.510 
this knife down and the latch came the
latch<00:04:36.140> screw<00:04:36.440> came<00:04:36.590> loose<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.040> fell<00:04:37.370> on<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
latch screw came loose and fell on the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.460 
latch screw came loose and fell on the
ground<00:04:37.669> unfortunately<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.390> had<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.570> latch<00:04:38.750> but

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
ground unfortunately I had the latch but

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.310 
ground unfortunately I had the latch but
I<00:04:39.500> can't<00:04:39.710> find<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.100> screw<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.270> now<00:04:42.110> it's<00:04:42.260> a

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
I can't find the screw so now it's a

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.370 
I can't find the screw so now it's a
latch<00:04:42.470> lisore<00:04:42.950> balisong<00:04:43.610> for<00:04:44.030> now<00:04:44.150> not<00:04:45.140> a<00:04:45.200> big

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
latch lisore balisong for now not a big

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.100 
latch lisore balisong for now not a big
deal<00:04:45.560> though<00:04:46.270> one<00:04:47.270> other<00:04:47.419> thing<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:47.720> did<00:04:47.930> notice

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
deal though one other thing I did notice

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.530 
deal though one other thing I did notice
with<00:04:48.530> between<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.910> this<00:04:50.030> isn't<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.360> mod

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
with between the and this isn't a mod

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.810 
with between the and this isn't a mod
that<00:04:50.990> Glenn<00:04:51.169> did<00:04:51.350> but<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.130> gunmetal<00:04:52.550> one

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
that Glenn did but the gunmetal one

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.680 
that Glenn did but the gunmetal one
seems<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:56.290> more<00:04:57.290> focused<00:04:58.330> as<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.390> metal

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
seems to have a more focused as a metal

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.080 
seems to have a more focused as a metal
one<00:04:59.840> it's<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.590> little<00:05:00.770> bit<00:05:00.890> more<00:05:01.070> sticky<00:05:01.850> and

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
one it's a little bit more sticky and

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.500 
one it's a little bit more sticky and
tacky<00:05:03.040> so<00:05:04.040> that's<00:05:04.400> kind<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.610> kind<00:05:05.090> of<00:05:05.210> nice<00:05:05.360> I

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
tacky so that's kind of kind of nice I

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.340 
tacky so that's kind of kind of nice I
don't<00:05:05.570> know<00:05:05.720> some<00:05:05.960> people<00:05:06.140> might<00:05:06.229> actually

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
don't know some people might actually

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.530 
don't know some people might actually
not<00:05:06.680> like<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:07.010> but<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.430> think<00:05:07.880> it's<00:05:08.150> kind<00:05:08.510> of

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
not like that but I think it's kind of

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.920 
not like that but I think it's kind of
nice<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.830> that's<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.840> Glen<00:05:11.840> tech<00:05:12.110> twist<00:05:13.930> as

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
nice so that's the Glen tech twist as

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.030 
nice so that's the Glen tech twist as
far<00:05:15.229> as<00:05:16.120> flipping<00:05:17.120> performance<00:05:18.040> they

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
far as flipping performance they

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.860 
far as flipping performance they
function<00:05:20.000> pretty<00:05:20.240> much<00:05:20.479> the<00:05:20.600> same<00:05:20.810> the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
function pretty much the same the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.510 
function pretty much the same the
difference<00:05:21.440> in<00:05:21.770> weight<00:05:21.860> between<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.280> barrel

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
difference in weight between the barrel

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.330 
difference in weight between the barrel
spacers<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.450> standard<00:05:23.810> spacers<00:05:24.500> it's

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
spacers and the standard spacers it's

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.070 
spacers and the standard spacers it's
not<00:05:25.580> a<00:05:25.820> enormous<00:05:26.690> difference<00:05:27.790> the<00:05:28.960> action<00:05:29.960> on

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
not a enormous difference the action on

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.170 
not a enormous difference the action on
this<00:05:30.260> one<00:05:30.530> feels<00:05:31.010> a<00:05:31.310> little<00:05:31.550> bit<00:05:31.729> tighter<00:05:31.910> just

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
this one feels a little bit tighter just

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.120 
this one feels a little bit tighter just
because<00:05:32.419> it<00:05:32.840> only<00:05:33.020> requires<00:05:33.380> one<00:05:33.620> washer<00:05:33.950> on

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
because it only requires one washer on

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.920 
because it only requires one washer on
your<00:05:34.490> side<00:05:34.700> and<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.360> plays<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:35.600> little<00:05:35.840> bit

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
your side and the plays a little bit

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.340 
your side and the plays a little bit
less<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.740> that's<00:05:36.890> kind<00:05:37.100> of<00:05:37.130> nice<00:05:38.200> by<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.229> way

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
less so that's kind of nice by the way

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.620 
less so that's kind of nice by the way
uses<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:39.970> one<00:05:40.970> thing<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.150> did<00:05:41.270> forget<00:05:41.390> to<00:05:41.540> mention

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
uses a one thing I did forget to mention

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.110 
uses a one thing I did forget to mention
the<00:05:41.900> washers<00:05:42.229> use<00:05:42.530> on<00:05:42.830> this<00:05:43.040> on<00:05:43.310> his<00:05:43.880> mod

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
the washers use on this on his mod

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.630 
the washers use on this on his mod
modded<00:05:44.660> version<00:05:44.690> or<00:05:45.080> nylon<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:46.430> he's<00:05:46.550> going

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
modded version or nylon and he's going

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.180 
modded version or nylon and he's going
to<00:05:46.700> try<00:05:46.910> some<00:05:47.180> different<00:05:47.300> a<00:05:47.660> different

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
to try some different a different

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.490 
to try some different a different
material<00:05:49.190> as<00:05:49.340> well<00:05:49.610> but<00:05:50.050> 9-month<00:05:51.050> was<00:05:51.229> what

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
material as well but 9-month was what

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.930 
material as well but 9-month was what
was<00:05:51.620> used<00:05:51.650> on<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:51.950> first<00:05:52.190> Brad<00:05:52.430> the<00:05:52.550> Kamara

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
was used on the first Brad the Kamara

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.180 
was used on the first Brad the Kamara
I<00:05:53.060> had<00:05:53.330> no<00:05:53.510> issues<00:05:53.840> with<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.020> at<00:05:54.200> all<00:05:54.490> so<00:05:55.490> I<00:05:57.190> just

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
I had no issues with it at all so I just

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.210 
I had no issues with it at all so I just
think<00:05:58.430> swings<00:05:58.700> fine<00:05:58.910> I<00:05:59.120> put<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.390> drop<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:00.410> lube

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
think swings fine I put a drop of a lube

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.340 
think swings fine I put a drop of a lube
on<00:06:01.400> it<00:06:01.550> and

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
on it and

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.920 
on it and
if<00:06:02.590> it<00:06:02.920> swings<00:06:03.220> just<00:06:03.370> as<00:06:03.580> freely<00:06:03.910> as<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.270> stock

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
if it swings just as freely as the stock

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.590 
if it swings just as freely as the stock
model<00:06:05.260> I<00:06:06.070> really<00:06:06.760> don't<00:06:06.910> feel<00:06:07.120> too<00:06:07.330> much<00:06:07.360> of<00:06:07.570> a

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
model I really don't feel too much of a

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.450 
model I really don't feel too much of a
difference<00:06:07.900> in<00:06:08.020> performance<00:06:08.190> other<00:06:09.190> than

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
difference in performance other than

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.220 
difference in performance other than
that<00:06:09.640> this<00:06:09.760> one's<00:06:10.000> just<00:06:10.090> um<00:06:10.450> I<00:06:10.630> feel<00:06:10.960> it's<00:06:11.080> just

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
that this one's just um I feel it's just

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.080 
that this one's just um I feel it's just
a<00:06:11.290> little<00:06:11.530> bit<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.830> little<00:06:12.580> bit<00:06:12.670> tighter<00:06:12.850> so

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
a little bit a little bit tighter so

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.910 
a little bit a little bit tighter so
that's<00:06:13.420> nice

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
that's nice

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.360

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
so it's um pretty cool modification for

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.040 
so it's um pretty cool modification for
a<00:06:18.400> very<00:06:19.000> entry-level<00:06:19.500> balisong<00:06:20.500> I<00:06:21.960> don't<00:06:22.960> know

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050
