contest<00:04:28.789> no<00:04:29.120> time<00:04:29.389> just<00:04:29.720> due<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.259> fact

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
contest no time just due to the fact

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.040

that<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:31.130> head<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.940> cup<00:04:32.150> was<00:04:32.389> caused<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:32.930> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
that the head the cup was caused as a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.210 
that the head the cup was caused as a
result<00:04:33.199> of<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.590> headbutt<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:36.470> doctor<00:04:36.979> or

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
result of a headbutt and the doctor or

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.249 
result of a headbutt and the doctor or
the<00:04:37.460> fighter<00:04:37.729> was<00:04:37.970> somebody<00:04:38.449> said<00:04:39.139> he

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
the fighter was somebody said he

couldn't continue

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.070 
couldn't continue
hence<00:04:40.729> it<00:04:40.910> makes<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.360> as<00:04:41.509> a<00:04:41.539> result<00:04:41.900> of<00:04:42.020> a

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
hence it makes it as a result of a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.379 
hence it makes it as a result of a
Powell<00:04:42.289> it's<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.710> no<00:04:42.830> contest<00:04:43.600> well<00:04:46.389> neither

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
fighter wanted this that's for sure and

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.350 
fighter wanted this that's for sure and
so<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.620> no<00:04:51.979> contest<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.820> likely<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.240> be

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
so a no contest is likely to be
