in a 1.9 gigahertz quad-core processor

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500 
in a 1.9 gigahertz quad-core processor
but<00:00:22.560> Samsung<00:00:23.160> felt<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.880> course<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.480> not

but Samsung felt that for course was not

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.439 
but Samsung felt that for course was not
enough<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:25.590> added<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.070> second<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:27.150> point

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
enough so they added a second one point

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.160 
three gigahertz quad-core processor
which<00:00:29.640> means<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.150> an<00:00:30.689> octa-core

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
which means it has an octa-core

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.979 
which means it has an octa-core
structure<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.430> also<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:33.030> 3<00:00:33.420> gigabytes<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989

for verizon which is less powerful
because<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.120> only<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.360> quad-core<00:03:30.720> processor

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
because it's only a quad-core processor

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.610 
because it's only a quad-core processor
it's<00:03:32.100> only<00:03:32.340> one<00:03:32.640> quad<00:03:32.940> core<00:03:33.180> processor<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.959> it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
it's only one quad core processor and it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.470 
it's only one quad core processor and it
will<00:03:34.769> be<00:03:34.920> more<00:03:35.220> expensive<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.970> mean<00:03:36.120> most<00:03:36.269> of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
will be more expensive I mean most of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.509 
will be more expensive I mean most of
them<00:03:36.600> are<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.260> this<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.739> definitely<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> niche

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
them are so this is definitely a niche

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.430 
them are so this is definitely a niche
product<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.480> nonetheless<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.930> will<00:03:40.170> be<00:03:40.230> fun

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
product but nonetheless it will be fun

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.350 
product but nonetheless it will be fun
