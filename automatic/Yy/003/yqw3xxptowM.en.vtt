its<00:00:57.750> new<00:00:57.930> technology<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.920> developed<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
its new technology that we developed to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.389 
its new technology that we developed to
combine<00:01:00.510> both<00:01:00.780> power<00:01:01.109> high<00:01:01.620> speed<00:01:01.859> data<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
works or maybe pick the thing up and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340 
works or maybe pick the thing up and
show<00:01:08.520> us<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.790> we've<00:01:08.909> got<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.299> yeah<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.230 
show us what we've got on here yeah so
what<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.010> our<00:01:11.189> first<00:01:11.430> product<00:01:11.970> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
what this is it's our first product that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
what this is it's our first product that
leverages<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.750> new<00:01:13.170> technology

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
leverages this new technology

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.980 
leverages this new technology
so<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> our<00:01:14.670> ThinkPad<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.540> link<00:01:15.780> dock

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so this is our ThinkPad one link dock

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
so this is our ThinkPad one link dock
and<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and here you can actually see the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.359 
and here you can actually see the
connection<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.040> portion<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
connection so you can see the portion of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
connection so you can see the portion of
the<00:01:20.460> connector<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.790> carries<00:01:21.240> both<00:01:21.390> USB<00:01:21.750> 3

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the connector that carries both USB 3

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.490 
the connector that carries both USB 3
and<00:01:22.140> native<00:01:22.740> video<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.180> also<00:01:24.540> power<00:01:24.869> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and native video and then also power so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.640 
and native video and then also power so
what<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.740> does<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:27.470> system<00:01:28.470> gets

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
what this does for you is system gets

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
what this does for you is system gets
there<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.700> lack<00:01:29.909> docking<00:01:30.479> connectors

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
there and they lack docking connectors

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
there and they lack docking connectors
people<00:01:31.079> still<00:01:31.409> ended<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.009> opportunity<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
people still ended the opportunity to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.510 
people still ended the opportunity to
expand<00:01:33.450> their<00:01:33.869> system<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.950> need<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> ports

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
expand their system they need the ports

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.789 
expand their system they need the ports
so<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.420> ends<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.659> forcing<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> do

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
so what that ends up forcing them to do

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.100 
so what that ends up forcing them to do
is<00:01:37.950> use<00:01:38.130> external<00:01:38.880> port<00:01:39.420> replicators<00:01:39.869> such<00:01:39.990> as

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is use external port replicators such as

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.040 
is use external port replicators such as
this

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.740 
this
and<00:01:42.350> they<00:01:42.470> use<00:01:42.590> usb3<00:01:43.220> right<00:01:43.820> one<00:01:44.600> of<00:01:44.690> the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
and they use usb3 right one of the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.510 
and they use usb3 right one of the
downsides<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.410> USB<00:01:45.710> 3<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.250> still

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
downsides to USB 3 is that you still

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.740 
downsides to USB 3 is that you still
have<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.640> plug<00:01:46.820> in<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.000> second<00:01:47.270> cable<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> power

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
have to plug in a second cable to power

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.230 
have to plug in a second cable to power
your<00:01:47.900> notebook<00:01:48.280> what<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.430> does<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.820> solves

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
your notebook what this does it solves

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240 
your notebook what this does it solves
for<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.540> everything<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.470> over<00:01:51.590> one<00:01:51.860> single

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
for that everything is over one single

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.160 
for that everything is over one single
cable<00:01:52.400> no<00:01:53.240> one<00:01:53.390> else<00:01:53.510> in<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.720> industry<00:01:53.810> has

cable no one else in the industry has

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
very cool so yeah there is there is an

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.920 
very cool so yeah there is there is an
irony<00:02:01.729> sometimes<00:02:02.300> when<00:02:02.450> people<00:02:02.479> get<00:02:02.780> these

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
irony sometimes when people get these

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.420 
irony sometimes when people get these
thin<00:02:03.229> laptops<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.860> then<00:02:03.950> they're<00:02:04.040> connecting

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
thin laptops and then they're connecting

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.980 
thin laptops and then they're connecting
all<00:02:04.520> these<00:02:04.700> things<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.420> cables<00:02:05.810> are<00:02:05.900> all

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
all these things and the cables are all

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.940 
all these things and the cables are all
over<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.260> place<00:02:06.470> it's<00:02:06.680> sort<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:06.860> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
over the place it's sort of the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.680 
over the place it's sort of the
simplicity<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.580> everything<00:02:08.179> goes<00:02:08.420> out<00:02:08.539> the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
simplicity and everything goes out the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.540 
simplicity and everything goes out the
window<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.229> there's<00:02:09.649> no<00:02:09.709> remedies<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.490> I

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
window so there's no remedies that I

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.610 
window so there's no remedies that I
guess<00:02:10.820> exactly<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.450> there's<00:02:11.630> nothing<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.530> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
guess exactly so there's nothing in the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.140 
guess exactly so there's nothing in the
industry<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.070> lets<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.340> do<00:02:13.490> this<00:02:13.640> over<00:02:14.000> one

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
industry that lets you do this over one

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.210 
industry that lets you do this over one
cable<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.600> definitely<00:02:15.590> nothing<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:15.890> industry

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
cable and definitely nothing in industry

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.970 
cable and definitely nothing in industry
