I woke up this morning I looked at the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
I woke up this morning I looked at the
specs<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.650> new<00:00:25.740> mac<00:00:25.920> mini<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.730> was

specs for the new mac mini and I was
literally<00:00:27.150> blown<00:00:27.359> away<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.380> told<00:00:28.769> myself<00:00:28.949> I'm

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
literally blown away I I told myself I'm

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.880 
literally blown away I I told myself I'm
like<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.880> days<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.510> people<00:00:31.289> calling<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.710> mac

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
like the days of people calling the mac

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.139 
like the days of people calling the mac
meaning<00:00:32.219> slow<00:00:32.550> or<00:00:33.469> officially<00:00:34.469> over<00:00:34.910> sure<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
meaning slow or officially over sure the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.450 
meaning slow or officially over sure the
Mac<00:00:36.329> Mini<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:37.040> intended<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.100> video<00:00:38.430> games

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
Mac Mini is not intended for video games

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.190 
Mac Mini is not intended for video games
and<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.149> still<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.450> intended<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:39.930> video

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and it's still not intended for video

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900 
and it's still not intended for video
games<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.340> people<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.700> there

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
games so for all you people out there

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.010 
games so for all you people out there
that<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.059> thinking<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:42.570> maybe<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.840> should

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that are thinking well maybe I should

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.979 
that are thinking well maybe I should
get<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> mac<00:00:43.320> mini<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.710> video<00:00:43.890> games<00:00:43.950> well

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
get a mac mini for video games well

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.709 
get a mac mini for video games well
Apple<00:00:45.989> kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> dropped<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.640> discrete<00:00:48.450> card

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
Apple kind of dropped the discrete card

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.959 
Apple kind of dropped the discrete card
so<00:00:49.020> all<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.469> are<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> intel<00:00:50.610> HD

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so all you have are just the intel HD

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.470 
so all you have are just the intel HD
graphics<00:00:51.000> 4000<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.469> those<00:00:52.860> those<00:00:53.480> integrated

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
graphics 4000 so those those integrated

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
graphics 4000 so those those integrated
cards<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.379> designed<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.860> gaming

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
cards are not really designed for gaming

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
cards are not really designed for gaming
so<00:00:56.640> gaming<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.510> completely<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
so gaming is completely out of the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
so gaming is completely out of the
picture<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.430> I'll<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.120> minute

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
picture but I'll get to that in a minute

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.549 
picture but I'll get to that in a minute
let's<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.719> over<00:01:00.840> some<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> models

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
let's just go over some of the models

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.860 
let's just go over some of the models
right<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> base<00:01:03.059> model<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.570> basically

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
right now so the base model is basically

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.789 
right now so the base model is basically
the<00:01:04.350> previous<00:01:04.830> generation<00:01:06.290> top<00:01:07.290> end<00:01:07.500> model

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the previous generation top end model

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.850 
the previous generation top end model
which<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> 2.5<00:01:08.610> dual<00:01:09.240> core<00:01:09.770> instead<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
which is a 2.5 dual core instead of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.440 
which is a 2.5 dual core instead of
having<00:01:11.040> discrete<00:01:11.490> graphics<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> have

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
having discrete graphics now you have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.070 
having discrete graphics now you have
the<00:01:12.689> HD<00:01:13.110> graphics<00:01:13.470> 4000<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:15.540> guess

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the HD graphics 4000 which is I guess

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.490 
the HD graphics 4000 which is I guess
it's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> step<00:01:16.680> down<00:01:16.890> slightly<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:18.500> overall

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
it's a step down slightly but overall

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580 
it's a step down slightly but overall
the<00:01:19.740> system<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.159> pretty<00:01:20.369> great<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.909> least<00:01:21.590> 44

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the system is pretty great at least 44

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.140 
the system is pretty great at least 44
people<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:22.979> looking<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.430> an<00:01:23.670> entry

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
people that are looking for an entry

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.260 
people that are looking for an entry
model<00:01:24.330> into<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> OS<00:01:25.680> 10<00:01:25.890> universe<00:01:26.310> 00<00:01:26.850> s10

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
model into the OS 10 universe 00 s10

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.469 
model into the OS 10 universe 00 s10
universe<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.850> were<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> look<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
universe so if we were to look at the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.840 
universe so if we were to look at the
first<00:01:31.079> let's<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.520> bring<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> up

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
first let's see if I could bring it up

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.719 
first let's see if I could bring it up
right<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.150> um<00:01:33.860> look<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> first<00:01:35.250> model<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
right now um look at the first model the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
right now um look at the first model the
only<00:01:35.909> thing<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> could<00:01:36.210> change<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> RAM

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
only thing you could change is the RAM

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
only thing you could change is the RAM
and<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.130> course<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> are<00:01:38.939> thinking<00:01:39.119> about

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and of course if you are thinking about

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.060 
and of course if you are thinking about
it<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.659> model<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> buy<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> RAM

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it in this model do not buy the RAM

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.219 
it in this model do not buy the RAM
directly<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.880> apple<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.079> going

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
directly from apple because it is going

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.359 
directly from apple because it is going
to<00:01:43.290> cost<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> lot<00:01:43.710> more<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.100> easily

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to cost you a lot more you can easily

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
to cost you a lot more you can easily
get<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.329> RAM<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> third<00:01:46.380> party

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
get the the RAM from a third party

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.090 
get the the RAM from a third party
vendor<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.960> probably<00:01:49.320> get<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.619> 100<00:01:50.070> bucks

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
vendor you probably get it for 100 bucks

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
vendor you probably get it for 100 bucks
and<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.610> 16<00:01:50.970> gigs<00:01:51.119> around<00:01:51.240> 400<00:01:51.780> bucks<00:01:51.930> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and get 16 gigs around 400 bucks so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.450 
and get 16 gigs around 400 bucks so
that's<00:01:52.710> basically<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> only<00:01:53.189> thing<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that's basically the only thing you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
that's basically the only thing you
could<00:01:53.549> change<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> first<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.390> um<00:01:54.770> if<00:01:55.770> we

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
could change for the first one um if we

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.440 
could change for the first one um if we
were<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.040> move<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> second<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
were to move to the second one which is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.609 
were to move to the second one which is
the<00:01:57.750> model<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.320> strongly

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the model that I would strongly

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.660 
the model that I would strongly
recommend<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> are<00:01:59.340> thinking<00:01:59.460> about

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
to get into the quad core systems you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.940

can<00:02:16.030> actually<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.450> get<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.900> regular<00:02:17.349> mac<00:02:17.709> mini

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
can actually just get a regular mac mini

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.729 
can actually just get a regular mac mini
and<00:02:19.050> jump<00:02:20.050> into<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> quad<00:02:20.830> core<00:02:21.130> game<00:02:21.700> and

and jump into the quad core game and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.559 
and jump into the quad core game and
that's<00:02:23.739> kind<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.099> nice<00:02:24.220> upgrade<00:02:24.489> again<00:02:25.390> with

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
that's kind of a nice upgrade again with

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.690 
that's kind of a nice upgrade again with
the<00:02:25.660> memory<00:02:25.959> get<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.800> memory<00:02:27.130> somewhere<00:02:27.430> else

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
the memory get the memory somewhere else

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.940 
the memory get the memory somewhere else
you'll<00:02:27.910> save<00:02:28.120> money<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.349> in<00:02:29.650> terms<00:02:29.800> of

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
you'll save money and now in terms of

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.140 
you'll save money and now in terms of
hard<00:02:30.130> drive<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.489> have<00:02:30.640> three<00:02:31.000> different

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
hard drive we have three different

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.339 
hard drive we have three different
options<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.660> we<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:31.989> an<00:02:32.140> interesting

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
options and we have an interesting

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.839 
options and we have an interesting
option<00:02:32.709> two<00:02:33.010> we<00:02:33.250> have<00:02:33.400> something<00:02:33.700> that's

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
option two we have something that's

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.670 
option two we have something that's
called<00:02:34.000> fusion<00:02:34.330> drive<00:02:34.690> basically<00:02:35.560> what

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
called fusion drive basically what

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.790 
called fusion drive basically what
fusion<00:02:35.980> drive<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.230> have<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> solid

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
fusion drive is is you you have a solid

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.650 
fusion drive is is you you have a solid
state<00:02:39.069> drive<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.550> also<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.269> regular

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
state drive and you also have a regular

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.290 
state drive and you also have a regular
hard<00:02:40.870> drive<00:02:41.050> as<00:02:41.200> well<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.880> system<00:02:43.180> is

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
hard drive as well so the system is

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.620 
hard drive as well so the system is
going<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.540> be<00:02:43.660> intelligently<00:02:44.440> deciding<00:02:45.630> what

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
going to be intelligently deciding what

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.960 
going to be intelligently deciding what
files<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.110> use<00:02:47.350> on<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.799> regular<00:02:47.950> basis<00:02:48.640> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
files you use on a regular basis and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.490 
files you use on a regular basis and
those<00:02:49.150> files<00:02:49.390> are<00:02:49.510> gonna<00:02:49.690> be<00:02:49.750> stored<00:02:50.080> into

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
those files are gonna be stored into

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.280 
those files are gonna be stored into
that<00:02:50.680> super<00:02:51.160> fast<00:02:51.430> SSD<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.870> only<00:02:53.019> thing<00:02:53.170> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that super fast SSD the only thing that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.600 
that super fast SSD the only thing that
I'm<00:02:53.350> concerned<00:02:53.410> about<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.340> want<00:02:54.549> to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
I'm concerned about this is I want to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.410 
I'm concerned about this is I want to
know<00:02:54.700> how<00:02:54.850> fast<00:02:55.239> this<00:02:55.900> Drive<00:02:56.530> actually<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.640> all

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
know how fast this Drive actually is all

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.180 
know how fast this Drive actually is all
we<00:02:58.569> actually<00:02:58.840> get<00:02:58.989> from<00:02:59.140> Apple<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.799> it's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
we actually get from Apple is that it's

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.190 
we actually get from Apple is that it's
two<00:03:00.400> times<00:03:00.580> faster<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.239> three<00:03:01.599> times<00:03:01.810> faster

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
two times faster is three times faster

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.080 
two times faster is three times faster
and<00:03:02.500> all<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.739> stuff<00:03:02.860> unless<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.670> specs<00:03:03.970> I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
and all this stuff unless the specs I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.360 
and all this stuff unless the specs I
want<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.299> see<00:03:04.420> what<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.989> reading<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
want to see what is the reading and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.509 
want to see what is the reading and
write<00:03:06.700> speeds<00:03:06.849> of<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:07.450> SSD<00:03:08.280> because<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.400> it's

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
write speeds of this SSD because if it's

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.190 
write speeds of this SSD because if it's
not<00:03:09.580> fast<00:03:09.849> enough<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.180> mean<00:03:10.299> I'll<00:03:10.540> just<00:03:10.840> put<00:03:11.080> my

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
not fast enough I mean I'll just put my

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.360 
not fast enough I mean I'll just put my

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
be said you'll have a computer for the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.170 
be said you'll have a computer for the
next<00:03:23.019> couple<00:03:23.109> of<00:03:23.260> years<00:03:23.579> if<00:03:24.579> not<00:03:24.640> if<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.060> want

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
next couple of years if not if you want

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.640 
next couple of years if not if you want
to<00:03:25.239> save<00:03:25.359> those<00:03:25.450> those<00:03:25.870> hundred<00:03:26.230> dollars<00:03:26.500> you

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
to save those those hundred dollars you

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.009 
to save those those hundred dollars you
could<00:03:26.769> just<00:03:26.829> get<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.100> 2.3<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:28.810> money

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
could just get to 2.3 and that money

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.800 
could just get to 2.3 and that money
that<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.319> save<00:03:29.560> try<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> invest<00:03:30.819> in<00:03:30.940> an<00:03:31.090> SSD<00:03:31.540> or

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
that you save try to invest in an SSD or

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.590 
that you save try to invest in an SSD or
if<00:03:32.260> not<00:03:32.440> get<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.890> fusion<00:03:33.459> drive<00:03:33.819> because

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
if not get the fusion drive because

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.030 
if not get the fusion drive because
honestly<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.109> can<00:03:35.319> have<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> super<00:03:35.859> fast

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
honestly you can have a super fast

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.280 
honestly you can have a super fast
processor<00:03:36.609> but<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:36.910> don't<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:37.209> an<00:03:37.390> SSD<00:03:37.810> to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
processor but you don't have an SSD to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.660 
processor but you don't have an SSD to
go<00:03:38.470> along<00:03:38.680> with<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:38.890> it's<00:03:39.190> not<00:03:39.340> really<00:03:39.549> going

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
go along with it it's not really going

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.520 
go along with it it's not really going
to<00:03:39.730> make<00:03:39.850> much<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.299> difference<00:03:40.690> now<00:03:41.290> moving

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
to make much of a difference now moving

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.490 
to make much of a difference now moving
on<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.239> mac<00:03:43.389> mini<00:03:43.420> server<00:03:43.840> on<00:03:44.170> this

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
on to the to the mac mini server on this

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.020 
on to the to the mac mini server on this
one<00:03:44.739> it's<00:03:45.010> basically<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.400> same<00:03:45.579> as<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.880> one<00:03:46.000> I

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
one it's basically the same as the one I

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.400 
one it's basically the same as the one I
was<00:03:46.269> talking<00:03:46.389> about<00:03:46.600> before<00:03:46.840> but<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.290> only

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
was talking about before but the only

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.900 
was talking about before but the only
difference<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.130> can<00:03:48.519> actually<00:03:48.549> have

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
difference is that you can actually have

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.059 
difference is that you can actually have
two<00:03:49.150> drives<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.530> comes<00:03:50.709> with<00:03:50.920> two

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
two drives in it so it comes with two

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.270 
two drives in it so it comes with two
gigs<00:03:51.400> two<00:03:51.880> gigs<00:03:52.329> two<00:03:52.840> terabyte<00:03:53.470> hard<00:03:53.950> drives

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
gigs two gigs two terabyte hard drives

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.759 
gigs two gigs two terabyte hard drives
stock<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.690> mean<00:03:55.840> if<00:03:55.989> you're<00:03:56.380> really<00:03:56.650> going

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
stock so I mean if you're really going

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.710 
stock so I mean if you're really going
to<00:03:56.829> use<00:03:57.010> this<00:03:57.190> as<00:03:57.400> an<00:03:57.880> actual<00:03:58.090> server<00:03:58.359> then<00:03:58.630> I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
to use this as an actual server then I

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.599 
to use this as an actual server then I
would<00:03:58.840> recommend<00:03:59.109> this<00:03:59.380> because<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.250> mean<00:04:00.489> if

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
would recommend this because I mean if

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.330 
would recommend this because I mean if
not<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.780> go<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.109> the<00:04:02.139> regular<00:04:02.560> one<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:03.130> top

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
not just go with the regular one the top

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.220 
not just go with the regular one the top
end<00:04:03.549> model<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.090> try<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.269> get<00:04:04.450> an<00:04:04.540> SSD<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.049> there

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
end model and try to get an SSD in there

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.830 
end model and try to get an SSD in there
or<00:04:05.410> if<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.040> plan<00:04:06.579> on<00:04:06.819> doing<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.690> work

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
or if you plan on doing the work

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.530 
or if you plan on doing the work
yourself<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.530> swapping<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:10.120> hard<00:04:10.329> drives

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
yourself and swapping the hard drives

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.530 
yourself and swapping the hard drives
yourself<00:04:10.930> then<00:04:11.250> maybe<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.430> server<00:04:12.670> could<00:04:13.359> be

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
yourself then maybe the server could be

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.199 
yourself then maybe the server could be
an<00:04:13.870> actual<00:04:14.260> option<00:04:14.799> but<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:15.430> doesn't<00:04:15.730> hey<00:04:15.880> it

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
an actual option but it doesn't hey it

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.060 
an actual option but it doesn't hey it
doesn't<00:04:16.570> doesn't<00:04:17.289> have<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:17.769> an<00:04:17.859> actual

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
doesn't doesn't have to be an actual

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.659 
doesn't doesn't have to be an actual
option<00:04:18.459> now<00:04:18.639> that's<00:04:19.450> hop<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.810> 2.3<00:04:20.410> quad<00:04:21.370> core

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
option now that's hop in 2.3 quad core

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.940 
option now that's hop in 2.3 quad core
machine<00:04:22.000> has<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.900> doesn't<00:04:23.260> I'm<00:04:23.530> pretty<00:04:23.590> sure

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
machine has it doesn't I'm pretty sure

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.580 
machine has it doesn't I'm pretty sure
it<00:04:24.070> has<00:04:24.190> space<00:04:25.150> for<00:04:25.180> two<00:04:25.630> hard<00:04:25.870> drives<00:04:25.990> they

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
it has space for two hard drives they

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.920 
it has space for two hard drives they
just

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
just

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.840 
just
advertise<00:04:27.289> it<00:04:27.440> as<00:04:27.680> is<00:04:27.889> having<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.430> space<00:04:28.669> for

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
advertise it as is having to space for

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.279 
advertise it as is having to space for
two<00:04:28.940> hard<00:04:29.150> drives<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.509> i'm<00:04:29.900> pretty<00:04:29.990> sure<00:04:30.169> it's

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
two hard drives and i'm pretty sure it's

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.360 
two hard drives and i'm pretty sure it's
going<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.470> be<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.590> same<00:04:30.740> thing<00:04:30.979> with<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
going to be the same thing with the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.710 
going to be the same thing with the
previous<00:04:31.729> generation<00:04:31.759> where<00:04:32.389> you<00:04:32.479> have<00:04:32.600> to

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
previous generation where you have to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.090 
previous generation where you have to
buy<00:04:32.810> an<00:04:32.930> adapter<00:04:33.139> to<00:04:33.410> be<00:04:33.500> able<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.740> put<00:04:33.889> two

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
buy an adapter to be able to put two

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.180 
buy an adapter to be able to put two
drives<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.729> it<00:04:34.940> but<00:04:35.389> it<00:04:35.539> is<00:04:35.690> possible<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.949> in

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
drives in it but it is possible so in

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.120 
drives in it but it is possible so in
reality<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:38.030> OS<00:04:38.389> 10<00:04:38.630> server<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.259> you<00:04:39.949> can

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
reality the OS 10 server is you can

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.070 
reality the OS 10 server is you can
literally<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.639> eliminate<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.479> people

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
literally just eliminate it and people

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.510 
literally just eliminate it and people
are<00:04:42.470> really<00:04:42.800> going<00:04:43.009> to<00:04:43.100> be<00:04:43.190> getting<00:04:43.430> the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
are really going to be getting the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.210 
are really going to be getting the
server<00:04:43.759> as<00:04:44.060> an<00:04:44.539> actual<00:04:44.840> server<00:04:45.139> because<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
server as an actual server because the

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.180 
server as an actual server because the
benefits<00:04:46.639> are<00:04:46.759> not<00:04:47.000> really<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:48.590> dramatic

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
benefits are not really that dramatic

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.310 
benefits are not really that dramatic
anymore<00:04:49.580> before<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.720> people<00:04:50.960> want<00:04:51.110> for<00:04:51.259> the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
anymore before the people want for the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.689 
anymore before the people want for the
service<00:04:51.590> because<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.919> wanted<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.250> quad<00:04:52.430> core

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
service because I wanted the quad core

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.310 
service because I wanted the quad core
system<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.330> now<00:04:53.389> you<00:04:53.449> have<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.900> quad<00:04:54.080> core

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
system and now you have the quad core

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.439 
system and now you have the quad core
system<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:54.800> have<00:04:55.009> slightly<00:04:55.669> better<00:04:55.910> graphics

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
system you have slightly better graphics

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.850 
system you have slightly better graphics
and<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:57.020> know<00:04:57.110> one<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.560> things<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.740> I

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
and you know one of the things that I

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.320 
and you know one of the things that I
want<00:04:58.009> to<00:04:58.070> talk<00:04:58.280> about<00:04:58.310> is<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.759> actual

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
want to talk about is the actual

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.330 
want to talk about is the actual
graphics<00:04:59.660> now<00:04:59.810> um<00:05:00.849> what<00:05:01.849> how<00:05:02.090> did<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.389> HD

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
graphics now um what how did the HD

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.439 
graphics now um what how did the HD
graphics<00:05:04.340> 4000<00:05:04.820> compared<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> previous

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
graphics 4000 compared to the previous

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.969 
graphics 4000 compared to the previous
generation<00:05:05.630> discrete<00:05:06.500> AMD<00:05:06.710> graphics<00:05:08.979> still

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
generation discrete AMD graphics still

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.740 
generation discrete AMD graphics still
the<00:05:10.130> discrete<00:05:10.490> graphics<00:05:10.639> are<00:05:10.970> still<00:05:11.539> better

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
the discrete graphics are still better

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.370 
the discrete graphics are still better
because<00:05:12.199> you<00:05:12.349> you<00:05:13.150> you<00:05:14.150> have<00:05:14.180> onboard<00:05:14.930> memory

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
because you you you have onboard memory

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.779 
because you you you have onboard memory
for<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.860> actual<00:05:16.130> system<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:16.699> not

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
for the actual system so it's not

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.029 
for the actual system so it's not
actually<00:05:17.180> stealing<00:05:17.479> from<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.470> RAM<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.889> the

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
actually stealing from the RAM of the

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.760 
actually stealing from the RAM of the
system<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:20.750> don't<00:05:21.229> know<00:05:21.349> the<00:05:21.590> actual

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
system and I don't know the actual

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.159 
system and I don't know the actual
numbers<00:05:22.280> of<00:05:22.490> how<00:05:22.639> they<00:05:22.820> compare<00:05:23.030> but<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:23.990> do

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
numbers of how they compare but I do

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.129 
numbers of how they compare but I do
have<00:05:24.680> some<00:05:25.550> stats<00:05:25.880> here<00:05:26.300> just<00:05:26.509> to<00:05:26.599> give<00:05:26.960> you<00:05:27.050> an

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
have some stats here just to give you an

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.020 
have some stats here just to give you an
idea<00:05:27.199> of<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:28.009> performance<00:05:28.430> of<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.580> HD

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
idea of the performance of the HD

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.279 
idea of the performance of the HD
graphics<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:31.210> if<00:05:32.210> we<00:05:32.479> look<00:05:32.599> at<00:05:32.720> Mass<00:05:32.930> Effect

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
graphics and if we look at Mass Effect

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.520 
graphics and if we look at Mass Effect
that's<00:05:33.500> in<00:05:33.590> as<00:05:33.889> an<00:05:34.039> example<00:05:34.370> we<00:05:35.360> have<00:05:35.630> so<00:05:36.289> as

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
that's in as an example we have so as

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.960 
that's in as an example we have so as
you<00:05:36.620> guys<00:05:36.740> can<00:05:36.889> see<00:05:36.949> if<00:05:37.190> you<00:05:37.280> were<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.490> run<00:05:37.669> at

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
you guys can see if you were to run at

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.580 
you guys can see if you were to run at
seven<00:05:39.130> basically<00:05:40.130> 720p<00:05:40.849> resolution<00:05:41.590> you'll

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
seven basically 720p resolution you'll

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.310 
seven basically 720p resolution you'll
be<00:05:42.770> able<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:43.010> get<00:05:43.220> almost<00:05:43.550> 50<00:05:43.849> frames<00:05:44.060> again<00:05:45.050> it

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
be able to get almost 50 frames again it

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.990 
be able to get almost 50 frames again it
really<00:05:45.680> depends<00:05:46.099> on<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.310> monitor<00:05:46.729> that<00:05:46.880> you

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
really depends on the monitor that you

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.210 
really depends on the monitor that you
have<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:48.320> resolution<00:05:48.800> that<00:05:48.889> you<00:05:49.010> want<00:05:49.159> to

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
have and the resolution that you want to

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.159 
have and the resolution that you want to
play<00:05:49.340> in<00:05:49.400> but<00:05:49.789> as<00:05:49.970> you<00:05:50.210> guys<00:05:50.360> can<00:05:50.449> see<00:05:50.510> 50

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
play in but as you guys can see 50

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.200 
play in but as you guys can see 50
frames<00:05:51.349> that's<00:05:51.650> extremely<00:05:52.190> playable<00:05:52.699> but

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
frames that's extremely playable but

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.909 
frames that's extremely playable but
again<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.510> resolution<00:05:53.990> is<00:05:54.139> pretty<00:05:54.530> crappy

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
again the resolution is pretty crappy

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.730 
again the resolution is pretty crappy
it's<00:05:55.130> not<00:05:55.310> going<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.639> be<00:05:55.789> 1080p<00:05:56.750> obviously<00:05:57.169> as

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
it's not going to be 1080p obviously as

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.730 
it's not going to be 1080p obviously as
soon<00:05:57.919> as<00:05:58.009> you<00:05:58.070> run<00:05:58.190> it<00:05:58.280> at<00:05:58.370> 1080p<00:05:59.409> below<00:06:00.409> 20

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
soon as you run it at 1080p below 20

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.219 
soon as you run it at 1080p below 20
frames<00:06:00.889> that's<00:06:01.250> not<00:06:01.490> really<00:06:01.940> playable<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.479> I

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
frames that's not really playable and I

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.930 
frames that's not really playable and I
was<00:06:03.349> looking<00:06:03.560> at<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:03.680> basically<00:06:04.580> looking<00:06:04.820> at

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
was looking at that basically looking at

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.520 
was looking at that basically looking at
all<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.389> games<00:06:05.570> and<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:05.870> frame<00:06:06.050> rates<00:06:06.289> for

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
all the games and the frame rates for

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
all the games and the frame rates for
most<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.830> games<00:06:06.979> and<00:06:07.220> that<00:06:07.340> was<00:06:07.430> basically

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
most of the games and that was basically

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.990 
most of the games and that was basically
the<00:06:07.970> same<00:06:08.210> trend<00:06:09.199> that<00:06:09.320> I<00:06:09.409> was<00:06:09.560> seeing<00:06:10.039> 720p

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
the same trend that I was seeing 720p

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.999 
the same trend that I was seeing 720p
playable<00:06:11.720> very<00:06:11.960> playable<00:06:12.440> and<00:06:12.740> then<00:06:12.830> as<00:06:12.919> soon

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
playable very playable and then as soon

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.070 
playable very playable and then as soon
as<00:06:13.130> you<00:06:13.250> hit<00:06:13.370> 1080p<00:06:14.000> it<00:06:14.210> just<00:06:14.449> became

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
as you hit 1080p it just became

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.680 
as you hit 1080p it just became
completely<00:06:15.740> unplayable<00:06:16.430> so<00:06:16.880> i<00:06:17.240> can<00:06:17.539> easily

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
completely unplayable so i can easily

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.830 
completely unplayable so i can easily
roll<00:06:18.080> out<00:06:18.259> this<00:06:19.270> intel<00:06:20.270> HD<00:06:20.659> 4000<00:06:21.380> 4000<00:06:22.310> as<00:06:22.840> not

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
roll out this intel HD 4000 4000 as not

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.460 
roll out this intel HD 4000 4000 as not
a<00:06:24.169> gaming<00:06:24.919> video<00:06:25.580> card<00:06:26.199> obviously<00:06:27.199> it's<00:06:27.349> a

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
a gaming video card obviously it's a

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.080 
a gaming video card obviously it's a
shared<00:06:27.979> card<00:06:28.220> so<00:06:28.370> I<00:06:28.430> was<00:06:28.520> never<00:06:28.699> intended<00:06:29.000> to

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
shared card so I was never intended to

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.420 
shared card so I was never intended to
be<00:06:29.270> a<00:06:29.620> gaming<00:06:30.620> video<00:06:30.740> card<00:06:31.070> prefer<00:06:31.340> those

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
be a gaming video card prefer those

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.649 
be a gaming video card prefer those
people<00:06:31.669> that<00:06:31.759> are<00:06:31.849> curious<00:06:32.210> and<00:06:32.360> thinking

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
people that are curious and thinking

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.270 
people that are curious and thinking
about<00:06:32.750> getting<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:33.169> system<00:06:33.470> for<00:06:33.680> for<00:06:33.949> gaming

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
about getting the system for for gaming

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.610 
about getting the system for for gaming
yeah<00:06:34.820> don't<00:06:35.300> get<00:06:35.510> it<00:06:35.630> for<00:06:35.719> gaming<00:06:36.080> it's

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
yeah don't get it for gaming it's

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.839 
yeah don't get it for gaming it's
completely<00:06:36.950> out<00:06:37.010> of<00:06:37.039> the<00:06:37.159> question<00:06:37.190> this

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
completely out of the question this

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.920 
completely out of the question this
machine<00:06:38.180> was<00:06:38.300> intended<00:06:38.750> for<00:06:38.990> other<00:06:39.740> things

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930

you<00:06:44.660> can<00:06:44.810> do<00:06:44.870> photoshop<00:06:45.260> but<00:06:45.350> it's<00:06:45.500> going<00:06:45.620> to

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
you can do photoshop but it's going to

up up to 3.6 so it's a i think the

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.100 
up up to 3.6 so it's a i think the
system<00:07:18.830> is<00:07:19.100> actually<00:07:19.370> pretty<00:07:19.820> well<00:07:20.180> balanced
