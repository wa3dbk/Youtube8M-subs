00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
hopefully we should be hearing a little

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.219 
hopefully we should be hearing a little
bit<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:08.670> perhaps<00:01:09.390> made<00:01:09.689> me<00:01:09.840> around<00:01:10.110> about

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
bit more perhaps made me around about

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
bit more perhaps made me around about
like<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.860> next<00:01:11.100> upcoming<00:01:11.280> months<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
about what exactly is this project

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.550 
about what exactly is this project
because<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.020> single

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
because we don't see like one single

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
because we don't see like one single
like<00:01:16.710> pick<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.310> maybe<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
like pick and maybe that's like one of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.390 
like pick and maybe that's like one of
the<00:01:18.960> good<00:01:19.110> sense<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> live<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.890> mean<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.250> of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the good sense to live I mean a lot of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
the good sense to live I mean a lot of
the<00:01:20.490> characters<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.000> say<00:01:21.299> look<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.780> bit

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the characters and say look a little bit

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.899 
the characters and say look a little bit
identical<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.920> maybe<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.369> might<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.670> say

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
identical so maybe that might be say

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.200 
identical so maybe that might be say
himself<00:01:24.540> thing<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:26.220> only<00:01:26.729> help

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
himself thing that like I can only help

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.700 
himself thing that like I can only help
them<00:01:27.570> dream<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.590> would

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
them dream and all that because I would

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
them dream and all that because I would
