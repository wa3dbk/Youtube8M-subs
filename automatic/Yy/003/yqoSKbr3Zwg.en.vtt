which<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.669> awesome<00:00:32.850> because<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.450> really

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
which is really awesome because I really

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.690 
which is really awesome because I really
hate<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> should<00:00:34.200> probably<00:00:34.350> already<00:00:34.649> know<00:00:34.950> when

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
hate I should probably already know when

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
hate I should probably already know when
the<00:00:35.850> chests<00:00:36.120> are<00:00:36.360> too<00:00:36.540> overpowered<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.500> these

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the chests are too overpowered and these

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
the chests are too overpowered and these
chests<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.160> definitely<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.969> overpowered

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
chests are definitely not overpowered

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.380

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
can play this map with at least four

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.370 
can play this map with at least four
people<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.659> also<00:01:45.780> play<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:45.990> eight

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
people but you can also play with eight

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.920 
people but you can also play with eight
people<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> mace<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.909> big<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.780> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
people because the mace so big it's just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.730 
people because the mace so big it's just
not<00:01:49.229> only<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> hooligans<00:01:50.100> map<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.490> also<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.970> map

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
not only a hooligans map it's also a map

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.260 
not only a hooligans map it's also a map
and<00:01:52.740> which<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and which I think it's kind of like a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
and which I think it's kind of like a
personal<00:01:54.720> map<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.680> well

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
personal map you have to think like well

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.819 
personal map you have to think like well
we<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:56.969> want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.719> which<00:01:58.110> direction<00:01:58.380> do

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
we do want to go now which direction do

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.770 
we do want to go now which direction do

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
engaged map you can just walk to each

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.059 
engaged map you can just walk to each
other<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.730> this

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
other but in this

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
map you have to go to the big enormous

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.910 
map you have to go to the big enormous
maze<00:02:15.579> to<00:02:16.239> get<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.629> other<00:02:16.749> player<00:02:17.019> which

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
maze to get to the other player which

will take you pretty long time and yeah
that's<00:02:20.829> basically<00:02:20.889> off<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.849> map<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.299> can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
that's basically off the map that I can

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.449 
that's basically off the map that I can
show<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.659> I<00:02:22.780> will<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.439> go<00:02:23.620> down<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:24.189> a<00:02:24.219> bit

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
show you I will just go down for a bit

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.099 
show you I will just go down for a bit
over<00:02:24.819> here<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.359> could<00:02:25.510> see<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.810> maze

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
over here so you could see the maze

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.520 
over here so you could see the maze
let's<00:02:26.739> fall<00:02:27.189> down<00:02:27.760> it's<00:02:28.359> actually<00:02:28.959> really<00:02:29.230> big

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
let's fall down it's actually really big

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.530 
let's fall down it's actually really big
and<00:02:29.739> it's<00:02:29.829> really<00:02:30.069> high<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.489> can<00:02:30.730> expand

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and it's really high I can expand

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.780 
and it's really high I can expand
imagine<00:02:31.959> how<00:02:32.019> long<00:02:32.319> that<00:02:32.500> took<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.889> make<00:02:33.069> but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
imagine how long that took to make but

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.449 
imagine how long that took to make but
yes<00:02:34.359> there<00:02:34.689> are<00:02:35.049> some<00:02:35.200> dead<00:02:35.379> ends<00:02:35.799> like<00:02:36.099> over

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
yes there are some dead ends like over

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.809 
yes there are some dead ends like over
here<00:02:36.639> for<00:02:36.879> example<00:02:37.889> minutes<00:02:38.889> let's<00:02:39.489> fly<00:02:39.790> let's

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
here for example minutes let's fly let's

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.879 
here for example minutes let's fly let's
fly<00:02:40.209> really<00:02:40.629> quickly<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.319> as<00:02:41.469> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.709> see<00:02:41.829> is

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
fly really quickly and as you can see is

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.289 
fly really quickly and as you can see is
that<00:02:41.919> there<00:02:42.159> are<00:02:42.219> not<00:02:42.370> too<00:02:42.430> many<00:02:42.700> chests

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
that there are not too many chests

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.780 
that there are not too many chests
because<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:43.989> found<00:02:44.260> one<00:02:44.500> myself<00:02:44.919> yet<00:02:45.189> but

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
because I have found one myself yet but

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.550 
because I have found one myself yet but
yes<00:02:45.969> it's<00:02:46.389> wow<00:02:46.689> there's<00:02:46.989> an<00:02:47.049> element<00:02:47.349> oh

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
yes it's wow there's an element oh

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.110 
yes it's wow there's an element oh
they're<00:02:47.859> a<00:02:47.889> couple<00:02:48.129> many<00:02:48.459> mice<00:02:48.669> over<00:02:48.849> here<00:02:48.969> and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
they're a couple many mice over here and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.720 
they're a couple many mice over here and
that's<00:02:49.629> also<00:02:49.930> probably<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.010> thing<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.310> will

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
that's also probably the thing that will

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.759 
that's also probably the thing that will
make<00:02:51.969> this<00:02:52.120> map<00:02:52.389> even<00:02:52.569> harder<00:02:53.109> because<00:02:53.379> there

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
make this map even harder because there

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.559 
make this map even harder because there
are<00:02:53.859> a<00:02:53.919> lot<00:02:53.949> of<00:02:54.280> mobs<00:02:54.519> out<00:02:54.730> there<00:02:55.000> trying<00:02:55.510> to
