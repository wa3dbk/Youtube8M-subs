00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.620
 Good morning 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.750
 Today I'll put you in something like that 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.769
 the little brother of the bat of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.020
 Roger Federer before 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.560
 and who goes by the name wilson prost 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.840
 from 790 little brother because of that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.670
 great in the here at the time is 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.820
 overall a bit easier 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.279
 here so 315 grams on the 97 head 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.020
 That said the name already has one 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.610
 31 0 abba longs and 16 19 his picture 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.380
 visually very similar at first sight 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.030
 you think it would also be a leather grip 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.040
 But it is not here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.530
 It's a bit more comfortable 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 only leather look 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.829
 Overall, the thing I would say 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 still something in the tur beater 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 for the tournament itself 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.440
 but also from the team players and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.239
 played by the club gamblers at 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.110
 115 grams is actually for none 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.390
 really too heavy 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.730
 when will get the good feedback anyway 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 this bomb game feeling what the Sun 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.629
 called big brother actually 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.040
 currently delivers a very small 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.420
 a little bit more and generally that is 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.409
 maybe something for the people themselves 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.189
 a little more with too 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.220
 to interact 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.540
 in the heavy 340 gram version there 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640
 that is also wonderful for 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.840
 straight punches for example here would 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.479
 I say a little bit 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.650
 better is if you play yourself 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.049
 control is so I believe the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.729
 main focus though that always comes 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.250
 still a lot of steam out with it, too 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 this is a bomb mixture 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.579
 I 've rarely played it that way, too 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 I often say this is a good all- rounder 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.090
 there and something like that is quite a bit 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.460
 Power allrounder but with a lot 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.220
 Quantity control gives the player a lot 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 a lot of security in itself that's just 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.960
 with the salmon evans I'm on it 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.520
 There are also and extra tests to do so 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.930
 simply suitable for aggressive 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.770
 play really well over the ball 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.049
 to go over it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.610
 very stable for wolf and and and and me 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.369
 believe the only real difference 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.439
 to the heavy 43 km version is the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.119
 He's still a bit more stable in the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.000
 meeting point and that is as I said if 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.049
 you yourself jump the wind the swing 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.130
 then it 's actually generated 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.560
 just as stable only 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.909
 when blocking eg because you realize that has 425 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.420
 less installed 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.519
 in the end this is something like that 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.440
 spring feeling for everyone that one has 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.840
 earlier with the poster 95100 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.610
 when she came out said here but are 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.950
 even more the thing is even closer to the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.750
 original version of springer tuned as the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.300
 predecessor, for example, that means the same 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.760
 game feeling a bit easier to act 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.680
 not so hard while the one 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.180
 Balance also adjusted a bit that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.890
 So ding is spring for the club 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.209
 player for every tournament player and for 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.069
 everyone as I said 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.080
 that does not mean that wilson closes 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.730
 So a super gap you look 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.560
 nevertheless please in our shop out 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.790
 center court de has all three versions 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.069
 There is a slightly lighter 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.410
 version of this with a little more spin to 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.450
 example and of course the original 11 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.099
 97 otto graf versions give the serious 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.049
 it also looks in our shop there please 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.370
 times by that in itself as said the 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.090
 best allrounder I believe for 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.920
 anyone 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.720
 I think nobody can out there and 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.040
 make a mistake look at you test 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.000
 The man then see us at 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.000
 next time and
