with your weather and based on the
variety<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:14.970> plant<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.660> that's<00:02:15.810> my

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
variety that you plant but that's my

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.479 
variety that you plant but that's my
first<00:02:16.140> harvest<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.680> radishes<00:02:16.980> that's<00:02:17.220> pretty

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
first harvest of radishes that's pretty

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.370 
first harvest of radishes that's pretty
good<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.420> great<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.900> wanted

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
good not as great as I wanted

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.110 
good not as great as I wanted
you<00:02:19.530> kind<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.920> want<00:02:20.040> radishes<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.670> don't

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
you kind of want radishes that don't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.810 
you kind of want radishes that don't
crack<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:22.080> was<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> watering<00:02:22.560> issue<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
crack and that was a watering issue if I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.890 
crack and that was a watering issue if I
could<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.120> watered<00:02:24.390> them<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> little<00:02:24.810> bit

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
could have watered them a little bit

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.979 
could have watered them a little bit
more<00:02:24.930> regularly<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> drought<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
more regularly and if the drought so to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.770 
more regularly and if the drought so to
speak<00:02:28.260> actually<00:02:28.440> was<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> drought<00:02:29.780> wasn't

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
speak actually was a drought wasn't

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.180 
speak actually was a drought wasn't
there<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.500> they<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.799> not<00:02:32.040> have

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
there I think they would not have

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.039 
there I think they would not have
