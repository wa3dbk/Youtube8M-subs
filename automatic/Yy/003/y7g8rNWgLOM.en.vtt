00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
around the basket and it prevents it

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.950 
around the basket and it prevents it
from<00:04:09.430> moving<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:10.030> altering<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.660> way<00:04:10.690> that

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
from moving and altering the way that

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.900 
from moving and altering the way that
you<00:04:11.080> stacked<00:04:11.470> up<00:04:11.680> all<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.100> gifts<00:04:12.400> inside<00:04:12.760> of

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
you stacked up all the gifts inside of

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.900 
you stacked up all the gifts inside of
the<00:04:13.000> basket<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.720> much<00:04:14.500> prefer<00:04:14.950> this<00:04:15.190> way<00:04:15.400> over

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
the basket I much prefer this way over

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.870 
the basket I much prefer this way over
the<00:04:16.299> regular<00:04:16.810> gift<00:04:17.350> bags<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:18.370> keeps

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
the regular gift bags it keeps

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.610 
the regular gift bags it keeps
everything<00:04:19.150> in<00:04:19.390> place<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.660> especially<00:04:20.260> if

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
everything in place and especially if

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.230 
everything in place and especially if
you're<00:04:20.739> traveling<00:04:20.980> with<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.670> basket<00:04:22.210> you

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
you're traveling with this basket you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.000 
you're traveling with this basket you
can<00:04:22.540> put<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.780> in<00:04:22.900> your<00:04:22.990> car<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.710> will<00:04:23.800> not

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
can put it in your car and it will not

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.070 
can put it in your car and it will not
alter<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.430> way<00:04:24.670> that<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:24.940> have<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.300> gift<00:04:25.510> so

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
alter the way that you have the gift so

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.480 
alter the way that you have the gift so
it<00:04:26.290> does<00:04:26.440> take<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.620> little<00:04:26.800> bit<00:04:26.920> of<00:04:27.010> time<00:04:27.250> but<00:04:27.430> I

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
it does take a little bit of time but I

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.310 
it does take a little bit of time but I
think<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:27.970> looks<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.300> lot<00:04:28.510> better<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.110> it

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
think that it looks a lot better and it

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.050 
think that it looks a lot better and it
just<00:04:29.350> keeps<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.950> more<00:04:30.130> secure<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.790> it<00:04:30.910> also

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
just keeps it more secure and it also

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.090 
just keeps it more secure and it also
keeps<00:04:31.390> those<00:04:31.720> kids<00:04:31.990> from<00:04:32.200> getting<00:04:32.440> inside<00:04:32.710> the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
keeps those kids from getting inside the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:54.219 
keeps those kids from getting inside the
candy<00:04:33.490> if<00:04:33.670> they<00:04:34.240> see<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.660> basket

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.600 

so<00:04:55.229> this<00:04:55.439> is<00:04:55.589> how<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.770> baskets<00:04:56.249> look<00:04:56.430> when

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
so this is how the baskets look when

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.939 
so this is how the baskets look when
they're<00:04:56.759> all<00:04:56.939> done<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.419> did<00:04:57.659> add<00:04:57.839> a<00:04:57.870> little<00:04:58.289> B<00:04:58.620> to

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
they're all done I did add a little B to

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.040 
they're all done I did add a little B to
bobbies<00:04:59.339> and<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.610> little<00:04:59.849> Q<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.330> quincies<00:05:00.779> and<00:05:00.990> I

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
bobbies and a little Q to quincies and I

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.230 
bobbies and a little Q to quincies and I
just<00:05:01.289> use<00:05:01.469> paper<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.189> washi<00:05:02.430> tape<00:05:02.819> and<00:05:03.029> went

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
just use paper and washi tape and went

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.719 
just use paper and washi tape and went
around<00:05:03.449> it<00:05:03.689> and<00:05:03.870> cut<00:05:04.319> it<00:05:04.439> all<00:05:04.559> out<00:05:04.589> I<00:05:05.129> think

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
around it and cut it all out I think

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.279 
around it and cut it all out I think
that<00:05:05.849> they<00:05:05.939> look<00:05:06.120> really<00:05:06.150> good<00:05:06.569> I'm<00:05:06.809> so<00:05:07.080> happy

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
that they look really good I'm so happy

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.809 
that they look really good I'm so happy
with<00:05:07.529> the<00:05:07.650> way<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.889> they<00:05:08.039> turned<00:05:08.309> out<00:05:08.550> and

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
with the way that they turned out and

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.610 
with the way that they turned out and
this<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.419> how<00:05:09.539> they<00:05:09.659> look<00:05:09.870> shrink-wrapped<00:05:10.439> I

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620
