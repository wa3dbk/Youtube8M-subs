this normally except i can because i'm

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.719 
this normally except i can because i'm
using<00:04:24.139> fling<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.949> idea<00:04:26.190> fling<00:04:26.460> is<00:04:26.580> that

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
using fling and the idea fling is that

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.550 
using fling and the idea fling is that
you're<00:04:26.940> attacking<00:04:27.720> long<00:04:27.930> distance<00:04:28.320> with<00:04:28.440> your

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
you're attacking long distance with your

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.980 
you're attacking long distance with your
sort<00:04:28.740> by<00:04:28.830> flinging<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:30.690> make<00:04:30.870> this

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
sort by flinging it and to make this

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.450 
sort by flinging it and to make this
more<00:04:31.199> realistic<00:04:31.680> i<00:04:31.770> might<00:04:31.949> make<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.220> sword

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
more realistic i might make the sword

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.740 
more realistic i might make the sword
disappear<00:04:32.699> for<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> little<00:04:33.330> while<00:04:33.479> so<00:04:33.660> you

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
disappear for a little while so you

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.710 
disappear for a little while so you
can't<00:04:33.930> use<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.820> but<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:35.970> adds<00:04:36.180> complexity

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
can't use it but that adds complexity

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.680 
can't use it but that adds complexity
and<00:04:36.960> people<00:04:37.229> complain<00:04:37.650> so<00:04:38.009> i<00:04:38.039> might<00:04:38.340> not

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
and people complain so i might not

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:47.210 
and people complain so i might not
that's<00:04:39.690> fling<00:04:40.020> unbind<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:41.479> so<00:04:45.259> there<00:04:46.259> we<00:04:46.380> go<00:04:46.470> so

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
that's fling unbind it so there we go so

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.830 
that's fling unbind it so there we go so
