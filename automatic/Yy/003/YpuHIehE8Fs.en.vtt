don't<00:02:12.430> think<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> problem<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
don't think the problem is that the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.580 
don't think the problem is that the
truck<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.620> moving<00:02:14.890> too<00:02:15.160> slow<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:16.380> think<00:02:17.380> those

truck is moving too slow I think those

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.370 
truck is moving too slow I think those
that<00:02:17.770> are<00:02:17.860> complaining<00:02:18.340> are<00:02:19.110> driving<00:02:20.110> too

you're driving properly you've got three

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.500 
you're driving properly you've got three
zones<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.470> you're<00:02:59.680> looking<00:02:59.799> at<00:03:00.510> you're

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
zones that you're looking at you're

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.410 
zones that you're looking at you're
looking<00:03:01.870> at<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.110> first<00:03:02.380> 15<00:03:02.920> seconds<00:03:03.489> which<00:03:04.239> is

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
looking at the first 15 seconds which is

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.870 
looking at the first 15 seconds which is
what<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.660> call<00:03:05.049> basically<00:03:05.860> my<00:03:06.010> safety<00:03:06.519> area

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
what I call basically my safety area

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.699 
what I call basically my safety area
that's<00:03:07.030> my<00:03:07.239> safety<00:03:07.630> zone<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.080> first<00:03:08.290> 15

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
that's my safety zone as the first 15

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.270 
that's my safety zone as the first 15
seconds<00:03:09.630> from<00:03:10.630> 15<00:03:11.110> seconds<00:03:11.620> out<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.950> 30

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.890 
seconds from 15 seconds out to 30
seconds<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.120> call<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.470> action<00:03:15.040> zone

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
seconds I call that the action zone

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.880 
seconds I call that the action zone
that's<00:03:17.130> where<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:19.150> take<00:03:19.390> action<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:20.049> avoid<00:03:20.230> so

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
that's where you take action to avoid so

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.620 
that's where you take action to avoid so
when<00:03:21.430> whatever<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.269> whether<00:03:22.420> it's<00:03:22.570> a
