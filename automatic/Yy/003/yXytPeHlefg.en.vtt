what was originally on but they would
have<00:02:35.920> been<00:02:36.100> real<00:02:36.550> small<00:02:37.110> openings<00:02:38.110> here<00:02:39.060> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
have been real small openings here and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.410 
have been real small openings here and
they<00:02:40.810> wouldn't<00:02:41.080> have<00:02:41.200> had<00:02:41.410> these<00:02:41.590> big<00:02:42.420> plastic

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
they wouldn't have had these big plastic

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.310 
they wouldn't have had these big plastic
windows<00:02:44.110> like<00:02:44.320> we<00:02:44.470> see<00:02:44.709> here<00:02:44.739> today<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:47.140> other

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
windows like we see here today the other

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.990 
windows like we see here today the other
thing<00:02:47.530> that's<00:02:47.620> kind<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.950> unusual<00:02:48.100> about<00:02:48.730> this

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
thing that's kind of unusual about this

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.210 
thing that's kind of unusual about this
is<00:02:49.570> because<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.110> was<00:02:50.260> ran<00:02:50.500> in<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> winter<00:02:50.980> time

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
is because it was ran in the winter time

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.940 
is because it was ran in the winter time
we<00:02:52.209> have<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> winter<00:02:52.870> front<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.650> front<00:02:53.920> of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
we have a winter front on the front of

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:04.130 
we have a winter front on the front of
the<00:02:54.070> radiator<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:55.660> keep<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.500> warm<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.190> so<00:03:02.430> open

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
the radiator to keep it warm and so open

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.820 
the radiator to keep it warm and so open
so<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.970> would<00:03:07.209> not<00:03:10.830> overheat

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
so that it would not overheat

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:28.390 
so that it would not overheat
and<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.520> can<00:03:26.680> that's<00:03:27.680> how<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:27.950> basically

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
and you can that's how you basically

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.080 
and you can that's how you basically
kept<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.210> temperature<00:03:29.720> up<00:03:29.960> in<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.700> end

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.290 

mm-hmm<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.190> is<00:03:40.370> all<00:03:40.580> original

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
mm-hmm and this is all original

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.900 
mm-hmm and this is all original
equipment<00:03:42.290> stuff<00:03:42.830> that<00:03:43.070> came<00:03:43.280> with<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:43.640> Flyer

where<00:03:57.410> they<00:03:57.920> would<00:03:58.070> have<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.660> when<00:03:59.660> they

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
where they would have to when they

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.210 
where they would have to when they
parked<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.110> at<00:04:00.230> night<00:04:00.410> there<00:04:00.770> was<00:04:00.860> no<00:04:00.980> block

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
parked it at night there was no block

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.830 
parked it at night there was no block
heat<00:04:01.490> or<00:04:01.610> anything<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:02.030> training<00:04:02.630> all<00:04:02.750> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
heat or anything so training all the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.840 
heat or anything so training all the
fluid<00:04:03.170> put<00:04:03.380> bring<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.800> inside<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.430> yep<00:04:04.580> they

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
fluid put bring it inside and yep they

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.700 
fluid put bring it inside and yep they
would<00:04:05.030> drain<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.480> water<00:04:05.660> out<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.410> at<00:04:06.500> that

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
would drain the water out and at that

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.560 
would drain the water out and at that
time<00:04:06.920> they<00:04:07.100> were<00:04:07.220> using<00:04:07.460> water<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.090> alcohol

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
time they were using water and alcohol

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.320 
time they were using water and alcohol
mixture<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.460> they<00:04:10.580> would<00:04:10.730> drain<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.180> out

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
mixture and so they would drain it out

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.360 
mixture and so they would drain it out
and<00:04:11.540> take<00:04:11.750> it<00:04:11.780> inside<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.500> keep<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.890> warm<00:04:13.070> and

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
and take it inside to keep it warm and

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.370 
and take it inside to keep it warm and
then<00:04:13.940> they'd<00:04:14.150> drain<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.540> oil<00:04:14.570> out<00:04:14.930> as<00:04:15.110> well

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
then they'd drain the oil out as well

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.640 
then they'd drain the oil out as well
and<00:04:15.680> take<00:04:16.580> all<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:16.970> inside<00:04:17.480> so<00:04:18.290> when<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.500> got
