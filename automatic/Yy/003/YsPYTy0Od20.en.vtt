 the motherland and then the proposal this time 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.419
 is to try to decorate our home in the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.640
 sense of Mexican decoration 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.560
 contemporary that has nothing to do 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.410
 with the composturas nor with the hat 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.719
 neither with the rebozos nor with all 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.030
 these beautiful things that are a tradition 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.969
 but really with these elements 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.710
 of our crafts with the color of 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.899
 our fauna of our flora of 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.670
 our way of living that is what goes 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.670
 doing every style that is coming to us 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.530
 very our very Mexican and how are we doing 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.690
 transforming according to our way of 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.000
 live and according to our thinking 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.699
 ours and our customs and our 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.160
 traditions look what is this that we 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.020
 you say it 's true we do not just put the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.630
 flag in September but we can 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.820
 do with our craftsmen and hands 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.220
 wonderful of our craftsmen 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 of life in our homes that apart 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.840
 it's worth mentioning them 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.810
 foreigners come and buy crafts 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.690
 to dress your home your elegant homes 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.210
 your france houses from all europe of 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.070
 usa and more than things made by hands 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.600
 Mexicans and we sometimes even 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.210
 We are ashamed of what we have in 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.770
 our country and also what you want what 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.900
 we know let's say that if not 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.180
 we recognize we do not even know and 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.830
 we do not even realize how 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 suddenly we see a very decoration 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.369
 contemporary Mexican that has to do 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.410
 for example with these colors that have to 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.910
 fashion with the apple and the orange that 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.520
 are combining to give us this 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.890
 colorful so new so contemporary and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.990
 if we think about putting them in the article that 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.840
 out there so they can read it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.850
 then as they remember our 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.470
 budgies do you put that every day 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.720
 to have in the box how they have these 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.110
 same colors as I reflect what 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.239
 I have what I live the fauna the color of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.039
 what of the fruit of what I see of what 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.930
 like what I have around me in 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.690
 what I want to decorate and the most 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.700
 contemporary and more Mexican than I can 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 have as we said do not have 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.390
 you have to see neither with equipales nor with what 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.129
 that we all think you can do 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.069
 it's like if I go abroad I say to 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.010
 Mexicans I wear a hat and the little 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.200
 syrup tapatío no is not that is to see and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.180
 realize what we really are 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.580
 surrounds in this country that has a 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.830
 beautiful craftsmanship and that has a 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.959
 decoration full of all these 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.569
 materials that we use like the tule the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.280
 mud looms the paper mache 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.440
 sculptures so beautiful that they are 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.910
 doing now and they can look in 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.760
 any style and in any 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.580
 contemporary decoration in this era 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.200
 in which as we say it does not have to do 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.930
 with putting flags on the door 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.569
 of the entrance but with what mexicanísimos 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.420
 our houses and above all let's make 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.310
 our children again have that 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.440
 experience the taste of what is the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.329
 tradition of his native country of his roots 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.060
 of their traditions and strengthen in them 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.799
 that nationalism that we need so much 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.200
 is now making clear that yes and 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.880
 also say it's worth it for 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.500
 example we have jalisco 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.090
 privileged that what for what and what 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.250
 tonalá that we have it back from the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.690
 corner what good does he set an example in all 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.930
 the Mexican Republic 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.700
 here Tabasco etcetera of these things 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.170
 very precious that we have and that they give 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.950
 shine to our entire Mexican republic 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.110
 then know appreciate buying and 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.360
 dress our house in mexico for everything 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.850
 the year for the whole year to do with the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.380
 accessories that we can use this is 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.180
 the first part of this idea for 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.490
 try to close on September 16 the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.160
 next week with the particularizando 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.000
 in each of the areas how can we go 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.880
 filling with these candle details 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.280
 cinnamon of how we want woven furniture 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.560
 with straw to the best in the seats 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.870
 on the backs of woven frames so 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.490
 beautiful with looms a lot of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.100
 details that can go vision to our 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.060
 houses like we have now nothing more 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.460
 giving it a different touch and an area and 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.590
 a contemporary Mexican air 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.140
 I should see ceramic sculptures 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.269
 so pretty they are doing now in 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.070
 Tonala me sadly nothing 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.040
 they export and that he does not even reach us 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.330
 that you tell a return 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.490
 and our friends went around 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.920
 by all the artisans who are 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.960
 working on such beautiful things and so 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.480
 beautiful that could be with a price 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.150
 híjole saying it's amazing that I 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.580
 I buy an accessory of other material 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.620
 that is imported very expensive when here 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.660
 There are so many things that can beautify 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.060
 each of the corners good the other 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.250

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.670
 guadalajara jalisco to tonalá tlaquepaque 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.590
 They ask for exclusive designs to be

 blown off caray 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.360

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.470
 blown glass factories is what 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.770
 They are doing 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.509

 different areas of the house a large 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.520
 amount of craftsmanship that the new 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.289

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.389
 and make all our people reach 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.759

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.030
