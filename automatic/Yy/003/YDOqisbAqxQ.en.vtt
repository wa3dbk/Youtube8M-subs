 do a little while with Romaine lettuce 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.820
 I just tried it in a restaurant 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.400
 very very good that is called bisbal that 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.320

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.640
 salad costs one a wool nothing more 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.640

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.060
 let's put them with enough 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.849
 scratch remember that always a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.099
 seafood and a fish always need 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.709

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.969
 you have a grill or tomorrow 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.100
 you can open it roasted and make them to the rotisserie 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:51.590
 this but we go to the oven to 350 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.090
 and they will be for 10 to 12 minutes 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.070
 remember that the salmon and we do not want 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.170
 that over costs is very important 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.700
 that nothing else when we see that the center 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.470
 it's slightly raw it's time to 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.080
 remove it when it starts to defoliate 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.640
 the eggs it's time to take it out for 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.350
