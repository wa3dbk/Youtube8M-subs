 hi youtube people flickr or less 125 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.080
 fringed wins two months of June, 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.880
 best moves that you send me 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 month to month and starting already in the post 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.980
 number 5 we have out the 2 that is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.010
 playing on the map raid is using his x 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.800
 pr starts to fail some shots get 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.869
 a hit marker throws his tomahawk kills 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.359
 one with her and she has a grenade in her 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.580
 feet and quickly claw to kill 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.679
 one with a direct impact really that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.750
 have high reflexes to do this and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.300
 especially good luck to get 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.969
 two casualties this way in the post 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.890
 number four we have the kid block that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.600
 appeared recently in a top 5 fails 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.399
 but this time it will not bring a very 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 good play is stunned with a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.149
 Granada standing but only affects you in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 more minimum to get a great double 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 low a great collateral with the ballista 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.840
 there we have the repetition in another angle 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.940
 get down to 1 and kill another that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.039
 I was just responding to the side 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.680
 of the boat on the map hijackers very good 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.200
 click 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.750
 in position number 3 we have bruno 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.760
 g19 we will show how they are used to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.040
 c4 and also it will show us that 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.800
 means four summers ago c4 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.060
 means to kill 4 campers 4 enemies 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.190
 that they were up there in the room 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 stand 2 and throwing something as simple as 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.410
 this equipment could get something 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.400
 as gross as being 4 casualties in the same 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.550
 spectacular moment bruno 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.680
 and at number 2 we have a new 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.190
 collateral this time no costumes take 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.710
 soul that consoles and I'll lose 50 like this 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.140
 spain gets here marker and then they come 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.270
 collateral without seeing enemies from behind 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.950
 from the really amazing wall and 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.310
 obviously you have to have a lot of ortho to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 get something so very good 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.189
 and now from number one for little 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.500
 if we talk a little south we have the 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.229
 far 12 that brings us a move that 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.939
 never of the jamases is going to repeat itself in 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.180
 the history of any call of duty 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.490
 never charge map you throw a tomahawk going to 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.560
 bounce on the metal structure bounces 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.130
 on the roof gets through the window 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.310
 bounces again on the floor and kills 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.290

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.910
