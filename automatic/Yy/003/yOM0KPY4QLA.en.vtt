racing<00:00:47.219> together<00:00:47.339> hasn't<00:00:47.850> brought<00:00:48.030> us<00:00:48.180> closer

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
racing together hasn't brought us closer

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.340 
racing together hasn't brought us closer
together<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:49.080> probably<00:00:49.409> torn<00:00:49.650> us<00:00:49.769> apart

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
together that's probably torn us apart

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.939 
together that's probably torn us apart
we<00:00:52.350> argue<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:55.680> one

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we argue a lot more now because this one

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.890 
we argue a lot more now because this one
and<00:00:56.189> I<00:00:56.280> were<00:00:56.549> in<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:56.879> car<00:00:57.059> together<00:00:57.269> in<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
and I were in the car together in the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.859 
and I were in the car together in the
Baja<00:00:58.199> 1000<00:00:59.009> in<00:00:59.239> 2008<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.570> did<00:01:00.689> was

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
Baja 1000 in 2008 and all we did was

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.109 
Baja 1000 in 2008 and all we did was
argue<00:01:01.339> here<00:01:02.339> to<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.610> out<00:01:02.729> of<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.850> car<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
argue here to get out of the car and

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.700 
argue here to get out of the car and
push<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.420> car<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.839> get<00:01:04.079> stuck<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
push the car when we get stuck that's it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
push the car when we get stuck that's it
you<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.009> out<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> car<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:07.079> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you get out of the car and that kind of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.410 
you get out of the car and that kind of
thing<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.430> code<00:01:08.790> drive<00:01:09.060> with

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
thing so we we don't code drive with

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
thing so we we don't code drive with
each<00:01:09.570> other<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.320> drive<00:01:10.560> separate<00:01:11.070> legs<00:01:11.280> we're

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
each other we drive separate legs we're

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.859 
each other we drive separate legs we're
driving<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> baa<00:01:13.729> 2012<00:01:14.729> separate<00:01:15.390> legs<00:01:15.540> I

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
driving in the baa 2012 separate legs I

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
driving in the baa 2012 separate legs I
take<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> leg<00:01:16.380> he<00:01:16.590> takes<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.950> leg<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.430> Morgan

take a leg he takes a leg and Morgan

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
take a leg he takes a leg and Morgan
takes<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.600> load<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.770> way<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.040> can't<00:01:20.310> argue

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
takes a load and that way we can't argue

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
takes a load and that way we can't argue
with<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.120> them<00:01:23.330> Baja<00:01:24.330> races<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.170> really

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
500 the Baja 1000 probably six times now

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.830 
500 the Baja 1000 probably six times now
so<00:02:33.580> uh<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:34.569> used<00:02:35.079> to<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.319> section<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:36.129> have

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
so uh I'm used to that section I have

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.630 
so uh I'm used to that section I have
enough<00:02:37.840> experience<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> faster<00:02:39.159> classes

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
enough experience and the faster classes

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.970 
enough experience and the faster classes
that<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:39.909> I'm<00:02:40.120> confident<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.470> do

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that I I'm confident that I can I can do

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.910 
that I I'm confident that I can I can do
well<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.459> trophy<00:02:42.760> truck<00:02:42.879> pace<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
well in the trophy truck pace so it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.649 
well in the trophy truck pace so it
seems<00:02:45.400> suited<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:46.000> having<00:02:46.299> me<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.450> do<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
seems suited to having me to do the

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.240 
seems suited to having me to do the
start<00:02:46.959> my<00:02:47.170> brother's<00:02:47.500> gonna<00:02:47.709> do<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> middle

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
start my brother's gonna do the middle

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.979 
start my brother's gonna do the middle

simplifier logistics traditionally we've

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.599 
simplifier logistics traditionally we've
we<00:03:12.609> were<00:03:12.700> running<00:03:13.109> two<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.409> one<00:03:15.099> time<00:03:15.310> three

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
we were running two and one time three

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.399 
we were running two and one time three
cars<00:03:15.849> in<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.150> thousand<00:03:16.629> so<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:16.930> was<00:03:17.170> one<00:03:17.319> of

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
cars in the thousand so that was one of

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.080 
cars in the thousand so that was one of
the<00:03:17.470> things<00:03:17.650> we<00:03:17.799> did<00:03:17.950> wrong<00:03:17.980> start<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.819> desert

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
the things we did wrong start a desert

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.210 
the things we did wrong start a desert
team<00:03:19.329> running<00:03:19.629> three<00:03:19.989> cars<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.560> every<00:03:21.010> race

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
team running three cars and every race

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.030 
team running three cars and every race
it<00:03:21.489> was<00:03:21.579> really<00:03:21.970> difficult<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.690> people<00:03:23.440> focus

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
it was really difficult and people focus

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.909 
it was really difficult and people focus
this<00:03:24.519> year<00:03:24.579> on<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.690> point-to-point<00:03:25.959> thousand

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
this year on the point-to-point thousand

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.099 
this year on the point-to-point thousand
all<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.220> our<00:03:27.310> attention<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:27.940> just<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.900> trail

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
all of our attention on just the trail

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.780 
all of our attention on just the trail
be<00:03:29.260> tracked<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.680> think<00:03:29.889> will<00:03:30.040> be<00:03:30.160> really<00:03:30.370> good

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
be tracked I think will be really good

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.809 
be tracked I think will be really good
for<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.090> team<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.630> think<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:33.549> it's

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
for the team I think that it's it's

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.240 
for the team I think that it's it's
really<00:03:34.120> our<00:03:34.239> first<00:03:34.480> trophy<00:03:34.989> truck<00:03:35.319> race<00:03:35.530> but<00:03:35.980> I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
really our first trophy truck race but I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.680 
really our first trophy truck race but I
think<00:03:36.519> we<00:03:36.579> have<00:03:36.669> a<00:03:36.730> chance<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.090> do<00:03:37.269> really<00:03:37.480> well

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
think we have a chance to do really well

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.309 
think we have a chance to do really well
and<00:03:37.900> maybe<00:03:38.109> surprise<00:03:38.500> some<00:03:38.739> people<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:40.290> one<00:03:41.290> of

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
and maybe surprise some people so one of

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.869 
and maybe surprise some people so one of
the<00:03:41.470> underrated<00:03:41.709> aspects<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.489> think<00:03:42.519> of<00:03:42.790> this

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
the underrated aspects I think of this

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.240 
the underrated aspects I think of this
sport<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:43.989> is<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.139> team<00:03:44.379> sport<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:45.040> you

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
sport is that it is a team sport and you

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.589 
sport is that it is a team sport and you
can't<00:03:45.459> do<00:03:45.609> it<00:03:45.700> without<00:03:45.819> your<00:03:46.030> chase<00:03:46.269> crews

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
can't do it without your chase crews

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.780 
can't do it without your chase crews
about<00:03:46.870> your<00:03:47.049> mechanics<00:03:47.530> without<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> complete

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
about your mechanics without a complete

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.750 
about your mechanics without a complete
effort<00:03:49.000> all<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.389> think<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.049> drivers<00:03:50.579> give<00:03:51.579> more

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
effort all I think the drivers give more

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.460 
effort all I think the drivers give more
credit<00:03:52.060> than<00:03:52.120> they<00:03:52.180> deserve<00:03:52.569> he<00:03:53.019> doesn't

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
credit than they deserve he doesn't

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.960 
credit than they deserve he doesn't
matter<00:03:53.650> at<00:03:53.799> all<00:03:53.889> how<00:03:54.129> great<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.549> driver<00:03:54.760> you

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
matter at all how great of a driver you

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.400 
matter at all how great of a driver you
are<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.359> other<00:03:55.510> cars<00:03:55.750> it's<00:03:55.959> just<00:03:56.079> gonna<00:03:56.199> break

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
are the other cars it's just gonna break

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.020 
are the other cars it's just gonna break
because<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.799> wasn't<00:03:56.949> prepped<00:03:57.280> correctly<00:03:57.699> yeah

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
because I wasn't prepped correctly yeah

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.059 
because I wasn't prepped correctly yeah
you<00:03:58.239> don't<00:03:58.389> win<00:03:58.599> races<00:03:58.780> with<00:03:59.169> broken<00:03:59.379> cars<00:03:59.739> you

of<00:04:09.340> really<00:04:09.639> fast<00:04:10.060> drivers<00:04:10.660> there

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
of really fast drivers there

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.509 
of really fast drivers there
I<00:04:11.849> think<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.719> sport<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.170> can't<00:04:13.650> do<00:04:14.280> well

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
I think in the sport you can't do well

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.759 
I think in the sport you can't do well
competitively<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.510> consistently<00:04:16.139> without<00:04:16.350> a

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
competitively and consistently without a

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.420 
competitively and consistently without a
really<00:04:17.160> strong<00:04:17.400> team<00:04:17.459> behind<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:22.250> one<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
really strong team behind you one of the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.950 
really strong team behind you one of the
best<00:04:23.610> experiences<00:04:24.120> I've<00:04:24.300> had<00:04:24.330> race<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.900> New

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
best experiences I've had race in New

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.779 
best experiences I've had race in New
Mexico<00:04:25.380> was<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.560> first<00:04:25.889> time<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.520> raced

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
Mexico was the first time that I raced

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.260 
Mexico was the first time that I raced
in<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.210> 2008<00:04:27.930> Baja<00:04:28.169> 1000<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.310> drove<00:04:30.150> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
in the 2008 Baja 1000 I drove the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.450 
in the 2008 Baja 1000 I drove the
finishing<00:04:30.690> section<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.380> class<00:04:31.620> 12<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.190> my<00:04:32.280> dad

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
finishing section in class 12 and my dad

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.700 
finishing section in class 12 and my dad
was<00:04:32.669> co-driver<00:04:33.090> for<00:04:33.360> me<00:04:33.449> there<00:04:34.199> are<00:04:34.320> two<00:04:34.470> lines

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
was co-driver for me there are two lines

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.560 
was co-driver for me there are two lines
and<00:04:35.100> one<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.280> them<00:04:35.370> up<00:04:35.520> was<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.669> bit<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.300> very

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and one of them up was a bit a very

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.120 
and one of them up was a bit a very
steep<00:04:36.870> hill<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.320> other<00:04:37.440> was<00:04:37.680> just<00:04:37.860> around

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
steep hill and the other was just around

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.650 
steep hill and the other was just around
the<00:04:38.280> mountain<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.210> got<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.419> little

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
the mountain and I got a little

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.060 
the mountain and I got a little
ambitious<00:04:40.199> and<00:04:40.380> thought<00:04:40.560> we<00:04:40.680> could<00:04:40.830> take<00:04:40.949> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
ambitious and thought we could take the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.890 
ambitious and thought we could take the
last<00:04:41.310> 12<00:04:41.639> car<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.060> go<00:04:42.120> straight<00:04:42.360> up<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.690> hill

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
last 12 car and go straight up the hill

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.659 
last 12 car and go straight up the hill
so<00:04:43.560> we<00:04:43.620> got<00:04:43.740> stuck<00:04:43.949> right<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.310> middle<00:04:44.400> of

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
so we got stuck right in the middle of

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.370 
so we got stuck right in the middle of
the<00:04:44.759> hill<00:04:44.940> there<00:04:45.690> must<00:04:45.870> have<00:04:45.900> been<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.110> dozen

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
the hill there must have been a dozen

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.499 
the hill there must have been a dozen
Mexican<00:04:47.099> kids<00:04:47.310> hanging<00:04:47.699> out<00:04:47.849> right<00:04:48.120> by<00:04:48.270> there

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
Mexican kids hanging out right by there

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.330 
Mexican kids hanging out right by there
cheering<00:04:48.810> us<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.440> we<00:04:49.500> were<00:04:49.770> stuck<00:04:50.070> these

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
cheering us on and we were stuck these

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.520 
cheering us on and we were stuck these
kids<00:04:50.669> helped<00:04:51.090> us<00:04:51.210> get<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.630> car<00:04:51.810> back<00:04:52.110> down<00:04:52.380> the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
kids helped us get the car back down the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.560 
kids helped us get the car back down the
hill<00:04:52.650> backwards<00:04:53.310> can<00:04:53.639> get<00:04:53.789> us<00:04:53.880> unstuck<00:04:54.090> and

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
hill backwards can get us unstuck and

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.710 
hill backwards can get us unstuck and
going<00:04:54.810> again<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:56.280> think<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.449> sums

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
going again and I think that that sums

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.060 
going again and I think that that sums
up<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.020> experience<00:04:58.470> with<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.650> fans<00:04:58.889> of

we always would have gotten to do this
earlier
