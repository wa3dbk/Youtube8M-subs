actually<00:00:35.629> today<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.949> first<00:00:37.160> two<00:00:37.340> games<00:00:37.460> were

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
actually today the first two games were

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.830 
actually today the first two games were
kind<00:00:38.000> of<00:00:38.090> stumped<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:38.870> I<00:00:39.860> think<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.219> was<00:00:40.840> under

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
kind of stumped and I think it was under

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.560 
kind of stumped and I think it was under
one<00:00:42.440> hand<00:00:42.680> because<00:00:43.190> we<00:00:43.609> played<00:00:43.820> against<00:00:44.090> three

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
one hand because we played against three

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.880 
one hand because we played against three
like<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.989> best<00:00:45.170> teams<00:00:45.410> from<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:46.160> world<00:00:46.460> and

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
like the best teams from the world and

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.099 
like the best teams from the world and
the<00:00:48.890> plate<00:00:49.160> are<00:00:49.430> like<00:00:49.730> team<00:00:50.390> compositions

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
the plate are like team compositions

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.880 
the plate are like team compositions
that<00:00:51.850> we<00:00:52.850> used<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.329> play<00:00:53.510> like<00:00:53.899> in<00:00:54.170> month<00:00:54.620> ago

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
that we used to play like in month ago

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.650 
that we used to play like in month ago
two<00:00:55.129> months<00:00:55.399> ago<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:55.820> didn't<00:00:56.120> really<00:00:56.300> adapt<00:00:56.539> to

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
two months ago we didn't really adapt to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.259 
two months ago we didn't really adapt to
the<00:00:56.719> meta<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.199> too<00:00:57.289> aggressive<00:00:57.890> play<00:00:58.850> styles

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
the meta and too aggressive play styles

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.869 
the meta and too aggressive play styles
that<00:00:59.420> these<00:00:59.840> things<00:00:59.989> have<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.429> truth<00:01:01.670> game

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
that these things have so the truth game

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.360 
that these things have so the truth game
today<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.179> last<00:01:02.539> game<00:01:02.750> really<00:01:03.530> just<00:01:03.800> went<00:01:04.100> all

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
today the last game really just went all

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.710 
today the last game really just went all
in<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.730> try<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.059> pick<00:01:05.239> new<00:01:05.420> stuff<00:01:05.690> like

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
in and try to pick new stuff like

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.990 
in and try to pick new stuff like
Cassiopeia<00:01:06.620> Diana<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:07.490> think<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.820> we've

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
Cassiopeia Diana and I think that we've

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.150 
Cassiopeia Diana and I think that we've
worked<00:01:08.180> out<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.690> helped<00:01:09.500> us<00:01:09.650> get<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.130> the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
worked out and helped us get to the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.120 
worked out and helped us get to the
laning<00:01:10.550> phase<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.240> mid<00:01:11.510> game<00:01:11.690> but<00:01:12.650> then<00:01:12.980> there

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.230 
just got stomped from the beginning and
if<00:01:54.890> you'd<00:01:55.040> gone<00:01:55.190> all-in<00:01:55.460> could<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.150> have

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
if you'd gone all-in could you have

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.690 
if you'd gone all-in could you have
changed<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.660> may<00:01:56.810> be<00:01:57.160> so<00:01:58.160> for<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.460> first

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
changed that may be so for the first

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.180 
changed that may be so for the first
game<00:01:58.910> I<00:01:59.210> think<00:02:00.140> even<00:02:00.290> if<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:00.740> picked<00:02:00.980> like

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
game I think even if we picked like

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.400 
game I think even if we picked like
whatever<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.940> best<00:02:02.150> team<00:02:02.420> configured<00:02:03.110> I

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
whatever the best team configured I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.800 
whatever the best team configured I
think<00:02:04.130> they<00:02:04.310> still<00:02:04.640> would<00:02:04.820> have<00:02:04.850> lost<00:02:05.210> like<00:02:05.510> a

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
think they still would have lost like a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.339 
think they still would have lost like a
lot<00:02:06.170> because<00:02:06.380> SKT<00:02:07.010> just<00:02:07.400> played<00:02:07.869> way<00:02:08.869> too<00:02:08.899> well

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
lot because SKT just played way too well

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.420 
lot because SKT just played way too well
like<00:02:09.590> they<00:02:09.860> are<00:02:10.099> classes<00:02:10.489> at<00:02:10.759> rotations<00:02:11.719> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
like they are classes at rotations and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.190 
like they are classes at rotations and
basically<00:02:13.430> everything<00:02:13.730> mechanically

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
basically everything mechanically

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.740 
basically everything mechanically
think<00:02:15.459> but<00:02:16.459> maybe<00:02:16.700> for<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:17.000> second<00:02:17.330> game<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.720> we

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
think but maybe for a second game if we

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.270 
think but maybe for a second game if we
picked<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:19.030> aggressive<00:02:20.560> comp<00:02:21.560> like<00:02:21.950> this

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
picked like aggressive comp like this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.940 
picked like aggressive comp like this
done<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.730> stuff<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.440> think<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.769> could

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
done and stuff I think that we could

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.589 
done and stuff I think that we could
actually<00:02:25.099> have<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.489> chance<00:02:25.550> at<00:02:25.849> beating<00:02:26.030> TSM

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
actually have a chance at beating TSM

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.330 
actually have a chance at beating TSM
because<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.410> way<00:02:27.530> they<00:02:27.590> played<00:02:27.920> they<00:02:28.280> were

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
because the way they played they were

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.729 
because the way they played they were
like<00:02:28.670> all<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> time<00:02:29.360> defensive<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.379> six

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
like all the time defensive like six

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.650 
like all the time defensive like six
versus<00:02:31.069> farming<00:02:31.489> MIT<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.030> they<00:02:32.540> were<00:02:32.630> just

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
versus farming MIT and they were just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.990 
versus farming MIT and they were just
telling<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.230> game<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.310> pushing<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
telling the game and just pushing the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.970 
telling the game and just pushing the
sidelines<00:02:35.390> not<00:02:35.569> really<00:02:35.810> doing<00:02:35.959> anything<00:02:36.260> else

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
sidelines not really doing anything else

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.210 
sidelines not really doing anything else
so<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.730> think<00:02:37.970> if<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.330> were<00:02:38.480> able<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:39.040> play<00:02:40.040> it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
so I think if we were able to play it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.750 
so I think if we were able to play it
like<00:02:40.760> out<00:02:41.500> aggressive<00:02:42.500> them<00:02:42.709> let's<00:02:43.340> say<00:02:43.549> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
like out aggressive them let's say I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.720 
like out aggressive them let's say I
think<00:02:44.180> we'll<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.690> chance<00:02:44.989> all<00:02:45.950> right<00:02:46.129> I'm

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
think we'll have a chance all right I'm

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.839 
think we'll have a chance all right I'm
with<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.780> mind<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.489> speaking<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.549> like

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
with that in mind then speaking of like

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.870 
with that in mind then speaking of like
playing<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.450> aggressive<00:02:51.340> for<00:02:52.340> your<00:02:52.430> next<00:02:52.670> line

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
playing it aggressive for your next line

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.509 
playing it aggressive for your next line
up<00:02:53.090> you're<00:02:53.660> facing<00:02:54.310> arguably<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.489> most

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
up you're facing arguably the most

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.449 
up you're facing arguably the most
aggressive<00:02:55.940> team<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.540> world<00:02:57.280> how<00:02:58.280> are<00:02:58.340> you

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
aggressive team in the world how are you

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.130 
aggressive team in the world how are you
how<00:02:58.819> do<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:58.940> plan<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.360> go<00:02:59.420> into<00:02:59.599> that<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.900> mean

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
how do you plan and go into that I mean

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.750 
how do you plan and go into that I mean
you<00:03:00.290> can't<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.680> can't<00:03:00.860> out<00:03:01.040> gress<00:03:01.310> these<00:03:01.519> guys

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
you can't you can't out gress these guys

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.020 
you can't you can't out gress these guys
so<00:03:02.390> what's<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.900> plan<00:03:03.760> actually<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:04.910> don't

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
so what's the plan actually we don't

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.460 
so what's the plan actually we don't
really<00:03:05.180> have<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> planet<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.590> don't<00:03:06.860> know

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
really have a planet so I don't know

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.750 
really have a planet so I don't know
that's<00:03:09.470> not<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.799> very<00:03:10.549> good<00:03:10.790> answer<00:03:11.120> um<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.700> but

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
that's not a very good answer um but but

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.460 
that's not a very good answer um but but
but<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:14.299> barring<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.630> then<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.930> mean<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.230> you

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
but but barring that then I mean you you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.229 
but but barring that then I mean you you
know<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.920> fact<00:03:16.099> that<00:03:16.250> they're<00:03:16.459> going<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.700> go

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
know for a fact that they're going to go

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.360 
know for a fact that they're going to go
for<00:03:17.450> some<00:03:17.569> some<00:03:17.930> rom<00:03:18.319> you<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.950> might<00:03:19.130> see

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
for some some rom you you you might see

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.530 
for some some rom you you you might see
a<00:03:19.400> nanny<00:03:19.609> but<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:20.030> might<00:03:20.180> see<00:03:20.329> all<00:03:20.359> these

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
a nanny but you might see all these

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.420 
a nanny but you might see all these
things<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:21.319> you<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.530> an<00:03:21.650> idea<00:03:22.069> of<00:03:22.100> what<00:03:22.250> you

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
things do you have an idea of what you

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.830 
things do you have an idea of what you
could<00:03:22.670> do<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.880> try<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.180> counter<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.600> stuff

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
could do to try and counter this stuff

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.199 
could do to try and counter this stuff
yeah<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:24.530> course<00:03:24.769> like<00:03:24.950> we<00:03:25.549> screamed<00:03:25.850> am<00:03:26.000> I

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
yeah of course like we screamed am I

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.340 
yeah of course like we screamed am I
think<00:03:26.540> yesterday<00:03:26.720> EDG<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:29.049> fink<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.109> first

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
think yesterday EDG and I fink the first

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.319 
think yesterday EDG and I fink the first
game<00:03:30.530> we<00:03:30.889> actually<00:03:31.160> it's<00:03:31.340> quite<00:03:31.549> well<00:03:31.819> but

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
game we actually it's quite well but

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.170 
game we actually it's quite well but
josh<00:03:33.139> is<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:33.680> clearly<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.579> most<00:03:34.819> aggressive

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
josh is like clearly the most aggressive

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.599 
josh is like clearly the most aggressive
team<00:03:35.510> that's<00:03:36.139> playing<00:03:36.739> here<00:03:37.010> probably<00:03:37.280> as<00:03:37.519> you

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
team that's playing here probably as you

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.590 
team that's playing here probably as you
said<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.260> we<00:03:40.190> easily<00:03:40.400> have<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.790> go<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:41.150> really

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
said so we easily have to go like really

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.479 
said so we easily have to go like really
this<00:03:41.959> difference<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:42.709> calm<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.069> will<00:03:43.280> just

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
this difference if calm that will just

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.330 
this difference if calm that will just
stole<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.000> game<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.540> like<00:03:45.010> defender<00:03:46.010> carries

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
stole the game and like defender carries

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.550 
stole the game and like defender carries
and<00:03:46.790> we<00:03:46.880> can<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.060> scare<00:03:47.389> them<00:03:47.569> back<00:03:47.750> or<00:03:48.380> we

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
and we can just scare them back or we

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.430

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
underestimated you they didn't actually

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.150 
underestimated you they didn't actually
take<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.000> seriously<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:12.079> almost<00:04:12.680> did

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
take you seriously and you almost did

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.309 
take you seriously and you almost did
turn<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.639> on<00:04:13.730> them<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.880> few<00:04:14.090> times<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.959> had<00:04:15.079> that

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
turn it on them a few times you had that

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.960 
turn it on them a few times you had that
really<00:04:15.650> unlucky<00:04:16.039> engaging<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.639> was<00:04:16.729> hard<00:04:16.910> to

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
really unlucky engaging it was hard to

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.229 
really unlucky engaging it was hard to
come<00:04:17.180> back<00:04:17.329> from<00:04:17.389> but<00:04:18.289> I<00:04:18.530> mean<00:04:19.340> they<00:04:20.060> weren't

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
come back from but I mean they weren't

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.089 
come back from but I mean they weren't
taking<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.660> seriously<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.440> do<00:04:21.799> have<00:04:21.950> that

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
taking you seriously so you do have that

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.680 
taking you seriously so you do have that
kind<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.430> going<00:04:22.729> for<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.060> that<00:04:23.210> they<00:04:23.479> don't

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
kind of going for you that they don't

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.870 
kind of going for you that they don't
know<00:04:23.780> what<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.080> expect<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.770> mean<00:04:24.950> can<00:04:25.159> you<00:04:25.220> I'm

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
know what to expect I mean can you I'm

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.310 
know what to expect I mean can you I'm
not<00:04:26.030> asking<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.450> reveal<00:04:26.690> your<00:04:26.900> secrets

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
not asking you to reveal your secrets

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.110 
not asking you to reveal your secrets
obviously

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
obviously

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.750 
obviously
but<00:04:29.120> but<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.510> do<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:29.930> think<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.410> maybe

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
but but you do you think that maybe

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.100 
but but you do you think that maybe
going<00:04:31.760> full<00:04:31.940> unicorns<00:04:32.480> of<00:04:32.570> love<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.840> them<00:04:32.990> like

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
going full unicorns of love on them like

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.020 
going full unicorns of love on them like
could<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.350> pull<00:04:33.620> something<00:04:33.830> crazy<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.490> maybe

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
could you pull something crazy and maybe

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.020 
could you pull something crazy and maybe
catch<00:04:35.270> them<00:04:35.480> with<00:04:35.600> their<00:04:35.720> guard<00:04:35.900> down<00:04:37.030> maybe

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
catch them with their guard down maybe

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.680 
catch them with their guard down maybe
but<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:40.130> thing<00:04:40.400> react<00:04:40.640> probably<00:04:41.090> gonna<00:04:41.240> do<00:04:41.450> is

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
but the thing react probably gonna do is

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.450 
but the thing react probably gonna do is
just<00:04:41.960> like<00:04:42.140> this<00:04:42.350> last<00:04:42.530> game<00:04:42.770> just<00:04:43.250> go<00:04:43.430> for

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
this is our first tournament against

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.440 
this is our first tournament against
teams<00:05:07.100> like<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.910> it's<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.150> first

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
teams like this and it's a first

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.300 
teams like this and it's a first
experience<00:05:08.930> if<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.200> can<00:05:09.380> get<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.860> little<00:05:09.980> bit

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
experience if you can get a little bit

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.460 
experience if you can get a little bit
and<00:05:10.430> learn<00:05:10.640> from<00:05:10.670> it<00:05:11.030> then<00:05:11.600> add<00:05:11.870> these<00:05:12.170> things

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
and learn from it then add these things

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.660 
and learn from it then add these things
into<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.920> practice<00:05:13.640> I<00:05:13.910> think<00:05:14.570> we<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:15.490> we<00:05:16.490> can

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
into the practice I think we can we can

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.020 
into the practice I think we can we can
get<00:05:17.480> on<00:05:17.750> like<00:05:17.960> really<00:05:18.320> high<00:05:18.440> ALCS<00:05:19.160> level<00:05:19.520> it's

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
get on like really high ALCS level it's

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.330 
get on like really high ALCS level it's
just<00:05:20.270> we<00:05:21.200> just<00:05:21.410> need<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.590> time<00:05:21.830> this<00:05:22.070> is<00:05:22.190> our

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
just we just need a time this is our

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.000 
just we just need a time this is our
first<00:05:22.580> experience<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.330> yeah<00:05:23.930> for<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.740> first

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
first experience so yeah for a first

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.680 
first experience so yeah for a first
time<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.430> think<00:05:25.760> you've<00:05:25.970> been<00:05:26.000> doing<00:05:26.390> it<00:05:26.480> fairly
