area this height which is five inches so
it's<00:00:42.120> two<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.600> half<00:00:42.750> inches<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> center

to this point I measured that height
from<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> floor<00:00:48.660> now<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> again<00:00:49.920> misses

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
from the floor now this is again misses

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.720 
from the floor now this is again misses
as<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> store<00:00:52.730> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
area - 36 to 38 is the height of the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.859 
area - 36 to 38 is the height of the
handrail<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.829> measured<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> 36<00:01:36.479> inches

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
handrail so I measured up to 36 inches

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.969 
handrail so I measured up to 36 inches
from<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> face<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.939> stair<00:01:39.240> up

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
from the from the face of the stair up

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
from the from the face of the stair up
to<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.369> there's<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.060> faint<00:01:42.450> line

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to here and there's a little faint line

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.219 
to here and there's a little faint line
but<00:01:43.110> again<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.960> 36<00:01:45.960> inches

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
but again they see it but it's 36 inches

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.380 
but again they see it but it's 36 inches
up<00:01:46.460> from<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> floor<00:01:48.409> which<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:51.119> to

up from the floor which is here up to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.270 
up from the floor which is here up to
that<00:01:51.540> same<00:01:51.780> mark<00:01:52.549> is<00:01:53.549> 43<00:01:54.299> inches<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> can

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that same mark is 43 inches so you can

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.569 
that same mark is 43 inches so you can
see<00:01:56.430> where<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> can't<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:58.579> you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.140 
fine so if this is 36 or 43 depending on
your<00:02:17.790> reference<00:02:18.209> point<00:02:18.769> 43<00:02:19.769> now<00:02:20.040> from<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
your reference point 43 now from the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.750 
your reference point 43 now from the
same<00:02:21.360> spot<00:02:21.689> which<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.140> floor<00:02:22.379> up<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
same spot which is the floor up to this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.449 
same spot which is the floor up to this
line<00:02:23.970> which<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.180> 49<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.079> half<00:02:25.459> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
line which is 49 and a half the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.369 
line which is 49 and a half the
difference<00:02:26.730> between<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.230> need

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
difference between that is what you need

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.429 
difference between that is what you need
to<00:02:28.500> cut<00:02:28.739> off<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.879> cut<00:02:30.299> off<00:02:30.450> 6<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> half

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
to cut off so I cut off 6 and a half

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.429 
to cut off so I cut off 6 and a half
inches<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.310> that's<00:02:34.280> effective<00:02:36.230> take<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.349> to

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
inches and that's effective take it to

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.470 
inches and that's effective take it to
the<00:02:37.560> soft<00:02:39.260> chop<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.439> whole<00:02:40.590> bad<00:02:40.739> boy<00:02:40.980> off<00:02:41.480> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the soft chop that whole bad boy off and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:58.099 
the soft chop that whole bad boy off and
now<00:02:43.069> when<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.099> go<00:02:46.159> up<00:02:47.159> to<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:50.269> ok<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.959> see

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
now when you go up to the ok you can see

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.789 
now when you go up to the ok you can see
this<00:02:58.260> then<00:02:58.579> there<00:02:59.579> we<00:02:59.670> go

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
this then there we go

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.289 
this then there we go
the<00:03:01.799> black<00:03:02.159> line<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.329> 36<00:03:04.109> inch<00:03:04.290> mark

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
the black line is the 36 inch mark

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.030 
the black line is the 36 inch mark
there<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.389> go<00:03:06.480> 36<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:09.470> just<00:03:10.470> by<00:03:10.590> taking<00:03:10.620> off

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
there you go 36 so just by taking off

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.099 
there you go 36 so just by taking off
now<00:03:11.250> what<00:03:12.150> happened<00:03:12.480> at<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.720> center<00:03:13.079> line

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
now what happened at this center line

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.460 
now what happened at this center line
just<00:03:13.950> post<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:15.150> handrail<00:03:15.720> will<00:03:15.930> will<00:03:16.290> die

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
just post the handrail will will die

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.809 
just post the handrail will will die
into<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:17.090> about<00:03:18.090> 36<00:03:18.810> inches<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.669> will<00:03:20.669> leave

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
into it about 36 inches is will leave

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.909 
into it about 36 inches is will leave
the<00:03:20.940> centerline<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.569> handrail<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.739> hem

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
the centerline of the handrail the hem

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.460 
the centerline of the handrail the hem
will<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.569> you<00:03:24.569> know<00:03:24.599> certain<00:03:25.019> dimension

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
will have you know certain dimension

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.439 
will have you know certain dimension
higher<00:03:25.799> or<00:03:25.949> lower<00:03:26.099> longer<00:03:26.849> them<00:03:27.090> within<00:03:27.329> that

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
higher or lower longer them within that

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.409 
higher or lower longer them within that
range<00:03:27.629> I'm<00:03:27.870> working<00:03:28.139> off<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.379> centerline<00:03:28.739> so

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
range I'm working off the centerline so

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.430 
range I'm working off the centerline so
Maggie<00:03:30.419> and<00:03:30.629> your<00:03:30.750> height<00:03:30.870> restrictions

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
Maggie and your height restrictions

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.909 
Maggie and your height restrictions
change<00:03:31.980> by<00:03:32.220> area<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.120> my<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:34.049> go<00:03:34.139> from<00:03:34.290> 36<00:03:34.859> to

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
change by area so my can go from 36 to

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.479 
change by area so my can go from 36 to
38<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.639> I<00:03:35.849> have<00:03:36.209> enough<00:03:36.419> clap<00:03:36.690> top<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.829> allow<00:03:38.250> to

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
38 so I have enough clap top to allow to

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.849 
38 so I have enough clap top to allow to
move<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.419> down<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:40.560> if<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.799> a

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
move up and down but if you have a

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:41.960 
move up and down but if you have a
different<00:03:41.129> handrail<00:03:41.459> style<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.940> should

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
different handrail style you should

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.839 
different handrail style you should
probably<00:03:42.359> take<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.290> whole<00:03:43.919> dimension<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
probably take that whole dimension to

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.219 
probably take that whole dimension to
make<00:03:45.030> sure<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.389> within<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.810> range<00:03:46.049> so

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
make sure you within that range so

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.879 
make sure you within that range so
you're<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:46.590> going<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.889> be<00:03:47.150> out<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.299> code

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
you're not going to be out of code

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.670 
you're not going to be out of code
anyway<00:03:49.889> now<00:03:50.069> we're<00:03:50.340> going<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:51.229> pre-drill<00:03:52.229> from

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
anyway now we're going to pre-drill from

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.129 
anyway now we're going to pre-drill from
both<00:03:52.859> sides<00:03:53.510> because<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.599> don't<00:03:54.780> have<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> bit

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
both sides because I don't have a bit

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.949 
both sides because I don't have a bit
long<00:03:55.349> enough<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.739> go<00:03:55.859> all<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:55.979> way<00:03:56.040> through

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
long enough to go all the way through

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.979 
long enough to go all the way through
lag<00:03:57.959> bolts<00:03:58.379> lag<00:03:59.370> bolts<00:03:59.729> into<00:03:59.970> there<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.419> then

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
lag bolts lag bolts into there and then

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.339 
lag bolts lag bolts into there and then
set<00:04:01.229> the<00:04:01.349> post<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.889> then<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.760> can<00:04:03.269> cut<00:04:04.229> the

set the post and then I can cut the
handrail<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:05.010> length<00:04:05.269> put<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.389> rosette<00:04:06.859> right

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859
