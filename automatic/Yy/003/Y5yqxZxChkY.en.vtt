we're going to start off at first base

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.759 
we're going to start off at first base
and<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> first<00:00:10.080> thing<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.349> want<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.590> talk

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
is really not the only way to hold a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.410 
is really not the only way to hold a
runner<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.880> especially<00:00:18.060> as<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
runner here and especially as a

right-hander getting pick offs is really

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.990

somebody<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.869> first<00:00:25.109> base<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.650> really

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
somebody off at first base is really

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.250 
somebody off at first base is really
kind<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> bonus<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.570> whole<00:00:27.720> thing

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
kind of a bonus out of the whole thing

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.900 
kind of a bonus out of the whole thing
our<00:00:28.619> whole<00:00:28.830> premise<00:00:29.070> every<00:00:29.490> time<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.789> we

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
our whole premise every time that we

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.430 
our whole premise every time that we
have<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> runner<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.260> work<00:00:31.289> on

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
have a runner on is really to work on

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.240 
have a runner on is really to work on
disrupting<00:00:34.440> his<00:00:34.590> timing<00:00:35.450> disrupting<00:00:36.450> anytime

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
disrupting his timing disrupting anytime

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
disrupting his timing disrupting anytime
just<00:00:38.250> kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> keeping<00:00:38.700> them<00:00:38.820> off<00:00:38.940> balance<00:00:38.969> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
just kind of keeping them off balance so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.090 
just kind of keeping them off balance so
he<00:00:39.870> doesn't<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.379> way<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.620> go<00:00:40.739> with

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
he doesn't know which way to go with

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.260 
he doesn't know which way to go with
whether<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.370> goes<00:00:41.460> needing<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.850> needs<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.149> go

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
whether it goes needing is needs to go

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900 
whether it goes needing is needs to go
back<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> bag<00:00:43.040> whether<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.760> he

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
back to the bag whether you know he

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.520 
back to the bag whether you know he
feels<00:00:45.120> comfortable<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> second<00:00:46.350> base

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
feels comfortable going to second base

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
feels comfortable going to second base
so<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.120> thing<00:00:48.239> we're<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> talk

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
so the first thing we're going to talk

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.049 
so the first thing we're going to talk
about<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.140> varying<00:00:50.010> our<00:00:50.129> times<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> plate

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
about is varying our times to the plate

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
about is varying our times to the plate
so<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.620> I'll<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.860> up

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
so what we're going to do is I'll go up

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170 
so what we're going to do is I'll go up
top<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.340> mountain<00:00:53.610> we'll<00:00:53.699> talk<00:00:53.910> through

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
top of the mountain we'll talk through

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.560 
top of the mountain we'll talk through
it<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:57.030> when<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.270> vary

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it a little bit is that when we vary

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.729 
it a little bit is that when we vary
time<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:59.460> what<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.140> every

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
time that what we can do here is every

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.310 
time that what we can do here is every
time<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.949> come<00:01:02.280> set<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> know<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.260> of

time I come set and I know a lot of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
time I come set and I know a lot of
young<00:01:04.559> pitchers<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:05.159> they're<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.400> pick

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
young pitchers if they're gonna pick

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.149 
young pitchers if they're gonna pick

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
like that and all three of those we're

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.510 
like that and all three of those we're
really<00:02:02.909> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.170> disrupt<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.530> good<00:02:05.310> base

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
really going to disrupt a good base

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280 
really going to disrupt a good base
runners<00:02:05.850> timing<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.659> hold<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> ball

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
for any length of time especially a guy

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.900 
for any length of time especially a guy
that<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.050> wants<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.800> you're<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that really wants to go you're going to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.840 
that really wants to go you're going to
deaden<00:02:12.270> out<00:02:12.360> his<00:02:12.510> life

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
deaden out his life

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.020 
deaden out his life
okay<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.690> then<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.290> step<00:02:14.530> off<00:02:14.800> very<00:02:15.790> good

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
okay so then you can step off very good

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.610 
okay so then you can step off very good
if<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.390> control<00:02:16.780> your<00:02:16.990> balance<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.530> your

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
if you can control your balance and your

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.140 
if you can control your balance and your
movement<00:02:18.070> on<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> mound<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:18.970> hold

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
movement on the mound that you can hold

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.060 
movement on the mound that you can hold
it<00:02:19.270> until<00:02:19.390> somebody<00:02:19.810> calls<00:02:20.050> time<00:02:20.350> or<00:02:20.890> if

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
it until somebody calls time or if

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.440 
it until somebody calls time or if
there's<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.340> point<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.880> time<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.270> nobody

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
there's a point in that time that nobody

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.710 
there's a point in that time that nobody
is<00:02:22.980> then<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.130> can<00:02:24.340> step<00:02:24.580> off<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.630> that's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
is then you can step off but that's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.140 
is then you can step off but that's
usually<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.260> great<00:02:26.920> way<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.160> deaden<00:02:27.610> out<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> fast

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
usually a great way to deaden out a fast

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.680 
usually a great way to deaden out a fast
runner<00:02:28.480> dead<00:02:29.020> notice<00:02:29.380> legs
