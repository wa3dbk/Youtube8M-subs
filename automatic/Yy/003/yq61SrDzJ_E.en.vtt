00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.440
 after the huge success that should 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.770
 cleaning and Xbox 360 in 2006 came time 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.960
 of the continuation must there in 211 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.689
 many are infested with thousands of 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.320
 zombies and hundreds of ways to end 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.320
 with them 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.150
 different from the first one the frame is 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.980
 in the new fictitious strong city insire and 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.220
 You're in the shock jacket now. 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.770
 felipe jones the famous motorcycle rider 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.290
 show theo premiere henin and after the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.840
 exhibition a mysterious group released 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.150
 zombies around the city and set it up so that 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.540
 Czech would become the culprit 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.250
 The case was familiar because the whole 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.220
 format is very similar to the first one 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.600
 the more you would leave security 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.580
 through an air duct that 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.830
 curiously from the director a mall 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.960
 center and still receives new missions 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.600
 through the radio by a girl called 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.180
 stacey 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.190
 also as in the first 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.340
 the missions have a time to breathe 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.890
 while you complete them save civilians and 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.660
 Thousands of zombies you win 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.690
 experience points that increase your 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.090
 level guaranteeing more life plus space 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.130
 inventory and new attack moves 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.330
 how this elusive followed by a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.729
 kick but not everything is the same as yours 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.700
 and the predecessor is the great novelty 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.050
 insertion of combo cards 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.119
 responsible for you to combine items and 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.780
 create the most deadly weapons ever 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.780
 views 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.140
 kill zombies with a baseball bat 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.720
 It can be fun but after you combine 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.390
 I need it with nails, the thing is much more 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.850
 fun and can become crazier 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.250
 also how to combine a metal bucket and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.490
 a drill to make the helmet more 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.830
 terrifying from the west 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 and if you are without weapons you do not have 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.929
 problem just look around and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.420
 improvise umbrellas wheelchairs 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.820
 with motor vehicles such as cars and 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.049
 almost all the scenery can be 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.140
 used as a weapon one thing you can have 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.660

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.390
 you can spend hours saving 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.280
 hostages killing thousands of zombies or 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.830
 confronting the mini chefs while 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.700
 level and to make a break in the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.260
 killing 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.049
 You can have a stroll around the mall. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.709
 visiting stores and even switching from 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.750
 clothes 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.700

 [Music] 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.870
 although the graphics did not impress on 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.420
 there are some small dead rising bugs 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.040
