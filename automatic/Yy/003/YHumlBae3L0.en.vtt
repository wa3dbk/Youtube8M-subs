my<00:02:53.769> SFTP<00:02:54.769> account<00:02:55.010> for<00:02:55.760> FTP<00:02:56.390> users<00:02:57.260> zero<00:02:57.530> one

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
my SFTP account for FTP users zero one

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.900 
my SFTP account for FTP users zero one
and<00:02:58.930> because<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.110> SFTP<00:03:00.829> I'm<00:03:01.190> prompted<00:03:01.459> for

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
and because it's SFTP I'm prompted for

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.720 
and because it's SFTP I'm prompted for
the<00:03:02.079> SSH

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the SSH

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.320 
the SSH
I<00:03:04.959> guess<00:03:05.959> it's<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.319> certificate<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:08.090> I'm<00:03:08.180> going

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
I guess it's a certificate so I'm going

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.290 
I guess it's a certificate so I'm going

so<00:04:12.230> just<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.350> demonstrate<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.220> two

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
so just to demonstrate that the two

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.820 
so just to demonstrate that the two
videos<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.090> did<00:04:15.480> actually<00:04:16.940> combines<00:04:17.940> both

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
videos that I did actually combines both

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.970 
videos that I did actually combines both
FTP<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.130> SFTP<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:22.080> them<00:04:22.290> operate<00:04:22.800> on

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
FTP and SFTP and have them operate on

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.790 
FTP and SFTP and have them operate on
the<00:04:23.280> same<00:04:23.310> folder<00:04:24.380> appointing<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.590> same

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
the same folder appointing to the same

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.000 
the same folder appointing to the same
user<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:27.660> that's<00:04:27.870> what<00:04:28.080> I've<00:04:28.170> achieved<00:04:28.380> in

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
user so that's what I've achieved in

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.160 
user so that's what I've achieved in
those<00:04:29.220> two<00:04:29.460> videos<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.750> check<00:04:30.990> out

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
those two videos and if you check out

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.720 
those two videos and if you check out
the<00:04:31.230> description<00:04:31.530> area<00:04:32.130> of<00:04:32.310> this<00:04:32.370> video

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
the description area of this video

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.370 
the description area of this video
you'll<00:04:33.120> find<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.480> links<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.870> those<00:04:33.990> two<00:04:34.230> other

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
you'll find the links to those two other

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.340 
you'll find the links to those two other
videos<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.400> if<00:04:35.760> that's<00:04:36.030> what<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.080> want<00:04:37.290> to

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.010 
videos so if that's what you want to
achieve<00:04:37.440> on<00:04:37.980> one<00:04:38.490> Windows<00:04:38.910> box<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.870> actually

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
achieve on one Windows box to actually

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.580 
achieve on one Windows box to actually
serve<00:04:40.470> up<00:04:40.740> FTP<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:42.080> SFTP<00:04:43.940> one<00:04:45.140> FTP<00:04:46.140> running<00:04:46.470> on

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
serve up FTP and SFTP one FTP running on

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.670 
serve up FTP and SFTP one FTP running on
port<00:04:46.800> 21<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.580> SFTP<00:04:48.390> running<00:04:49.080> on<00:04:49.230> strictly

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
port 21 and SFTP running on strictly

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.540 
port 21 and SFTP running on strictly
port<00:04:49.950> 22<00:04:50.280> that's<00:04:51.240> how<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.480> can<00:04:51.780> achieve<00:04:51.870> that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
port 22 that's how you can achieve that

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.950 
port 22 that's how you can achieve that
you'll<00:04:53.550> notice<00:04:53.760> there's<00:04:54.120> slight<00:04:54.390> differences

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
you'll notice there's slight differences

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.700 
you'll notice there's slight differences
on<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:57.030> goes<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:57.720> home<00:04:57.930> directory<00:04:57.960> and

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
on is it goes to the home directory and

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.460 
on is it goes to the home directory and
the<00:04:59.520> home<00:04:59.700> directory<00:04:59.970> or<00:05:00.480> root<00:05:00.720> directory<00:05:01.260> it

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
the home directory or root directory it

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.880 
the home directory or root directory it
really<00:05:01.950> isolates<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:03.030> just<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.360> slash<00:05:03.890> so

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
really isolates it to just the slash so

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.560 
really isolates it to just the slash so
I<00:05:04.920> can't<00:05:05.250> go<00:05:05.400> above<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.120> home<00:05:06.270> directory

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
I can't go above the home directory

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.650 
I can't go above the home directory
whereas<00:05:07.140> in<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.440> SFTP<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:08.820> does<00:05:09.090> have<00:05:09.390> the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
whereas in the SFTP it does have the

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.800 
whereas in the SFTP it does have the
slash<00:05:09.990> home<00:05:10.230> slash<00:05:10.580> username<00:05:11.580> for

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
slash home slash username for

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.590 
slash home slash username for
but<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:15.050> also<00:05:15.500> can't<00:05:15.920> go<00:05:16.130> beyond<00:05:16.490> that<00:05:16.730> or<00:05:17.240> any

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
but I also can't go beyond that or any

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.650 
but I also can't go beyond that or any
of<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.870> things<00:05:18.050> above<00:05:18.470> if<00:05:18.770> you<00:05:18.830> follow<00:05:19.630> how<00:05:20.630> I

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
of the things above if you follow how I

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.440 
of the things above if you follow how I
actually<00:05:20.960> set<00:05:21.770> up<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.010> permissions

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
actually set up the permissions

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.380 
actually set up the permissions
so<00:05:25.080> in<00:05:25.440> any<00:05:25.590> case<00:05:25.830> that's<00:05:26.160> what<00:05:26.820> I<00:05:26.850> did<00:05:27.120> and

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
so in any case that's what I did and
