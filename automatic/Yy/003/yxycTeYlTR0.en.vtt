00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to all this in person face with masters in 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.440
 In this case, together we have quite 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.960
 bad position in my opinion what do you think? 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.330
 I think we're fine 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.090
 try to find some kind of interview 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.000
 at her feet 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.160
 We are playing to shift even the market from Germany 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.949
 pretty famous grandmaster now 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.640
 ford is far from the peak of the form 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.460
 less so but White has an extra pawn is not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.460
 the pawn has been bad but not yet 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:46.489
 we want t5 g5 to check c4d 6 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 please lower 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.440
 it will make noise and fate is not new 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 now us and what he can do 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.170
 and hey you che it 400 you to damage on 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.830
 plug this elephant 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.369
 Well, you are all above new and shut up 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.170
 shutting up soon 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.170
 here is the tortuosity 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.050
 b3 pancakes don't go and you just become 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.580
 at the base now it makes a noise I felt 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.120
 though wind off anything it's nice to live 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.940
 comments on the right are just 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:37.980
 super toxic tutorial commentary 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:41.610
 so so can we not be okay yes 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:48.150
 knight take knight back we multiply by 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:52.160
 f4 respect not in 4 voice everything is now ours 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.160
 measles would be on the family would be a killer 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.940
 then or until 5 you will be like that very 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.700
 hard sense course he too was to be 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.570
 as for a dog if you enter arson 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.200
 about this find it for your friend what 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.890
 whether to change 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.870
 It is usually given to know the grandmaster especially 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.930
 German chamberlain and aged 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:25.550
 pretty good but anyway yes who am i 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.410
 owe me too i will turn on 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.160
 but you have to be some gesture of them 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.160
 Eventually 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 so not that thoughtful not want trouble 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.739
 fighters degree sometimes it seems to me that my 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.290
 the computer starts to make noise then when you 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.980
 doing what is not for example 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.329
 teddy bear 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.700
 for some reason he started very fast aviation 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.620
 already time lag has decreased 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.069
 thoroughly all right, we think 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.069
 watched policy position all not bad 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.079
 no you have of course 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:15.160
 a bunch of weakness well, okay topic conscience 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:18.519
 given from not given and not eaten 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.290
 It will always be like this 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.400
 cool gas c3 and it becomes completely not 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.000
 heard here a clamp so the tactics don't 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:39.050
 passes neither type finds I wanted to beat 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:47.120
 on on clear 2 and 23 there together here 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:52.370
 stop on the floor you can beat like this 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:04:00.230
 Yes, and I will reduce it and we have a great 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:02.450
 pawn sucked won barely fit on 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.840
 believe me of course still take up to 5 5 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:12.050
 and the animusa the sun itself 5 would be 5 in a hurry 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.030
 it is impossible he would 5 also in a hurry 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:22.790
 clamps caught passing catch caught withdrawn 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.250
 and all now need to roll up to 4 by 4 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.480
 quickly leave the pawn 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.450
 block the volume of the fields there everything is here 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.790
 one night she pawn dark 3 put 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.980
 you don't even know what we want 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.380
 actually well should be somehow fans 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.940
 once extra pawns a day but not obvious 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.990
 the past is very good why not see 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.450
 blocks on these tadam so vary 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.520
 anyone's life here yes now is necessary 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.320
 kingside pushing it ours 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.040
 Tesla chance of victory can not be so 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.900
 bad chance ya pawn at 5 they give 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:04.300
 on foot it became then we are not abiding 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:08.660
 here we wonâ€™t benefit chess 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:12.530
 up there I 'll die everything is gone 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.550
 cooks yes yes thank you all for your attention 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.550
