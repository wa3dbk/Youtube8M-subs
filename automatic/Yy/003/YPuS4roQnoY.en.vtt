00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.739
 in this film public director and a great lover of chess 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.750
 I decided to introduce a game actually played in 1903 by citraro e 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.789
 shirley shelabarger 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.770
 finally they face each other 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.770
 the free astronaut could in the computer hal 9000 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 bungalow the queen mother i believe 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.070
 the bishop but you know it or even tufano rules 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.480
 tower of on tv I'm sorry franca maybe you missed you networks in mind you 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.360
 bishop eat tadpoles i remain mates scacco matto 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.560
 well it seems 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.500
 thanks for the beautiful game 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.820
 the initial part of the game is not seen in the film 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 but it went like this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.630
 and at this point that is the scene beginning in the just made attack of 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.780
 discovery on the white woman dying the bishop 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 the options are not many 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.150
 it is clear that the fact that black has left its own enterprise 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.980
 store 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.370
 inna 8 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.100
 it was not a conspicuous move given as it brought the white queen 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.920
 away from the battle site read all the other pieces of the black cat 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 still developed 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.839
 obviously the black queen cannot be taken because 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.729
 the checkmate would immediately follow as the computer says 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:26.879
 in reality in spite of what he said to the game is not yet third of the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.669
 white at least two so fast this can even be one of the 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.669
 first signs of its imbalance that will lead then 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.060
 mission compromise during the film 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.159
 in fact white can avoid dictatorship to the queen 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.899
 for example by moving one's own 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.980
 initials 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.500
 this to avoid the checkmate with the horse in h3 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.199
 the problem is that white must succumb soon the same
