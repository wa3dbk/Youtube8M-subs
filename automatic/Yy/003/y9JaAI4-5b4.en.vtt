00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.500
 where do I show a recipe for 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.939
 Sushi 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.320
 What I 'm talking about and if there were 12 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.970
 and from talking right 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.060
 But I'm not going to talk like this not because 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.000
 I'm not mistaken, a rope well tomorrow, I 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.150
 I will tell the story of how the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.530
 sushi and because we eat the fish with 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.150
 rice and seaweed 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.150
 this way the company 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.450
 How do you know japan there? 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.540
 principal commercial activity of a 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.270
 island is the production of fish in which 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.430
 Let's start with this beautiful fish. 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.000
 piece of salmon 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.330
 I'll get my sif knife and cut some 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.820
 some historians record 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.800
 that the word sushi means fish 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.080
 conserved in August 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.520
 so the idea is the following we go 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.740
 catch the fish and use the rice as 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 preservative that's right the logic is 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.360
 wrap fish assembling rice 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.149
 this Japanese rice that is a bit more 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.930
 sticky he has a little more coma 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.130
 sticky than the fine of rice 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.850
 that we eat in the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.460
 brazil and put the wrapped fish in the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.610
 However, this rice is expected to 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.410
 and in fermentation the fermentation 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.360
 bacteria will produce acetic acid 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.200
 rice vinegar and it is this acetic acid 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.200
 that will conserve the fish for longer 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.240
 the very ingredients are these leaves 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 of class 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.340
 obviously Japanese did not use leaves 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.920
 industrialized countries such as 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 these are actually sheets of paper 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.190
 lesson is a recycled paper with the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.470
 complete and dry with this format 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.510
 just as we play the role of one day 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.480
 using cellulose 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.090
 most likely in Japan there are classes 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 were actually leaves of a seaweed 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.770
 red called noriko today we go 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.920
 use the one that is the only one available in 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.920
 Marketplace 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.150
 the staff looks at what I did one 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.870
 seaweed box that's where I go 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.980
 make my sushi for our chile in 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.020
 end will have fish wrapped rice 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.470
 on this lesson sheet so now I go 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.020
 put a layer of rice to serve 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:05.030
 of cane for our salmon 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.030
 Now I'm going to add the fish. 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.700
 I'm going to make another coverage with 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.310
 japanese rice 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.360
 here at this time we have to think 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.240
 enough to not leave spaces is 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.010
 public fish otherwise our fish will 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.460
 be attacked bacteria remember that the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.080
 principle of business here is to conserve 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.300
 fish 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.330
 come on I am but the japanese use 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.030
 wooden boxes with a false bottom 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.100
 background coming out and you can get the 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.770
 I smell here easily I go 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.630
 use it from here I believe it goes 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.010
 succeed 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.800
 go there our salmon brick with 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.900
 rice and nori seaweed now the challenge 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.710
 Can you get this out of God, I can? 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.340
 I'll try 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.340
 lets see if it works 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.850
 this is our emerging fashion samurai 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:36.310
 and I think that the 2001 people came to 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:39.220
 see that he has only one thing more 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.110
 an ingredient in our revenue is this 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.780
 but it had green 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.960
 this is a root wasabi paste 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.510
 strong this paste has bactericidal action 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.660
 so if you're going to eat raw fish it's 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.850
 The better you eat with the know and it is 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.440
 so I'll give it to the beginning and 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.440
 to see and experience and today 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.479
 Yes, I'm sure my 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.479
 Guests will not have money 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:43.289
 Kissed and kissed Samurai 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.289
 I'm going to eat without making ugly faces. 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:54.479
