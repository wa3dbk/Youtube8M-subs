00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.490
 of beta-carotene supplements 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.490
 but also men must be protected 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.090
 and we have neglected men a little because 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.639
 are quite 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.900
 Avantaggiati 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.090
 from the fact that the melasma ineffects prefers the in the female sex 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.490

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.839
 They do not have to 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:31.219
 expose them cheerfully to the sun then let us remember apart from the melasma that it is 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.549
 men are women who are clear subjects rather than dark subjects 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.699

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.889
