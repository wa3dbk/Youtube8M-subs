to now have pack size as part of this
technological<00:00:32.259> factory<00:00:32.920> when<00:00:33.370> it<00:00:33.490> came<00:00:33.610> to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
technological factory when it came to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.090 
technological factory when it came to
our<00:00:33.790> facility<00:00:34.390> with<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.170> size<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:35.470> scope<00:00:35.950> of

our facility with the size and scope of
the<00:00:36.160> machine<00:00:36.550> was<00:00:36.790> a<00:00:36.820> little<00:00:37.180> intimidating

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
the machine was a little intimidating

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.300 
the machine was a little intimidating
for<00:00:38.080> the<00:00:38.170> fact<00:00:38.380> that<00:00:38.500> we<00:00:38.650> did<00:00:38.830> not<00:00:38.860> know<00:00:39.160> what

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
for the fact that we did not know what

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.100 
for the fact that we did not know what
to<00:00:39.430> expect<00:00:39.850> but<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.450> actual<00:00:40.810> training

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
to expect but the actual training

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.350 
to expect but the actual training
procedures<00:00:41.740> and<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.370> follow-up<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.030> service

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
procedures and the follow-up and service

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.450 
procedures and the follow-up and service
has<00:00:43.510> been<00:00:43.690> really<00:00:44.080> amazing<00:00:44.380> with<00:00:44.980> pack<00:00:45.220> size

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
has been really amazing with pack size

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.920 
has been really amazing with pack size
and<00:00:45.700> we<00:00:45.820> were<00:00:45.940> actually<00:00:46.120> up<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.540> operational

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
and we were actually up and operational

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.260 
and we were actually up and operational
in<00:00:47.470> just<00:00:47.860> under<00:00:48.130> 30<00:00:48.370> hours<00:00:48.730> from<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.060> time<00:00:49.090> of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
in just under 30 hours from the time of

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.150 
in just under 30 hours from the time of
install<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.170> learning<00:00:50.560> curve<00:00:50.770> for<00:00:50.800> the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
install the learning curve for the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.880 
install the learning curve for the
machine<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.820> startup<00:00:52.300> was<00:00:53.080> very<00:00:53.380> simple

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
machine and the startup was very simple

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.250 
machine and the startup was very simple
it<00:00:54.160> was<00:00:54.250> basically<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:55.210> half<00:00:55.810> a<00:00:55.990> day<00:00:56.230> of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
it was basically a half a day of

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.970 
it was basically a half a day of
training<00:00:57.190> from<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.790> technician<00:00:58.540> and<00:00:58.780> then<00:00:59.470> I

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
training from the technician and then I

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.100 
training from the technician and then I
have<00:01:00.490> basically<00:01:01.060> trained<00:01:01.420> everybody<00:01:01.900> else

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
have basically trained everybody else

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.229 
have basically trained everybody else
involved<00:01:02.680> in<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.890> machine<00:01:03.250> pack<00:01:03.790> size<00:01:04.059> has

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
involved in the machine pack size has

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.790 
involved in the machine pack size has
been<00:01:04.360> able<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.689> allow<00:01:05.080> us<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.470> ability<00:01:05.620> to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
been able to allow us the ability to

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.520 
been able to allow us the ability to
shorten<00:01:06.370> our<00:01:06.909> actual<00:01:07.300> box<00:01:07.570> making<00:01:07.840> cycle<00:01:08.380> so

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
shorten our actual box making cycle so

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.290 
shorten our actual box making cycle so
that<00:01:08.560> we<00:01:08.800> can<00:01:08.950> actually<00:01:09.130> make<00:01:09.550> boxes<00:01:10.120> within

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
that we can actually make boxes within

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.990 
that we can actually make boxes within
30<00:01:10.720> minutes<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.140> an<00:01:11.560> actual<00:01:11.800> pack<00:01:12.070> out<00:01:12.310> taking

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
30 minutes of an actual pack out taking

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.090 
30 minutes of an actual pack out taking
place<00:01:13.270> unlike<00:01:14.110> before<00:01:14.320> where<00:01:14.800> we<00:01:14.920> would<00:01:15.070> have

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
place unlike before where we would have

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.730 
place unlike before where we would have
a<00:01:15.220> 24<00:01:15.790> 36<00:01:16.180> hour<00:01:16.360> lead<00:01:16.659> time<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.200> actually<00:01:17.500> up

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
a 24 36 hour lead time to actually up

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.340 
a 24 36 hour lead time to actually up
boxes<00:01:18.130> made<00:01:18.400> from<00:01:18.970> an<00:01:19.090> outside<00:01:19.390> supplier<00:01:19.780> pack
