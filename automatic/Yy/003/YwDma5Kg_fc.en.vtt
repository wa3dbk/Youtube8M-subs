00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.250
 The food industry is very inventive and sampled Rag Expo 1 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.449
 Schacht Tel containing all sorts of goodies 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.789
 but did not always have what's on the front of the packaging whet the appetite 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.249
 that's a comeback 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.249
 Goldschmidt looking for her 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.630
 Ben 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.720
 I can not talk anymore 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.989
 so lasted 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.149
 it hangs 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.149
 4 and in consequence of the Erfurter 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.500
 we are still under 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 Nevertheless, it is only when we think that it is sour and hard 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 There are more than 500 cranberry products 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.490
 mostly in front of the big thing in it 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.250
 but not done 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.330
 this cereal bar on the front does not stand for more red fruit 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.760
 to this picture 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.420
 with the ingredients only find the saying 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.860
 Rank finished 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610
 why is not that from Prof 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.969
 Manufacturer Not Riestern writes the Cranberries is 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.860
 clearly recognizable by the picture on the front 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.090
 not for everyone 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.200
 «I would say that now my front leads this little he is 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.210
 whose departure of the lawyer 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.330
 for a no closer one 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.800
 another example 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.229
 this must every company Cologne stands in front Schoko Kirchstr 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.659
 but in the list of ingredients, the first fruit is an obstacle 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.050
 while dried fruit comes first Vanessa here for the first time 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.240
 most included 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.710
 because the ingredients are in descending order of weight percentage 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 So what's the most important reason is that it's at the top of the list 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 first mentioned Ries 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.890
 Sour cherries come as a second team but ahead of it is from Brender 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.410
 nothing to see but bottles 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.780
 Manufacturers can write one got out 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.979
 Recipe strategically chosen for the cranberry 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.170
 Do not get him the rule from the manufacturer slaughterhouse Horatio 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.890
 shifted at short notice 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.439
 but in the works the rest belong again first 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.589
 Bishop has been appointed 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.589
 as the taste of the cherry dominates it is the cherry-giving name for 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.589
 this place 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.089
 wrong fruit 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.239
 why race could be measured as cherries with us 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.200
 Cranberry crop in the USA 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.269
 There they are mainly hit 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.579
 in the meantime, they are also a commodity popular with manufacturers 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.919
 European market 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.919
 Maria Kraus markets the Cranberry in Germany 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.229
 you are after 90 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.229
 has the American 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.649
 the Americans have eaten 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.740
 even today their service is cheap for German manufacturers 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.939
 one kilo of dried strawberries cherries and mangos cost 9 euros each 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:03.209
 Industries are 11 raspberries at 12 Glen Davis costs only 4 euros the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.859
 kilo 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.340
 but how come that is also explanatory in that is not this 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:09.189
 suggests 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.370
 a professional article is suspected of being an aroma treatment 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.540
 The cranberries are deprived of their own juice 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.599
 and the natural thing indicates other fruits 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.509
 The dried cranberries only serve as a visually pleasing aroma 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:26.549
 Trekker 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.739
 These must be proudly reported to a food chemist 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.870
 really do everything they had to taste already the tastes 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.819
 Gum Marshmallows Pepperoni Pepper and tomato brought in 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.609
 The Cranberry is a real quick-change artist 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.689
 you can change it now would be 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.439
 then a raspberry 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.909
 also other industries 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.039
 just as blue would be or 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.039
 and of course a cherry 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.310
 we test flavored cranberries from a supplier for the 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.519
 food industry 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.289
 What kind of fruit is that? 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.829
 orange 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.829
 I would and Culture 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.589

 Cranberries «with raspberry flavor 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.599
 the deception has succeeded 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.599
 the miraculous transformation of the case 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.199
 Consumer advocates had a clear position on this 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.059
 that is a very experienced product 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:37.370
 Anna something secretly enriched in the chemistry lab that is deception 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.550
 and fake and he should not find food 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:44.830
 but not just a malicious turned into expensive fruit 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.159
 we find this muesli from St 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.159
 On the picture are raspberries and strawberries 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.039
 on the list of ingredients, they read the following 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.960
 dried apple pieces flavored with raspberry juice 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.189
 Misty he writes us 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.719
 the product has a raspberry flavor 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.110
 On it we want with the picture of raspberries on the front of the

 Packaging indicates 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.849
 advertised while the actually much cheaper Hittfeld 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.810
 We rate this as misleading labels as consumers 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.560
 there you can go to Greenland wants list of ingredients in the supermarket of Heesen 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.300
 The line fruits disguised as expensive once again grab the manufacturer deep in 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.300
 the bag of tricks 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:36.209
 Anyone on Mondays to make sure everything comes up but a small consolation
