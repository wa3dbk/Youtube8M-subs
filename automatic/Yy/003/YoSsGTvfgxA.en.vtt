00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
are way too easy you can usually just

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.530 
are way too easy you can usually just
stand<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.400> front<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.730> them<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.060> mash<00:03:19.269> the

until later but even later they're still

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.530 
until later but even later they're still
pretty<00:03:25.810> easy<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:27.400> types<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:27.820> Pokemon<00:03:28.299> do

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
pretty easy the types of Pokemon do

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.690 
pretty easy the types of Pokemon do
matter<00:03:28.840> like<00:03:29.200> electric<00:03:29.739> versus<00:03:30.070> water<00:03:30.370> or

water<00:03:30.940> against<00:03:31.360> fire<00:03:31.570> etc<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:33.459> if<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.760> don't

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
water against fire etc but if you don't

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.789 
water against fire etc but if you don't
have<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> Pokemon<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.989> type<00:03:35.320> with<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.590> power

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
level high enough it doesn't really

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.449 
level high enough it doesn't really
matter<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.110> pretty<00:03:38.350> much<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.530> boils<00:03:39.070> down<00:03:39.130> to

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
matter it pretty much just boils down to

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.990 
matter it pretty much just boils down to
numbers<00:03:39.910> not<00:03:40.180> types<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:42.100> game<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.459> honestly<00:03:42.880> a

Pokemon toys instead of regular Pokemon
was<00:04:38.169> probably<00:04:38.650> just<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:39.070> lame<00:04:39.280> excuse<00:04:39.789> not<00:04:39.970> to

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
was probably just a lame excuse not to

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.279 
was probably just a lame excuse not to
try<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:42.100> on<00:04:42.280> one<00:04:42.580> hand<00:04:42.880> it's<00:04:43.120> Pokemon<00:04:43.720> so

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
try so on one hand it's Pokemon so

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.590 
try so on one hand it's Pokemon so
that's<00:04:44.470> good<00:04:44.770> but<00:04:45.550> on<00:04:45.699> the<00:04:45.880> other<00:04:46.030> hand<00:04:46.419> it

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
that's good but on the other hand it

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.650 
that's good but on the other hand it
gets<00:04:46.750> really<00:04:47.139> boring<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:48.130> that's<00:04:48.340> bad<00:04:48.580> but<00:04:49.539> you

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660
