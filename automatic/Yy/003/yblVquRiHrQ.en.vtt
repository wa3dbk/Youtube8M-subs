00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:18.080
 the three fundamental steps and so that 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.010
 we look for something good are the texture 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.350
 the cove and the conformation of products 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.040
 the texture is that by means of the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.110
 touch of the fingers look for the degree of 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.870
 Ham maturity of three key points 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.670
 that would be just inside the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.180
 ham training and looking for that lean 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.900
 the mass 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.900
 and had 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.340
 we have three critical points that would be 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.090
 the roller 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.490
 the oatmeal and then the chain by means of the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.820
 local football that is made of a bone 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.750
 of the cane of the cow and that for about 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.540
 seconds stays in the smell 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.880
 when entering the cove huesca or we read 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.060
 we see this has smell of soap suitable for 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060
 the consumption 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.040
 what we are looking for is a stylized ham 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.990
 we look for although it has a wide mass and 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.420
 well covered with grease a shore 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.210
 covered in fat and that does not have 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.659
 hotheads because we do not find 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.500
 bruises and bumps produced by 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:39.149
 racks and left to the consumer 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.149
 a good present a good view
