see that shadow that you can hardly cast
underneath<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.580> well<00:01:11.580> that's<00:01:11.880> where<00:01:12.060> he

when I came to this body of water and I

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.410 
when I came to this body of water and I
could<00:01:29.740> tell<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:29.920> lot<00:01:30.190> from<00:01:30.460> fishing<00:01:31.180> all<00:01:31.270> over

lakes that do that sometimes require an

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.760 
lakes that do that sometimes require an
entirely<00:01:55.060> different<00:01:55.420> strategy<00:01:55.840> so<00:01:56.440> when<00:01:56.680> I'm

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
entirely different strategy so when I'm

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
coming to a place like this and I'm

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.180 
coming to a place like this and I'm
breaking<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.240> down<00:01:58.470> I'm<00:01:59.470> finding<00:01:59.950> the

breaking it down I'm finding the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.389 
breaking it down I'm finding the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
of those little things they sound like

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.320 
of those little things they sound like
subtle<00:02:21.310> differences<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:21.850> they<00:02:21.970> make<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> big

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
subtle differences but they make a big

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.790 
subtle differences but they make a big
difference<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:22.900> if<00:02:22.989> they<00:02:23.110> hold<00:02:23.260> fish<00:02:23.500> are<00:02:23.650> not

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
difference and if they hold fish are not

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.410 
difference and if they hold fish are not
and<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.370> know<00:02:24.459> something<00:02:24.489> as<00:02:24.910> simple<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.269> just

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
and you know something as simple as just

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.479 
and you know something as simple as just
testing<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.870> whole<00:02:26.019> bunch<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.319> them<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.650> seeing

testing a whole bunch of them and seeing

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.710 
testing a whole bunch of them and seeing
which<00:02:27.640> docs<00:02:27.940> they're<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.450> what<00:02:28.540> type<00:02:28.690> of

cover their on and even the water

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.819 
cover their on and even the water
clarity<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:31.959> some<00:02:32.170> different<00:02:32.290> parts<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.769> the

clarity in some different parts of the

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.170 
clarity in some different parts of the
lake<00:02:33.040> make<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> big<00:02:33.519> difference<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:33.910> how<00:02:33.970> they

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
lake make a big difference on how they

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180 
lake make a big difference on how they
relate<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.660> cover<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.410> break<00:02:35.890> all<00:02:36.040> that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
relate to that cover so I break all that

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.800 
relate to that cover so I break all that
stuff<00:02:36.430> down<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.640> my<00:02:36.850> head<00:02:37.030> sometimes<00:02:37.269> before<00:02:37.630> I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
stuff down to my head sometimes before I

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.199 
stuff down to my head sometimes before I
even<00:02:37.959> make<00:02:38.200> my<00:02:38.350> first<00:02:38.530> cast<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.250> when<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.030> get

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
even make my first cast and when I get

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.340 
even make my first cast and when I get
out<00:02:40.360> here<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.630> I'm<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:40.810> going<00:02:41.049> through<00:02:41.290> the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
out here and I'm just going through the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.229 
out here and I'm just going through the
motions<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.829> fishing<00:02:42.070> these<00:02:42.160> docks<00:02:42.489> that's

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
motions of fishing these docks that's

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.220 
motions of fishing these docks that's
just<00:02:43.390> putting<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> pieces<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.200> puzzle

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
just putting the pieces of the puzzle

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.830 
just putting the pieces of the puzzle
together<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:46.000> know<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> dock<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.600> this

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
together and you know a dock like this

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900 
together and you know a dock like this
sounds<00:02:47.799> crazy<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:48.280> sometimes<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
sounds crazy but sometimes the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.640 
sounds crazy but sometimes the
difference<00:02:49.239> between<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> simple<00:02:50.320> of<00:02:50.470> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
difference between just the simple of a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.770 
difference between just the simple of a
painted<00:02:51.160> versus<00:02:51.519> non<00:02:51.670> painted<00:02:52.090> doc<00:02:52.269> makes<00:02:52.660> a

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
painted versus non painted doc makes a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.569 
painted versus non painted doc makes a
difference<00:02:53.140> some<00:02:53.320> wake<00:02:53.860> up<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.310> heat<00:02:54.549> a

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
difference some wake up that heat a

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.190 
difference some wake up that heat a
little<00:02:54.820> bit<00:02:54.940> more<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.269> magnify<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.840> heat<00:02:56.079> if

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
little bit more and magnify the heat if

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.050 
little bit more and magnify the heat if
you<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.410> one<00:02:56.590> that's<00:02:56.620> black<00:02:57.070> or<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.549> dark<00:02:57.880> old

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
you have one that's black or a dark old

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.560 
you have one that's black or a dark old
wood<00:02:59.250> may<00:03:00.250> tend<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.549> hold<00:03:00.670> fish<00:03:00.910> more<00:03:01.120> making<00:03:01.540> a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
wood may tend to hold fish more making a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.030 
wood may tend to hold fish more making a
whole<00:03:01.840> fish<00:03:02.049> less<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.500> look<00:03:02.739> at<00:03:02.829> all<00:03:02.950> those

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
whole fish less so I look at all those

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.289 
whole fish less so I look at all those
little<00:03:03.190> subtle<00:03:03.489> differences<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.120> try<00:03:04.269> to

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
little subtle differences and I try to

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.910 
little subtle differences and I try to
put<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.570> pieces<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.870> puzzle<00:03:05.109> together<00:03:05.380> and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
put the pieces of puzzle together and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.430 
put the pieces of puzzle together and
many<00:03:06.430> times<00:03:06.810> that's<00:03:07.810> all<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.109> takes<00:03:08.260> is

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
many times that's all it takes is

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.810 
many times that's all it takes is
finding<00:03:08.799> one<00:03:08.950> little<00:03:09.220> difference<00:03:09.609> and<00:03:09.790> you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
finding one little difference and you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.789 
finding one little difference and you
get<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.390> big<00:03:10.570> one<00:03:10.690> or<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> couple<00:03:11.079> extra<00:03:11.320> fish

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
get a big one or a couple extra fish

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.020 
get a big one or a couple extra fish
throughout<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> course<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.670> does

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
throughout the course it does

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.309 
throughout the course it does
time<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.900> move<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.170> got<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:16.510> shadowed<00:03:17.510> side

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
time to move I got to the shadowed side

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.160 
time to move I got to the shadowed side
of<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.620> coal<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.910> kind<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.930> many

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
of this coal and it's kind of in many

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.420 
of this coal and it's kind of in many
ways<00:03:21.319> defeating<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.800> purpose<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.220> dock

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
ways defeating the purpose of dock

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.070 
ways defeating the purpose of dock
fishing<00:03:22.610> you're<00:03:22.910> fishing<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.270> docks<00:03:23.690> cuz<00:03:23.959> the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
fishing you're fishing the docks cuz the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.770 
fishing you're fishing the docks cuz the
fish<00:03:24.410> are<00:03:24.530> seeking<00:03:24.800> cover<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.720> there's<00:03:26.720> no

fish are seeking cover and there's no
