00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
 She lay on top of me and her mother passed me the journey and made her journey 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 And I discovered it during the Second Lebanon War when it was .. They were in the Carmel Center in Haifa, 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.330
 With the two grandparents and then we discovered through the journey that everyone there was terribly frightened 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.290
 And she was just terrified of everyone's fear. She did not know what was going on outside. 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.100
 She was a baby .. But she felt so strongly the fear of everyone, 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.550
 That something about her is very deep 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.600
 And we opened it and we did it with a process of exhortation and forgiveness. And then when we came to them to visit Vickand 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.420
 She said to me - Grandpa, let me make you a journey. I said okay and then she took me down the stairs and made a journey for me 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.180
 Then she brought her father and also made a journey for him. She was then three years old and a bit .. 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.360
 And then I told her-now I'll make a trip for you. And she said-well, all right 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.870
 And I made her a 5 minute journey .. I took her down the stairs .. I met her with the instructor 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.820
 Then she met a place where she was left alone and everyone went and she started to cry and was very sorry 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.420
 And then we did some sort of process again where she realized she was never really alone 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.560
 And forgave them all and forgave herself 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.410
 And after a week my daughter calls me hysterical and says - 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.990
 The skin was gone. The skin was gone, the wounds disappeared. The wounds just disappeared 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.400
 There were a few scars left where the wounds were 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.610
 And besides, she started talking as if they had taken a plug from her throat and she kept talking 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:52.030
 And ... I'm pretty skeptical in my life .. I was very hard to believe .. I had to fly immediately to my daughter's house, 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.980
 Look and see .. And everything just disappeared .. No dermatologist did not know what to do with it 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.930
 They were just in panic .. It was spreading .. She went through some dermatologists 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.550
 They did not know what to do with it ... and it just disappeared 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.790
 So this is the story with my daughter. 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.230
 I want to tell you another little story about my sweet mother who is 82 years old 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.890
 She is the queen of skepticism. Once I tried to make a journey with her 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:28.460
 My mother was widowed a few years ago and after that she had breast cancer and all kinds of mess 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:38.400
 Some time ago I had lunch with her and I said to her - Mom, after lunch we'll make a journey together 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.440
 She says - Yes, but I can not 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.970
 I said to her: Okay, it does not have to succeed, we'll do something together, go, go, we will not go 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:56.770
 And I made a journey to cure phobias. My mother hid for three and a half years in a hayloft in the Netherlands 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:06.600
 During World War II, we received claustrophobia, which we will not know from trouble 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.290
 And I did a job with her like they do with a child .. I told her - 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:18.070
 Listen, I can not believe it, you do not believe it, we'll just go and see where it goes. Look what happens 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.040
 What came out of this is that for the first time in almost 82 years she has been forgiving of her sister 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.540
 Who had very, very difficult relationships ... She hid with her sister in the hayloft ... her older sister 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:43.400
 Came down to her life ... and it went on after that throughout her life .. and she made such a deep process of forgiveness with her 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.170
 And from nothing ... as if from nothing. She lay quietly and did the process 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.820
 And after two days she turned and kept calling me-I do not know what happened here 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:00.590
 I do not know what happened here, but I cleaned it up with my sister. This is the journey. This is the journey 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:12.610
 I'll tell you another story. You will go to Google and check out what is spondylosis oncollosis 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.080
 This is a disease that affects mostly young people .. young men 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.850
 That the vertebrae are sticking to the lower back or upper back 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.800
 And when the vertebrae are infected then first of all it is very strong pain but it is also almost impossible to move 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.660
 And a 32-year-old guy who was 21, in the regular army, came to me and accepted it 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:42.290
 ... like a broom he came, with pain all the time and I did a total of 4 treatments .. 4 or 5 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.850
 Again, these are the places that leave me gaping ... I did a one-week journey with him - 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.970
 About the reasons why he got the spondylosis oncillosis - 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.260
 The emotional, mental, mental and processes of forgiveness with it 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.860
 And one week acupuncture .. Week Journey, Week Acupuncture .. The fifth time he came to my clinic and said to me - 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:15.810
 Look and do not faint, and bend down and touch your fingers on the floor .. So .. this is the journey .. and more 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.950
 I can talk until the end of the day because I'm in love and when I'm in love my heart opens up 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.880
 And when my heart opens, anyone who knows some Chinese medicine knows that when the heart opens, the tongue rolls 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.320
 And the words begin to come out .. So I'm in love and this is the journey and I am Nadav and I am in love, and thank you very much
