project bike on me website so you can
have<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> look<00:02:33.190> at<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.549> but<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:34.299> might<00:02:34.690> change

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
have a look at that but I I might change

like to use on most of my bikes because

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.699 
like to use on most of my bikes because
they're<00:04:08.420> really<00:04:08.630> important<00:04:09.170> for<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.440> pressure

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
they're really important for a pressure

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.789 
they're really important for a pressure
gauge<00:04:10.959> here's<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.019> other<00:04:12.170> gas<00:04:12.410> tank<00:04:12.680> I'm

gauge here's the other gas tank I'm
working<00:04:13.160> on<00:04:13.220> now<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.500> that's<00:04:15.680> getting<00:04:15.950> there

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
working on now so that's getting there

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.259 
working on now so that's getting there
so<00:04:18.979> I<00:04:19.010> put<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.370> out<00:04:19.400> I'd<00:04:19.640> show<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.120> little

this is where I drill my Rose I can't
what<00:04:26.530> about<00:04:26.710> your<00:04:26.860> rotors<00:04:27.220> well<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.430> didn't

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
what about your rotors well I didn't

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.600 
what about your rotors well I didn't
drill<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:27.970> mere<00:04:28.240> army<00:04:28.449> drill<00:04:28.660> press<00:04:29.400> they<00:04:30.400> kind

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
drill a mere army drill press they kind

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.990 
drill a mere army drill press they kind
of<00:04:30.669> start<00:04:30.880> off<00:04:31.090> like<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.669> drill<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
of start off like that and I drill the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240 
of start off like that and I drill the
Bulls<00:04:34.210> out<00:04:34.479> of<00:04:34.600> them<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.740> they<00:04:35.860> end<00:04:36.009> up<00:04:36.100> like

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
Bulls out of them and they end up like

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.870 
Bulls out of them and they end up like
that<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.759> then<00:04:37.449> what<00:04:37.539> I<00:04:37.570> got<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.870> do<00:04:37.990> then<00:04:38.169> is
