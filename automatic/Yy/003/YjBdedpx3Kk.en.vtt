00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.299
 previous because we also have new media 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.700

 information for those finds 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.240
 important for customers is important elements 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.070
 are on the website for example that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.550
 talking on the old website 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.559
 the journey times are difficult 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
 to find groups and so on on the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 current websites very clearly arranged 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 With a few states you can find 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.920
 The thing I could find that the new 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.600
 website of fall in the rhine maas 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.940

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.050
 find current information quickly 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 for me, first of all, the most important 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590
 change on the website in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.539
 compared to the previous one 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.229
 Internet appearance is the fast and 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.830
 uncomplicated contact for 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.049
 commercial questions with the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.369
 sales staff and for general 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.369
 ask with customer care or 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 computer science 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.270
 So interesting is this website 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.100
 that they are very clearly arranged 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 is that one of the most important things 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 can find immediately and still for 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.159
 eye on what is offered with many 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.930
 interesting beautiful pictures hoogland 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 is dual enough the ob-amt new website 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.310
 or with the compact school, find one 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.740
 social documents can be found 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.540
 So today's time where everyone with 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.649
 smartphones tablets is on the go 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 Of course this is a very important thing 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.000
 that the website is now in the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.590
 Design life into the device adapts that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.170
 called 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.329
 the layout at 10 different than at 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.340
 smartphone or even chain if I have the 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.560
 Viewing the structure of the new website 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.840
 I think they are much more logical in advance 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.629
 by letting me go from left to right 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:33.079

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:34.519
 the website is an important and 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.410
 interesting point on the website is 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.410
 also the link eg with twitter 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.780
 facebook the social media around there as well 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.299

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.299
