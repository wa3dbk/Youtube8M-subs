00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
to do a video showing my texture and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.750 
to do a video showing my texture and
right<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.359> have<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.379> deep<00:00:08.160> conditioner<00:00:08.400> on

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
right now I have a deep conditioner on

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.900 
right now I have a deep conditioner on
my<00:00:09.120> hair<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.900> that's<00:00:10.349> why<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:11.040> see<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> white

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
my hair so that's why you see the white

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.860 
my hair so that's why you see the white
residue<00:00:12.480> that's<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:14.480> so<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> just<00:00:15.690> want

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
residue that's on it and so I just want

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.710 
residue that's on it and so I just want
to<00:00:15.960> show<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.250> what<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.490> hair<00:00:18.060> looks<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:18.480> at

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
to show you what my hair looks like at

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500 
to show you what my hair looks like at
two<00:00:19.050> years<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.650> five<00:00:20.039> months<00:00:20.550> post<00:00:20.970> relaxer

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
two years and five months post relaxer

00:00:21.510 --> 00:01:06.060 
two years and five months post relaxer
so<00:00:22.109> ah<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:26.180> middle<00:00:27.180> texture

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.460 

insane

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:36.650 

Oh

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.520 

okay<00:01:37.660> and<00:01:37.900> just<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:39.729> guess<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.810> compare<00:01:41.290> the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
okay and just I guess to compare the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.160 
okay and just I guess to compare the
shrinkage<00:01:42.040> with<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.780> length<00:01:43.780> when<00:01:44.050> it

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
shrinkage with the length when it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.160 
shrinkage with the length when it
stretched<00:01:44.470> out<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.340> this<00:01:45.550> is<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.729> front<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
stretched out so this is the front and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.499 
stretched out so this is the front and
I'm<00:01:50.530> going<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.740> stop<00:01:50.979> my<00:01:51.160> finger<00:01:51.580> where<00:01:51.910> my

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
I'm going to stop my finger where my

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:00.469 
I'm going to stop my finger where my
relax<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.200> start<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:59.170> side

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
relax and start so this is it the side

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:12.230 
relax and start so this is it the side
there's<00:02:01.479> no<00:02:01.600> relaxed<00:02:02.110> ends<00:02:02.530> on<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.740> side<00:02:03.160> so

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:31.540 

and<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.610> back<00:02:15.950> closer<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.370> side

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.240 

that's<00:02:32.550> where<00:02:32.760> my<00:02:32.880> armpit<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:35.190> is

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
that's where my armpit is and this is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.680 
that's where my armpit is and this is
the<00:02:35.670> back<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.569> see<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.020> right<00:02:40.230> here

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
the back so you can see it's right here

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.530 
the back so you can see it's right here
and<00:02:42.690> then<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.080> stretch<00:02:43.380> it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:59.849 

might<00:02:50.230> have<00:02:50.379> to<00:02:50.439> stand<00:02:50.829> up<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.099> little<00:02:51.370> bit<00:02:58.859> and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
might have to stand up a little bit and

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.750 
might have to stand up a little bit and
that's<00:03:00.069> where<00:03:00.310> my<00:03:00.549> armpit<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:02.680> right<00:03:02.859> so<00:03:03.370> I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
that's where my armpit is all right so I

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.210 
that's where my armpit is all right so I
am<00:03:04.150> going<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.420> come<00:03:04.569> back<00:03:04.599> when<00:03:05.590> I've<00:03:05.980> washed

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220
