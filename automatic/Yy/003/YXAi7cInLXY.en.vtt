00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.970
 look at the page 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.270

 contrast on the screen very much 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:55.180
 more intense is as black as 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.920
 painless was not that but 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.610
 at the beginning so far out there was a 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.260
 few problems 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.620

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.210
 intense day later behind it lies 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.680
 means to imagine from the cabinet 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.680

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.080
 natively for the straight things in the big one 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:32.830
 fingers the four are in the word 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:34.390
 tapping it works like that and what 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.979

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.420
