00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
power training what I like about this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.500 
power training what I like about this
one<00:00:46.430> is<00:00:47.350> it's<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.410> little<00:00:48.649> bit<00:00:48.739> smaller<00:00:49.070> I<00:00:49.910> can

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
one is it's a little bit smaller I can

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.630 
one is it's a little bit smaller I can
work<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:50.840> it<00:00:50.989> not<00:00:51.440> only<00:00:51.710> with<00:00:51.890> my<00:00:52.040> athletes<00:00:52.460> but

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
work on it not only with my athletes but

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.750 
work on it not only with my athletes but
with<00:00:52.790> my<00:00:52.940> ladies<00:00:53.329> who<00:00:54.290> are<00:00:54.649> as<00:00:55.040> well<00:00:55.309> athletes

with my ladies who are as well athletes

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.950 
with my ladies who are as well athletes
but<00:00:55.970> they're<00:00:56.149> not<00:00:56.270> really<00:00:56.540> into<00:00:56.870> the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
but they're not really into the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.180 
but they're not really into the
competition<00:00:57.500> they're<00:00:57.710> just<00:00:57.920> something

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
competition they're just something

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.430 
competition they're just something
fitness<00:00:58.550> part<00:00:58.790> of<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.030> so<00:00:59.989> this<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.290> very

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
fitness part of it so this is very

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.040 
fitness part of it so this is very
versatile<00:01:00.890> before<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.450> can<00:01:02.660> work<00:01:02.840> on

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
versatile before that and I can work on

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.079 
versatile before that and I can work on
lower<00:01:03.379> body<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.070> I'll<00:01:04.280> provide<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.610> core

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
lower body and I'll provide a core

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.510 
lower body and I'll provide a core
strength<00:01:05.689> a<00:01:06.200> little<00:01:06.619> bit<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.829> movement<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
strength a little bit of movement to the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.699 
strength a little bit of movement to the
bag<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.479> can<00:01:08.659> also<00:01:08.810> incorporate<00:01:09.229> my

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:09.709

athletes<00:01:10.219> into<00:01:10.729> this<00:01:10.909> my<00:01:11.569> younger<00:01:11.929> athletes

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
athletes into this my younger athletes

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.169 
athletes into this my younger athletes
because<00:01:12.709> it's<00:01:12.889> a<00:01:12.950> little<00:01:13.130> bit<00:01:13.249> smaller<00:01:13.549> a

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
because it's a little bit smaller a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.849 
because it's a little bit smaller a
little<00:01:14.600> bit<00:01:14.689> layer<00:01:14.869> for<00:01:15.170> them<00:01:15.289> to<00:01:15.469> work<00:01:15.649> on

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
little bit layer for them to work on

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:21.489 
little bit layer for them to work on
this<00:01:16.579> one<00:01:16.819> here<00:01:17.209> I<00:01:18.069> think<00:01:19.069> for<00:01:19.639> me<00:01:19.789> as<00:01:20.499> gym

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
this one here I think for me as gym

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.519

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.830 
up so this one is really really good for
that<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.829> wouldn't<00:01:49.189> really<00:01:49.329> use<00:01:50.329> this<00:01:50.479> with<00:01:50.689> my

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
that I wouldn't really use this with my

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.480 
that I wouldn't really use this with my
younger<00:01:51.409> athletes<00:01:51.740> unless<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.130> brought<00:01:52.369> it

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
younger athletes unless I brought it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.789 
younger athletes unless I brought it
down<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.689> can<00:01:53.929> do<00:01:54.109> that<00:01:54.259> we<00:01:54.409> can<00:01:54.560> bring<00:01:54.740> it

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
down and we can do that we can bring it

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.499 
down and we can do that we can bring it
down<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:55.130> their<00:01:55.279> level<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.179> they<00:01:56.329> can

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
down to their level and then they can

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.179 
down to their level and then they can
work<00:01:56.689> their<00:01:56.869> kicks<00:01:57.169> it<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:57.770> small<00:01:58.009> enough

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
work their kicks it is small enough

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.010 
work their kicks it is small enough
where<00:01:58.459> they're<00:01:58.639> not<00:01:58.819> going<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:58.999> get<00:01:59.119> hurt<00:01:59.359> -<00:01:59.539> so

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
where they're not going to get hurt - so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.569 
where they're not going to get hurt - so
all<00:02:00.259> three<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.679> these<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.979> think<00:02:01.009> are<00:02:01.279> really

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
all three of these I think are really

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.209 
all three of these I think are really
really<00:02:01.939> versatile<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.799> best<00:02:03.979> I've<00:02:04.189> seen

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
really versatile it's the best I've seen

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.849 
really versatile it's the best I've seen
so<00:02:05.060> far<00:02:05.090> out<00:02:05.630> there<00:02:05.929> as<00:02:06.079> far<00:02:06.289> as<00:02:06.349> what<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:06.829> can

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
so far out there as far as what you can

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.440 
so far out there as far as what you can
do<00:02:07.099> with<00:02:07.249> it<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.549> all<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.939> different<00:02:07.969> works

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
do with it and all the different works

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.330 
do with it and all the different works
that<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.929> do<00:02:09.020> with<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:10.069> really

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
that you can do with it so I really

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.059 
that you can do with it so I really
really<00:02:10.729> do

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
