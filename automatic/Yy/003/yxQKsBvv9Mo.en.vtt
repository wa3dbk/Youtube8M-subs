00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 why here I am delighted to you 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.569
 find today for a small 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.690
 I feel that my camera zooms 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.670
 need I'm delighted to find you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.450
 today for a little video that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.289
 will be a video either May 2 last small 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.460
 bourgeois lipstick so this is the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.600
 first time I bought red 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 bourgeois lip end I may have 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.420
 when I was younger I was 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.849
 believe the first makeup brand 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.330
 that I started to see when 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
 I was 13 14 years old I had small 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.140
 you know the little eyeshadow 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 mono the bubble is so brief and a few 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.090
 golos I still remember it as 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.250
 saint-etienne and so I decided 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.829
 to buy some lipsticks from the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 collection a red editions 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.199
 so I thought they were really pretty 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.660
 have never really heard 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.070
 Besides, I 'm not really interested 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.739
 to big-box brands 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 why not what is the meeting already 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.140
 we only have two choices in the big 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.270
 surfaces and large products 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.379
 surfaces remain expensive so quit to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.560
 buy products I prefer to buy 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.409
 other products more products 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.530
 than at the end at the price level 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.149
 it's not very very interesting and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.520
 reading what was written on the 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.689
 packaging that tempted me I told myself 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.789
 that it could be nice so I have 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.590
 taken 5 at the meeting it seems to me that 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:28.109
 costs a little less than 15 euros it has to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.329
 football and in the 14 euros saint fort 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.299
 between 14 and 15 euros I would say 14 euros 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.649
 70 under something like that and so 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.130
 This is the first I've taken so 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.729
 this is the Belgian trench so those 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.140
 hits number two and it's a pretty 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.250
 beige nude game and apply it so here 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.659
 they are very creamy 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.439
 it looks very good they have a matte finish 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.209
 satin I would say a little glossy it is 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.890
 really super nice to wear so there 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.569
 necessarily embodies you did reflex to his 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.069
 contour of the lips but I will not 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.020
 have fun doing systematically 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.369
 lip contour was five colors 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.049
 otherwise we will not get by 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.170
 so that's it for the new deal is 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.959
 really he is very very pretty very 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.420
 comfortable to wear at the level of the outfit 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.370
 will tell you a little bit about here 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.680
 weeks since I had them there there are 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.489
 a few days and that's at the level of the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.380
 color I like a lot 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.959
 I would have taken almost every 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.989
 colors but I was limited to 5 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.139
 so here's for the nude then I 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:41.430
 took the hue number 3 which is 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:43.849
 the attainment cozy fishing which is the very 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.849
 pretty fishing 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.170
 same observation it would require an outline of 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.209
 lips but hey I'm not going 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.520
 to bother me with this is a very pretty 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.140
 fishing always a very good smell very 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.290
 that's nice as I zoom in iran 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.209
 do not know if you'll see well but it's 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.860
 very very very cute I'll eat 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.849
 chocolate to taste so I'm going 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.500
 maybe some chocolate on them 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.640
 teeth but that's it for number 3 it is 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.620
 very talkative when you're a little tanned 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:27.630
 the pech it comes out well then we 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:34.349
 will pass number 11 which is a coral and 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:35.970
 it's the braking remix number I 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.049
 find it super nice packagings 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.610
 like that what's up when you 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.560
 put in your display upside down 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.340
 you see the number and the hue is 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.870
 very handy so the veil to read at 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.780
 comes out a little pink but it is really 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.579
 shorter at orange and that that really 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.060
 pink as you see it back 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.060
 camera 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.469
 not put it too 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.469
 lack that both men because he 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:01.840
 is very angry check that I have not 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.010
 put everywhere whose purpose is not 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.400
 to have perfect lips but of you 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.319
 show the color 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.379
 so he's really very pigmented by 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.599
 compared to the other two and very flashy 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.579
 it's nice for the summer I think 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.560
 spring-summer it's a color that you 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.669
 will definitely enjoy wearing me 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.530
 it's not a color that I wear 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.539
 a lot but there like that around 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.509
 camera I have the impression that he is 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.770
 nice enough after you have to see the outfit 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.070
 how does it feel 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.259
 I'll tell you a bit more later 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.660
 so we go to number 7 which is there in 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:43.180
 pink fuchsia called fuchsia 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.729
 graffiti if all the lipsticks 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.300
 could be done so that's 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.909
 a refusal fia that pulls to the purple 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.139
 you will excuse me for laying red to 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.430
 lips but it's not the purpose of good 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.470
 ask is really to show you 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.759
 the colour 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.289
 so that's the type of pink colors 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.270
 who pulls to the purple that does everything from 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.620
 following up the green eyes is a 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.270
 color that I really like to wear when 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.879
 I make arduous make-up that nude with 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.740
 white glitter for example and 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:15.250
 I find it and pigmented today 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.080
 so that's for this number 7 and I'm going 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.449
 finish very quickly because I 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.770
 no longer have a battery with the number 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.719
 with the number 13 so obviously 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:32.729
 I could not not test in red 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:35.039
 this is the red jet set which is a 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.629
 gorgeous red 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.460
 we will test it right away and see what 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:44.190
 that it gives sir put red to 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.190
 lips everywhere it's okay 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.180

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.699
