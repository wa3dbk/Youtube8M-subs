because it wants something that looks
natural<00:04:04.180> okay<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:05.240> I<00:04:05.390> am<00:04:05.630> using<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.050> brush<00:04:06.200> for

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
natural okay so I am using a brush for

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.020 
natural okay so I am using a brush for
this<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.010> that's<00:04:07.130> just<00:04:07.340> for<00:04:07.520> aesthetic<00:04:07.910> my

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
this but that's just for aesthetic my

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.400 
this but that's just for aesthetic my
makeup<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.570> just<00:04:08.870> making<00:04:09.110> sure<00:04:09.260> it's

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
makeup and just making sure it's

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.860 
makeup and just making sure it's
long-lasting<00:04:10.070> I<00:04:10.280> would<00:04:11.090> have<00:04:11.210> used<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.540> party

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760

puff but I just think brushes give it
more<00:04:13.940> even<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.690> natural<00:04:14.960> finish<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:17.030> we're
