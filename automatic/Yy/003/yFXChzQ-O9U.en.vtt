00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
some more piston extenders this time

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.770 
some more piston extenders this time
Quinn<00:00:51.719> tuple<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:52.920> double<00:00:53.390> second<00:00:54.390> ah<00:00:56.780> there

quick I don't know what's the other

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.950 
quick I don't know what's the other
direction<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:11.250> course<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:18.240> best<00:01:18.509> part<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
direction of course and the best part is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.460 
direction of course and the best part is
the<00:01:19.259> size<00:01:19.850> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.119> probably<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.960> small<00:01:22.320> as

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the size this is probably as small as

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
the size this is probably as small as
you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.799> make<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.790> could<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.090> wrong

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you can make it but I could be wrong

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.859 
you can make it but I could be wrong
right<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:27.080> 4:45<00:01:28.220> wide<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.520> 9<00:01:29.850> tall<00:01:30.180> for

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
right now it's 4:45 wide and 9 tall for

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.410 
right now it's 4:45 wide and 9 tall for
a<00:01:30.900> total<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:32.240> 180<00:01:33.240> blocks<00:01:35.000> which<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> really

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
a total of 180 blocks which is really

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.679 
a total of 180 blocks which is really
small<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:38.030> I<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> show<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> how<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
small and I will now to show you how to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.289 
small and I will now to show you how to
build<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:42.680> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
build it so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.069 
build it so
obviously<00:01:46.299> start<00:01:46.540> off<00:01:46.600> with<00:01:46.750> your<00:01:46.899> five

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
obviously start off with your five

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.749 
obviously start off with your five
Pistons<00:01:47.560> here<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.020> we'll<00:01:50.619> get<00:01:50.829> some<00:01:51.100> gold

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
Pistons here and we'll get some gold

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.370 
Pistons here and we'll get some gold
here<00:01:51.939> for<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.720> input<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:56.049> gonna<00:01:56.170> be<00:01:56.290> your

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
here for the input that's gonna be your

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.940 
here for the input that's gonna be your
input<00:01:56.649> with<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.130> lever<00:01:57.549> I<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:02.380> know<00:02:02.649> keep

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
input with a lever I don't know keep

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.240 
input with a lever I don't know keep
that<00:02:03.070> on<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.479> again<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.080> torch<00:02:05.439> tower<00:02:05.679> so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
that on so again a torch tower so

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.770 
that on so again a torch tower so
actually<00:02:06.520> what<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.759> do<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.210> just<00:02:07.360> from

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
actually what you can do is just from

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.919 
actually what you can do is just from
this<00:02:07.899> input<00:02:08.110> count<00:02:08.619> eight<00:02:08.860> blocks<00:02:09.190> up<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:10.690> two

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
this input count eight blocks up one two

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.500 
this input count eight blocks up one two
three<00:02:11.290> four<00:02:11.790> five<00:02:12.790> six<00:02:13.410> seven<00:02:14.410> eight<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.510> then

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
three four five six seven eight and then

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.199 
three four five six seven eight and then
on<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.200> second<00:02:17.590> side<00:02:17.769> just<00:02:18.069> build<00:02:18.340> up<00:02:18.519> till

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
on the second side just build up till

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.620 
on the second side just build up till
one<00:02:19.360> below<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.959> then<00:02:20.290> start<00:02:20.680> knocking<00:02:21.069> out

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
one below and then start knocking out

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.289 
one below and then start knocking out
the<00:02:22.630> ones<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> diagonal<00:02:24.060> until<00:02:25.060> you're<00:02:25.180> done

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
the ones on a diagonal until you're done

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.120 
the ones on a diagonal until you're done
to<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.480> bottom<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.230> as<00:02:26.350> you'll<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.620> that'll

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
to the bottom and as you'll see that'll

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.490 
to the bottom and as you'll see that'll
create<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.700> pattern<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.840> required<00:02:29.230> so

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
create the pattern that is required so

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.460 
create the pattern that is required so
next<00:02:29.620> let's<00:02:30.100> torch<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.519> here<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.470> basically

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
next let's torch in here and basically

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.280 
next let's torch in here and basically
torch<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.860> all<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.160> way<00:02:33.250> up<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:37.450> here<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:37.959> then

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
torch it all the way up to here and then

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.580 
torch it all the way up to here and then
put<00:02:38.650> torch<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.430> block<00:02:39.959> redstone<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.200> a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
put torch on this block redstone and a

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.770 
put torch on this block redstone and a
repeater<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:41.980> two<00:02:42.220> ticks<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.930> like<00:02:44.080> that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
repeater on two ticks just like that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.199 
repeater on two ticks just like that
then<00:02:46.780> they'll<00:02:46.959> find<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.470> block<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:51.180> put<00:02:52.180> a

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
then they'll find this block here put a

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.280 
then they'll find this block here put a
torch<00:02:52.480> block<00:02:53.140> another<00:02:53.769> torch<00:02:55.260> then<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
torch block another torch then a

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.580 
torch block another torch then a
repeater<00:02:56.769> on<00:02:56.829> three<00:02:57.780> some<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.019> may<00:02:59.230> have

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
repeater on three some of you may have

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.500 
repeater on three some of you may have
already<00:03:00.280> noticed<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.880> this<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.180> quite

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
already noticed that this is quite

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.569 
already noticed that this is quite
similar<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.410> beginning<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.859> my<00:03:03.100> quad

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
similar to the beginning of my quad

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.390 
similar to the beginning of my quad
extender<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.470> that's<00:03:05.650> because<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:05.980> start<00:03:06.280> use

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
extender and that's because I start use

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.099 
extender and that's because I start use
the<00:03:06.549> same<00:03:06.760> concepts<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.840> it

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
the same concepts of it

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.160 
the same concepts of it
so<00:03:08.340> repeater<00:03:09.340> there<00:03:12.269> again<00:03:13.269> up<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.660> down<00:03:13.780> into

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
so repeater there again up and down into

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.910 
so repeater there again up and down into
redstone<00:03:15.450> then<00:03:16.450> make<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.780> L<00:03:17.019> shape<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:20.350> then

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
redstone then make that L shape and then

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.599 
redstone then make that L shape and then
down<00:03:21.459> here<00:03:22.230> extend<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.410> down<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:27.340> then<00:03:27.459> down

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
down here extend it down and then down

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.030 
down here extend it down and then down
again<00:03:27.900> redstone<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.910> repeater<00:03:30.910> there

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
again redstone and repeater there

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.170 
again redstone and repeater there
alright<00:03:33.040> here's<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.310> parts<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.700> little<00:03:33.970> bit

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
alright here's the parts a little bit

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.789 
alright here's the parts a little bit
different<00:03:34.540> block<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:36.690> then<00:03:37.690> blocks<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.680> so

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
different block and then blocks like so

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.349 
different block and then blocks like so
but<00:03:41.799> dust<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.850> there

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
but dust in there

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.470 
but dust in there
repeater<00:03:44.109> on<00:03:44.200> one<00:03:44.590> tick<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.150> down<00:03:46.150> here<00:03:46.450> a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
repeater on one tick and down here a

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.089 
repeater on one tick and down here a
repeater<00:03:46.959> on<00:03:47.109> two<00:03:47.319> ticks<00:03:47.850> like<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:51.450> next

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
repeater on two ticks like so next

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.350 
repeater on two ticks like so next
we're<00:03:54.099> gonna<00:03:54.220> put<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.549> half<00:03:54.849> slab<00:03:55.120> here

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
we're gonna put a half slab here

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.699 
we're gonna put a half slab here
redstone<00:03:56.459> repeater<00:03:58.110> well<00:03:59.110> two<00:03:59.379> repeaters

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
redstone repeater well two repeaters

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.880 
redstone repeater well two repeaters
actually<00:04:02.670> like<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:04.379> then<00:04:05.379> what's<00:04:05.680> down

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
actually like that then what's down

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.259 
actually like that then what's down
there<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:07.530> thank<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:08.590> for<00:04:08.769> now<00:04:09.150> we're<00:04:10.150> not

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
there and thank you for now we're not

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.240 
there and thank you for now we're not
actually<00:04:10.450> we're<00:04:11.140> just<00:04:11.319> gonna<00:04:11.440> put<00:04:11.709> four

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
actually we're just gonna put four

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.069 
actually we're just gonna put four
repeaters<00:04:12.790> all<00:04:13.299> facing<00:04:13.900> in<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.049> same

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
repeaters all facing in the same

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.170 
repeaters all facing in the same
direction<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.840> it'll<00:04:17.019> make<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.290> easier

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
direction just so it'll make it easier

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.909 
direction just so it'll make it easier
like<00:04:19.180> that<00:04:21.990> and<00:04:22.990> then<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.500> will<00:04:23.680> come<00:04:23.740> up

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
like that and then this will come up

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.670 
like that and then this will come up
here<00:04:24.389> it's<00:04:25.389> two<00:04:25.690> redstone<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.440> I'm<00:04:26.500> going<00:04:26.650> to

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
here it's two redstone and I'm going to

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.810 
here it's two redstone and I'm going to
appear<00:04:27.220> on<00:04:27.400> -<00:04:32.400> I'm<00:04:33.400> gonna<00:04:33.580> bring<00:04:33.760> that

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
appear on - I'm gonna bring that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.480 
appear on - I'm gonna bring that
redstone<00:04:34.150> down<00:04:34.539> here<00:04:37.860> put<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:39.010> into<00:04:39.460> a

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
redstone down here put it into a

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.400 
redstone down here put it into a
repeater<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.889> vortex<00:04:42.600> into<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.630> sticky<00:04:44.080> piston

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
repeater on vortex into a sticky piston

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
repeater on vortex into a sticky piston
with<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.590> block<00:04:44.800> on<00:04:44.979> top

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
with a block on top

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.890 
with a block on top
enter<00:04:46.360> Peter<00:04:47.139> on<00:04:47.289> three<00:04:47.740> toes<00:04:48.330> I'll<00:04:49.330> go<00:04:49.600> into

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
enter Peter on three toes I'll go into

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.730 
enter Peter on three toes I'll go into
there<00:04:50.229> and<00:04:50.560> also<00:04:50.830> down<00:04:52.080> into<00:04:53.160> redstone<00:04:55.740> so

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
there and also down into redstone so

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.440 
there and also down into redstone so
take<00:04:57.099> that<00:04:57.340> signal<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.030> bring<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.419> down

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
take that signal and bring it down

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.250 
take that signal and bring it down
another<00:04:58.870> one<00:04:59.110> into<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.380> repeater<00:05:00.900> then<00:05:01.900> into

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
another one into a repeater then into

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.010 
another one into a repeater then into
block<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:04.210> think<00:05:04.389> I've<00:05:04.510> built<00:05:04.720> us<00:05:04.840> about

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
block and I think I've built us about

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.930 
block and I think I've built us about
five<00:05:05.320> times<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.889> each<00:05:06.099> time<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.729> keep

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
five times and each time I keep

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.520 
five times and each time I keep
forgetting<00:05:07.389> to<00:05:07.419> put<00:05:07.720> this<00:05:07.840> repeater<00:05:08.169> here<00:05:08.410> on

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
forgetting to put this repeater here on

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.219 
forgetting to put this repeater here on
a<00:05:08.590> half<00:05:08.860> slab<00:05:09.099> make<00:05:09.639> sure<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:09.820> do<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.169> put<00:05:11.169> a

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
a half slab make sure you do that put a

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.370 
a half slab make sure you do that put a
torch<00:05:11.530> there<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:13.950> repeater<00:05:14.950> on<00:05:16.169> default<00:05:17.169> delay
