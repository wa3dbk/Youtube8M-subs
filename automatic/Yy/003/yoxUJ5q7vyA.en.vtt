 for the first time in eight months for home 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 it looks like a house 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.210
 is already 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.159

 explode in these excursions that I do 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 by bike through the city ​​because it's a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.509
 site I think for me to read or to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.509
 relax because it is very good or not 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.250
 interesting the conversation 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.230
 is that Juarez that right at this moment 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.750
 that we are communicating with people 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.100
 because we 're not going to the bowling 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.790

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.860
 a lot of pressure 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.340
 something that skin 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.670
 you can re- pull and pull 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.670

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.819
 where I return atp lotina now there 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.420

 this is done it intentional 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.099
 I want to throw them all 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.270
 it's like that 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.359
 if true 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.350

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.799
 51 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.530
 if you are diverting attention to 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.530
 cities 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.760
 today 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.340
 this makes me nervous not 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.930
 good good good 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:53.690
 the last round and the markers are 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:56.890
 re 6.134 visit 78 included 85 we go to 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.890
 see how the redhead plays 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.650
 this penultimate throw 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.000
 It's not good It's not good It's not good 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.000
 let's see his second run 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.720
 and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.100
 run what's happening you're going to win 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.100
 I'm thrashing 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.290
 this is the face of defeat 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.360
 and this is the key to victory 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.100
 and until the results 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.830
 you are having a bad time 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.180
 Well, I've escaped from home 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.370
 little in fact I've been all day 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.319
 trying to escape from home because that 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.670
 home today is hell you can not 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.830
 be there 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.120
 more than a short one seems to be 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.120
 rolling a trilogy 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.570
 I wanted to tell you that many people tell me 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.520
 I ras you're a bit of a goal back 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.420
 this to celebrate your birthday all the 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.240
 month 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.400
 He fuck jodamos he not refused the following areas 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.980
 what I'm trying is to be able 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.780
 celebrate the birthday with all my 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.640
 friends I'm a lucky one because I have 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.680
 many friends but it is very difficult 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.720
 bring them all together in a single day and 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.970
 celebrate it with only one so what 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.680
 I do every year it is possible by giving what 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.840
 throughout the month of June 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.400
 with several of them and doing things 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.590
 celebrate them with each one in a way 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.390
 different for example for me and me the 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.190
 Sunday to lisbon concurred and was 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.860
 celebrate my birthday with curry and today 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.420
 I'm going to see, for example, thanks to 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.120
 my good friend again I do not 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.590
 you know if you do not let him record 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.060
 the play 'the lion king' here in 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.210
 in Madrid 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.550
 a gift then he saw her in london and 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.139
 I thought it was cool, it's true 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.000
 that there he saw her a little bit in a hurry and such 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.800
 and I could not give it all the attention that 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.169
 he deserved but I remember him quite 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.180
 alright so let's see how it is 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.200
 here in the Spanish version I have been told 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.560
 that do not have the rights of 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.960
 songs so it's likely that 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:40.290
 and we disagree, let's find a point of 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:44.419
 fiction but I have hopes already put 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.419
 we are in the theater lope de vega 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.290
 since we were in the European theater of 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.960
 vega about to start the show and 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.900
 that's the scenario is pretty cool 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.370
 the nancys are projections or drawings 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.590
 they all create great and there are the 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.620
 instruments that will touch us in 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.270
 direct 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:11.200
 every time it is inhibited 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:15.200
 in your day to day you can comment 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:19.250
 I like to say hello 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.730
