last<00:05:33.050> exercise<00:05:34.010> you<00:05:34.730> can<00:05:34.880> try<00:05:35.920> only<00:05:36.920> doing

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
last exercise you can try only doing

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.300 
last exercise you can try only doing
your<00:05:37.490> are<00:05:37.880> mask<00:05:38.150> so<00:05:39.080> practice<00:05:39.680> this<00:05:39.830> couple

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
your are mask so practice this couple

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.020 
your are mask so practice this couple
takes<00:05:40.600> practice<00:05:41.600> this<00:05:41.810> on<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.350> other<00:05:42.530> leg

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
takes practice this on the other leg

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.300 
takes practice this on the other leg
practices<00:05:44.030> with<00:05:44.240> opposite<00:05:44.720> arms<00:05:45.140> and<00:05:45.380> the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
practices with opposite arms and the

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.190 
practices with opposite arms and the
trick<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.790> keeping<00:05:47.120> your<00:05:47.540> shoulders<00:05:47.990> square

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
trick to keeping your shoulders square

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.850 
trick to keeping your shoulders square
is<00:05:48.560> just<00:05:48.830> looking<00:05:49.250> straight<00:05:49.670> ahead<00:05:49.700> so<00:05:50.860> don't

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
is just looking straight ahead so don't

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.880 
is just looking straight ahead so don't
try<00:05:52.250> to<00:05:52.280> look<00:05:52.640> over<00:05:53.300> your<00:05:53.330> shoulder<00:05:53.500> don't<00:05:54.500> try

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
try to look over your shoulder don't try

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.130 
try to look over your shoulder don't try
to<00:05:54.950> look<00:05:55.280> behind<00:05:55.580> you<00:05:56.030> don't<00:05:56.330> look<00:05:56.630> around<00:05:56.810> the

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
to look behind you don't look around the

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.630 
to look behind you don't look around the
room<00:05:57.350> simply<00:05:58.340> make<00:05:58.850> a<00:05:58.880> point<00:05:59.660> on<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.050> wall<00:06:00.200> and

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
room simply make a point on the wall and

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.700 
room simply make a point on the wall and
staring<00:06:01.640> it<00:06:01.760> for<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.210> couple<00:06:02.330> seconds<00:06:02.870> before

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
staring it for a couple seconds before

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.490 
staring it for a couple seconds before
you<00:06:04.280> come<00:06:04.520> down<00:06:04.550> from<00:06:05.090> your<00:06:05.150> arabesque<00:06:05.720> so

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
you come down from your arabesque so

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500 
you come down from your arabesque so
it's<00:06:07.280> going<00:06:07.790> to<00:06:07.940> feel<00:06:08.180> a<00:06:08.210> little<00:06:08.330> bit

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
it's going to feel a little bit

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.580 
it's going to feel a little bit
different<00:06:08.780> possibly<00:06:09.770> but<00:06:11.440> arabesque<00:06:12.440> is<00:06:12.530> a

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
different possibly but arabesque is a

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.650 
different possibly but arabesque is a
figure<00:06:12.920> that<00:06:13.040> you<00:06:13.340> want<00:06:13.550> to<00:06:13.730> hold<00:06:13.970> rather<00:06:14.390> than

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
figure that you want to hold rather than

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.800 
figure that you want to hold rather than
move<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.310> it's<00:06:16.310> only<00:06:16.520> for<00:06:17.000> a<00:06:17.330> couple<00:06:17.420> of

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
move and it's only for a couple of

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.540 
move and it's only for a couple of
seconds<00:06:18.170> that<00:06:18.380> you're<00:06:18.530> going<00:06:18.800> to<00:06:18.830> go<00:06:19.040> here<00:06:19.340> and

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
seconds that you're going to go here and

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.600 
seconds that you're going to go here and
then<00:06:20.060> you<00:06:20.180> go<00:06:20.300> too<00:06:20.600> close<00:06:20.720> so<00:06:21.190> we<00:06:22.190> you<00:06:22.430> miss

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
then you go too close so we you miss

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.770 
then you go too close so we you miss
movement<00:06:23.120> like<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.540> in<00:06:23.810> tango<00:06:24.500> when<00:06:25.160> we

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
movement like that in tango when we

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.960 
movement like that in tango when we
transfer<00:06:26.780> our<00:06:26.810> weight<00:06:27.200> for<00:06:28.040> example<00:06:28.070> before

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
transfer our weight for example before

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.080 
transfer our weight for example before
we<00:06:29.120> go<00:06:29.300> into<00:06:29.720> our<00:06:30.620> next<00:06:30.950> figure<00:06:31.580> so<00:06:31.850> for

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
we go into our next figure so for

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.220 
we go into our next figure so for
example<00:06:32.600> if<00:06:32.840> I'm<00:06:33.710> going<00:06:34.250> into<00:06:34.550> an<00:06:35.270> orchard<00:06:35.750> for

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
example if I'm going into an orchard for

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.040 
example if I'm going into an orchard for
my<00:06:36.320> sense<00:06:36.650> that<00:06:36.980> I<00:06:37.160> need<00:06:37.460> to<00:06:37.610> get<00:06:37.730> here<00:06:38.210> before

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
my sense that I need to get here before

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.690 
my sense that I need to get here before
going<00:06:39.320> into<00:06:39.770> my<00:06:41.050> twisting<00:06:42.050> position<00:06:42.500> so<00:06:43.250> this

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
going into my twisting position so this

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.960 
going into my twisting position so this
is<00:06:43.910> what<00:06:44.120> this<00:06:44.270> is<00:06:44.420> going<00:06:44.660> to<00:06:44.780> help<00:06:44.960> with

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
is what this is going to help with

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.890 
is what this is going to help with
transferring<00:06:46.970> your<00:06:47.090> weight<00:06:47.150> clearly

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
transferring your weight clearly

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.020 
transferring your weight clearly
transferring<00:06:48.650> your<00:06:48.770> weight<00:06:48.830> clearly<00:06:49.400> same

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
transferring your weight clearly same

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.100 
transferring your weight clearly same
thing<00:06:50.360> forward<00:06:50.840> and<00:06:51.140> back<00:06:52.100> and<00:06:52.660> if<00:06:53.660> I<00:06:53.840> leave<00:06:54.080> my

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
thing forward and back and if I leave my

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.470 
thing forward and back and if I leave my
foot<00:06:54.620> behind<00:06:54.830> for<00:06:55.370> some<00:06:55.550> reason<00:06:55.940> if<00:06:56.060> I'm<00:06:56.210> doing

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
foot behind for some reason if I'm doing

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.740 
foot behind for some reason if I'm doing
an<00:06:56.570> embellishment<00:06:56.990> for<00:06:57.290> example

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
an embellishment for example

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.870 
an embellishment for example
is<00:06:58.990> going<00:06:59.200> to<00:06:59.320> help<00:06:59.560> me<00:06:59.770> keep<00:07:00.490> my<00:07:00.550> balance

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
is going to help me keep my balance

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.300 
is going to help me keep my balance
without<00:07:01.660> falling<00:07:02.290> backwards<00:07:02.800> all<00:07:03.370> up<00:07:03.730> so

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
without falling backwards all up so

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.760 
without falling backwards all up so
again<00:07:06.310> try<00:07:07.120> this<00:07:07.620> hold<00:07:08.620> it<00:07:09.000> try<00:07:10.000> the<00:07:10.060> fan<00:07:10.390> on

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
again try this hold it try the fan on

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.670 
again try this hold it try the fan on
clothes<00:07:11.770> clothes<00:07:12.780> dry<00:07:13.780> all<00:07:14.170> different

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
clothes clothes dry all different

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.580 
clothes clothes dry all different
combinations<00:07:15.720> so<00:07:16.720> my<00:07:16.960> left<00:07:17.230> foot<00:07:17.410> goes

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
combinations so my left foot goes

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.370 
combinations so my left foot goes
forward<00:07:17.620> my<00:07:18.220> right<00:07:18.250> arm<00:07:18.730> goes<00:07:18.910> forward<00:07:19.540> my

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.380 
forward my right arm goes forward my

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.740 
forward my right arm goes forward my
left<00:07:20.980> arm<00:07:21.220> goes<00:07:21.460> forward<00:07:22.000> to<00:07:22.150> make<00:07:22.330> sure<00:07:22.540> it's

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
left arm goes forward to make sure it's

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.960 
left arm goes forward to make sure it's
not<00:07:22.930> twisted<00:07:23.200> like<00:07:23.680> this<00:07:23.970> here<00:07:25.170> close<00:07:26.400> so<00:07:27.400> try

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
not twisted like this here close so try

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.810 
not twisted like this here close so try
these<00:07:28.030> exercises<00:07:28.420> and<00:07:29.320> see<00:07:29.740> if<00:07:30.040> you<00:07:30.250> feel<00:07:30.640> any

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820 
these exercises and see if you feel any

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.750 
these exercises and see if you feel any
improvement<00:07:31.360> than<00:07:31.480> you<00:07:31.570> think
