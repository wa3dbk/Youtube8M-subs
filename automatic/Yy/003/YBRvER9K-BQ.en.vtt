 I would like to give a lecture on how to make this batter 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.880
 First of all, at first it feels the same as strings 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.200
 So oh yeah 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.530
 We are chasing in a hurry the other rough-hewn fast forward state 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.030
 First, have we put the sounds participation set tree earth Well crease 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.199
 Bag dude 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.199
 Open in shape 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.300
 Village charge thinking this 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.450
 If you are positive you know how to fold cranes 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:03.880
 To the positive this state and who sometimes broke Well crane or rather 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.880
 I think it is easy to bring 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.700
 But those who do not know well 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:18.870
 I'm digging too early and I don't know 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.890
 Asked to look at there in the video have been introduced in another video I also one with a lot of long Complimentary wireless Internet access because Nde 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.659
 The 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.050
 We have you confirm and say from now on 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.130
 To up to this form 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.000
 If you decide 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.890
 I think it's a batter from here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.820
 First, it's tool because it is not too difficult 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.820
 This form is also 0 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.570
 Let me see 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.130
 Well a little 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.610
 Might the Nodema subtle say wo in a hurry in a hurry 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.460
 Yes, it is up to this form 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:12.080
 It's like I just spread one by one vertically with a bag weave 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.230
 Please bring it to this form 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.890
 Yes, I 'm doing well from here 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.069
 How to make it Yes 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.999
 Well first, this Whoa It Is 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.290
 Because I think that is in the form to open the square curtain 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:35.379
 This open 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.140
 That 's right, it 's a gate here, I feel that it connects Karo and the center. 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.010
 Weave up 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.010
 Please open it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.370
 As well 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.550
 Say so 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.870
 the same 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.530
 To a place 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.640
 I can do it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.600
 Yes 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.120
 It will be like this if you open it later 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.120
 Well this time 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.150
 It is the only type 4 Toko day from the middle Well 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:10.300
 This child has half the other part 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.380
 It folds on him naturally line in the middle 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.380
 Ok if you put it on 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.280
 Or 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.620
 Cleanly 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.890
 Child of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.980
 I think this can not be done 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.970
 This is also the line is positive 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.200
 It is roughly but roughly 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.200
 Yeah Well participation 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.200
 If the crease in the sound comes out 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:41.240
 I think that there is no problem if you seem to feel that you are explicitly involved 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.290
 Yes 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:51.250
 The lower now When you come it up to here 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.250
 I'm looking forward to this middle fold 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.980
 Yes 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:00.130
 Well, it's about 5 mm, so I'm doing Honda down . 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.460
 About 5 mm in a folded state 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.060
 Want to 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.060
 We will have 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 It is like this 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.980
 It is 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.980
 Returns cage you want to in the Dancin ' 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.250
 So next to a child is 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.550
 This is half already 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.879
 Overall it is half place 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.879
 The 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:35.139
 It is is after this 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:37.770
 This is a part of the end but this is this line 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.600
 High tide according to the edge line 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.590
 Outward treatment 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.590
 Wrap 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.810
 Yes 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.770
 This is the end of the batter 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.289
 is not it 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.969
 Same as this 9 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.300
 Well color difference 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:01.090
 Express 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.120
 You stand and you just stand up and stand 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.529
 Because I will 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.619
 It becomes like a meadow if you line up a lot 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.619
 Take the way of the batter in the Yes it is abnormal
