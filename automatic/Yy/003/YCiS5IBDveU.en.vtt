00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
as we drop down I tried to notice any

as we drop down I tried to notice any
signs<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.860> narcosis<00:01:30.140> most<00:01:31.140> obvious<00:01:31.619> one

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
signs of the narcosis most obvious one

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.719 
signs of the narcosis most obvious one
was<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> funny<00:01:32.549> metallic<00:01:33.270> taste<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> my<00:01:34.049> mouth

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
was a funny metallic taste in my mouth

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.899 
was a funny metallic taste in my mouth
as<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.030> had<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> bit<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.390> blood<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.899> I

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
as if you had a bit of blood there I

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.700 
as if you had a bit of blood there I
felt<00:01:38.909> reasonably<00:01:39.539> relaxed<00:01:40.049> as<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.320> drop<00:01:40.470> down

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
felt reasonably relaxed as we drop down

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
felt reasonably relaxed as we drop down
to<00:01:40.830> 50<00:01:41.130> meter<00:01:41.509> but<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.539> suspect<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.470> part

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to 50 meter but I suspect that was part

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:55.460 
to 50 meter but I suspect that was part
of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> narcosis<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.759> coast<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.780> tested<00:01:55.200> just

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of the narcosis the coast is tested just

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.809 
of the narcosis the coast is tested just
going<00:01:55.740> interview<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.280> bottom<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.640 

i'm<00:02:15.390> afraid<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.840> i'm<00:02:16.049> not<00:02:16.200> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> show

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
i'm afraid that i'm not going to show

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.940 
i'm afraid that i'm not going to show
you<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.920> contents<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> narcosis<00:02:18.090> test

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
you the contents of the narcosis test

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.220 
you the contents of the narcosis test

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
because it's easier to North meters it's

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.830 
because it's easier to North meters it's
much<00:02:22.410> harder<00:02:22.650> at<00:02:22.890> 50<00:02:23.250> meters
