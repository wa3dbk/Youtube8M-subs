hi<00:00:00.930> everybody<00:00:01.350> i'm<00:00:01.589> dana<00:00:01.890> Scheider<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.520> in

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hi everybody i'm dana Scheider and in

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.220 
hi everybody i'm dana Scheider and in
this<00:00:02.790> video<00:00:03.030> i'm<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.720> explain<00:00:03.840> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
this video i'm going to explain the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.160 
this video i'm going to explain the
concept<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.770> absolute<00:00:04.980> value<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.180> know<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.899> said

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
concept of absolute value I know I said

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.020 
concept of absolute value I know I said
my<00:00:07.200> next<00:00:07.350> video<00:00:07.830> was<00:00:08.069> gonna<00:00:08.220> be<00:00:08.400> about<00:00:08.639> adding

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
my next video was gonna be about adding

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.790 
my next video was gonna be about adding
and<00:00:09.150> subtracting<00:00:09.599> negative<00:00:09.929> numbers<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.679> I'm

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and subtracting negative numbers and I'm

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.860 
and subtracting negative numbers and I'm
going<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.190> do<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.550> next<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:12.690> decided

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
going to do that next but I just decided

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.990 
going to do that next but I just decided
it<00:00:13.230> was<00:00:13.320> important<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.980> include<00:00:14.009> absolute

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
it was important to include absolute

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.359 
it was important to include absolute
value<00:00:15.269> first<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:16.440> you're<00:00:16.800> comfortable<00:00:17.279> with

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
value first if you're comfortable with

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.279 
value first if you're comfortable with
the<00:00:17.520> idea<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> number<00:00:18.300> line<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.510> positive

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the idea of the number line and positive

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.080 
the idea of the number line and positive
and<00:00:19.439> negative<00:00:19.920> numbers<00:00:20.279> you're<00:00:20.730> ready<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
and negative numbers you're ready to

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.480 
and negative numbers you're ready to
learn<00:00:21.270> about<00:00:21.420> absolute<00:00:21.990> value<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:23.310> can

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
learn about absolute value you can

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.040 
learn about absolute value you can
understand<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> absolute<00:00:24.510> value<00:00:24.840> without

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
understand the absolute value without

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.040 
understand the absolute value without
understanding<00:00:26.010> fractions<00:00:26.570> arithmetic<00:00:27.570> or

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
understanding fractions arithmetic or

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.880 
understanding fractions arithmetic or
why<00:00:28.529> any<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.189> matters<00:00:30.529> absolute<00:00:31.529> value

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
why any of this matters absolute value

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.459 
why any of this matters absolute value
is<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.669> simple<00:00:33.000> concept<00:00:33.290> by<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.320> way

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
is a really simple concept by the way

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.979 
is a really simple concept by the way
most<00:00:34.800> math<00:00:35.370> concepts<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.149> actually<00:00:36.600> simple

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
most math concepts are actually simple

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
most math concepts are actually simple
but<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.410> easy<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.860> lose<00:00:38.040> sight<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.610> when

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
but it's easy to lose sight of that when

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.979 
but it's easy to lose sight of that when
you've<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:38.879> got<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> whole<00:00:39.540> bunch<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you've just got a whole bunch of the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.959 
you've just got a whole bunch of the
main<00:00:40.170> thrown<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.829> once<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
main thrown at you at once so I want to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.750 
main thrown at you at once so I want to
make<00:00:42.090> sure<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> point<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.840> out

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
make sure to point that out

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.100 
make sure to point that out
absolute<00:00:44.760> value<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> distance<00:00:45.690> between

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
absolute value is the distance between

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.610 
absolute value is the distance between
any<00:00:46.530> number<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.190> zero<00:00:48.320> integers<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.559> be

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
any number and zero integers can be

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.430 
any number and zero integers can be
positive<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.399> negative<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.480> absolute<00:00:52.050> values

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
positive or negative but absolute values

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720 
positive or negative but absolute values
are<00:00:52.620> always<00:00:52.890> positive

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
are always positive

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.119 
are always positive
that's<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.930> absolute<00:00:55.440> value<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.920> about

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that's because absolute value is about

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.790 
that's because absolute value is about
the<00:00:56.370> distance<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.030> zero<00:00:57.480> not<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> direction

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the distance from zero not the direction

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
the distance from zero not the direction
from<00:00:58.980> zero<00:00:59.510> you<00:01:00.510> indicate<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> absolute

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
from zero you indicate the absolute

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
from zero you indicate the absolute
value<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.100> number<00:01:02.280> by<00:01:02.579> putting<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> number

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
value of a number by putting the number

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.670 
value of a number by putting the number
between<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:04.080> vertical<00:01:04.739> bars<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.680> it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
between two vertical bars like this it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.990 
between two vertical bars like this it's
best<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> number<00:01:08.790> line<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
best to use the number line to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870 
best to use the number line to
illustrate<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:11.010> positive<00:01:11.490> integer

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
illustrate this the positive integer

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.560 
illustrate this the positive integer
four<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.600> four<00:01:13.260> away<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.770> zero<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:15.150> negative

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
four is four away from zero the negative

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.050 
four is four away from zero the negative
integer<00:01:15.990> negative<00:01:16.500> four<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.040> also<00:01:17.520> far<00:01:17.850> away

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
integer negative four is also far away

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
integer negative four is also far away
from<00:01:18.119> zero<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> opposite<00:01:19.799> direction

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
from zero just in the opposite direction

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.820 
from zero just in the opposite direction
since<00:01:21.390> direction<00:01:21.960> doesn't<00:01:22.170> matter<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
since direction doesn't matter for

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
since direction doesn't matter for
absolute<00:01:23.250> value<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.820> absolute<00:01:23.939> value<00:01:24.689> of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
absolute value the absolute value of

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.179 
absolute value the absolute value of
both<00:01:25.080> 4<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.710> negative<00:01:26.430> 4<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.180> 4<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.979> can

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
both 4 and negative 4 is 4 you can

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.880 
both 4 and negative 4 is 4 you can
generalize<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.840> absolute<00:01:31.350> value<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
generalize this the absolute value of a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620 
generalize this the absolute value of a
positive<00:01:31.920> number<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> same<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
positive number is the same as the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.620 
positive number is the same as the
original<00:01:33.720> number<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> absolute<00:01:36.119> value<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
original number so the absolute value of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
original number so the absolute value of
1<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.229> 1<00:01:37.460> absolute<00:01:38.460> value<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> 6<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.570> 6<00:01:39.930> etc<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
1 is 1 absolute value of 6 is 6 etc the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.030 
1 is 1 absolute value of 6 is 6 etc the
absolute<00:01:42.450> value<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.020> negative<00:01:43.229> number<00:01:43.680> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
absolute value of a negative number is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.310 
absolute value of a negative number is
the<00:01:44.460> same<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> original<00:01:45.180> number<00:01:45.960> but

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the same as the original number but

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.280 
the same as the original number but
positive<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.299> absolute<00:01:48.750> value<00:01:49.259> of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
positive so the absolute value of

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.249 
positive so the absolute value of
negative<00:01:49.649> 1<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.369> positive<00:01:50.820> 1<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:52.110> absolute

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
negative 1 is positive 1 the absolute

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.910 
negative 1 is positive 1 the absolute
value<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> negative<00:01:53.340> 3<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> positive<00:01:54.270> 3<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.350> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
value of negative 3 is positive 3 and so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
value of negative 3 is positive 3 and so
on<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.790> simple<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> conclude<00:01:59.960> absolute

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
on see simple so to conclude absolute

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.319 
on see simple so to conclude absolute
value<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.590> distance<00:02:01.829> between<00:02:02.549> any<00:02:03.030> number

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
value is the distance between any number

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.050 
value is the distance between any number
and<00:02:03.750> 0<00:02:04.130> absolute<00:02:05.130> values<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.790> always

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and 0 absolute values are always

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.229 
and 0 absolute values are always
positive<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:07.190> hope<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.399> video<00:02:08.640> has<00:02:08.970> helped
