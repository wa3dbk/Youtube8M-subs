00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.199 
how far that bounced all right let's go
with<00:02:33.200> one<00:02:33.440> more<00:02:33.620> polyurethane<00:02:34.489> insole<00:02:34.940> this

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
with one more polyurethane insole this

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.380 
with one more polyurethane insole this
is<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.570> original<00:02:35.890> polysorbate<00:02:37.000> co<00:02:38.000> which<00:02:38.239> is

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
is the original polysorbate co which is

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.010 
is the original polysorbate co which is
a<00:02:38.420> very<00:02:38.720> good<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.170> Seoul<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:41.540> it's<00:02:41.720> not

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
a very good in Seoul but it's not

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.280 
a very good in Seoul but it's not
compared<00:02:42.530> with<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.770> down<00:02:42.980> soft<00:02:43.450> okay<00:02:44.450> one<00:02:44.780> two

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
compared with the down soft okay one two

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.110 
compared with the down soft okay one two
three<00:02:46.840> all<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:51.400> all<00:02:52.400> right<00:02:52.489> now<00:02:52.790> let's<00:02:52.970> go

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
three all right all right now let's go

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.520 
three all right all right now let's go
ahead<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.299> compare<00:02:53.690> these<00:02:53.870> with<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.049> standard

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
ahead and compare these with a standard

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.740 
ahead and compare these with a standard
nike<00:02:54.980> insole<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.390> give<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.720> a

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
nike insole just to give you a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.199 
nike insole just to give you a
comparison<00:02:57.200> this<00:02:57.709> is<00:02:57.890> called<00:02:58.100> EV<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.180> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
comparison this is called EV a this is a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.720 
comparison this is called EV a this is a
standard<00:02:59.540> insole<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.049> is<00:03:00.320> Amol<00:03:00.680> shoes<00:03:01.040> one

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
standard insole that is Amol shoes one

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.240 
standard insole that is Amol shoes one
two<00:03:02.630> three<00:03:04.840> okay<00:03:08.560> all<00:03:09.560> right<00:03:09.769> next<00:03:10.040> we're

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
two three okay all right next we're

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.650 
two three okay all right next we're
going<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.400> go<00:03:10.549> ahead<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.000> quick<00:03:11.299> gel

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
going to go ahead and do a quick gel

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:20.820 
going to go ahead and do a quick gel
three-quarter<00:03:12.500> in<00:03:12.620> slow

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:30.200 

okay<00:03:22.500> here<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.530> go<00:03:24.240> one<00:03:25.240> two<00:03:26.040> three<00:03:28.620> all<00:03:29.620> right

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
okay here we go one two three all right

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.300 
okay here we go one two three all right
but<00:03:31.210> you<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.570> see<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.500> gel<00:03:32.800> doesn't

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
but you can see that the gel doesn't

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.090 
but you can see that the gel doesn't
actually<00:03:33.520> absorb<00:03:34.270> as<00:03:35.140> much<00:03:35.200> as<00:03:35.560> people<00:03:35.740> claim

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
actually absorb as much as people claim

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.430 
actually absorb as much as people claim
it<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.690> does<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.490> a<00:03:39.520> good<00:03:39.760> material<00:03:40.440> but

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
it is it does it is a good material but

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.460 
it is it does it is a good material but
the<00:03:41.620> Nano<00:03:41.830> soft<00:03:42.190> is<00:03:42.400> nanotechnology<00:03:43.360> is<00:03:44.170> far

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
the Nano soft is nanotechnology is far

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.990 
the Nano soft is nanotechnology is far
beyond<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.220> technology<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.270> gel<00:03:46.980> one<00:03:48.000> two

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
beyond the technology of the gel one two

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.560 
beyond the technology of the gel one two
three<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.350> see<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.950> golf<00:03:54.640> ball<00:03:54.910> the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
three so you see the golf ball the

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.170 
three so you see the golf ball the
energy<00:03:56.440> derived<00:03:56.860> from<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> golf<00:03:57.370> ball<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.880> not

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
energy derived from the golf ball is not

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.870 
energy derived from the golf ball is not
absorbed<00:03:58.480> by<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.720> gel<00:03:59.140> but<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.370> pro<00:04:00.670> by

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
absorbed by the gel but it is a pro by

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.020 
absorbed by the gel but it is a pro by
the<00:04:00.940> Nassau<00:04:02.280> okay<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:03.490> we're<00:04:03.640> going<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:03.910> go

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the Nassau okay so we're going to go

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.030 
the Nassau okay so we're going to go
ahead<00:04:04.060> we're<00:04:04.420> going<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.600> do<00:04:04.720> another<00:04:05.040> silicone

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
ahead we're going to do another silicone

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.380 
ahead we're going to do another silicone

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
see if it now can we take a look at the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.280 
see if it now can we take a look at the
bottom<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.470> that<00:05:02.590> insult<00:05:03.479> okay<00:05:04.479> so<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:04.810> has<00:05:05.020> a

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
bottom of that insult okay so it has a

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.380 
bottom of that insult okay so it has a
gel<00:05:07.320> silicone<00:05:08.320> gel<00:05:09.040> this<00:05:09.430> is<00:05:09.610> what<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:10.060> really

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
gel silicone gel this is what it really

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.330 
gel silicone gel this is what it really
is<00:05:10.540> it's<00:05:10.930> made<00:05:11.110> from<00:05:11.260> silicon<00:05:12.600> all<00:05:13.600> right<00:05:14.340> one

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
is it's made from silicon all right one

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.150 
is it's made from silicon all right one
more<00:05:15.400> time<00:05:15.790> we're<00:05:16.030> going<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.210> do<00:05:16.360> another<00:05:17.160> gel

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
more time we're going to do another gel

more time we're going to do another gel
slim<00:05:19.000> soul<00:05:19.530> which<00:05:20.530> is<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:21.690> nice<00:05:22.690> in<00:05:22.990> Seoul<00:05:23.260> okay

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
slim soul which is a nice in Seoul okay

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.700 
slim soul which is a nice in Seoul okay
we'll<00:05:24.070> go<00:05:24.160> ahead<00:05:24.220> put<00:05:24.430> that<00:05:24.610> in<00:05:24.760> there

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
one two three all right so you see we've

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.170 
one two three all right so you see we've
tested<00:05:34.000> out<00:05:35.010> many<00:05:36.010> different<00:05:36.520> styles<00:05:36.820> of
