00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.090
 difficult to make this eye our people in 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 Cassio if you want to learn to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.510

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.319

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.319
 that they have to be of body 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.120

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.920
 of garbage already after we did this to 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.760
 People are going to get a brown shadow. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.290

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.290
 Way to that bubu bh ​​that I have here

 Way I'm not going to let too much mark 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.320
 because I think very happy in at least 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.800

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.760

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.140
 eyebrow more lightly because I 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.560
 I do not like being tagged I already told you 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.560

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:21.180
 grass I 'm not going to show you 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.180

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.639
 withdrawal in dissent 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.979
