00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.420
 They are imagining that well because I 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.309

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 well and gets everyone and all those 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.019
 things and today I came to do what a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.910
 conversation 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.250
 our thing we always do anyway 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.029
 always the same as always 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.050
 I wanted to say first of all is what 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.090
 first I 'm very excited about this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.760
 week I think the super cool boot 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.830
 things will pass on a donkey and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.689
 I'm also starting to write a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.030
 new book that is the third one that will leave 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.440
 end of the year 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:42.540
 expect expectations day ahead 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.340
 That's when I excited, with a new book. 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 Today I'm going to talk about a subject that is very 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.329
 Yummy wanted to talk about it 's about 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.190
 I miss you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.989
 I thought it was so delicious 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.550
 to miss some people at 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.780
 Sometimes you do not like it, you missed it. 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 feeling but do not forget one thing 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.870
 so pure is one thing is a love of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 Memory knows how long I miss it, just wait. 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.600
 who 's memory loves love one day be 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.119
 a person 's situation is so good 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.210
 We like to play. I missed you. 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.740
 remember the memories of what people 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.680
 liked what we did great 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.159
 level but I think it's so 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.439
 the memory is the longing in the case the woman 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 more delicious people remember that our 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.130
 life was worth what a life was 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 A nice, cool life. 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.930
 There's a phrase that I really like that says 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.659
 the following the happiness of a person 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.100
 who married depends on everything she came 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.720
 before the wedding 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.509
 this is obviously not to do with the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.430
 marriage with thing so you open one 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.070
 horizon to understand another way but 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.079
 has to do with what people have lived 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.189
 It's good to have marriages and then 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.560
 whatever 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.909
 this homesickness these memories memories 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.590
 not to be fed by people 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.180
 in the future but I know we will 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.979
 remember one day you may realize that it is 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.329
 very funny but all friends 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.130
 men 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.380
 I say this because I live in the middle. 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.200
 of men living with memories can see 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.709
 that we always meet a crowd and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.710
 lines even talk the same stories the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.020
 same memories then to this day 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.450
 with that many grandparents friends at last 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.790
 who the same uncles conversations 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.400
 jokes the same as the same ones 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.750
 story is always the same and always as if 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.080
 it was the first time 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.570
 It's very nice, this connecting thing. 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.090
 talk remember to put things on 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.100
 This paper is so good to remember 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.140
 that feeds people until today me and my 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.140
 friends I shut for the day that 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.790
 people drank and went to travel with 20 years 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.490
 and I do not know until today this is something that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.000
 feeds me so much to remember that brings a 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.740
 energy so stubborn that you should live life 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.110
 I enjoyed what I had to enjoy 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.030
 And dude there's nothing better than 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.100
 This does not have anything but we like it . 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.590
 remember is what we see what we people 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.180
 was the longing sometimes hurts the homesickness 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.300
 often makes us remember one thing one 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.760
 good thing in order but overall the longing 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.190
 a delicious thing so do not let 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.080
 To feel homesick, sit down with the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.660
 nostalgia and longing spoke know how 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.530
 Are you talking to her flat? 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.140
 ideas 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.300
 understand how everyone misses the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.610
 world and who gives the best with fodder 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.430
 feels better 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.800
 It's not the question of life, I think. 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.720
 opinion is not a situational issue 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.310
 plus a perspective issue are 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.870
 spent 1 cent lose people we 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.030
 like all green 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.260
 The difference is that how to deal with it 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.750
 as each unit 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.430
 how do you each feel then miss you 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.800
 Remember the things you like to leave 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.500
 homesick are door pictures are gardens 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.870
 they are lime in the fridge a keepsake 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.870
 Longing is the hottest thing in the world. 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.090
 people and we always remember is what 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.640
 people lived because we were the ones who 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.800
 People were not what we wanted to be. 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.930
 I think the best thing is that we 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.170
 never regret what one day the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.780
 people did not go then miss them 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.940
 because I love and longing I wanted 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.830
 To say that in today's video is over 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.780
 anyway just talk about my longing to 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.030
 nostalgia is memories 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.819
 feel good to have memories of 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.430
 I miss it, it hurts a little more in the field. 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.269
 She'll be a reason to smile in life. 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.130
 from everyone 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.690
 I wanted to play a less serious role today. 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.479
 I do not even know 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.919
 I was kind of late for nobody 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.520
 I kind of wanted to talk about 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.500
 that 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.050
 It was a chat to combine, there was 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.270

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.120
 I'm seeing such a fast thing. 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.280
 who knows who knows you do not like 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.139
 give a smile or two ovaries at last 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.849
 But this was the talk here today of 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.860
 today 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.919
 Thank you for your patience. 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.169

 and at last leave a comment 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.460
 Even I think it's cool, they've interacted with 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.820
 shame because sometimes this is the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.889
 conversation will not even read the question that I 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.800
 talk will be a beast cease to be a beast 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.289

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.810

 I should do more and not 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.430
 To think so much was a tip for me. 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.620
 same 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.150
 you are listening to this point of 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.520
 video could already have gone but it is 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.650

 get worse and paulo that it's legal to stay j &amp; j 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.980
