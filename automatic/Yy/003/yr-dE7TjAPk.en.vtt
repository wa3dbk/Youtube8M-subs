00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.620
 hello to all and friends seems to carros 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.260
 is so today we have prepared 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.400
 a traditional Moroccan soup then 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.200
 it's only one that we prepare 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.380
 usually during the month of Ramadan 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.369
 we found on all the tables at 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.990
 Morocco this moment it is essential 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.029
 especially for a young person so pleasant 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.590
 first see what his soup looks like 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.109
 then I will represent myself aggression 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.330
 and I pass the preparation to the soup 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.670
 traditional Moroccan is a soup 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.300
 prepared generally for during the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.280
 month of ramadan 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.340
 it's a soup found on 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.680
 all the tables in Morocco 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.989
 then the integrated level of the regime there 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.059
 have chickpeas lentils 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.340
 angel hair a few pieces of 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.649
 meat is then I added some of the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.300
 flour dilute in water but ensures the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.930
 flour dilute in water it allows 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.719
 simply spite cyr soup like 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.850
 you can see it then for the 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.280
 ingredients roger chickpeas into 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.289
 tin can of course could very 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 take it to dry chickpeas 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.819
 it will then be tricked into the water 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.529
 about a day at the weight I prefer 

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:10.600
 always take chickpeas in 

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:12.549
 tip of canned food because it's 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.649
 much faster is of course for 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.049
 cooking it is necessary to put them just at the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.729
 end it would have been dry chickpeas 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.889
 making friends her from the very beginning of the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.539
 cooking then you need the 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.060
 meat there I took the beef 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.659
 that I cut into small pieces 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.369
 because I can advise you 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.229
 confident is rather the chest 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.779
 of lamb its best finally it costs 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.889
 a little more expensive by cons wished 

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:38.619
 or fake salt a little lemon juice 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:41.619
 pepper a mixture and son so I 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.399
 half a teaspoon of cumin 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.939
 paprika ginger and cinnamon to 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:53.560
 onion by rapping two tomatoes missed 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.389
 a good amount of parsley will 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.690
 mix with coriander a cube of 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:03.330
 broth you can take beef 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.830
 you want of course after not too much 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.650
 salty since the cube of 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:13.380
 broth and then salted well 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.150
 olive oil lentils 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.920
 angel hair that I'm in the end because 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.920
 that cooking and is very fast 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.020
 then the tomato sauce 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.120
 there I took about a brick of sauce 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.730
 water tomato of course and make you 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.020
 about 1 liter or even liters 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.600
 depends on how much we wanted 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.460
 make soup and then water with 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.210
 the flour that I will mix together 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.710
 towards the end we will see this after 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.290
 so now I'm going to move to the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.850
 preparation it's really very close 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.020
 easy to do is fast enough at 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.190
 thigh level one wonders 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.250
 really not much time it takes 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.530
 count about 1h 1h30 then in a 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.530
 big pan pour a little of the group 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.060
 here is the tomato 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.540
 finally tomatoes because the two 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.950
 the onion the father site with an end 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.270
 mixed with a little coriander 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.250
 I notice a little for the moment 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.660
 players and I'm going to keep the rest for 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:26.160
 the end spices 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:28.670
 I will put the broth cube next 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.670
 you want the meat 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:41.430
 nor league 1 can take to this scene 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.620
 then for chickpeas and 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.120
 angel hair years of course I just 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.500
 forgot to specify for the hair 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.140
 angel need you can very well 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.230
 replace by for example with 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.610
 moors other birds there I took 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.890
 angel hair because that's what 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.270
 I have in my closet good for them 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.280
 angel hair and chickpeas I 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.600
 will only put them in the end as 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.300
 it does not really require a lot of 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:16.420
 cooking time if you then had 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:26.740
 mix to bring back all on 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:28.120
 over low heat about 5 to 10 of course 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.450
 do not hesitate to mix time in 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.450
 time 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.590
 then to know how to open your eyes 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.639
 but the ngo 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.639
 now it's rather rare at this level 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.780
 there I will put to the family 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.780
 now I 'm going to cook about 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.160
 half an hour on medium heat 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:07.520
 we follow in a salad bowl we must pour 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:09.139
 the amount injected the small asset and in 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.500
 besides must be whipping for step by step 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.500
 lumps 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.889
 it's very important not to have 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.330
 many in the dough 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.919
 it's very simple if you want a 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.860
 thick soup do not hesitate in 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.760
 put more if you want soup that is 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.410
 rather liquid 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.060
 what should be done is to remove 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.020
 flour finally put less of 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.020
 flour for example 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.080
 so after about half an hour of 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:59.379
 cooking I'm going to add peas 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:06:01.560
 chickpeas tomato sauce hair 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.560
 angel 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.460
 of course you have to mix well for not 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.039
 of that sticks against the bottom of the 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.360
 pan 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.090
 then add the flour dilute 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.710
 in water 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.250
 what I'm doing is I'm pouring the 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.680
 fine of elected officials who gradually 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.919
 that the decla soup really thick finally 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.330
 as soon as the texture of the soup appeals to me 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.000
 cart directly from pouring the 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.099
 flour deducted in water instead of 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.319
 pay more than a month have not I lose 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:39.889
 it's just a bit and at the same time I 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.889
 mix of course I leave on medium fire 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:47.460
 so here we commit we could not go 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:54.479
 well thick and still plays a master 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:57.960
 father and I mix I'm still in 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:00.930
 to be a little there we can see she 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.550
 got thicker so now I 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.030
 cook for about 10 minutes 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.919
 soup 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.860
 Of course, we must not leave 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:10.759
 overcook your soup over fire while 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:15.469
 simply you can chiche and wc 's 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:17.520
 to be overcooked they will be too pasty 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.560
 of course it's your soup is too much 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.029
 thick compared to what you 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.039
 wait it was not add a little 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:25.949
 more hot water and then you 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.150
 now the one already important if I 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.340
 know how to add hot water and 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.100
 do not have cold water 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.690
 so as soon as the soup is ready 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.900
 then add a little parsley 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:41.880
 mixed with a little coriander 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:45.110
