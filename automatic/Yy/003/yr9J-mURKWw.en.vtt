00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.789
 I would like to give you a tool here now 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 Imagine with them easily 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.389
 need 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 Cushions can top up all the usual 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.030
 browser can 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.750
 we are in case dlc 123 is building soon 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.030
 the 127th 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.380
 in the set there are once the 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.520
 syringe and the adapter to 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.140
 filling the syringe is recommended 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 little help to organize the ink 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.239
 then we can do that 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.760
 tidy up the ink 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.760
 in this case, we draw 30 milliliters 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.329
 then screw the adapter on the 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.329
 syringe on it firmly on it screw 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.090
 then we take the cartridge and there 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.440
 we have two openings like in the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.280
 description we take the top 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.000
 not the white but this one 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.080
 put the cartridge on the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.770
 table top put the adapter on it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.759
 grab with both fingers and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:30.520
 pull the piston upwards 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:32.860
 pulled and let go we wanted 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.340
 an instant then we pull the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 piston up again in the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 hold fast 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.390
 then we remove the adapter 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.760
 careful of the potato and the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.520
 cartridge is filled to the brim can be 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.860
 then in the case also good here in front 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 Detecting no more air is cartouche 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.250
 in that case, the cartridges have a chip 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.530
 on top 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.530
 we have a suprasetter fittingly for that 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:18.780
 quite simply, however, he has two 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:22.890
 leaderless for the cartridge 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.380
 consequently, so it push the disc 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.790
 whole on the reset he starts to 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.390
 flashing and we think so 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:38.010
 long until the led turns green and the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.980
 Cartridge is the rest of the type 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.570
 We can give her the bottle back 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.770
 Of course, then also from the syringe 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.200
 probably the whole thing with water 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.920
 dry up and can the next 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.920
 fill the colors
