you want enough so that you can cover
your<00:01:12.140> body<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.650> then<00:01:12.770> pretty<00:01:13.040> much<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.820> it

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
your body and then pretty much so it

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.970 
your body and then pretty much so it
takes<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.570> while<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.050> then<00:01:15.590> what<00:01:15.740> you're<00:01:15.860> gonna

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
takes a while and then what you're gonna

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.920 
takes a while and then what you're gonna
do<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.460> take<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.880> balloons<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.510> just<00:01:17.750> start

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
do is take the balloons and just start

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.469 
do is take the balloons and just start
taping<00:01:18.170> them<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.740> each<00:01:18.980> other<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.520> taping

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
taping them to each other and taping

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.690 
taping them to each other and taping
that<00:01:20.600> around<00:01:21.110> your<00:01:21.410> body<00:01:21.620> so<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.280> probably

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that around your body so it probably

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.890 
that around your body so it probably
makes<00:01:22.850> more<00:01:23.030> sense<00:01:23.300> if<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.540> just<00:01:23.690> watch<00:01:23.870> what

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
makes more sense if you just watch what

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.880 
makes more sense if you just watch what
I'm<00:01:24.200> doing<00:01:24.229> here

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
I'm doing here

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.800 
I'm doing here
