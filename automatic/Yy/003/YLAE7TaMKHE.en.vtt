cold and some getting warm water we're
going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.059> go<00:00:12.150> through<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> step<00:00:12.780> we're

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
going to go through a step we're

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.900 
going to go through a step we're
checking<00:00:13.590> through<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.400> end<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.700> month

many how long it took to get water warm
water<00:01:34.720> now<00:01:35.680> we<00:01:35.740> will<00:01:36.160> test<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:37.420> temperature

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
water now we will test the temperature

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.040 
water now we will test the temperature
of<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.170> water<00:01:38.610> holding<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.820> meter<00:01:40.060> by<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
front do not hold the shaft in any way

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.969 
front do not hold the shaft in any way
safer<00:01:44.050> for<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:45.130> shaft<00:01:45.430> we<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.470> will<00:01:47.470> register

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
safer for the shaft we is will register

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.170 
safer for the shaft we is will register
your<00:01:48.190> temperature<00:01:48.670> not<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.000> water

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
your temperature not the water

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.350 
your temperature not the water
temperature<00:01:49.660> so<00:01:50.350> hold<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.740> shaft<00:01:51.210> stick<00:01:52.210> it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
temperature so hold the shaft stick it

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.290 
temperature so hold the shaft stick it
into<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.690> water<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.470> watch<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.490> needle<00:01:58.000> go

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
into the water and watch the needle go

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.070 
into the water and watch the needle go
up<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.140> hundred<00:02:02.470> degrees<00:02:04.080> you

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
up there it is of a hundred degrees you

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.660 
up there it is of a hundred degrees you
don't<00:02:05.290> need<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.560> go<00:02:05.680> any<00:02:05.830> farther<00:02:06.130> than<00:02:06.340> that

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
don't need to go any farther than that

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.850 
don't need to go any farther than that
you<00:02:06.970> can<00:02:07.149> go<00:02:07.270> anywhere<00:02:07.300> between<00:02:07.750> 90<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.380> 100

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
you can go anywhere between 90 to 100

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.350 
you can go anywhere between 90 to 100
degrees<00:02:09.130> once<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.880> reaches<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.209> temperature

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
degrees once it reaches that temperature

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.530 
degrees once it reaches that temperature
just<00:02:11.020> write<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.350> down<00:02:12.360> record<00:02:13.360> your

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
just write it down record your

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.199 
just write it down record your
temperature<00:02:13.989> here<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.940> all<00:02:16.090> ready

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
temperature here so this is all ready

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.600 
temperature here so this is all ready
today<00:02:16.530> tomorrow<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:18.010> temperature<00:02:18.430> will<00:02:18.580> be
