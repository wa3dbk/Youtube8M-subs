hello and welcome to my review on
garry's<00:00:03.689> mod<00:00:03.720> 10<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:05.150> bought<00:00:06.150> garry's<00:00:06.450> mod<00:00:06.480> 10<00:00:06.839> a

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
garry's mod 10 I bought garry's mod 10 a

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.020 
garry's mod 10 I bought garry's mod 10 a
couple<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.200> weeks<00:00:07.350> ago<00:00:07.670> I've<00:00:08.670> been<00:00:08.790> messing

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
couple of weeks ago I've been messing

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.129 
couple of weeks ago I've been messing
around<00:00:09.210> with<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.630> then<00:00:10.410> if<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.860> mods<00:00:11.190> for<00:00:11.460> it

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
around with it then if you mods for it

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.690 
around with it then if you mods for it
and<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.380> far<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.920> quite<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> good<00:00:14.490> game

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and so far it's quite a good game

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.400 
and so far it's quite a good game
there's<00:00:15.660> no<00:00:15.929> real<00:00:16.260> gameplay<00:00:16.680> aspect<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.850> this

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
there's no real gameplay aspect to this

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.519 
there's no real gameplay aspect to this
game<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.740> play<00:00:20.279> well<00:00:20.939> dr.<00:00:21.900> kleiner<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:22.260> think

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
game you play well dr. kleiner i think

game you play well dr. kleiner i think
i'm<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.740> entirely<00:00:22.920> sure<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.939> then<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.990> just

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
i'm not entirely sure and then you just

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.250 
i'm not entirely sure and then you just
build<00:00:25.439> random<00:00:25.920> things<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.260> surprisingly

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
build random things and surprisingly

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.269 
build random things and surprisingly
it's<00:00:28.500> very<00:00:28.769> very<00:00:29.099> fun<00:00:29.750> you<00:00:30.750> make<00:00:31.619> things<00:00:31.949> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it's very very fun you make things that

can kill people and like people into

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.760 
can kill people and like people into
space<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:37.520> do<00:00:38.520> people<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.030> cannon<00:00:39.770> you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
space can do people out of a cannon you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.090 
space can do people out of a cannon you
can<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.790> g-man<00:00:42.239> into<00:00:42.510> some<00:00:42.690> weird<00:00:42.870> poses<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
can get g-man into some weird poses and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.150 
can get g-man into some weird poses and
making<00:00:45.059> drag<00:00:45.510> Alex<00:00:45.690> um<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> graphics<00:00:49.500> wise

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
making drag Alex um the graphics wise

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
making drag Alex um the graphics wise
it's<00:00:50.610> exactly<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> same<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.719> half-life<00:00:52.170> 2

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it's exactly the same as half-life 2

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
it's exactly the same as half-life 2
there's<00:00:53.070> no<00:00:53.579> real<00:00:53.879> differences<00:00:54.480> part<00:00:54.809> from

there's no real differences part from
the<00:00:55.020> physic<00:00:55.590> physics<00:00:56.309> gun<00:00:56.809> which<00:00:57.809> doesn't

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the physic physics gun which doesn't

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.279 
the physic physics gun which doesn't
really<00:00:58.770> matter<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.280> cuz<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.199> in

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
couldn't fill my computer because it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.010 
couldn't fill my computer because it
slows<00:01:33.780> down<00:01:33.929> my<00:01:34.170> computer<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.939> anyway

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
something put some melons in there and

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.100 
something put some melons in there and
then<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.140> say<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.250> really<00:01:53.580> you're<00:01:54.360> done<00:01:54.539> then

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
just hit the button that's allocated to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.389 
just hit the button that's allocated to
the<00:01:57.179> dynamite<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.229> melons<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.099> flying

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the dynamite in the melons go flying

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.370 
the dynamite in the melons go flying
into<00:01:59.610> whatever<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.539> point<00:02:01.080> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.229> matter

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.720 

so<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.320> score<00:02:06.740> gameplay<00:02:08.020> 10<00:02:09.020> really<00:02:09.560> because

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so a score gameplay 10 really because

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.880 
so a score gameplay 10 really because
well<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.810> can't<00:02:13.019> really<00:02:13.230> give<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.620> game<00:02:13.830> a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
well you can't really give this game a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.140 
well you can't really give this game a
score<00:02:14.420> because<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.730> not<00:02:17.879> really<00:02:18.120> a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
score because that it's not really a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.170 
score because that it's not really a
game<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.930> physics<00:02:19.709> sandbox<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:20.940> say

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
game it's a physics sandbox as they say

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.789 
game it's a physics sandbox as they say
and<00:02:22.010> even<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.610> little<00:02:24.319> video<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.680> on

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
and even in the little video you get on

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.009 
and even in the little video you get on
steam<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.819> even<00:02:27.030> shows<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.390> some<00:02:27.569> ways<00:02:27.750> how<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
steam it even shows you some ways how to

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.800 
steam it even shows you some ways how to
kill<00:02:28.349> dr.<00:02:28.950> Klein<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.580> people<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.450> then<00:02:30.720> he
