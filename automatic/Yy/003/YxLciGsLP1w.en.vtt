00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.020
 to reduce the number of over 250,000 wildlife accidents per year 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.529
 existing knowledge must be bundled 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:15.619
 in these violates how the ADAC clarify how high the endangerment of a 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.669
 Driver in a wildlife accident 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.329
 the accident opponent in the test is a capital deer of about 55 kilograms 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.099
 brings on the scales 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.129
 the danger is not only in its mass but also by the specific 

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.710
 the soft as a vehicle driver 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.440
 of course you should 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.400
 Traffic signs pay attention as already on the deer in but also interpret 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.340
 Special seasons are therefore responsible for that on Twitter 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.310
 This game will be particularly popular in the early and in the autumn 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.930
 and especially the early morning hours that is 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.740
 the hours of dusk or the evening hours if 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.680
 the sun slowly disappears again 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.610
 the impact speed will be in this test 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.990
 40k a hair worn 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 first the commission in real time 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 in slow motion you can see that the bonnet is the main task 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 depends and the animal is then whirled through the air 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 the decisive factor for the middle class under the vehicle 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.070
 recognizable from the driver's perspective 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.820
 Not dangerous close to the expenses of the windshield 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.860
 draw closer 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.750
 his passport there was only damage in the front area 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 the windshield has remained intact 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.960
 Of course, the speed of the vehicle also came here 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.799
 enormous energies that act on the vehicle you can see it from the 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.440
 Confirmation in car front area 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.850
 one can assume here from the loads that one 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.360
 here a deer with a weight of about 50 to 60 kilograms 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.100
 UD that to five times his own body weight here as energy in the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.250
 Vehicle front bring in the talk here of almost a ton 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.850
 which loads the vehicle 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.140
 In our particular case, there is the greatest danger for the driver here 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.039
 by 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.499
 the antlers of the beast that means that the antlers knees by the 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.029
 Windshield interior can bring 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.539
 a bigger radio plays, of course, also pose the danger here 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.789
 generally more direction the impact sound tend to that means that also 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.029
 if Koehler can penetrate the whole body of the fish 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.949
 the probability is very low 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.949
 and so you see that the danger 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.269
 Percent inmates here are relatively low 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.179
 This of course also the tip 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.759
 before you 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.519
 Steering maneuvers risked and occasionally with the Mac oncoming traffic 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.569
 happy to keep the track here and in case of need also an accident with one 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.809
 Just to accept picture 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.389
 but then the following should be noted 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.190
 after one 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.720
 Accident with a picture so it's very very important here first 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.960
 So what does that mean, then, without another one? 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.059
 Accident causes 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.709
 of course, the second thing to see here is the game 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.109
 and continue to inform the police or here 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.789
 to counter the responsible hunter 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.079
 and this wildlife accident
