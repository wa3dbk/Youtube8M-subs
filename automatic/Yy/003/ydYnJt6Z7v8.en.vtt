00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.529
 welcome to the Motorshow today with the sports offshoot of yes actually 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.460
 cruiser Ford Focus 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.360
 this time we were from Zurich to Lake Sempach 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.349
 our destination to the lake in the canton of Lucerne 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.079
 the abbreviation RS already adorns the very special since the sixties 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.649
 Ford models 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.100
 Incidentally, it is for Ferrari Sport with 90 hp that was all started 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.190
 today, this winged Focus RS is bolstered to 305's 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 This is certainly not environmentally correct but does not want this car 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.440
 not to be 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.829
 Quarrel out 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.640
 here comes the power as this dispute sounds like to do more 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.640
 every engine show 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.120
 the Ford Focus RS is at first glance a separate force despite having one 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.280
 Giant Maul 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 a local that per year 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 Entrup 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.840
 At second glance, this is a composite vehicle seating five 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.150
 large trunk as with any focus and where please give nice under 52 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.540
 a thousand francs over 300 hp that drives her well here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.900
 in 2q also 5 liter five-cylinder with turbocharging but please, please 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.900
 the power comes to the road only with front-wheel drive 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.440
 as long as it is dry it can be amazingly good thanks to the TV 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.689
 staring and specifically at the front axle construction 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.770
 Speaking of demand front tires, the HSV should but best compromise 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.640
 make sure they do not last long 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.370
 1 falls in this car because really hard to give it soft gas was 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.370
 that according to the information in 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 but now from quite sober the technical data 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.940
 in the Ford Focus he blows but there are 51 points 9 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.510
 Franken the test car costs including accessories 56 Thorsten 950 Francs he has 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.779
 2522 cubic centimeters of capacity 50 refused and makes 105 gates the St 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:25.309
 the spurt from zero to one hundred kilometers per hour takes 95 points 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.840
 The Boliden compact car has a maximum torque of 440 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:35.459
 Newton meters, according to the work, focus only averaged 9 2 0 4 liters per 100 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.239
 Kilometers and emits 225 grams of co2 per kilometer he reaches the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.239
 Energy efficiency category AP 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.649
 one way or the other is analog loss and of course has brought in the focus 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:57.169
 that 's just the heaviest focus for a number smaller round that approx 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.480
 Daniel Müller wants the slogans 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.419
 for console and let measure 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.909
 a brittle step is mounted 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.069
 Hey tree of fuel so pretty close to our discretion 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.340
 Leistungsmäßig Munich 15 first aid was provided by the day care center 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:14.740
 Court to land actually 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.030
 everything taken away or can you do anything at all 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.060
 Yatego Edward could be aired even in the village is still open 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.589
 it sounds like the sad one 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.630
 even more complicated 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.170
 Advance sale is still questionable how much of the progress as the injured 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.570
 optically and technically, October succeeds nicely or not at all 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.500
 Even Horst Seehofer has yet to be sold 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.799
 This should also be the case 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.200
 Volker Hauff from the okay that sounds now you can do a lot of Michna cosmetics 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.199
 we are watching sitting the performance on 4 comparison 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.609
 So the tuned Focus is from feeling - as good as the first 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:12.299
 he is "we see Hertha still the turbo speaks even more spontaneously but 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.819
 has been moved to the best 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.879
 about the statement 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.019
 Jörg Roth threatens therefore the greeting the chest is strengthened 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.259
 Since it needs very well from the previous quarter that I still with the 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.659
 Bestseller with advertising Stauber brings 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:32.069
 Melk with a big city around from sunday cool cool dove threatened with death 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.279
 even more volunteers were lost per unit 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.029
 Kirchhof himself position with which he is so well proven 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.029
 that still chances 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.789
 which was recently anyway 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.350
 Bergs RS Spyder it right cracker 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.790
 Both are about 300 guests 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.270
 only wonders that in the future still leads but years Zündorf 400 500th 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.300
 PS conceivable in a few years Blatter Worber on that was thanks to exemplary TV 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.510
 he mastered 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.710
 and not everyone needs only roughly estimate this bring for the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.360
 Preferences spaces and Kurdish people claim that I am at the moment 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.129
 Reading pace taken with a shovel 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.940
 to take 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.660
 ecological reason follows » 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.889
 I'm curious what comes out of it at Jürgen Schardt for me 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.409
 good accident-free ride on 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.409
 the judge 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.500
 This Focus RS is actually a real racing car 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.569
 but also honestly 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.550
 who is already on the closed track just like the SUVs 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.749
 Most of the large SUVs can be found in kindergartens and cafés 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.859
 or
