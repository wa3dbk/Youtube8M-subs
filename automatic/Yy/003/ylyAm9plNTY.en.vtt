rubber on the inside of it and it still
doesn't<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.230> meant<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.559> mounting

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
doesn't and this meant that mounting

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
doesn't and this meant that mounting
onto<00:01:02.399> anything<00:01:02.760> metal<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.629> almost

onto anything metal was almost

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
onto anything metal was almost
impossible<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> mount<00:01:05.160> would<00:01:05.369> move

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
impossible and the mount would move

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
impossible and the mount would move
around<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.630> crazy<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.680> would<00:01:07.799> overcome<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
around like crazy we would overcome this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
around like crazy we would overcome this
problem<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:08.790> using<00:01:08.820> parts<00:01:09.540> pieces<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> old

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

biking or two or something like that to
just<00:01:12.060> add<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.659> rubber<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
just add a little bit of rubber to the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.700 
just add a little bit of rubber to the

inside to counsel out that or to add

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
inside to counsel out that or to add
some<00:01:17.040> friction<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.520> mount<00:01:17.790> didn't<00:01:18.240> move

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
some friction to the mount didn't move

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.719 
some friction to the mount didn't move
around<00:01:18.659> too<00:01:18.900> much<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.890> these<00:01:20.070> new<00:01:20.280> pieces

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
around too much with these new pieces

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179 
around too much with these new pieces
you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:21.840> take<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:23.100> they

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you can actually take them and then they

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
you can actually take them and then they
have<00:01:23.340> these<00:01:23.460> rubber<00:01:23.729> knobs<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> top<00:01:25.259> which

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
have these rubber knobs at the top which

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
have these rubber knobs at the top which
jam<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> roll<00:01:27.030> bar<00:01:27.210> mount<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.720> into<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
jam into the roll bar mount or into the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.899 
jam into the roll bar mount or into the
handle<00:01:28.409> our<00:01:28.530> mounts<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.830> just<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
handle our mounts are just like this and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.600 
handle our mounts are just like this and
then<00:01:30.900> make<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.740> roll<00:01:31.979> bar<00:01:32.159> mount<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.490> your

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
then make your roll bar mount or your

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
then make your roll bar mount or your
handlebar<00:01:32.970> mount<00:01:33.150> way<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.930> secure<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
handlebar mount way more secure so you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
handlebar mount way more secure so you
start<00:01:34.890> by<00:01:34.920> wrapping<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> rubber<00:01:35.850> piece

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
start by wrapping the rubber piece

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
start by wrapping the rubber piece
around<00:01:36.689> whatever<00:01:37.229> you're<00:01:37.439> mounting<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
around whatever you're mounting on to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
around whatever you're mounting on to
and<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.850> make<00:01:39.030> sure<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.540> tight<00:01:39.750> around

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and you make sure that it's tight around

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.819 
and you make sure that it's tight around
there<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.380> handlebar

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
there and then you do up the handlebar

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
there and then you do up the handlebar
mount<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.549> other<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.090> cool<00:01:45.390> addition<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
mount the other really cool addition is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.950 
mount the other really cool addition is
the<00:01:46.710> thicker<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.299> any<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> have

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the thicker one now if any of you have

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.710 
the thicker one now if any of you have
tried<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> mount<00:01:49.860> your<00:01:50.369> handlebar<00:01:51.329> mounts<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
tried to mount your handlebar mounts to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
tried to mount your handlebar mounts to
the<00:01:51.979> pointy<00:01:52.979> end<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.189> your<00:01:53.310> ski<00:01:53.520> pole<00:01:53.759> what

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the pointy end of your ski pole what

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.210 
the pointy end of your ski pole what
you've<00:01:54.600> probably<00:01:54.869> found<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> doesn't

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
you've probably found is that it doesn't

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.859 
you've probably found is that it doesn't
actually<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.820> small<00:01:57.180> enough<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> good

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
actually go small enough to get a good

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.120 
actually go small enough to get a good
grip<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.320> could<00:01:58.470> overcome<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> by

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
grip now you could overcome this by

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
grip now you could overcome this by
wrapping<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.759> rubber<00:02:00.090> or<00:02:00.390> duct<00:02:00.869> tape<00:02:00.990> or

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
wrapping it in rubber or duct tape or

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.319 
wrapping it in rubber or duct tape or
something<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.000> new

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
something like that but with this new

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.600 
something like that but with this new
piece<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> insert<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.100> it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
piece that you can insert in here it

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.690 
piece that you can insert in here it
greatly<00:02:06.329> reduces<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.200> grip<00:02:07.710> size<00:02:08.070> of<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
greatly reduces the grip size of the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.969 
greatly reduces the grip size of the
diameter<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.470> handlebar<00:02:10.799> mount

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
diameter that be or the handlebar mount

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.010 
diameter that be or the handlebar mount
will<00:02:11.250> grip<00:02:11.489> onto<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.300> makes<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.720> small

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
will grip onto and it makes it small

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.860 
will grip onto and it makes it small
enough<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.650> grip<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.730> small<00:02:15.330> end<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
enough to grip on to the small end of a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.090 
enough to grip on to the small end of a
ski<00:02:16.140> pole

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
ski pole

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.990 
ski pole
that<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.490> super<00:02:18.180> super<00:02:18.990> cool<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.220> these<00:02:20.640> two

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that is super super cool so these two

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.600 
that is super super cool so these two
additions<00:02:21.480> are<00:02:21.690> huge<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.890> they<00:02:23.100> will<00:02:23.340> work

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
additions are huge and they will work

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.600 
additions are huge and they will work
with<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.000> old<00:02:24.950> handlebar<00:02:25.950> mount<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> an

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
with the old handlebar mount so the an

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.250 
with the old handlebar mount so the an
old<00:02:26.730> handlebar<00:02:27.060> mounts<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.600> same<00:02:27.930> two

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
old handlebar mounts have the same two

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.680 
old handlebar mounts have the same two
indents<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.490> has<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:30.420> means

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
indents that this one has which means

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.940 
indents that this one has which means
that<00:02:30.930> using<00:02:32.120> these<00:02:33.120> are<00:02:33.390> pieces<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.950> your

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
that using these are pieces with your

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.670 
that using these are pieces with your
old<00:02:35.400> handlebar<00:02:35.850> mount<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.210> still<00:02:36.810> possible

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
old handlebar mount is still possible

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.440 
old handlebar mount is still possible
the<00:02:38.220> addition<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.640> these<00:02:38.760> two<00:02:38.820> rubber<00:02:39.180> pieces

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the addition of these two rubber pieces

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.000 
the addition of these two rubber pieces
has<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.930> about<00:02:40.080> fixed<00:02:40.560> my<00:02:40.680> biggest

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
has just about fixed my biggest

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.770 
has just about fixed my biggest
complaint<00:02:41.610> about<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.090> hand<00:02:42.270> lower<00:02:42.450> mount<00:02:42.630> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
complaint about the hand lower mount and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.960 
complaint about the hand lower mount and
that<00:02:42.960> was<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.920> ability<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.640> mount<00:02:44.850> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
that was the ability for the mount to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.750 
that was the ability for the mount to
just<00:02:45.330> spin<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.230> move<00:02:46.680> when<00:02:47.250> mounted<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
just spin and move when mounted to a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.190 
just spin and move when mounted to a
bike<00:02:47.940> handlebars<00:02:48.450> if<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.720> put<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:48.990> on<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
bike handlebars if you put this on a

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.190 
bike handlebars if you put this on a
bike<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:50.190> would<00:02:50.340> most<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.910> time<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.330> fall<00:02:51.990> in

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
bike it would most the time just fall in

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.690 
bike it would most the time just fall in
your<00:02:52.320> camera<00:02:52.530> would<00:02:52.710> end<00:02:52.830> up<00:02:52.920> facing<00:02:53.310> down

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
your camera would end up facing down

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.210 
your camera would end up facing down
because<00:02:54.210> like<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.200> said<00:02:55.410> there's<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.130> was

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
because like I said there's just it was

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.890 
because like I said there's just it was
metal<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.640> plot<00:02:56.880> hard<00:02:57.120> plastic<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.630> there<00:02:57.810> was

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
metal on plot hard plastic and there was

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.900 
metal on plot hard plastic and there was
no<00:02:58.050> grip<00:02:58.320> there<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.740> we<00:02:59.430> had<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.580> do<00:02:59.640> some<00:02:59.790> with

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
no grip there so we had to do some with

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.460 
no grip there so we had to do some with
that<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.360> was<00:03:00.480> pretty<00:03:00.720> annoying<00:03:01.020> with

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that and that was pretty annoying with

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.200 
that and that was pretty annoying with
the<00:03:01.650> addition<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:01.980> these<00:03:02.070> two<00:03:02.250> pieces<00:03:02.460> they

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
the addition of these two pieces they

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.670 
the addition of these two pieces they
fixed<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.020> they've<00:03:04.140> also<00:03:04.320> fixed<00:03:04.620> my

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
fixed that and they've also fixed my

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.530 
fixed that and they've also fixed my
other<00:03:04.890> complaint<00:03:05.310> was<00:03:05.490> which<00:03:05.880> was<00:03:06.240> that<00:03:06.390> it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
other complaint was which was that it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.620 
other complaint was which was that it
did<00:03:06.690> not<00:03:06.720> work<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.830> end<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.340> ski<00:03:08.580> pole<00:03:08.630> so

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
did not work on the end of a ski pole so

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.810 
did not work on the end of a ski pole so
by<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.200> addition<00:03:10.740> of<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.010> piece<00:03:11.280> they<00:03:11.640> have

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
by the addition of this piece they have

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.270 
by the addition of this piece they have
made<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.030> possible<00:03:12.360> however<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.350> don't<00:03:14.010> feel

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
made that possible however I don't feel

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.060 
made that possible however I don't feel
that<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.670> GoPro<00:03:15.660> handlebar<00:03:16.560> mount<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
that the GoPro handlebar mount is a

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.220 
that the GoPro handlebar mount is a
critical<00:03:17.730> piece<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.060> gear<00:03:18.270> for<00:03:18.510> your<00:03:18.600> kit<00:03:18.900> if

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
critical piece of gear for your kit if

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.430 
critical piece of gear for your kit if
you<00:03:19.680> want<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.490> mount<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.330> bike<00:03:21.630> tubes<00:03:22.050> and

you want to mount on to bike tubes and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.950 
you want to mount on to bike tubes and
handlebars<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.580> bikes<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:24.240> is<00:03:24.450> definitely<00:03:24.810> a

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
handlebars of bikes this is definitely a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.890 
handlebars of bikes this is definitely a
valuable<00:03:25.350> mount<00:03:25.680> for<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.240> don't<00:03:27.360> think

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
valuable mount for you but I don't think

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.540 
valuable mount for you but I don't think
it's<00:03:28.140> something<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.680> every<00:03:29.130> person<00:03:29.160> who

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
it's something that every person who

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.360 
it's something that every person who
owns<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.880> GoPro<00:03:30.270> is<00:03:30.480> going<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.020> require<00:03:31.410> pole
