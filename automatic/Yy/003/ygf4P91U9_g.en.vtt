they are unsafe they are they are they

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.960 
they are unsafe they are they are they
can<00:01:48.000> lead<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.540> damaging<00:01:49.140> health<00:01:49.530> effects<00:01:50.130> now

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
can lead to damaging health effects now

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.330 
can lead to damaging health effects now
let's<00:01:51.509> look<00:01:51.689> into<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.470> first<00:01:53.159> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
let's look into some of them first of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.469 
let's look into some of them first of
all<00:01:53.520> you've<00:01:53.880> got<00:01:54.259> healthy<00:01:55.259> bacteria<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:56.130> your

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
all you've got healthy bacteria in your

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.410 
all you've got healthy bacteria in your
and<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.079> has<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.649> be<00:01:57.829> that<00:01:58.039> that<00:01:58.640> bacteria<00:01:59.180> has

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
and it has to be that that bacteria has

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.069 
and it has to be that that bacteria has
to<00:01:59.630> be<00:01:59.750> there<00:01:59.960> all<00:02:00.140> over<00:02:00.619> time<00:02:00.860> by<00:02:01.729> put<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.780> by

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
to be there all over time by put it by

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.889 
to be there all over time by put it by
doing<00:02:03.140> colonics<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.189> wash<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.610> aloud<00:02:04.939> another

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
doing colonics you wash it aloud another

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.690 
doing colonics you wash it aloud another
reason<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.409> people<00:02:06.679> experience<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.280> lot<00:02:07.549> of

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
reason is people experience a lot of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.839 
reason is people experience a lot of
discomfort<00:02:08.149> when<00:02:09.019> they<00:02:09.500> do<00:02:09.560> colonics<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.610> I

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
discomfort when they do colonics and I

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.880 
discomfort when they do colonics and I
myself<00:02:11.209> experienced<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.140> before<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.650> did

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
myself experienced it before I did

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.830
