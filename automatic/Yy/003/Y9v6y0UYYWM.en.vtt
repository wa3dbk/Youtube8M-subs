00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
did work and what I did was I really

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.380 
did work and what I did was I really
just<00:01:06.990> put<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.350> thought<00:01:07.590> into<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:09.180> made

just put some thought into it and I made

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
just put some thought into it and I made
a<00:01:09.420> list<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.930> things<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:11.010> are<00:01:11.460> traits

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a list of things that I think are traits

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.870 
a list of things that I think are traits
that<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.990> nursing<00:01:13.350> students<00:01:13.799> had<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.549> did

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that the nursing students had that did

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.070 
that the nursing students had that did
suck<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.420> does<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.229> Excel<00:01:16.530> sorry<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> first

suck so does it Excel sorry so the first
thing<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.400> did<00:01:20.640> was

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
thing that I think that they did was

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.539 
thing that I think that they did was
they<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.509> knew<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.070> were<00:01:23.130> going

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
they really knew what they were going

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.560 
they really knew what they were going
for<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:24.420> clearly<00:01:24.950> had<00:01:25.950> outlined<00:01:26.850> goals<00:01:27.270> I

knew<00:01:57.760> their<00:01:58.060> target<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.800> other<00:01:59.950> thing<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.430> um

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
knew their target the other thing is um

knew their target the other thing is um
that<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.720> this<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:02.920> my<00:02:03.250> personal<00:02:03.790> thing

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
that I this is just my personal thing

diet and I see decent because maybe you

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.590 
diet and I see decent because maybe you
really<00:02:10.450> can't<00:02:10.660> afford<00:02:11.700> organic<00:02:12.700> foods<00:02:13.030> or

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
really can't afford organic foods or

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.450 
really can't afford organic foods or
whatever<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.830> have<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.070> make<00:02:15.400> sure

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
whatever but you just have to make sure

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.780 
whatever but you just have to make sure
that<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.060> eat<00:02:16.770> intelligently<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.490> feed

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that you eat intelligently just feed

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.240 
that you eat intelligently just feed
your<00:02:18.910> body<00:02:19.150> what<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.540> needs<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:20.530> don't<00:02:20.860> over

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
your body what it needs but don't over

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.520 
your body what it needs but don't over
eat<00:02:21.459> over<00:02:21.940> eating<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.170> biggest

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
eat over eating is like the biggest

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.790 
eat over eating is like the biggest
killer<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.720> being<00:02:25.720> able<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.990> say<00:02:26.230> because<00:02:26.680> if

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
killer to being able to say because if

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.530 
killer to being able to say because if
you<00:02:26.980> have<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> ton<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.730> food<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.300> your<00:02:28.390> belly

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
you have a ton of food in your belly

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.470 
you have a ton of food in your belly
your<00:02:29.500> mind<00:02:29.890> cannot<00:02:30.400> focus<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:31.060> what<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.300> needs

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
your mind cannot focus on what it needs

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.600 
your mind cannot focus on what it needs
to<00:02:31.570> focus<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.050> because<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.590> has<00:02:32.770> no<00:02:33.070> blood<00:02:33.340> it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
to focus on because it has no blood it

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.390 
to focus on because it has no blood it
is<00:02:33.840> focusing<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:35.050> digesting<00:02:35.920> all<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.220> food

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
is focusing on digesting all that food

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.870 
is focusing on digesting all that food
in<00:02:36.430> there

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
in there

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.290 
in there
so<00:02:37.739> having<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.800> good<00:02:38.950> diet<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:40.060> think

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
so having a good diet is I think

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.580 
so having a good diet is I think
essential<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:42.580> other<00:02:42.700> thing<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:44.110> saw

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
essential the other thing is that I saw

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.280 
essential the other thing is that I saw
a<00:02:44.620> lot<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.890> them<00:02:45.190> say<00:02:45.700> no<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.690> things<00:02:46.870> that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
a lot of them say no to things that

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.840 
a lot of them say no to things that
we're<00:02:47.709> gonna<00:02:47.800> take<00:02:48.100> them<00:02:48.250> away<00:02:48.489> from<00:02:48.700> their

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
we're gonna take them away from their

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.790 
we're gonna take them away from their
goals<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.450> lot<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.910> nursing<00:02:51.910> students<00:02:52.270> are<00:02:52.800> from

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
goals a lot of nursing students are from

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.860 
goals a lot of nursing students are from
families<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.640> really<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.540> know<00:02:55.570> need

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
families that really have you know need

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.080 
families that really have you know need
a<00:02:55.900> lot<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.140> help<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.739> they<00:02:57.580> had<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.940> make

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
a lot of help and they had to make

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.060 
a lot of help and they had to make
intelligent<00:02:58.390> decisions<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:59.500> what<00:02:59.739> was<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
intelligent decisions on what was the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.949 
intelligent decisions on what was the
best<00:03:00.250> thing<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:00.519> them<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.630> best<00:03:01.810> thing

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
best thing for them and the best thing

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.770 
best thing for them and the best thing
for<00:03:01.989> their<00:03:02.260> family<00:03:02.620> ultimately<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:04.000> saying<00:03:04.480> no

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
for their family ultimately so saying no

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.520 
for their family ultimately so saying no
to<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.200> lot<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.440> things<00:03:06.299> was<00:03:07.299> probably<00:03:07.840> hard<00:03:08.410> for

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
to a lot of things was probably hard for

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.180 
to a lot of things was probably hard for
them<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:10.350> can<00:03:11.350> imagine<00:03:11.530> because<00:03:11.920> it's<00:03:11.950> really

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
them I can imagine because it's really

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.479 
them I can imagine because it's really
hard<00:03:12.459> for<00:03:12.519> me<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.820> say<00:03:13.150> no<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.690> lot<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.989> things

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
hard for me to say no to a lot of things

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.460 
hard for me to say no to a lot of things
but<00:03:15.489> they<00:03:15.700> did<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.030> because<00:03:16.360> they<00:03:16.900> knew<00:03:17.140> what

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
but they did it because they knew what

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.920 
but they did it because they knew what
their<00:03:17.620> goal<00:03:17.890> is

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
their goal is

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.530 
their goal is
another<00:03:19.930> thing<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.290> saw<00:03:20.560> was<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.299> think

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
another thing that I saw was and I think

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.390 
another thing that I saw was and I think
this<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.230> biggest<00:03:23.410> thing<00:03:23.620> they

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
this this is the biggest thing they

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.340 
this this is the biggest thing they
really<00:03:24.640> had<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> strong<00:03:25.360> connection<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.230> their

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
really had a strong connection to their

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.930 
really had a strong connection to their
creator<00:03:26.709> they<00:03:27.040> knew<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.580> was<00:03:27.760> their

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
creator they knew that this was their

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.820 
creator they knew that this was their
purpose<00:03:28.390> they<00:03:29.170> knew<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:29.650> was

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
purpose they knew that this was

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.710 
purpose they knew that this was
something<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.190> they<00:03:30.430> had<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.820> do<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.420> was

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
something that they had to do it was

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.570 
something that they had to do it was
driving<00:03:32.170> them<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.680> was<00:03:32.769> like<00:03:32.799> pulling<00:03:33.220> them

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
driving them it was like pulling them

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.150 
driving them it was like pulling them
towards<00:03:34.080> reaching<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.200> goal<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.799> they<00:03:36.010> just

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
towards reaching that goal and they just

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.699 
towards reaching that goal and they just
they<00:03:36.519> knew<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.269> this<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.140> what<00:03:38.260> they<00:03:38.410> had<00:03:38.560> to

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
they knew that this is what they had to

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.530 
they knew that this is what they had to
do<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.190> they<00:03:39.580> were<00:03:39.640> going<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.880> do<00:03:40.030> whatever<00:03:40.209> it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
do and they were going to do whatever it

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.860 
do and they were going to do whatever it
took<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.750> get<00:03:41.019> there<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:43.330> other<00:03:43.450> thing<00:03:43.750> and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
took to get there so the other thing and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.240 
took to get there so the other thing and
I<00:03:43.930> think<00:03:43.989> this<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.440> probably<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.040> most

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
I think this is probably the most

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.340 
I think this is probably the most
important<00:03:45.820> thing<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.239> see<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.900> that

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
important thing that I see is that

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.120 
important thing that I see is that
people<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.330> less<00:03:49.630> time<00:03:49.989> will<00:03:50.920> not

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
people that have less time will not

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
people that have less time will not
tolerate<00:03:52.410> being<00:03:53.410> around<00:03:53.650> people<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.459> are

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
tolerate being around people that are
