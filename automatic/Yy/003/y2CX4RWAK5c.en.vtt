00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
start with sections on a slight diagonal

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.090 
start with sections on a slight diagonal
at<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> front<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.560> we're<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.710> gonna<00:00:19.800> put<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
little bit of backcombing in the roots

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.980 
little bit of backcombing in the roots
as<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.740> I'm<00:00:25.859> literally<00:00:26.519> just

pushing the hair back on itself and then
spraying<00:00:33.260> each<00:00:34.260> section<00:00:35.750> quite<00:00:36.750> liberally

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
spraying each section quite liberally

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.060 
spraying each section quite liberally
with<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.380> hairspray<00:00:39.440> we're<00:00:40.440> gonna<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> same

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
with a hairspray we're gonna do the same

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.240 
with a hairspray we're gonna do the same
thing<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.270> other<00:00:42.300> side<00:00:45.890> when<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
thing on the other side when we get to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.310 
thing on the other side when we get to
the<00:00:47.370> crown<00:00:47.640> section<00:00:48.000> we're<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> start

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320

the the hair straight up at the crown

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
the the hair straight up at the crown
and<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:56.460> combing<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.329> lots

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and just back combing so we've got lots

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.110 
and just back combing so we've got lots
of<00:00:57.930> hold<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.980> lots<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.699> building

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
of hold there and lots of just building

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.279 
of hold there and lots of just building
up<00:01:00.210> lots<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.780> Heights

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
up lots of Heights

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.250 
up lots of Heights
that's<00:01:01.590> where<00:01:01.739> our<00:01:01.770> shapes<00:01:02.129> gonna<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.750> on<00:01:03.750> top

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that's where our shapes gonna be on top

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
that's where our shapes gonna be on top
which<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.530> taking<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> triangular<00:01:05.670> section

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
which is taking a triangular section

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.740 
which is taking a triangular section
quite<00:01:06.840> far<00:01:07.140> forward<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.240> back<00:01:09.240> combing<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
quite far forward and back combing that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
quite far forward and back combing that
as<00:01:09.930> well<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.340> height<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
as well just to get that height in the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.490 
as well just to get that height in the
crown

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.620 

coming<00:01:16.500> through<00:01:16.649> to<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.829> back<00:01:17.100> take<00:01:17.630> vertical

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
coming through to the back take vertical

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.100 
coming through to the back take vertical
sections<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.380> back<00:01:19.920> home<00:01:20.219> in<00:01:20.990> exactly<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
sections and back home in exactly the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
sections and back home in exactly the
same<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.710> did<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> sides<00:01:23.280> just

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
same way as we did the sides just

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
same way as we did the sides just
literally<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.990> fraction<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.680> backcombing<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
literally a fraction of backcombing in

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
literally a fraction of backcombing in
the<00:01:26.880> roots<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:28.110> bit<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the roots and a little bit on the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.700 
the roots and a little bit on the
Midlands<00:01:32.750> that's<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.899> main<00:01:34.079> shape<00:01:34.409> it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
Midlands that's the main shape it's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.139 
Midlands that's the main shape it's
really<00:01:35.039> important<00:01:35.399> to<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:35.970> back

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
really important to get all your back

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.999 
really important to get all your back
combing<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.689> first<00:01:36.990> before<00:01:37.289> you<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.740> anything

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
combing in first before you do anything

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.190 
combing in first before you do anything
so<00:01:38.850> we're<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.060> gonna<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.539> that<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.899> very

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so we're just gonna use that the very

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.249 
so we're just gonna use that the very
very<00:01:40.470> tip<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> brush<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.720> smooth<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
very tip of the brush just to smooth it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.130 
very tip of the brush just to smooth it
over<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.829> fraction<00:01:44.369> we're<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.329> take<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
over a fraction we're going to take the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.589 
over a fraction we're going to take the
half<00:01:46.619> section<00:01:47.099> at<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.459> and<00:01:47.759> some<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.539> the

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
half section at the back and some of the

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.779 
half section at the back and some of the
crown<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.619> using<00:01:49.770> our<00:01:50.009> hands<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.520> smooth

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789

crown I'm just using our hands to smooth
it<00:01:51.000> over<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:52.049> lace<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.819> we're<00:01:53.819> gonna<00:01:53.970> bring

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it over and to lace it we're gonna bring

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.210 
it over and to lace it we're gonna bring
that<00:01:54.450> back<00:01:54.869> down<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> downwards<00:01:56.099> direction

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
that back down in a downwards direction

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.760 
that back down in a downwards direction
towards<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.509> nape<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.750> her<00:01:58.049> neck<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.500> we're

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
towards the nape of her neck and we're

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.949 
towards the nape of her neck and we're
going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.950> twist<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.580> in<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.360> downwards

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
going to twist that in a downwards

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.320 
going to twist that in a downwards
direction<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:02.220> we've<00:02:02.429> got<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> nice<00:02:02.880> kind<00:02:03.209> of

direction so we've got a nice kind of

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.050 
direction so we've got a nice kind of
pleat<00:02:03.720> going<00:02:04.319> on<00:02:04.470> it's<00:02:05.009> always<00:02:05.220> just<00:02:05.429> pinching

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
pleat going on it's always just pinching

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the hair a little bit to pull it out so

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.699 
the hair a little bit to pull it out so
you've<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.940> kind<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.299> slightly

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
you've got that kind of slightly

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.490 
you've got that kind of slightly
disheveled<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.009> slept<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.090> feeling<00:02:12.630> take<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
disheveled and slept on feeling take the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.650 
disheveled and slept on feeling take the
pin<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:13.980> we're<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.390> pleat

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
pin and we're going to go into the pleat

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.520 
pin and we're going to go into the pleat
