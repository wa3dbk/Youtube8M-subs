 more herbs tasty per lesson and then the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.430
 most important you have to invest that from 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.830
 Jessie applies yes and so I also my 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.750
 symbols redness 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.730
 you've seen at another supermarket 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.720
 I think you can also get it 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.770
 fries on that can not photo but this 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 very 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.240
 and this also contains salt and pepper 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.810
 have to give there 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.020
 maud continued and all articles are entered 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.340
 cut slices and do so cut 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.140
 potato first in 3 equal parts or in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 four depending on how large earthen floor 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.270
 is but I can quite do it 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 contract is with around 3 parts 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.840
 then still in 4 parts you need final 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:14.940
 great spectacle so in segments earlier 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:17.430
 cloth through hell often so if you have 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.190
 all fries 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.170
 and you will do that with all apples until they 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.850
 are different and you can do much the same 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.530
 thickness determined but I think our LED is what 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.660
 thinner than they do also the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.730
 crispy I 'm going to suffer from the bus now 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.050
 for some olive oil 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.700
 the baking tin 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.870
 immediately call the potatoes that are ready 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.870
 with against 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.980
 alarm until you done horses 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.510
 left this is also reimbursed but if 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.299
 you have a large baking tins 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.150
 this is a very small hammer my eyes 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.970
 The large container again princip more but 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.700
 do it about it and up to well 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.180
 two three lie on each other no longer you 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:15.470
 don't need a whole paint and you still 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:18.590
 a little olive oil over for 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.959
 then the cells in 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.859
 and yes just do this on feeling I want 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.500
 quite finished 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:29.480
 I think it is so far the quantity 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.480
 patients who can think of problems 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:41.269
 over two teaspoons is for hefty 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:43.609
 teaspoon small woman again felt the 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.769
 for most clients as well as for 20 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.620
 call hold food over the lake as you 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.120
 does not like spicy food very small 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.359
 bit on i it about half a 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.359
 teaspoon 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:05.970
 what Karel was honest so much about me and me 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:08.100
 think about 3 4 teaspoons 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.140
 do this again to taste how death 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.420
 note rents one 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.420
 I did a lot and yes I love it 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.690
 and there will be herbs on it and 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.520
 you're about to get tired 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.260
 then I grab a spoon or a spatula and 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.940
 then consider how all the spices and oil 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.400
 they mix well together 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.350
 shaken with regret or spoon so that the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.940
 herbs are spread evenly everywhere 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.300
 award few drinks to you 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.550
 just make arrivals and be very poor 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.830
 needed and often add an extra now 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.810
 beads of everything because it still 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.200
 idea that just a little more almost all 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.580
 pasjes is ready so just here again 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.230
 nice and they see that i have a few 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.620
 packages are not yet doing herbs 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.380
 and then just more women but know 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.790
 sure the herbs are a bit 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.790
 You will see yourself get it when you do 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.030
 well i have the out on a twig well now 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.389
 seasoned 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.069
 so in the eyes or 32 degrees I have 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.759
 no patience myself so I have someone on the 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.169
 highest position 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.789
 if you just have a fries 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.749
 then you may even want to 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.009
 yourself up about doing a 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.539

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.120
 preheated that from handy to from 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.949
 So before doing so it does have the 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.289
 30 degrees they go into the oven 15 minutes 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.449
