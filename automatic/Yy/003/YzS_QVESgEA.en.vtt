answer<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.470> yes<00:01:56.030> with<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.390> mind<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
answer is yes with this in mind I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.929 
answer is yes with this in mind I
wondered<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.590> he<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.890> able<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.310> chain<00:01:59.700> two

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
wondered if he was able to chain two

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
wondered if he was able to chain two
empowered<00:02:00.420> autos<00:02:00.810> back-to-back<00:02:01.469> since<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
empowered autos back-to-back since it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
empowered autos back-to-back since it
looked<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.700> able<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.180> gain<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.689> bonus

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
looked like I was able to gain the bonus

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.539 
looked like I was able to gain the bonus
damage<00:02:04.110> even<00:02:04.530> when<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> cooldown<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
damage even when the cooldown on the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.270 
damage even when the cooldown on the
trade<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.909> over<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
trade was over and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.460 
trade was over and
again<00:02:07.640> yes<00:02:08.000> he<00:02:08.509> can<00:02:08.720> double<00:02:09.050> cast<00:02:09.259> an

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
again yes he can double cast an

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.010 
again yes he can double cast an
