first<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.990> gameloft<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.840> falsely

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
first or gameloft just you know falsely

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.090 
first or gameloft just you know falsely
advertised<00:01:34.350> i<00:01:34.530> guess<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.590> my<00:01:37.590> guess<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
advertised i guess so my guess is that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.280 
advertised i guess so my guess is that
since<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> games<00:01:38.909> come<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.720> mark<00:01:40.140> my

since the games come out like mark my

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.490 
since the games come out like mark my
pollination<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> teaser<00:01:43.110> trailer<00:01:43.350> was

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pollination and the teaser trailer was

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.170 
pollination and the teaser trailer was
august<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.799> fit<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.610> came<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.909> two<00:01:45.060> months

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
august one fit but i came out two months

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.310 
august one fit but i came out two months
later<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.140> october<00:01:46.890> 26<00:01:47.280> 12<00:01:47.759> 27<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.450> same<00:01:49.140> favor

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
later on october 26 12 27 and same favor

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.929 
later on october 26 12 27 and same favor
mother<00:01:49.500> come<00:01:49.649> by<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> came<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.220> late<00:01:50.490> october

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
mother come by to came out late october

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
mother come by to came out late october
but<00:01:51.090> her<00:01:51.390> trailer<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.810> released<00:01:51.840> october

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but her trailer was released october

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.580 
but her trailer was released october
19th<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.579> my<00:01:53.759> guess<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.600> monochrome<00:01:55.500> at

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
19th so my guess is that monochrome at

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.700 
19th so my guess is that monochrome at
four<00:01:55.829> will<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.250> released<00:01:56.520> two<00:01:57.259> months<00:01:58.259> after

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
four will be released two months after

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.170 
four will be released two months after
the<00:01:58.799> shader<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.430> sense<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> trailer
