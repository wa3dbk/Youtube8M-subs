00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.199
 the crazy boy who party rice 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.730
 you must have realized that now 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.289
 the chefs confectioners are investing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.480
 in a new type of cake 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.850
 they are making too many nickels or 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.340
 peeled buns that are paulo without pasta 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 without those applications all 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 they are silly as the dough becomes apparent 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.730
 and the stuffing we also visited 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 diego lozano confectionery school 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.469
 To watch boss making cake and now 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.500
 Our idea is that I reproduce the cake 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.600
 here to get me some better some 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 tips to make a make how is the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.620
 people have to prepare the dough as it is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 that you have to prepare the filling with my 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.489
 mind you make a dough that has a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.430
 good afternoon structure people usually 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.320
 another of the points that loaf of bread in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 followed as a goal that got full 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.900
 Relative has quite full is legal to 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.180
 use of full child and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.430
 consistency in the case here I would say 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.689
 bitter chocolate ganache and for the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 people who use it a lot 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.770
 Then I worked with 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.270
 fruits that blend well with chocolate and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.850
 has none because in the theoretical tests 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.180
 I think I like the Brazilian and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.340
 reached the house in the heart without increasing 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.530
 I certainly think that it has already existed there 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.890
 some nice time and what now? 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.799
 is resuming think right logical event 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.509
 No, people do not go back into fashion. 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.869
 the man most often again 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.869
 all 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.050
 everything is good to do at home that you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.820
 give me 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.710
 I think if you are afraid in the mind of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.800
 to make more than one story more than one 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.560
 What do you do for the journey and grow up? 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.830
 How did I get a practice? 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.290
 better then make a cut that on the hour 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.600
 who cut the cake port equally to the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.670
 layers did not fall filling not spreading 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.670
 strong and then follow you have to climb 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.240
 The cake is ready. It's kind of small. 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.370
 huh 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.570
 but what if he was hospitalized 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 juicy 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.880
 but this is the conclusion is that if you 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.000
 is to put a make with your 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.590
 wedding and the birthday assad you asked for 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.310
 the chef confectioner make what is more 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.310
 guaranteed
