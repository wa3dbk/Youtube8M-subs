00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello guys promised to show one more 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.500
 way to build shank both shutters 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:20.630
 let's see for this us 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 I will need 3 I look sat myself 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.600
 like a wedge 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.529
 it was a hell forged valve but I have 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.949
 become not like therefore for a long time 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 lying just now will be to us our 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.579
 test sample also 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 the second part this will serve 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.850
 build-up shank cut off from this 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 same valve for let's say other blade 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.789
 you can use any steel 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 suitable for which you have availability 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:00.660
 either a stainless steel of some kind or maybe 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.229
 ordinary steel at your discretion and here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.229
 just fit in thickness so 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.299
 cut off a piece of it further to us 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.790
 need 2 nakladochka 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.509
 my case is 2 stainless steel thick 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 these overlays 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.470
 one pad should be half 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.320
 thickness of stripes linochka here on and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.090
 accordingly some riveting in my 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.090
 case, these are the m3 screws 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:42.270
 usually cog 3 will use it 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.009
 like a rivet that's all in principle this 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.009
 I put the whole thing together 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:50.969
 that's all we got here is 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:54.060
 connections on the buttons let's 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:59.510
 Now let's see what it can do something 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:04.200
 there is such a way now bend 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.109
 do a little bit like this 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.510
 way to bend it somehow break it 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:16.069
 generally unrealistic let's see 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.069
 side loads now here i bend 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:28.530
 I managed to bend myself 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:33.299
 plate she's bad knee that's how you see 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:36.959
 nothing threatens the connection itself 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.349
 let's look out and brought another 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.349
 the side 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 Now in this way as you can see on 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.180
 the very joint 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:04:15.880
 not even deformation the other side to 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:39.100
 you are not them now let's give a little more 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:41.670
 camera putting at a different angle so here 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.670
 so here should 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:09.870
 see the junction held on like this 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:14.900
 no backlash did not appear 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.900
 try to return it in the opposite direction 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:48.469
 approximately exactly you are such 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:52.330
 so here it all look now 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:55.389
 bent here is this tip 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.520
 as you can see, but these ends are better left 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.490
 not very long 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.879
 so that they do not perceive themselves extra 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:08.259
 load from this side where 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:14.530
 short no deformation but how 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:18.969
 we see them if we consider that this one is worth 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:21.939
 we will have a conscience 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:27.099
 somewhere here so here we will have a handle 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:30.389
 nothing comes to him here 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:34.300
 happen he can handle any load 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:37.569
 which you give him to him soon 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.569
 the blade will break than it will break 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.199
 This one here is all I wanted. 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:46.810
 to show 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:49.090
 Thank you for your attention and still a little 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:55.180
 afterword I want to still break and 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:57.719
 this joint let's see if i can 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.719
 do this 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:30.820
 what can I say 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:35.560
 he broke off as he had intended 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:39.160
 weak spot on the hole here but 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.680
 because as I said this is part of 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.200
 we will be in the hilt 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:53.560
 that is, our arms will stick up 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:57.150
 and here here and here these all parts are not 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.680
 will be exposed to the maximum moment 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.070
 since we will not have more 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.800
 cross section due to the arms than the blade itself 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:06.460
 the blade will break rather than fall away 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.360
 handle 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:14.400
 With this connection , now for sure 

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.400
 thank you all, bye
