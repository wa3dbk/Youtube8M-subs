 was still in use until a few years ago 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 a species with the pacific rattlesnake 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.510
 her habitat is the same 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.510
 in the west of the us to canada in the north 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.680

 Every year, about 900 people fall 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.039
 the sacrifice the chains is enough 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.720
 Widely used and the size varies 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.250
 depending on the country between 09 and 1.85 meters 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.490

 Cambodia Laos Thailand and Vietnam 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.860
 is common for man is one 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.450
 bit life threatening is dangerous 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.689
 especially for work on rice fields 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.829

 eleventh place occupies the sender's interest 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.720
 we become the globe and in all 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.650
 africa israel and saudi arabia 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.020

 the snakes can be between 30 and 100 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.280
 cm long one to snake this one 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.220
 should be especially painful 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.470
 we reach the top-10 this place 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.180
 occupies the so-called booms lay like 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.990

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.520
 is known 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.710
 she keeps herself mainly in the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.180
 tropical areas of africa on the poison 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.189
 it is quite dangerous but the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.890
 so far very shy and goes to the people 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.100
 usually out of the way the ninth 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.960
 platz occupies the attractive bruni the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.219
 mainly in southern Africa to be 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.259
 find the snake is 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.530

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.739
 cm 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.360
 that gives her pretty strong 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.269
 however, human serpent usually 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.040
 not to sacrifice while one is only very 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.500
 little poison is released 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.269
 on place 8 is the Arabic 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.760
 continues to honor the largely in the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.590
 In Central Africa, that is what it is 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.390
 poison is quite poisonous, however, this is 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.810
 snake on average only 44 to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.700
 a maximum of 75 cm big the ticker 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 rattlesnake takes seventh place 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.140
 this list you will find it 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.280
 mainly in the sonoran desert in the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.870
 usa and mexico 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.180
 the ticker body is snakes 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.579
 lives on average 80 centimeters tall 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.140
 dry and rocky areas produced 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.900
 but only a very small dose of 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.120
 poisones sixth place occupies the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.040
 Eastern brown snake the australia 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.209
 and New Guinea lives it belongs to the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.950
 Giften part and average 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.989
 one and a half meters long 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.730
 however, the maximum length became full 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.370
 Measured 24 meters 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.590
 we reach the top 5 your place 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.450
 the Filipino cobra takes the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.250
 again at that time already says only 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.230
 is found in the Philippines 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.870
 usually it reaches a length 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.639
 from one and a half to 16 meters 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.780
 but sometimes it can also be up to two 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:23.120
 meter will be big on four seats 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.150
 bungalows terol eos also as indian 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.889
 create known up to 175 meters 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.989
 long pole mainly stays in the 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.579
 Indian jungle on these snakes 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.260
 is especially dangerous in humans 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.030
 Often they were not bitten after being bitten 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.109
 feel pain and therefore in 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.180
 think safety 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.970
 If left untreated, the sterol rate is lower 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.709
 one yet at 70 to 80 percent 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.959
 third place went to Chinese 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.209
 nose notter the mainly in china 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.549
 but also Taiwan and Vietnam at home 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.709
 she is with typically 13 to 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.209
 maximum 16 meters long and six 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.669
 Cubs are already producing that 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.319
 extremely dangerous poison the Chinese 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.000
 nose notter is also that one 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.530
 garden and hides 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.340
 for example, under boards or 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.620
 cough up 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.419
 in second place is the motive 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.760
 rattlesnake in the southwest of the usa 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.819
 is common and between under one 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.989
 meter and up to 13 meters tall that will be 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.940
 script of these snakes now extremely 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.459
 Interestingly enough, interestingly enough 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.389
 Deaths rarely occur because the antidote is wide 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.130
 is available 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.019
 the most poisonous snake is the taipan 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.930
 is therefore the first place this 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.820
 list 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.070
 The taipan is mainly found 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.320
 in australia and papua new guinea 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.580
 The snake grows up to two meters tall 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.770
 and that is the case 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.690
 luckily it happens 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.669
 rare to know because the Japanese shy 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.380
 is people are only then attacked 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.900
 when the snake feels threatened 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.820
 or surprise is untreated end 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.919
 of the most lethal symptoms begin 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.360
 with nausea and vomiting 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.090
 then there is such a paralysis of 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.400
 Musculature to the respiratory arrest 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.139
 those were the 15 poisonous snakes 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.479
 the world i hope this period of 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.070
