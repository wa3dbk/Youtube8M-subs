00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.179
 summer sun adventure is the vw bus 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 for decades a guarantee for beautiful 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.960
 excursions with family and friends 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.179
 Volkswagen has been offering it for exactly ten years 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.970
 the camping model california too 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.310
 directly from the factory 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.769
 recently there ran the 50 thousandth of the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.320
 band the small anniversary we take 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.050
 occasion and the t5 california times out 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.050
 to look at different perspectives 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.690
 I have it a bit today 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.269
 made more convenient and do not test how 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.670
 otherwise a normal car but usual 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.100
 a camping car and the vw-bus 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.149
 california and what that can do in detail 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.860
 let's take a closer look today 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.260
 Every good adventure starts with one 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.879
 ride to exciting places lived 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.949
 clearly arranged are buttons and switches 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.430
 and make the service a children's game 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.750
 the seat covers are cheerful patterned 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.640
 and create a good mood 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.619
 Five people can be in this 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.220
 California in the beach equipment 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.929
 ride 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.380
 the place in the back seat is more than 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.880
 generous and not only there 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.500
 and in fact up here in california 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.539
 it is comfortable I am on the second 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.140
 floor where loose two persons place 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.060
 to have 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.470
 and if you have to then have determined here 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.210
 also another child place 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 otherwise there is more below 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.369
 Sleeps and how the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.649
 are constructed 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.909
 that was next we test 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.459

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.459
 take out 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.289
 to pull the seat forward 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:50.570
 then you can go back up the back seat 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:56.350
 make as a whole bed and to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.350
 Good last spread the mattress 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.869

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.690
 web storage for luggage 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.910
 even if you do a bit during the day 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.380
 You wanted to be able to sleep that heat 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.300
 Do not darken by going up here 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.090

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.470
 Both sides have power down here 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.630
 the possibility of the windows 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.800
 accordingly darken and of course 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.900
 we have the front here too 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.220
 possibility to darken everything because lead 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.080
 we here in this bag the curtains 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.790
 the best part is the pages 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.320
 curtains are fixed with a magnet 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.780
 so that you do not have to wait long 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.010
 thread must but directly a good 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.920
 Result gets changed

 four diesel and two gasoline vw has for 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.670
 Depending on the california beach on offer 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.310

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.590
 cheapest version comes with the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.500
 two liter tdi and 62 kw therefore and costs 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.500
 in germany 38 1600 euro 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.510
 the california unfolds to 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.640
 real space miracles when daytime 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.799
 you can not use the coal at the top 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.650
 The roof can fold up and can 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.940
 even stand comfortably in here 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.709
 Of course, this only works on the outside 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.060
 getting in are sensible but doing so 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.819
 all things here are hidden 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.220
 The table is for outdoor as well 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.909
 Also suitable for thirds in there 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.620
 if I place two legs and 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:41.909
 then here these holders fold out 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:48.180
 then you can have the table here on mine 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:49.859
 Threading the left side and then you can 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.620
 here breakfast lunch here 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.629
 dinner or playing cards and when 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.709
 you want them to can get a 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.260
 push the table forward 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.230
 you can comfortably place the vehicle here 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.030
 to leave 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.109
 at vw california is the love 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.299
 simply in detail 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.549
 we have a table inside 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.349
 and it works out there 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.599
 Of course, it only makes sense if we do not 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.620
 but have to expand 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:19.079
 here in the case two wonderful 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.349
 Folding chairs hidden in the tailgate 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.349
 to have 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.350
 and with that I come to my conclusion 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.509
 wonderful car for a short 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.850
 it's for me personally 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.560
 a long camping trip then 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.240
 a bit too small, even if you have the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.580
 short camping trip has in mind 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.780
 he also relatively expensive and therefore 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.960
 I want to see if I can see him 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.490
 at some point can borrow somewhere 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.500
 However, who cares for the california 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.130
 Decide often gives a bond for 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.979
 live in 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.410
 for whom the comfort is sufficient 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.410
 many expect many adventures
