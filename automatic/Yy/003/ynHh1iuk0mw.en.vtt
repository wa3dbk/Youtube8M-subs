00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:15.230
 this project began more as a 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.950
 hobby to motivate me drew all 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.940
 day and make dogs draw in 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.960
 animals 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.360
 everyone is already great fun 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.990
 So that's what I ended up taking the whole 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.210
 To do what you like dog 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.059
 my intention with the dogs she 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.809
 do something very fast will do 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.379
 paintings intense but who could make me 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:47.409
 train a lot of probe advice 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.409
 colors in a more simplified way 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:59.200
 - by surrealism is one more thing 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.090
 uncompromised even with a goal 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.220
 daily and as I like these 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.500
 drawings on facebook have a lot of 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 staff until several people 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.650
 asked for every time that mutts 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.800
 may have reasons that had to draw 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.590
 dog poo brunet and there that 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.300
 started the second part in the plan and I 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 I contacted the morale of staff 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.940
 of the animals and asked if it could be up to 200 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.060
 dogs if you do not pay anything 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.220
 idea and began to help 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.700
 select which dogs 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.509
 I 'll be drawing based on what 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.040
 the owner of the animals are here and all 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.250
 What he did was a really cool thing. 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.070
 accompanying and after having achieved 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.530
 a considerable number of illustrations 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.509
 I decided to close a publication these 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.390
 guys and it will get 44 page format 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.300
 of 25/21 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.350
 is what will be of good quality and 120 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.050
 grams so the one for printing has 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.060
 that two colored pages and ten more 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:13.150
 pages of studies and sketches and once 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.060
 that the goal of catharsis was achieved 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.430
 part of the money raised will be 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.709
 converted for the purchase of 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.700
 dogs and cats for the love of the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.590
 bugs 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.110
 so I hope people can 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.569
 to be contributing already knowing that you 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.980
 will take the quality material and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.670
 will be helping several 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.350
 keep them until they can 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.900
 find definitive gifts in check 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.110
 the rewards even have several 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.690
 different things different things that 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.900
 to vote by offering among them 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.410
 original designs and for those who can not 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.140
 contribute financially 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.940
 It's okay, what you can do is 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.610
 share this video 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.040
 It will be a great help so that's it. 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:08.060
 help in any way you can. 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:27.520
 and work again 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:27.520
 Ok, and checking the options in 2006
