okay<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.470> first<00:01:17.650> thing<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.040> did<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:19.240> to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
okay so the first thing I did was to

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.690 
okay so the first thing I did was to
mount<00:01:19.900> up<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.410> new<00:01:20.590> sprocket<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.400> Alpha

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
mount up the new sprocket on the Alpha

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.390 
mount up the new sprocket on the Alpha
hub<00:01:22.000> again<00:01:22.720> with<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.170> new<00:01:23.290> clip<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.800> is<00:01:24.100> the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
hub again with a new clip this is the

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.360 
hub again with a new clip this is the
SGS<00:01:25.150> 500<00:01:26.080> it's<00:01:26.200> underlined<00:01:26.650> which<00:01:26.950> just<00:01:27.190> means

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
SGS 500 it's underlined which just means

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.590 
SGS 500 it's underlined which just means
it<00:01:27.520> has<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.790> three<00:01:28.030> internal<00:01:28.330> roller

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
it has the three internal roller

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.380 
it has the three internal roller
bearings<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:29.920> as<00:01:30.160> you<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.370> see<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:31.240> actually

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
bearings so as you can see it actually

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.140 
bearings so as you can see it actually
looks<00:01:31.720> like<00:01:31.900> it's<00:01:32.230> tracking<00:01:32.680> quite<00:01:32.980> well<00:01:33.220> if

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
looks like it's tracking quite well if

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.480 
looks like it's tracking quite well if
you<00:01:34.270> keep<00:01:34.510> your<00:01:34.630> eye<00:01:34.690> on<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:35.590> kind<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.370> the

from<00:01:46.450> gates<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.050> seemed<00:01:47.230> to<00:01:47.260> work<00:01:47.410> quite

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
from gates and it seemed to work quite

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.430 
from gates and it seemed to work quite
well<00:01:48.600> fortunately<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.750> didn't<00:01:50.080> have<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.290> make

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
well fortunately I didn't have to make

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.620 
well fortunately I didn't have to make
any<00:01:50.680> adjustments<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:52.120> side<00:01:52.360> Drive

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
any adjustments to the right side Drive

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.050 
any adjustments to the right side Drive
arm<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.410> sprocket<00:01:53.920> or<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.760> bottom<00:01:55.000> bracket

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
arm the sprocket or the bottom bracket

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.810 
arm the sprocket or the bottom bracket
if<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:56.530> did<00:01:56.740> find<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:57.310> alignment<00:01:57.700> was

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
if you did find that the alignment was

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.160 
if you did find that the alignment was
off<00:01:58.000> there's<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.540> couple<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.840> things<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:59.110> you

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
off there's a couple of things that you

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.930 
off there's a couple of things that you
can<00:01:59.320> do<00:01:59.470> well<00:01:59.830> first<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.430> all<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.610> issue<00:02:00.729> is

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
can do well first of all the issue is

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.490 
can do well first of all the issue is
that<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.210> internal<00:02:01.510> hub<00:02:01.720> no<00:02:02.020> longer<00:02:02.320> has<00:02:02.470> any

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
that the internal hub no longer has any

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.750 
that the internal hub no longer has any
adjustment<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:03.250> can't<00:02:03.430> get<00:02:03.550> stick<00:02:03.729> a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
adjustment like you can't get stick a

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.790 
adjustment like you can't get stick a
spacer<00:02:04.120> in<00:02:04.270> there<00:02:04.330> for<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.690> sprocket<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.260> the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
spacer in there for the sprocket and the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.840 
spacer in there for the sprocket and the
thought<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.010> is<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.340> might<00:02:06.460> sit<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.760> little

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
thought that is that might sit a little

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.030 
thought that is that might sit a little
bit<00:02:06.970> too<00:02:07.210> far<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:08.020> since<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.709> can't<00:02:08.920> make

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
bit too far in and since you can't make

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.980 
bit too far in and since you can't make
adjustments<00:02:09.490> back<00:02:09.640> here<00:02:10.030> you've<00:02:10.630> got<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.899> make

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
adjustments back here you've got to make

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.010 
adjustments back here you've got to make
all<00:02:11.140> your<00:02:11.200> adjustments<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.490> sprocket

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
all your adjustments up on the sprocket

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.650 
all your adjustments up on the sprocket
so<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:15.070> happens<00:02:15.520> what<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.940> can<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.270> is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
so if that happens what you can do is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.390 
so if that happens what you can do is
you<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.350> pull<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> right-side<00:02:18.010> drive<00:02:18.130> arm

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
you can pull the right-side drive arm

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.850 
you can pull the right-side drive arm
off<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.880> then<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:19.930> put<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.140> back<00:02:20.350> on<00:02:20.620> and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
off and then you can put it back on and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.150 
off and then you can put it back on and
then<00:02:21.120> screw<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.180> down<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.739> tighten<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
then screw it down and tighten it and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.370 
then screw it down and tighten it and
see<00:02:24.310> if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.459> can<00:02:24.610> get<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:25.030> recede<00:02:25.690> farther

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
see if you can get it to recede farther

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.770 
see if you can get it to recede farther
on<00:02:26.560> then<00:02:27.130> when<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.880> was<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.120> -<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.360> first<00:02:28.570> time

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
on then when it was on - the first time

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.290 
on then when it was on - the first time
and<00:02:28.989> they<00:02:29.170> say<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.850> give<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.180> good

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
and they say that if you give it a good

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.360 
and they say that if you give it a good
turn<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.870> pick<00:02:31.989> up<00:02:32.110> maybe<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:33.070> one

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
turn you can pick up maybe one to one

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.100 
turn you can pick up maybe one to one
and<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.550> half<00:02:33.580> millimeters<00:02:34.300> which<00:02:34.660> should<00:02:34.959> help

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and a half millimeters which should help

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.870 
and a half millimeters which should help
give<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.620> line<00:02:35.860> up<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.340> need<00:02:36.550> and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
give you the line up that you need and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.449 
give you the line up that you need and
without<00:02:37.720> having<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.260> into<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.160> bottom

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
without having to get into the bottom

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.850 
without having to get into the bottom
bracket<00:02:39.550> into<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.480> bottom<00:02:41.290> bracket<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.709> make

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
bracket into the bottom bracket to make

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.660 
bracket into the bottom bracket to make
adjustments<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.400> bring<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:44.459> okay<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.519> I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
adjustments to bring it in okay so I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.860 
adjustments to bring it in okay so I
went<00:02:45.790> ahead<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.120> laced<00:02:46.239> up<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.570> will<00:02:46.750> this

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
went ahead and laced up this will this

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.540 
went ahead and laced up this will this
is<00:02:47.019> my<00:02:47.050> first<00:02:47.440> time<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.920> used<00:02:48.220> Sheldon

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
is my first time I just used Sheldon

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.370 
is my first time I just used Sheldon
Browns<00:02:48.700> wheel<00:02:48.910> building<00:02:49.269> site<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.230> took

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
Browns wheel building site and took

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.110 
Browns wheel building site and took
about<00:02:50.530> an<00:02:50.620> hour<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> half<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.910> look

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
about an hour and a half so if you look

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.970 
about an hour and a half so if you look
the<00:02:52.510> rim<00:02:52.750> typically<00:02:53.380> comes<00:02:53.560> with<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.830> right

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
the rim typically comes with the right

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.070 
the rim typically comes with the right
hand<00:02:54.220> left<00:02:54.430> hand<00:02:54.610> drill<00:02:54.940> hole<00:02:55.120> alternating

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
hand left hand drill hole alternating

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.680 
hand left hand drill hole alternating
for<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> for<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.890> spoken<00:02:57.310> Impuls<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.910> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
for the for the spoken Impuls and the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.000 
for the for the spoken Impuls and the
best<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.989> could<00:02:59.050> tell<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.530> bike<00:02:59.769> they

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
best I could tell on this bike they

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.530 
best I could tell on this bike they
looked<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.489> they're<00:03:00.670> almost<00:03:01.120> dead<00:03:01.300> center

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
looked like they're almost dead center

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.240 
looked like they're almost dead center
down<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.110> drill<00:03:02.500> down<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.920> middle<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.190> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
down the drill down the middle of the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.940 
down the drill down the middle of the
load<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.580> wheel<00:03:03.760> line<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.720> my<00:03:05.080> best<00:03:05.260> guess<00:03:05.380> if

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
load the wheel line but my best guess if

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.170 
load the wheel line but my best guess if
you<00:03:06.040> look<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.519> can<00:03:06.640> double<00:03:06.880> check<00:03:06.940> on

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
you look at and you can double check on

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.640 
you look at and you can double check on
your<00:03:07.300> measurements<00:03:07.750> was<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:07.989> this<00:03:08.170> second

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
your measurements was that this second

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.280 
your measurements was that this second
hole<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.370> skip<00:03:09.640> one<00:03:09.910> this<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.870> second<00:03:11.200> hole

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
hole so skip one this is the second hole

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.250 
hole so skip one this is the second hole
again<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.890> first<00:03:12.160> right<00:03:12.670> hand<00:03:12.850> drill<00:03:13.269> so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
again is the first right hand drill so

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.140 
again is the first right hand drill so
if<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.560> look<00:03:14.709> at<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.790> where<00:03:16.030> you'd

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
if you look at this this is where you'd

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.820 
if you look at this this is where you'd
start<00:03:16.330> your<00:03:16.660> will<00:03:16.840> building<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.440> take<00:03:17.650> this

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
start your will building you take this

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.770 
start your will building you take this
up<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.250> then<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.880> first<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:19.330> runs<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.660> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
up and then this first one runs to the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.750 
up and then this first one runs to the
inside<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.500> hub<00:03:20.680> flange<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.519> little

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
inside of the hub flange so the little

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.789 
inside of the hub flange so the little
you<00:03:22.030> know<00:03:22.150> flat<00:03:22.540> head<00:03:22.930> part<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.380> sticking<00:03:23.739> out

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
you know flat head part is sticking out

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.259 
you know flat head part is sticking out
on<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.010> outside<00:03:24.310> again<00:03:24.489> stops<00:03:24.880> back<00:03:25.090> right

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
on the outside again stops back right

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.699 
on the outside again stops back right
here<00:03:27.329> okay<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.359> I<00:03:28.540> put<00:03:28.570> about<00:03:28.870> 50<00:03:29.230> miles<00:03:29.410> on

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
here okay so I put about 50 miles on

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.000 
here okay so I put about 50 miles on
this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
this

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.100 
this
Hubbs<00:03:30.430> since<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.909> first<00:03:31.120> laced<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.810> it's

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
Hubbs since I first laced it and it's

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.140 
Hubbs since I first laced it and it's
going<00:03:32.349> it's<00:03:32.799> just<00:03:32.920> awesome<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.670> think

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
going it's just awesome I think

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.550 
going it's just awesome I think
everybody<00:03:34.450> will<00:03:34.569> really<00:03:34.659> enjoy<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:35.170> couple

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
everybody will really enjoy a couple

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.860 
everybody will really enjoy a couple
things<00:03:35.739> I<00:03:35.920> learned<00:03:36.189> this<00:03:36.489> rear<00:03:36.909> tooth<00:03:37.269> setup

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
things I learned this rear tooth setup

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.460 
things I learned this rear tooth setup
as<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> 24<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:39.010> 3<00:03:39.430> sprocket<00:03:39.939> the<00:03:40.900> front<00:03:41.200> sprocket

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
as a 24 to 3 sprocket the front sprocket

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.530 
as a 24 to 3 sprocket the front sprocket
being<00:03:41.890> set<00:03:42.040> up<00:03:42.069> again<00:03:42.310> with<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.579> original<00:03:43.000> 55

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
being set up again with the original 55

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.860 
being set up again with the original 55
tooth<00:03:43.900> gives<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.040> gearing<00:03:45.430> about<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
tooth gives you the gearing about so the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.720 
tooth gives you the gearing about so the
4th<00:03:47.170> gear<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:47.769> your<00:03:47.920> shifter<00:03:48.310> would<00:03:48.610> be

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
4th gear on your shifter would be

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.339 
4th gear on your shifter would be
equivalent<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.510> single<00:03:49.840> speed<00:03:50.019> setup

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
equivalent to the single speed setup

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.649 
equivalent to the single speed setup
that<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.769> bike<00:03:50.920> came<00:03:51.190> with<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:52.060> you've<00:03:52.180> got<00:03:52.360> 3

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
that the bike came with so you've got 3

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.300 
that the bike came with so you've got 3
years<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:53.019> can<00:03:53.170> dropped<00:03:53.409> it<00:03:53.590> into<00:03:53.709> lower<00:03:53.980> gear

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
years you can dropped it into lower gear

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.220 
years you can dropped it into lower gear
and<00:03:54.489> you've<00:03:54.579> got<00:03:54.760> 4<00:03:55.090> gears<00:03:55.390> arguing<00:03:56.109> whether

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
and you've got 4 gears arguing whether

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.720 
and you've got 4 gears arguing whether
you<00:03:56.349> can<00:03:56.440> go<00:03:56.620> up<00:03:56.769> into<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.040> higher<00:03:57.250> gear<00:03:57.280> for<00:03:57.700> a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
you can go up into a higher gear for a

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.979 
you can go up into a higher gear for a
little<00:03:57.879> top-end

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.839 

okay<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.230> didn't<00:04:02.650> have<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.799> truing<00:04:03.189> stand<00:04:03.220> so

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
okay so I didn't have a truing stand so

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.610 
okay so I didn't have a truing stand so
to<00:04:03.909> true<00:04:04.209> of<00:04:04.269> my<00:04:04.390> very<00:04:04.629> weel<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.200> just<00:04:05.379> ended<00:04:05.530> up

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
to true of my very weel I just ended up

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.140 
to true of my very weel I just ended up
using<00:04:05.769> my<00:04:06.010> brakes<00:04:06.220> as<00:04:06.459> guides<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.909> again

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
using my brakes as guides and again

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.789 
using my brakes as guides and again

and I spent a little time just adjusting
and<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.900> seemed<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.169> work<00:04:20.229> out<00:04:20.440> just<00:04:20.680> fine<00:04:20.799> so

and it seemed to work out just fine so
I've<00:04:21.160> got<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> wheel<00:04:21.549> right<00:04:21.820> dead<00:04:22.539> center

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
first time I done any kind of wheel

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.750 
first time I done any kind of wheel
building<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:35.260> wasn't<00:04:35.500> too<00:04:35.800> overwhelming

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
building and it wasn't too overwhelming

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.490 
building and it wasn't too overwhelming
it<00:04:36.820> was<00:04:36.880> actually<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.270> pretty<00:04:37.750> pretty<00:04:38.110> easy<00:04:38.260> gig

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
it was actually a pretty pretty easy gig

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.680 
it was actually a pretty pretty easy gig
once<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.889> found<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.340> resources<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.850> needed<00:04:40.060> so
