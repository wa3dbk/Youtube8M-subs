wash this time and research tells me

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.609 
wash this time and research tells me
this<00:01:43.119> car<00:01:43.420> washes<00:01:45.780> most<00:01:46.780> likely<00:01:46.990> twenty<00:01:47.410> years

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
this car washes most likely twenty years

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.200 
this car washes most likely twenty years
old<00:01:47.860> at<00:01:48.100> least

around<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:55.020> back

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
around the back

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:22.180 
around the back
and<00:01:56.670> we'll<00:01:56.820> watch<00:01:56.970> up<00:01:57.240> through<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> top

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:45.620 

but<00:02:23.190> focus<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.730> too<00:02:23.849> well<00:02:27.080> there<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.230> go

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.510 

I<00:02:45.690> should<00:02:46.410> change<00:02:46.650> cycles<00:02:47.160> right<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
I should change cycles right when it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.729 
I should change cycles right when it
reaches<00:02:47.850> somewhere<00:02:48.150> around<00:02:48.240> here

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.470 

prints<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:53.430> can<00:02:53.459> see<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.819> machines<00:02:54.180> very

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
prints you can see this machines very

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.089 
prints you can see this machines very
simple<00:02:54.989> there<00:02:55.140> since<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.440> hoses<00:02:55.860> they're<00:02:55.980> all

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
simple there since the hoses they're all

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.580 
simple there since the hoses they're all
on<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.280> pivot<00:02:56.640> point<00:02:56.670> there<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.110> believe

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
on a pivot point there that I believe

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.140 
on a pivot point there that I believe
that<00:02:58.800> mechanism<00:02:59.069> there<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.610> has<00:02:59.760> drive

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
that mechanism there just has drive

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.820 
that mechanism there just has drive
motor<00:03:00.540> at<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> top<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.349> travels<00:03:01.739> around

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
motor at the top and it travels around

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.790 
motor at the top and it travels around
on<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.430> rail<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.230> mean<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.769> of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
on that rail I mean you know it's one of

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.530 
on that rail I mean you know it's one of
these<00:03:04.890> things<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.400> simple<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.209> go<00:03:06.360> wrong

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
these things it's so simple you go wrong

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380 
these things it's so simple you go wrong
with<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.090 

we<00:03:10.690> might<00:03:10.870> be<00:03:10.990> able<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.200> see<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.410> single<00:03:11.860> wheel

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
we might be able to see the single wheel

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.190 
we might be able to see the single wheel
toward<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.610> back<00:03:12.850> for<00:03:13.480> probably<00:03:13.750> two<00:03:13.930> wheels

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
toward the back for probably two wheels

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.690 
toward the back for probably two wheels
as<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.620> see<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.890> both<00:03:15.070> but<00:03:15.340> they're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
as you can see the both but they're

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.930 
as you can see the both but they're
driving<00:03:16.120> around<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.480> track<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.790> we've

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
driving around the track and we've

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.250 
driving around the track and we've
already<00:03:19.120> entered<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.570> spot-free<00:03:19.960> rinse

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
already entered the spot-free rinse

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.320 
already entered the spot-free rinse
cycle<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.740> is<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.920> very<00:03:21.190> short<00:03:21.430> wash<00:03:21.700> even<00:03:22.060> on

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
cycle this is a very short wash even on

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.990 
cycle this is a very short wash even on
these<00:03:22.570> highest<00:03:23.320> dollar<00:03:23.680> setting

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.430 

plus<00:03:27.570> drop<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.990> camera

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.720 

we'll<00:03:36.920> get<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.070> good<00:03:37.100> look<00:03:37.400> at<00:03:37.490> that<00:03:37.580> machine

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
we'll get a good look at that machine

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.370 
we'll get a good look at that machine
coming<00:03:38.180> up<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.420> time<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.780> see<00:03:38.870> how<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.020> pivot

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
coming up this time to see how the pivot

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.130 
coming up this time to see how the pivot
point<00:03:39.590> turns<00:03:40.180> there<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.330> is<00:03:41.450> going<00:03:41.660> around<00:03:41.960> on

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
point turns there it is going around on

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.060 
point turns there it is going around on
the<00:03:42.200> rail<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:44.140> have<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.230> two<00:03:45.380> rotating

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
the rail you have the two rotating

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.120 
the rail you have the two rotating
wheels<00:03:46.580> with<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:48.320> know<00:03:48.410> water<00:03:48.680> spraying

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
wheels with a you know water spraying

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.860 
wheels with a you know water spraying
out<00:03:49.310> they're<00:03:49.490> both<00:03:49.580> pretty<00:03:49.760> large<00:03:50.090> there<00:03:50.720> are

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
out they're both pretty large there are

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.470 
out they're both pretty large there are
no<00:03:51.080> dryers<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:51.770> as<00:03:51.830> soon<00:03:51.980> as<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.190> stops<00:03:52.490> there's

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
no dryers so as soon as it stops there's
