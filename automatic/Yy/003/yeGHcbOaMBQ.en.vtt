00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.760
 hi people i am back to the of 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.289
 stv and today I'll show you the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.449
 galaxies 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:19.180
 after all the very popular 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.550
 developer mclaren decides the mac 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.720
 norms to the funny stroke ml loud 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.850
 google 125 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.980
 I know who knows Polish so 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.279
 I can not confirm that or 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.719
 deny that for the time being one of his 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.340
 Career has always been announced 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:42.280
 bad and see the murder for that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.479
 galaxy ace so now indeed had 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.149
 several times the end of his career 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.460
 sheen announced this time 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.999
 is at least for now at least one too 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.909
 his 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.679
 then he said yes thank you very good 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.429
 blablabla maybe I'll do it 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.499
 continue 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.199
 and since then I have not heard that 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:03.519
 me already a few days ago 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.330
 but there is a new end of ten 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.820
 around 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.760
 that means galaxy s is just real 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.080
 only the post from another 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.090
 Developer continued 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.040
 you already have at the boot animation 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:23.530
 win this is the new sending moth 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:26.020
 in the boat animation yes camera has no 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.080
 autofocus that would be mostly court or 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 mecklar does not happen that's too bad 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.540
 but the focus just works 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.070
 Not 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.690
 yes there you are the good again 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.150
 animation after all this 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.710
 I can crash now 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.450
 do not say if that is a beta so or 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.210
 but what else I guess was one 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.830
 but it will not be release candidate 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.720
 it just does not mean beta 2 anymore 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.720
 its gonna be a galaxy this time 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:05.680
 crashed it is exactly the camera I have 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.800
 I have two cameras now I understand that 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.050
 fun too that is a national one 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.629
 the same has no auto focus and ford 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.049
 when hangs then I have the camera over 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.969
 finish the back button and apparently 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.090
 he also does not save the photos because 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:24.400
 that still the video of the last one 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.950
 room test is now as well as the home button 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.129
 end not like practically a running 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.209
 felt liquid the wifi is synonymous if 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.370
 I do not understand why I am right now 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.170
 not in the wlan am the play stars too 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.349
 preloaded course always 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.290
 the beautiful widgets where I'm the same 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:52.150
 wanted to add a picture to the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.060
 do not use okay I have 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.859
 What else is there to say 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.749
 Of course I can overclock cpu and stuff like that 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.319
 further one is from transmitters motto 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:06.609
 used to over the phone 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:09.029
 android 4.1.1 we have exactly one 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.029
 changelog 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.299
 I do not want to read who is 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:24.099
 a bit long now 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:26.169
 ok anna fischer cooper she just stopped that 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.999
 whole as I said exactly I can 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.980
 of course the overclock and so on 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:34.659
 Do not make the mistake not now 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.480
 have already done and I have now 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.459
 right click on 902 does not do that 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.950
 makes the individual small steps 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.859
 because otherwise all the fun will freeze you 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.790
 on 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:50.559
 that means always nice and slow 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.389
 processor to not overstretch who is 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.739
 yes, quite slowly at minimum 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.769
 cpu tact could do it all in one go 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.329
 do that but that does not matter but maximum 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.809
 This should not overwhelm scary 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:08.680
 there is also okay yes as I said very much 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:10.319
 liquid dsp manager bass gain 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.629
 we turn on 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:22.520
 effect on medium nikoläuse and 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:25.050
 make the exhibition more better 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.330
 that is , the bass is a wonderful substitute 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.910
 up we look at the same 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.729
 in apollo how the fun sounds 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.970
 Of course you need it in the looks 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.599
 fits that rammstein then I come 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.599
 not far now 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:10.919
 Here it is you are absolutely none 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.080
 fun so that you have to be quieter 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:18.930
 do 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:20.610
 so you can listen well well what 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.050
 there is left to say otherwise has 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.400
 not much done the pictures will not 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:33.780
 saved that I had already said 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:36.560
 yes contacts everything looks 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.699
 just said yes 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.830
 mäckler has given up his career 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.370
 but it is a pity that you can not do anything 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.380
 do 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.370
 it goes on at least that's it 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.310
 positive and yes that was again 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.979
 from me and I wish you now 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.659
 Have fun with the galaxy rom and 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.180
 if you have to ask then writes it 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.180
