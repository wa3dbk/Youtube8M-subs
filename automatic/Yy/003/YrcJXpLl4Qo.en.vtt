that you guys can do is actually change

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.230 
that you guys can do is actually change
the<00:01:01.980> flavor<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.580> you<00:01:02.610> can<00:01:02.670> add<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.120> bit

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
the flavor so you can add a little bit

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.270 
the flavor so you can add a little bit
of<00:01:03.360> peanut<00:01:03.720> butter<00:01:03.810> when<00:01:04.050> it's<00:01:04.170> puree<00:01:04.440> or<00:01:05.070> you

can add some frozen strawberries and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.850 
can add some frozen strawberries and
then<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> totally<00:01:07.470> different<00:01:07.740> flavor

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
then you have a totally different flavor

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.410 
then you have a totally different flavor
