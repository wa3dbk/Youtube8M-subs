00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
this is the it's easier to tell when I

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.300 
this is the it's easier to tell when I
penguin<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.380> read<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.740> next<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.100> each<00:02:24.160> other

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
pink one I could be incorrect on that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.730 
pink one I could be incorrect on that
might<00:02:30.670> be<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.820> red<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.270> sorry<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.840> know<00:02:31.930> one<00:02:32.710> of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
might be the red one sorry I know one of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.600 
might be the red one sorry I know one of
them<00:02:32.920> has<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.370> gray<00:02:34.090> instead<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.570> blue<00:02:34.780> but

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
them has the gray instead of blue but

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.300 
them has the gray instead of blue but
i'm<00:02:36.610> not<00:02:36.730> positive<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.980> let's<00:02:38.980> see

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
i'm not positive on that let's see

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.240 
i'm not positive on that let's see
where's<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.920> blue<00:02:45.100> one

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
where's here so this is the blue one

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.030 
where's here so this is the blue one
which<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.430> 30<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.810> i<00:02:47.170> believe<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
which is 30 so i believe this is the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.410 
which is 30 so i believe this is the
pink<00:02:48.400> one<00:02:48.640> then<00:02:48.850> because<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> other<00:02:49.210> one

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
pink one then because the other one

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.960 
pink one then because the other one
