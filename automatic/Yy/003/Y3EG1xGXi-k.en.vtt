deep down inside you if I tell you that
I<00:00:14.759> think<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:16.109> thought<00:00:16.410> before<00:00:16.770> there<00:00:17.130> today

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430

of thought speed teen is potentially

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.040 
of thought speed teen is potentially
dangerous<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:16.850> what<00:03:17.000> we<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.270> is<00:03:17.420> we<00:03:17.570> we<00:03:17.930> use

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
dangerous but what we do is we we use

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.840 
dangerous but what we do is we we use
the<00:03:18.170> best<00:03:18.350> equipment<00:03:18.590> available<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.490> minimize

the best equipment available to minimize
the<00:03:20.000> risk<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.020> therefore<00:03:21.230> for<00:03:22.100> us<00:03:22.190> it's

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
the risk and so therefore for us it's

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.140 
the risk and so therefore for us it's
all<00:03:23.750> we<00:03:23.900> do
