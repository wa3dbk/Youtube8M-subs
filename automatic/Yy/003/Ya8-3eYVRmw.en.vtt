tougher<00:00:24.980> in<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.070> very<00:00:26.279> similar<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> diablo

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
tougher in a very similar way to diablo

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.410 
tougher in a very similar way to diablo
2<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.960> primarily<00:00:28.710> raise<00:00:29.160> their<00:00:29.400> level<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:30.300> have

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
2 we primarily raise their level we have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.290 
2 we primarily raise their level we have
this<00:00:30.510> big<00:00:30.810> cool<00:00:31.560> spreadsheet<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
this big cool spreadsheet that is the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660 
this big cool spreadsheet that is the
monster<00:00:33.540> scrunching<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> does<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
monster scrunching and what it does is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.080 
monster scrunching and what it does is
it<00:00:35.880> says<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.960> has<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.350> these<00:00:37.469> different<00:00:37.680> stats

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
it says it has all these different stats

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.229 
it says it has all these different stats
and<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> side<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.559> has<00:00:40.620> levels<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
and then down the side it has levels and

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
and then down the side it has levels and
so<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.540> says<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> level<00:00:43.530> 5<00:00:43.770> monster<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so it says this is a level 5 monster and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.250 
so it says this is a level 5 monster and
we<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.640> through<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> set<00:00:45.210> okay<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:46.079> five

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
we go through and set okay little five

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
we go through and set okay little five
months<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.770> average<00:00:47.129> damage<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.910> level

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

all those types of things it's all in
there<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.289> set<00:00:58.500> those<00:00:58.649> kind<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> globally

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
there and we set those kind of globally

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.479 
there and we set those kind of globally
for<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> monsters<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.370> go

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
for all the monsters so and then we go

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
for all the monsters so and then we go
into<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.789> monster<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.750> set<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
into the monster and when we set the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
into the monster and when we set the
help<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> monster<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.159> don't<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.489> put<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
help of the monster we don't as put a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
help of the monster we don't as put a
number<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> percentage<00:01:07.189> so

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
number in there we put a percentage so

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.140 
number in there we put a percentage so
we<00:01:08.280> say<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:10.280> average<00:01:11.280> monster<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.000> it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
we say this is a average monster if it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
we say this is a average monster if it's
an<00:01:12.240> average<00:01:12.540> monster<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.530> gets<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
an average monster then it gets a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.800 
an average monster then it gets a
hundred<00:01:14.070> percent<00:01:14.189> health<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.479> kind<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
hundred percent health if it's kind of a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
hundred percent health if it's kind of a
weak<00:01:16.020> monster<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.590> gets<00:01:16.740> fifty<00:01:17.009> percent<00:01:17.340> or

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
weak monster it gets fifty percent or

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
weak monster it gets fifty percent or
eighty<00:01:18.630> percent<00:01:18.869> somewhere<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.650> area<00:01:19.770> if

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
eighty percent somewhere in that area if

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
eighty percent somewhere in that area if
it's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.820> tough<00:01:21.030> monster<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.780> two

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
it's a really tough monster can get two

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's a really tough monster can get two
three<00:01:22.830> four<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.310> five<00:01:23.490> hundred<00:01:23.790> percent<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
three four or five hundred percent and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
three four or five hundred percent and
we<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.290> alter<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> experience

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
we can also alter like the experience

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
we can also alter like the experience
game<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.060> give<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> chance<00:01:28.170> for

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
game that they give a chance for

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
game that they give a chance for
dropping<00:01:28.740> treasure<00:01:28.950> earn<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.430> those<00:01:29.850> things

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
dropping treasure earn all those things

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
dropping treasure earn all those things
all<00:01:30.240> done<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> percentage<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.250> want

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
all done is a percentage so if we want

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
all done is a percentage so if we want
to<00:01:32.520> move<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.939> creature<00:01:33.270> around<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> say<00:01:34.110> oh

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to move that creature around and say oh

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660 
to move that creature around and say oh
this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:34.890> difficulty<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this is not very difficulty this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.399 
this is not very difficulty this
creature<00:01:35.909> needs<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.390> tougher<00:01:36.689> now<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.200> just

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
creature needs to be tougher now we just

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.969 
creature needs to be tougher now we just
change<00:01:37.619> its<00:01:37.799> level<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.600> how<00:01:39.979> it's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
change its level and so that's how it's

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
change its level and so that's how it's
probably<00:01:41.310> maybe<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.970> did<00:01:42.180> sorry<00:01:42.360> answer<00:01:42.630> than

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
probably maybe it did sorry answer than

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.240 
probably maybe it did sorry answer than
you<00:01:42.899> want<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.189> easy

you want change the difficult because

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
you want change the difficult because

not the right person talks about that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
not the right person talks about that
generally<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.479> talk<00:02:06.719> about<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.020> kind

of stuff the answer
the<00:02:09.519> tuning<00:02:09.789> level<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.239> yes<00:02:10.780> but<00:02:12.750> specific

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the tuning level is yes but specific

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.690 
the tuning level is yes but specific
specifically<00:02:14.739> you'd<00:02:15.040> probably<00:02:15.250> want<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.549> talk

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
specifically you'd probably want to talk

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.800 
specifically you'd probably want to talk
to<00:02:15.819> one<00:02:15.939> of<00:02:15.970> our<00:02:16.030> game<00:02:16.239> play<00:02:16.420> poker<00:02:16.629> because

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
to one of our game play poker because

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.949 
to one of our game play poker because
they<00:02:17.170> know<00:02:17.319> better<00:02:17.500> than<00:02:17.680> but<00:02:18.430> AI<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.299> coffee

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
they know better than but AI and coffee

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.890 
they know better than but AI and coffee
group<00:02:20.290> composition<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.220> Hell<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.420> a

group composition and Hell in a
nightmare<00:02:23.319> won't<00:02:23.950> change<00:02:24.189> is<00:02:24.879> out<00:02:25.060> well<00:02:26.489> some

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
nightmare won't change is out well some

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.729 
nightmare won't change is out well some
of<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.640> inputs<00:02:28.030> change<00:02:28.359> because<00:02:29.290> things<00:02:29.620> like

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
of the inputs change because things like

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.479 
of the inputs change because things like
a<00:02:30.480> attack<00:02:31.480> rate<00:02:31.829> we<00:02:32.829> have<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.980> lot<00:02:33.189> of<00:02:33.220> little

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
a attack rate we have a lot of little

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.360 
a attack rate we have a lot of little
inputs<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:33.909> control<00:02:34.329> AI<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.930> for<00:02:35.109> example

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
inputs that control AI like for example

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.819 
inputs that control AI like for example
how<00:02:36.370> quickly<00:02:36.670> i<00:02:36.790> choose<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.269> pursue<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.829> that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
how quickly i choose to pursue you that

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.069 
how quickly i choose to pursue you that
actually<00:02:39.280> does<00:02:39.519> get<00:02:39.760> altered<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.420> those<00:02:40.689> we

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
actually does get altered and those we

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.930 
actually does get altered and those we
have<00:02:41.200> some<00:02:41.349> global<00:02:41.560> variables<00:02:42.190> we<00:02:42.340> do<00:02:42.489> we<00:02:42.700> just

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
have some global variables we do we just

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.369 
have some global variables we do we just
say<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.120> know<00:02:43.239> what<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.629> thing<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:44.139> wanted

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
say you know what this thing we wanted

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.550 
say you know what this thing we wanted
to<00:02:44.440> globally<00:02:44.980> go<00:02:45.129> down<00:02:45.310> across<00:02:45.579> all<00:02:45.940> creatures

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
to globally go down across all creatures

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.080 
to globally go down across all creatures
so<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:47.739> do<00:02:47.859> have<00:02:48.010> some<00:02:48.220> elements<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.819> that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
so we do have some elements like that

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.509 
so we do have some elements like that
but<00:02:49.359> our<00:02:50.290> AI<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.909> a<00:02:51.970> very<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:54.430> very

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
but our AI is is is a very it's very

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.849 
but our AI is is is a very it's very
it's<00:02:55.269> got<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> lot<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.750> script<00:02:56.079> inputs<00:02:56.470> into<00:02:56.650> it

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
it's got a lot of script inputs into it

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.800 
it's got a lot of script inputs into it
so<00:02:57.040> we<00:02:57.159> alter<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> lot<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.849> those<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> core

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
so we alter a lot of those but the core

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.119 
so we alter a lot of those but the core
of<00:02:58.900> what<00:02:59.019> drives<00:02:59.139> it<00:02:59.439> though<00:02:59.560> doesn't<00:03:00.010> really

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
of what drives it though doesn't really

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.220 
of what drives it though doesn't really
change
