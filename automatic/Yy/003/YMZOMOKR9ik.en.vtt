00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.230
 ah 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.820
 Hello everyone, as you are today, I am going 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740
 to teach how to do two types of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.770
 masks as a base both carry the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.590
 honey are very simple to make and I think 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.689
 that a bit of fools put me here to a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.369
 couple of honey for the face because if yes 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.930
 we are funny to see them but 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.050
 I really do not think it's necessary that you 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.610
 explain that it is applied all over the face 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.340
 leaving out the outline of the eyes and 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.920
 mouth so I tell you how they are made 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.510
 this mask and just so good 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 the shakes to apply on the face is 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.210
 moisturizing and the other is to the internet but 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.789
 I'm going to show you the moisturizer is made 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.489
 honey and olive oil small pot of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.760
 extra virgin olive oil that good 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.129
 I got it from a couple of boats and texts 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 as samples and I have them part of type 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 of little things like that I have the little boats 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.649
 small for the masks and also 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.910
 just to throw oil before 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.370
 to explain the two masks os 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 I want to say that apply oil 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 olive all over the face if we do not go to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.090
 go out to the street we simply apply 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.190
 with your hands all over your face as if 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 we stop the face with oil we leave it 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.250
 act for a while I do not know if we're going to be 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.750
 at home doing housework 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.399
 let's just be in a magazine 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.439
 we leave the oil on our face and then 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.220
 we wash that is great for the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.640
 skin they use it for decades or centuries that 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.810
 I can say that they use it and always 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.659
 the elderly that today is that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.630
 they do this since they are young 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.310
 they have the most precious skin I say in case 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.990
 you did not know it was worth I'll go with the two 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.689
 that I tell him that I always finish 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.299
 rolling or with some the moisturizer 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.659
 which is honey and olive oil two parts 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.909
 of honey one of olive oil is to say 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.770
 a spoonful of olive oil two 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.979
 tablespoons of honey 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.960
 a small cup of olive oil two 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.670
 of honey if we want to do more 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.170
 amount in case we're going to do it with 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.360
 our friends or whatever we are going to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.310
 put each one of the masks 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.349
 we do this and we put it 20 seconds at 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.459
 microwave like 20 seconds we take out 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.989
 our puppy with our prayers 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.200
 we anoint the face and leave it 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.849
 act 5 minutes or we remove it and that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.190
 does that it's not about the skin 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.420
 frequencies of use of these good according to 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.209
 the needs and we have very skin 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.440
 dry we can use it I do not know how the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.870
 masks that can be used once a 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.010
 the week or something like that if you have the skin 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.599
 mixed to be moisturizing with oil 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 honey can all give a little fat 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.819
 you can use it sparingly and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.799
 anti-acne mask is made with honey and 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.690
 with cinnamon was three parts of me 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.640
 cinnamon moon if we make three 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.920
 tablespoons of honey a teaspoon of 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.069
 cinnamon we microwave this mixture 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.079
 for 30 seconds and when they are in 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.120
 project we are going to get hot in 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.740
 the skin the same for the other we leave it 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.070
 act 10 minutes 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.690
 ten minutes then we do not remove it 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.069
 our cream always and we have 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.950
 another mask made the same 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.159
 frequency of use then once a 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.159
 week 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.209
 the natural products always 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.920
 advisable that after applying 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.359
 masks of any treatment that 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.430
 we will not give the sun on your face no 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.200
 is that it is very dangerous but it is better 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.250
 prevent circular because nothing else I hope 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.139
 that you liked these two 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.060
 masks I've already put them both in 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.219
 my ear because they are two masks to 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.829
 honey base very simple I hope that 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:32.079

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.879
 in case you already have results to me 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.219
 I really like this about oil with 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.139
 honey and cinnamon with the same he did not 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.750
 You just need so much right now 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.069

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.659
