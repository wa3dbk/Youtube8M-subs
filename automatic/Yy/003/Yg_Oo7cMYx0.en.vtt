00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.200
 and hello very good two people that such 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.570
 you are good here with another example no 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.849
 it's a live comment but the game itself 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.650
 that is recorded in live and good 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.790
 I really wanted to comment a little bit 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.919
 of this map that is what has 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.259
 seemed like a map to me that either 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.149
 if it is loaded as each and every one of 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.790
 the maps that are in the call of duty 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.739
 but above all always always 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.059
 I wanted to explain a little more or less to the 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.739
 hour that more or less the few 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.660
 games he plays on the first 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.190
 as I already tell you on this map since already 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.110
 you know they announced the four 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.310
 principals that are going to leave because he will be 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.079
 one of them that will give the sure 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.269
 trailer or be a bit of it 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.010
 on your map in which it is as if it were 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.600
 an advance of that because because all 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.280
 there are many exits on each path there 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.690
 ancor two or three exits generally 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.390
 Now I know that several of the corners with 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.149
 figures of medium corners but all 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.649
 the whole map has the outputs 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.289
 different are not like a kind of 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.240
 Communications presides over his communique 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:09.159
 you know the rest of this game is 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.450
 well done I at least see it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.340
 be fine because you are always in your 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.409
 version 39 that comes from the other side 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.750
 how do you just look good in front and 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 good is always you already know based on 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.450
 as I always say to play power 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.670
 put you into practice of mostly 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.890
 practice will serve you better 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.659
 I imagine about the opinion that 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.520
 you saw a lot of people who thought that the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.170
 game did not like because it is that the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 low streak is they are very difficult to 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.569
 get out or liked it because of the fact 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.209
 how are the losing streak or the 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.890
 best bookings are or the blog maps 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.509
 is not going to focus is gone 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.220
 enough comments of all kinds not about 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.860
 this game when it came out 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.009
 also the zombie mode for me has been 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 crazy and I tell you but good ya 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.409
 I will comment in another video 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.060
 in some game about it on the 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.310
 zombies mode and to be entertained is a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.159
 while today the theme of the system for more or 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.840
 less and especially this weapon and weapons 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.759
 in general that I have tried and how not 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 all a few and I tell you I'll try 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.400
 upload a gameplay if you go from 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.349
 practically of the different weapons 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.690
 because I think you have to give it 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.420
 try them good says that the weapons that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.310
 they got some you have them if according to 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.110
 I have seen them get them according to the level 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.940
 it's worth the arms you're blocking 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.420
 according to the level 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.370
 that you have level 10 vouchers good if 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.280
 you have some I understand myself gross what 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.450
 that I 'm missing people depends on 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.850
 level of why those other hills 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.280
 Weapons accessories using the weapon 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.480
 in weapon over so much is worth more 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.000
 unlocking the different ones with 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.800
 good accessories but you also have 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.210
 challenges that if you meet the challenges with 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.900
 those accessory I think you have what to 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.870
 another I tell you I have to still vote 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.060
 gear enough when about the fact of 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 the weapons themselves and all this but 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.730
 well you know that the accesses are 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.850
 they get so good more little things 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.590
 stability stability cadence of this 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.000
 kind of things in the weapons that we see 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.460
 as a weapon that we are talking about 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.570
 we are talking about not an analysis 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.060
 complete the map and doing an analysis 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.640
 more or less like that in quotes of these 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 good hands 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.110
 the rules in general in the game according to 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.810
 they have said and I have said and I think 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.090
 that sometimes do not move are not no 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.230
 they are weapons that are moving 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.290
 too much at the time of shooting or that 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.760
 have whatever and as if they were a 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.000
 look super weird or something like that does not 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.670
 looks are very similar to the picture 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.410
 mold you good is like the triumph 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.660
 with your then all do not help more than 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.890
 I live out in the other games another 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.370
 hotter and new but good as 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.019
 not all 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.489
 they are very stable has an activity 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.720
 tremendous is not necessary or that few 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.019
 point and stable 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.480
 for example of the three since it barely 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.560
 move and move the weapons is 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.950
 incredible is a tremendous perfection 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.959
 then more expensive I wanted to comment 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.400
 apart from the hip it goes very well 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.810
 You can also point directly from 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.510
 hip to a triplet we married for a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.209
 little long and beat well enough the east 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.739
 of good scavenger bullets on this map I 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.120
 I think carrion is not going to do either 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.729
 much lack of more children to buy 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.250
 pig because you now the wey module does not 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.530
 it will be necessary since I see that 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.419
 logically I'm not quite shot 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.610
 of killing an enemy I at least 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.410
 the parts that I have still played in this 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.000
 game also in this game I have not 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.610
 I got pissed off 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.160
 well you will see how it will happen as in 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.289
 the modern warfare 3 or on the white with 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.900
 this is going to see a lot of campero and I'm leaving 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.550
 to run a lot more things from this 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.160
 delay of weapons so generally that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.020
 is watching I tell them I'm going to make a 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.669
 small you are going to have a small mini 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.409
 video in which I will be analyzing the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.699
 sniper is worth a little bit above 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.399
 also complete matches about 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.139
 Shotguns on different playing cards 

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:56.550
 categories and good class gusts 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.469
 low gusts I also have to carry 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.469
 but good what they observe thus in the 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.569
 game about weapons and about maps 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.009
 it's also pretty good how 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.349
 graphic for you pretty pretty 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.550
 Successful have good graphic design 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.909
 better than the previous ones 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.129
 that is super clear everything but good 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.529
 what is the complete analysis like that in 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.589
 general of weapons and what is the 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.999
 general computation of the maps because it is already 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.039
 which it is what they have said 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:24.479
 not much mystery that's what there is 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.610
 one thing that is that the losing streak 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.289
 It costs to take them out, you have to kill me and 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.669
 get enough dots man 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.860
 thank goodness he tells you so much 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.269
 assists as everything goes 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.219
 counting there you accumulate that what 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:37.319
 clear is that you die from that part all 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.550
 streak is not like in the wolf mode to 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.110
 three that you're left with the streak 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.999
 help for example you stayed there and 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.129
 I could follow that it ended up following 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:46.860
 Even if he died, you do not know that 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.439
 there is neither new nor is there more 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.239
 there's none of that is it's only 19 casualties 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.999
 that the most in its 19 and it's already has not 

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:55.560
 more mystery so many that I 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.800
 you have to ask once they have 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.169
 no, it's not taken away and people 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.480
 people do not camp so much that's something that 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:07.500
 it seems quite please because really 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:11.790
 that you camp in warren you 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.260
 in short, a little bit like that above gives us 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.240
 enough rage to kill you champion the 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.160
 change people do not change that much 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.960
 the slices are still dragged 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.370
 you work the advantages ways that are 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.680
 super guards for my taste we were what 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.600
 that they have taken us away that they are going to put us 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.490
 maybe some but still see 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.500
 sewing so seeing how it has been 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.960
 well I do not know if I do not look at it the other day and 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.000
 good but occupied a ventajita 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.620
 then it takes to know for example what 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.540
 conceive but can carry but they said or 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.820
 for example but good for the rest 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.890
 pretty good I tell you this is a law 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.980
 and a little bit over between weapons a little 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.419
 maps and a little bit everything in general is worth and 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.010
 Nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.660
 have gone well giving the favorite if 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.580
 you want more videos and keep uploading 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.380
 more information and comments in three 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.380
 little things and see you goodbye
