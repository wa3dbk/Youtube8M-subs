the<00:00:04.820> next<00:00:05.800> exercise<00:00:06.800> that<00:00:07.550> we<00:00:07.700> want<00:00:07.910> to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
the next exercise that we want to

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.410 
the next exercise that we want to
execute<00:00:09.260> what<00:00:09.350> the<00:00:09.470> bands<00:00:09.920> is<00:00:10.070> that<00:00:10.280> of<00:00:10.490> a<00:00:10.730> dead

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
execute what the bands is that of a dead

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.590 
execute what the bands is that of a dead
left<00:00:11.860> will<00:00:12.860> cross<00:00:13.370> bands<00:00:13.730> over<00:00:14.090> just<00:00:14.300> as<00:00:14.450> we

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
left will cross bands over just as we

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.679 
left will cross bands over just as we
did<00:00:14.780> for<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.110> bent-over<00:00:15.410> row<00:00:16.029> I<00:00:17.029> want<00:00:17.600> to

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
did for the bent-over row I want to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.279 
did for the bent-over row I want to
mention<00:00:17.869> one<00:00:18.080> key<00:00:18.619> factor<00:00:18.980> here<00:00:19.279> as<00:00:19.760> far<00:00:20.029> as

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
mention one key factor here as far as

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.570 
mention one key factor here as far as
physical<00:00:21.289> evaluation<00:00:21.529> i<00:00:22.189> think<00:00:22.400> that's

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
physical evaluation i think that's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.759 
physical evaluation i think that's
always<00:00:22.970> a<00:00:22.999> key<00:00:23.269> point<00:00:23.539> before<00:00:23.839> you<00:00:24.140> start<00:00:24.679> at

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
always a key point before you start at

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.239 
always a key point before you start at
any<00:00:24.859> athlete<00:00:25.400> or<00:00:26.119> expect<00:00:26.779> them<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.109> execute<00:00:27.859> a

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
any athlete or expect them to execute a

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.749 
any athlete or expect them to execute a
given<00:00:29.210> technique<00:00:29.659> is<00:00:29.869> to<00:00:30.769> look<00:00:31.009> at<00:00:31.249> their<00:00:31.489> body

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
given technique is to look at their body

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.770 
given technique is to look at their body
build<00:00:32.140> some<00:00:33.140> people<00:00:33.500> have<00:00:33.710> long<00:00:33.980> femurs<00:00:34.520> and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
build some people have long femurs and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.849 
build some people have long femurs and
particularly<00:00:35.780> when<00:00:35.930> we<00:00:36.050> get<00:00:36.199> into<00:00:36.379> this<00:00:36.559> lower

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
particularly when we get into this lower

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.889 
particularly when we get into this lower
body<00:00:37.250> lower<00:00:37.670> back<00:00:38.000> stuff<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:40.149> long<00:00:41.149> femur<00:00:41.510> can

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
body lower back stuff the long femur can

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.400 
body lower back stuff the long femur can
create<00:00:42.199> some<00:00:42.469> issues<00:00:43.250> as<00:00:43.460> far<00:00:43.489> as<00:00:44.260> doing<00:00:45.260> the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
create some issues as far as doing the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.770 
create some issues as far as doing the
exercise<00:00:45.980> particularly<00:00:46.699> with<00:00:47.120> an<00:00:47.329> overload

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
exercise particularly with an overload

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.830 
exercise particularly with an overload
so<00:00:48.170> we<00:00:48.859> want<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.160> watch<00:00:49.600> execution<00:00:50.600> of<00:00:50.719> the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
so we want to watch execution of the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.169 
so we want to watch execution of the
exercise<00:00:51.410> with<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.769> lightweight<00:00:52.179> good

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
exercise with a lightweight good

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.319 
exercise with a lightweight good
fundamentals<00:00:53.809> initially<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.649> then

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
fundamentals initially and then

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.779 
fundamentals initially and then
adaptation<00:00:56.329> i'll<00:00:56.480> be<00:00:56.600> there<00:00:56.750> equipment<00:00:57.789> or

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
adaptation i'll be there equipment or

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.130 
adaptation i'll be there equipment or
the<00:00:59.530> style<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:00.920> they<00:01:01.730> executed<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:02.539> is<00:01:02.749> also

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
the style that they executed in is also

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.740 
the style that they executed in is also
going<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.440> be<00:01:03.530> important<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:05.239> with<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.540> dead

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
going to be important so with the dead

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.690 
going to be important so with the dead
left<00:01:06.020> i'd<00:01:06.320> like<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:07.060> again<00:01:08.060> with<00:01:08.329> my<00:01:09.700> key

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
left i'd like to again with my key

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.960 
left i'd like to again with my key
things<00:01:11.150> on<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.900> just<00:01:12.079> strength

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
things on this and just strength

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.179 
things on this and just strength
application<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.600> we<00:01:15.200> cross<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.680> band's<00:01:16.040> over

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
application so we cross the band's over

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.490 
application so we cross the band's over
we're<00:01:16.909> going<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.119> sit<00:01:17.450> back<00:01:17.659> as<00:01:17.930> much<00:01:18.140> as<00:01:18.200> we

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
we're going to sit back as much as we

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.639 
we're going to sit back as much as we
can<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:19.490> femurs<00:01:19.939> allow<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:20.630> if<00:01:21.140> we<00:01:21.500> have<00:01:21.619> a

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
can the femurs allow for if we have a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.160 
can the femurs allow for if we have a
long<00:01:21.890> femur<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.610> short<00:01:23.500> again<00:01:25.210> short<00:01:26.210> torso

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
long femur and short again short torso

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.530 
long femur and short again short torso
this<00:01:28.159> will<00:01:28.430> require<00:01:28.640> again<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.240> little

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
this will require again a little

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.030 
this will require again a little
different<00:01:29.990> look<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.259> little<00:01:30.619> different

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
different look a little different

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.670 
different look a little different
adaptation<00:01:31.850> but<00:01:32.090> with<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:32.420> band's<00:01:32.689> I<00:01:33.110> can

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
adaptation but with the band's I can

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.069 
adaptation but with the band's I can
stay<00:01:33.979> more<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.640> axis<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.210> rotation<00:01:35.390> so

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
stay more in the axis of rotation so

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.850 
stay more in the axis of rotation so
again<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:36.649> going<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:38.200> apply<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.320> muscle

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
again it's going to apply the muscle

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.969 
again it's going to apply the muscle
ensure<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.250> way<00:01:40.399> I<00:01:40.430> want<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:40.820> apply<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.200> sit

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
ensure the way I want it apply so sit

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.139 
ensure the way I want it apply so sit
back<00:01:43.009> down<00:01:43.810> if<00:01:44.810> it's<00:01:45.020> cute<00:01:45.380> with<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.520> deadlift

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
back down if it's cute with the deadlift

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.569 
back down if it's cute with the deadlift
crossing<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.200> bands<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.920> now<00:01:49.070> i'm<00:01:49.219> going<00:01:49.460> to
