okay<00:00:07.249> back<00:00:07.490> in<00:00:07.609> the<00:00:07.700> shack<00:00:07.910> again<00:00:08.210> I'm

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
okay back in the shack again I'm

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.459 
okay back in the shack again I'm
checking<00:00:09.140> out<00:00:09.290> a<00:00:09.350> weather<00:00:09.620> satellite<00:00:10.389> it's

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
checking out a weather satellite it's

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:19.089 
checking out a weather satellite it's
Noah<00:00:12.469> 15<00:00:13.299> that's<00:00:14.299> what<00:00:14.480> it<00:00:14.540> sounds<00:00:14.809> like

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.919 

got<00:00:19.669> an<00:00:19.730> image<00:00:19.880> coming<00:00:20.449> up<00:00:20.509> on<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:20.720> screen

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:20.929 
got an image coming up on the screen

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:58.410 
got an image coming up on the screen
I'll<00:00:21.050> show<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:21.289> in<00:00:21.349> a<00:00:21.439> bit<00:00:22.449> better<00:00:23.449> signal

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.110 

I'll<00:00:58.989> keep<00:00:59.170> an<00:00:59.350> ALICE<00:00:59.620> position<00:01:00.070> tilted<00:01:01.000> and

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
I'll keep an ALICE position tilted and

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.740 
I'll keep an ALICE position tilted and
40<00:01:01.329> degrees<00:01:01.739> we're<00:01:02.739> not<00:01:02.860> 13<00:01:03.700> elevation<00:01:04.420> and

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
40 degrees we're not 13 elevation and

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.620 
40 degrees we're not 13 elevation and
I'll<00:01:04.870> just<00:01:05.019> take<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> screenshot<00:01:05.830> of<00:01:06.190> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I'll just take a screenshot of the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.430 
I'll just take a screenshot of the
computer<00:01:07.630> see<00:01:07.780> what<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.960> can<00:01:08.110> see<00:01:09.240> okay<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.540> see

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
computer see what you can see okay I see

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.260 
computer see what you can see okay I see
your<00:01:11.619> image<00:01:11.920> going<00:01:12.190> through<00:01:12.460> from<00:01:12.760> satellite

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
your image going through from satellite

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.469 
your image going through from satellite
I'm<00:01:13.600> gonna<00:01:13.810> swallow<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.970> le<00:01:16.060> oh<00:01:16.300> we

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
I'm gonna swallow it you see le oh we

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.130 
I'm gonna swallow it you see le oh we
get<00:01:16.630> on<00:01:16.720> in<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.960> bit

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.350 

just<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:20.920> frequency<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:22.800> it's<00:01:23.800> moving

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
just in the frequency one it's moving

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.180 
just in the frequency one it's moving
not<00:01:25.360> quite<00:01:25.570> as<00:01:25.660> fast<00:01:25.870> as<00:01:26.080> some<00:01:26.260> satellites<00:01:26.800> so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
not quite as fast as some satellites so

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.440 
not quite as fast as some satellites so
it's<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.400> little<00:01:27.520> bit<00:01:27.760> slower<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.270> Doppler

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
it's a little bit slower on the Doppler

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:41.500 
it's a little bit slower on the Doppler
darling

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.490 

families<00:01:42.510> doing<00:01:42.690> well<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.320> hear<00:01:43.440> in

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
families doing well as you can hear in

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
families doing well as you can hear in
the<00:01:43.560> background<00:01:44.270> shoot<00:01:45.270> off<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> screen

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the background shoot off to the screen

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.500 
the background shoot off to the screen
again<00:01:46.430> hopefully<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.760> see<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.000> okay

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.149 

I'll<00:01:51.510> I'll<00:01:52.110> zoom<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.830> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.070> later<00:01:55.159> got

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
I'll I'll zoom in a little bit later got

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.710 
I'll I'll zoom in a little bit later got
a<00:01:56.190> signal<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.670> home<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.910> f9<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> satellite

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
a signal now home to f9 on the satellite

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.240 
a signal now home to f9 on the satellite
16<00:02:00.720> degrees<00:02:01.110> above<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.500> earth<00:02:02.479> 253<00:02:03.479> degrees

azimuth

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.110 

I'll<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.440> have<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> quick<00:02:13.160> sneak<00:02:13.490> crew<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
I'll just have a quick sneak crew and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.250 
I'll just have a quick sneak crew and
what's<00:02:14.300> going<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.490> software

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
what's going on so this is the software

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.160 
what's going on so this is the software
the<00:02:18.260> according<00:02:19.120> got<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.270> spectrum<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.140> I

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
the according got the spectrum and I

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.559 
the according got the spectrum and I
rise<00:02:21.350> up<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.830> top<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.270> image<00:02:23.480> is

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
rise up to the top and the image is

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.309 
rise up to the top and the image is
coming<00:02:23.750> fill<00:02:25.600> frequency<00:02:26.600> readout<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.170> not

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
coming fill frequency readout it's not

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.100 
coming fill frequency readout it's not
quite<00:02:27.590> correct<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.120> don't<00:02:29.510> take<00:02:29.630> much<00:02:29.810> nicer

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
quite correct so don't take much nicer

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.650 
quite correct so don't take much nicer
that<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.770> tracking<00:02:31.459> soft<00:02:31.790> software<00:02:32.569> at

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
that and the tracking soft software at

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.530 
that and the tracking soft software at
the<00:02:32.720> moment<00:02:33.080> I'm<00:02:33.170> running<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.980> G<00:02:34.310> predict<00:02:37.540> and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the moment I'm running is G predict and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.650 
the moment I'm running is G predict and
the<00:02:38.780> really<00:02:39.080> are<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.450> FT<00:02:41.780> 847<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:44.360> adjust

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
the really are is the FT 847 just adjust

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.949 
the really are is the FT 847 just adjust
the<00:02:44.750> frequency<00:02:44.930> slightly<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.450> check<00:02:47.780> that

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
the frequency slightly and check that

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.530 
the frequency slightly and check that
position<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:50.530> elevation<00:02:52.300> back<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
position and elevation back to the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.110 
position and elevation back to the
screen<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.600> image<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.900> upside<00:03:00.050> down<00:03:00.940> G<00:03:01.940> with<00:03:02.060> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
screen the image is upside down G with a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:33.380 
screen the image is upside down G with a
satellite<00:03:02.390> traveling<00:03:02.920> towards<00:03:03.920> us

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.830 

I<00:03:33.420> use<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:35.360> discriminator<00:03:36.360> frequency

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
I use the discriminator frequency

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.470 
I use the discriminator frequency
discriminator<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.550> middle<00:03:38.760> we're<00:03:38.940> just

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
discriminator in the middle we're just

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.540 
discriminator in the middle we're just
there<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:40.770> tells<00:03:41.040> me<00:03:41.220> whether<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
there like this tells me whether the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.570 
there like this tells me whether the
satellites<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.180> frequency<00:03:42.950> it's<00:03:43.950> quite<00:03:44.400> handy

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
satellites on frequency it's quite handy

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.960 
satellites on frequency it's quite handy
tool<00:03:45.230> on<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.410> image<00:03:46.700> still<00:03:47.700> coming<00:03:47.940> through

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
tool on the image still coming through

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.910 
tool on the image still coming through
strong<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:53.580> there's<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.910> satellite<00:03:54.210> you<00:03:54.920> can

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
strong and there's a satellite you can

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:26.820 
strong and there's a satellite you can
make<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.220> out

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.439 

so<00:04:27.430> that's<00:04:27.610> how<00:04:27.729> you<00:04:27.789> receive<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.180> weather

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
so that's how you receive a weather

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.980 
so that's how you receive a weather
