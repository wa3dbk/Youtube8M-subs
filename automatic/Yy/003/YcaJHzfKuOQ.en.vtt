just<00:05:16.510> winning<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.200> pawn<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.680> sometimes

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
just winning the pawn it sometimes

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.540 
just winning the pawn it sometimes
happens<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:18.760> French<00:05:19.000> it<00:05:19.180> wants<00:05:19.540> I

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
happens and the French it wants I

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.740 
happens and the French it wants I
thought<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:22.150> this<00:05:23.160> this<00:05:24.160> is<00:05:24.400> pretty<00:05:24.750> pretty

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
thought so this this is pretty pretty

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.650 
thought so this this is pretty pretty
straightforward<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.210> good<00:05:28.390> thing<00:05:28.630> is

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
straightforward the the good thing is

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.110 
straightforward the the good thing is
that<00:05:28.810> also<00:05:29.500> this<00:05:29.770> is<00:05:29.920> just<00:05:30.370> a<00:05:30.550> brilliant<00:05:30.850> night

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
that also this is just a brilliant night

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.060 
that also this is just a brilliant night
it's<00:05:31.480> not<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:33.310> any<00:05:33.490> way<00:05:34.350> possible<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.770> that

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
it's not in any way possible that that

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.790 
it's not in any way possible that that
you<00:05:36.550> text<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.090> it's<00:05:37.270> just<00:05:37.650> unassailable<00:05:38.650> on

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
you text it it's just unassailable on

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.350 
you text it it's just unassailable on
the<00:05:38.950> square<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.890> if<00:05:41.890> he<00:05:42.100> if<00:05:42.310> he<00:05:42.460> takes<00:05:42.700> here<00:05:43.180> I

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
the square and if he if he takes here I

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.990 
the square and if he if he takes here I
can<00:05:43.800> yeah<00:05:44.800> computer<00:05:45.340> wants<00:05:45.580> to<00:05:45.700> take<00:05:45.880> on

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
can yeah computer wants to take on

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.800 
can yeah computer wants to take on
before<00:05:46.390> I<00:05:46.480> intended<00:05:46.930> this<00:05:47.080> move<00:05:48.570> at<00:05:49.570> least

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
before I intended this move at least

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.510 
before I intended this move at least
this<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.050> what<00:05:50.080> I<00:05:50.230> saw<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:50.710> it<00:05:50.920> is<00:05:51.100> just<00:05:51.310> an

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
this is what I saw and it is just an

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.150 
this is what I saw and it is just an
extra<00:05:51.850> porn<00:05:52.120> it's<00:05:52.360> not<00:05:52.510> much<00:05:53.160> compensation

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
extra porn it's not much compensation

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.130 
extra porn it's not much compensation
for<00:05:54.700> white<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:57.850> comp<00:05:58.180> actually<00:05:58.750> wants<00:05:59.080> to

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
for white the comp actually wants to

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.670 
for white the comp actually wants to
take<00:05:59.650> here<00:06:00.300> yeah<00:06:01.300> why<00:06:01.570> not<00:06:01.780> this<00:06:02.110> is<00:06:02.260> probably

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
take here yeah why not this is probably

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.630 
take here yeah why not this is probably
even<00:06:02.860> bateria<00:06:03.570> understandable<00:06:05.640> something

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
even bateria understandable something

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.800 
even bateria understandable something
like<00:06:06.820> this

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.500 

yeah<00:06:10.810> why<00:06:11.110> Dwight<00:06:11.380> can<00:06:11.650> continue<00:06:12.250> but<00:06:13.030> it's

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
yeah why Dwight can continue but it's

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.280 
yeah why Dwight can continue but it's
really<00:06:13.720> just<00:06:13.810> a<00:06:14.139> pawn<00:06:14.380> I<00:06:15.210> have<00:06:16.210> many<00:06:16.840> pawns

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
really just a pawn I have many pawns

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.840 
really just a pawn I have many pawns
move<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:17.919> making<00:06:18.190> is<00:06:18.840> slightly<00:06:19.840> exposed<00:06:20.320> but

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
move so making is slightly exposed but

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.340 
move so making is slightly exposed but
this<00:06:21.850> can<00:06:22.150> be<00:06:22.270> a<00:06:22.300> problem<00:06:22.600> in<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.840> Blitz<00:06:23.050> game

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
this can be a problem in the Blitz game

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.340 
this can be a problem in the Blitz game
but<00:06:23.560> objectively<00:06:24.400> this<00:06:25.210> should<00:06:25.780> be<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:25.960> billing

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
but objectively this should be a billing

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.220 
but objectively this should be a billing
winning<00:06:26.830> position<00:06:27.040> almost<00:06:27.810> yeah<00:06:28.810> thanks<00:06:29.169> for
