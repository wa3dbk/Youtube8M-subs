00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.019

 the basic things are est vs kinks 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.859
 indeed applications that he has taken care of all important to me is never the same 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.309

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.639
 interest 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.770
 in short I must say that this genre that was really mantua because 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.080
 except this time when 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.910
 self-esteem from who knows what I had to simply turn off and on the 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.909
 phone went usually all right london did it all with one 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.770
 gesture 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.419
 I must say that advisable 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.029
 no problems at all 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:49.389
 and only some people with a a4 fund have encountered problems 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.430
 and for 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.580
 as for the use of fil they are together 3gs confirmation communion 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:02.120

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.610

 how do you say 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.930
 as we said before, I advise everyone to go to the fifth solution 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.409
 general phone settings 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.849
 air seychelles repeat command also select restore settings 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.210

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.599

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.220
 easystanza seems to be the previous summary next not to be 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.250
 available 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.529
 made this small 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.839
 it is a trick or final and not from the schemes 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.229
 + water problems. 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:54.339

 I don't even know any nicer about going back to the basic phone settings 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.270
 it will simply be enough 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.979
 by asking if you follow the restoration 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.119

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.319
