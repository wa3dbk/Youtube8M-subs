good<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.590> rank<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:03.559> one<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> few<00:01:05.010> ways

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
good to rank on it's one of the few ways

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.530

light<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.680> best<00:01:07.860> thing<00:01:07.979> about<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
light and the best thing about it is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
light and the best thing about it is
just<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> spell<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.869> activate<00:01:10.110> a

that<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:21.930> opinion<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.380> two<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.650> those<00:01:22.740> ya

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that was my opinion on two of those ya

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990 
that was my opinion on two of those ya
thinks<00:01:23.909> all<00:01:24.000> charges<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> atoms<00:01:25.640> no<00:01:26.640> not

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
thinks all charges on the atoms no not

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
thinks all charges on the atoms no not
this<00:01:27.119> format<00:01:27.750> probably<00:01:28.049> next<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.530> my

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this format probably next one in my

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.480 
this format probably next one in my
opinion<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.060> came<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:30.689> yeah

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
opinion it just came out you know yeah

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.950 
opinion it just came out you know yeah
so<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.909> game<00:01:33.299> breaking<00:01:33.950> like<00:01:34.950> how

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
