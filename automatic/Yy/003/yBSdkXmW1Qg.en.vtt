you<00:02:01.649> got<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.369> put<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.759> security

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you got to do is put in the security

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.580 
you got to do is put in the security
code<00:02:03.479> which<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.290> three

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
code which is going to be the three

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
code which is going to be the three
digits<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.579> back<00:02:05.729> depending<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.659> card

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
digits on the back depending what card

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
digits on the back depending what card
is<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.350> sometimes<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.160> believe<00:02:08.459> from

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
is I think sometimes I believe from

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.729 
is I think sometimes I believe from
American<00:02:09.060> Express<00:02:09.360> has<00:02:09.599> four<00:02:09.899> four<00:02:10.379> digits

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
American Express has four four digits

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.730 
American Express has four four digits
for<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.009> security<00:02:11.459> code<00:02:11.750> once<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
for the security code once you do that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.400 
for the security code once you do that
you'll<00:02:13.920> simply<00:02:14.070> hit<00:02:14.340> next<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.880> then<00:02:15.600> we'll<00:02:16.110> go

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
you'll simply hit next and then we'll go

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.980 
you'll simply hit next and then we'll go
back<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:17.100> then<00:02:17.640> we'll<00:02:17.850> actually<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:18.870> we

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
wanted to cover as far as the video goes

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.690 
wanted to cover as far as the video goes
kind<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.600> like<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.810> blog<00:04:21.020> style<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.620> video<00:04:22.370> where
