mounting<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.340> simple<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> clamp

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
mounting it is simple there's a clamp

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
mounting it is simple there's a clamp
that<00:00:54.570> goes<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> side<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> tank<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that goes on the side of the tank you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310 
that goes on the side of the tank you
can<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> comes<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.480> two<00:00:57.750> aqua<00:00:58.140> bus

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
can see that it comes with two aqua bus

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
can see that it comes with two aqua bus
ports<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.309> every<00:00:59.670> apex<00:01:00.059> module<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.809> can

ports like every apex module you can

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
ports like every apex module you can
daisy-chain<00:01:01.379> other<00:01:01.800> items<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.699> case<00:01:02.969> would

daisy-chain other items this case would

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
daisy-chain other items this case would
be<00:01:03.270> likely<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.809> only<00:01:03.989> thing<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> daisy

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
be likely the only thing that you daisy

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.160 
be likely the only thing that you daisy
chain<00:01:05.309> off<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.700> module<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> second

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
chain off this module would be a second

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.350 
chain off this module would be a second
