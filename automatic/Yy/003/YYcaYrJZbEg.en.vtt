as we as we move on to our shorter

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.779 
as we as we move on to our shorter
blades<00:00:34.190> around<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.610> edges

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.310

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.969 

little<00:01:16.690> bit<00:01:16.899> different<00:01:17.289> growth<00:01:17.500> pattern<00:01:17.890> in

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
little bit different growth pattern in

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.590 
little bit different growth pattern in
the<00:01:18.069> right<00:01:18.280> corner<00:01:18.759> so<00:01:18.909> I'm<00:01:19.030> going<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.330> what

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
Clipper this way which is going to make

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.880 
Clipper this way which is going to make
it<00:01:23.409> a<00:01:23.440> little<00:01:23.590> bit<00:01:23.770> longer<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.310> just<00:01:25.179> try<00:01:25.450> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it a little bit longer and just try to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.050 
it a little bit longer and just try to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
we're going to close the blade half way

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.149 
we're going to close the blade half way
I'm<00:01:36.640> going<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.789> do<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.970> same<00:01:37.149> thing

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
I'm going to do the same thing

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:52.649 
I'm going to do the same thing
not<00:01:39.159> go<00:01:39.310> as<00:01:39.490> high

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.399 

and<00:01:53.200> work<00:01:53.409> our<00:01:53.590> way<00:01:53.619> back<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.189> left<00:01:54.430> side

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and work our way back to the left side

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.990

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
so we're going to start in the center

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.040 
so we're going to start in the center

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.870 

to<00:02:04.560> cook<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.890> pretty<00:02:05.160> sharp<00:02:05.400> so<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.730> don't

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to cook for pretty sharp so we don't

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.250

have<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.390> too<00:02:06.570> far<00:02:08.930> and<00:02:09.930> you<00:02:10.020> want<00:02:10.200> to

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
have to go in too far and you want to

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.960 
have to go in too far and you want to
work<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.770> hairline<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.220> you're<00:02:11.610> given

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
work with the hairline that you're given

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.570 
work with the hairline that you're given
not<00:02:12.630> everybody<00:02:13.170> has<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.740> thickest<00:02:14.130> hairline

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
not everybody has the thickest hairline

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.210 
not everybody has the thickest hairline
and<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.600> leaves<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.140> darkest<00:02:16.590> line<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.160> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and it leaves the darkest line so you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
and it leaves the darkest line so you
want<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.550> make<00:02:17.670> sure<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.090> don't<00:02:18.300> go<00:02:18.420> too
