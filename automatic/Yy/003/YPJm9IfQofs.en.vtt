00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 3 types 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.280
 Hello, everyone is a disaster regular drummer today 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.830
 A novel in one measure 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:26.640
 I would like to practice to get the count of the branch while feeling the white version 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.640
 Half white edition 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.300
 It is a clumsy novel 2 a time until RyuRyu RyuRyu the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:40.059
 Half white and half 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.059
 Half further edition of its half of the branch 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.990
 It is for 16 ordinary husband three 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.440
 I will practice for a while so I can get the count of the branch while hitting this 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.570
 W 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.600
 Follow 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.600
 2 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.050
 It would be great if this could be done 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:31.030
 Half sweet 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.900
 It was a bit thin but it was 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.900
 Standing standing 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:46.620
 So as not to lose sight of the novel even in the novel to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.610
 Let's practice to keep counting the branch 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 Let's try it 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.659
 Pan 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.799
 4 e 4 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.750
 The 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 Putsu 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.069
 Have 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.940
 a 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.560
 eh 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.490
 As count is kept out 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.760
 That's fine 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.319
 Nde g unprocessed is large 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.319
 I have to say in a loud voice 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.769
 The point is that you can afford a little loud voice 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.360
 Let it go 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:18.750
 Please practice so that the count of the branch is clearly felt with loud voice 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.180
 That especially with half-handed or phrase 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.180
 There are so many Phil countryside that you can hear 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.210
 If you can not feel the branch there 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.160
 Please practice by all means because it will be a mess 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:39.220
 People who say that Garry is difficult to accent if they can not feel it 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.310
 You can start with clap 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.290
 This is 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.100
 Bill 2 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.470
 Say 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.270
 Package day 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.810
 Even if you start with the clapping 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:02.230
 I think it's good 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.230
 Please try by all means to practice at the Tsu Jarre up here today 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:11.250
