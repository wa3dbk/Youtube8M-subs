00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:11.769
 Let's go a 3 points on a straight line with the vector 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:13.870
 It's quite easy here , but it's easy to find it at the Oe of management without some of the vectors , but in fact 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.340
 It is not so difficult 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:24.220
 Because parallel conditions and great conditions are similar 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:27.490
 When such Now study the number and say what it three points abp is on a straight line 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.520
 What kind of hint is often used in one-handed vector 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.230
 That's what I said, but as already written here 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.360
 Ap Victory black t multiple of ab ab when abp is on the straight line Te Concern 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.750
 If you make it as a vector, it often works well 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.270
 I will 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.040
 This is by far Tsu immediately seen and do you think the high 3 abp Te is on a straight line When viewed in FIG. 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.320
 When 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:54.360
 ap vector is 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:59.040
 but it is that Rutte and how many cups is that the tea by tea piece of ab vector 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.720
 The auction is a little bit different The character may be another key or whatever , but the important thing is ap 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.150
 Such a relationship holds when the vector is a cup of ab 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.220
 is not it 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:13.040
 It works well if you use this hint . Of course ab vector is t 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.100
 Even if the ab vector 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:22.090
 bp vector anyway be anything you burns say is from this kind of pictorial image 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 ap vector is ab vector of t bar or abp vector is t 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:31.299
 You're going to meet the bar's ap or just build that image 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.899
 I be in any Results are in abp floor on a straight line in Tsu anyway san do come together 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.390
 If you say 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:38.840
 ap vector is like ab vector t times t 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.190
 There is no problem at all if you tell the way of the hint 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.400
 Let's take a look at Car Furuichi by saying that the braces first to vector = a vector 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.100
 When op is 4-33 opp ob vector b 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:56.300
 try to prove that p is on ab 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:02:02.030
 I think also look at the hint idea of this problem b able to say ab field 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.920
 Three points abp are straight lines. Three points app are straight lines are ap vectors. 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.020
 = t times ab vector 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.729
 After ap vector ab Beikutoroku be done to put taking advantage Namba it Ya another system 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.810
 It will be judged 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.900
 So the goal is to first ask for ap vector numbers and Lotte 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.170
 So you are calculating the ab vector 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.240
 I Is it ok also I will have him doing another This Na 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:32.320
 The app vector can be transformed after finishing op 4 wards before backtracking 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.180
 This is also how to get used to the cross anyway anyway 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:41.900
 ap is calculated so it can be much op flight before backtracking to 3-3 b 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 Just like ab vectra ob flying and from b- 8 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.580
 That ap vector 3-3 b ab vector b - to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:55.290
 I think you have been to this three-fold 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.090
 That Beku three times the ab vectors and I was told this by also ap of the Beku ap 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.600
 Those in which the ab to 3 times the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.480
 I could prove it because this form was done 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.950
 It is a kind of flow 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:12.470
 The point of this problem is the other 10 p is to see that say there is on a straight line shrimp 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:16.670
 abap call t bar ab 8 aim at this shape aim at this shape 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:22.550
 If you can judge that way, the answer is almost complete 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:28.730
 The second is also similar 3. If abc is on a straight line, the specified is the value of the constant a 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:32.020
 Hato also ac room is t times ab because 3 points abc are on a straight line 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:37.090
 If it is a vector, you will use this frequency 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.670
 Character of ab is p times of eac Toka bc even Which Yu's t plum 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.090
 It's good, all the answers will be together 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:49.490
 I to Fu say it is any one doing that anyway in the 3-point ab 4 floor on a straight line 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:55.670
 Imagine this figure and catch up on how to use such hints 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:57.260
 The rest is already a component c What is vector is this also at the component of the vector 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.950
 I will study again and again 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.920
 Please review one ingredient from the persimmon 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:11.080
 Coacey vector will be inside a +1 before backtracking 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:15.860
 Hey b this vector is also the same, and when it comes to the old holy dragon , this western part is very 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:20.759
 People know this is divided it at the base, please review this video as component 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:26.840
 The rest is that t by of this is equal, so it can be said that an expression can be done like this 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:31.620
 And is calculated vehicle height I So this = Correa said this = comes to this 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.180
 Now with a +13 t and a negative ad + 10 p 8 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:40.680
 Because there are two expressions in two letters, this equation is absolutely applied 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.729
 It in the wet keep kana Well best with a sword City = form of 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:49.180
 If you assign to the 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:54.009
 T that after but I was quadratic equation was calculated is from the house to that of 3 minutes on a single of the round 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:57.909
 When t is seems I get the answer to Fu Tteyuu issue of movie 4 t Ganu when love when 5/3 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:02.720
 Is it ok I a is I 4 and the answer is there are two from 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:08.240
 So I 'm the king of vector figures here, but in fact 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:13.040
 It's not difficult . 3 points in a straight line with the vector, ie 3 points app is in a straight line 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.430
 When is like great expression of this parallel to the ab 9 of ap vector Iikoro t bar 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.730
 Ne 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:21.520
 Was the place Tteyuu'll go well if things like Tteyuu 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.520
 Let's practice firm can do with it is after Nohinto
