thing you can get basically from these

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.750 
thing you can get basically from these
creeks<00:02:54.450> ease<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.069> that<00:02:56.069> that's<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:56.489> amazing

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
creeks ease and that that's just amazing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.780

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
to a different platform over here

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.490 
to a different platform over here
because<00:03:02.609> it's<00:03:02.760> getting<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.209> bit<00:03:03.239> crowded<00:03:03.690> over

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
because it's getting a bit crowded over

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.550 
because it's getting a bit crowded over
all<00:03:04.799> over<00:03:05.010> there<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:06.170> let's<00:03:07.170> see<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.500> can
