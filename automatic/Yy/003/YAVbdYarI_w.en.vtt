00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 seems small to us 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.600

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.860

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.770

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:16.209

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.370
 Daddy are the heavy landu click crickets 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:27.890

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:35.510
 Look, it's there and what the noise is. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:38.390
 and if I do not know long of my belly 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.130

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.459
 it's time to eat 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.459

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.390

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.829

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.019

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.480
 night for the evening papa night party 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.970

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.400
 Mother Pepe Jorge is sleeping in the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.310
 tent dad is sleeping underneath 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.739
 of the stars 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.000
 I love to sing in the open air with 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.620
 the stars up there 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.549
 I think it was not such a good idea. 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.850

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.470

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.910
 There is a delight in the tent to 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.190
 father's father's road is gone 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.990

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:03.650

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:16.770

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.690
 I'm an expert at camping 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:26.960

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.960
