00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.199
 Video here that good Rodat silva and pretend 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:55.679
 that the espionage game similar to a 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.589
 007 his name is project eg and it's a 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.170
 first person shooter fps it 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.879
 was distributed by interactive errors 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.350
 in 2008 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.409
 this time the thing will play the version here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.080
 beta of the game the beta is only has 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 phase and the full version has 10 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
 beauty phases 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.100
 It's finally a spy game so you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.100
 You have to be cautious when playing in my case. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:27.479
 here is bullet caution 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:33.210
 so is the guy in the dust 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.790
 the one that died right? 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.259
 I've already stolen every team and get smart 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.479
 Back to the game guys, how can you? 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.710
 realizing the dynamics of the game is not 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.789
 action because it is a game of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.039
 espionage then you have to try 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.780
 sneak enemies enemies 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.729
 will have to wear binoculars will end 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 the radar that they're showing 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.759
 you a radar 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.590
 so it's a really strategy game you 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.550
 have to try to kill the enemies in 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.550
 vichy see ozanan know that every weapon with 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.569
 a muffler and you have a screen like that 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.729
 In the game you will also have to 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.259
 disable some cameras so that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.819
 when you leave outside 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.470
 enemies may not have the chance to 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.549
 see through cameras neither so attractive 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.660

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.030
