00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.770
 move all guys how are you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.779
 welcome a say to the channel and good 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.840
 today I extract the first skill episode 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.549
 science and good in the background as you can 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.900
 see good because they are all players 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.429
 what files it costs a little bit like that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.170
 fast camera so you can see well 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.680
 how much did they cost me and how was it going 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.600
 putting and good simply worth in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.880
 this video was explained I will bring three 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.370
 videos per game in what decided 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.450
 I think it's pretty good work 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.990
 of the video will be approximately 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.730
 between 6 and 8 minutes I do not want 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.679
 lengthen so much so that they do not come out 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.230
 tired and I'm going to do an edition 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:41.010
 quite correct I believe at the time of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 let's say watch it to be more 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.289
 entertaining more colorful not good here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.600
 You see already how I think this is the last 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.100
 indeed worth this is the last thing 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.989
 signed and well here you see the template that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.089
 I honestly makes me a template 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.399
 I'm good looking and looking 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.159
 and well I decided to throw for the Christian of 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.960
 bronze what the good area tells me and 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.540
 Well, the bronze tournament has me 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.410
 start you'll see what happened to me 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.760
 and good in the first game the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.230
 equipment is yes it is true that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.120
 they seemed pretty but the first team 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.370
 that it was my turn, yes, it is true that 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.640
 it was so good and here you see the first 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.280
 opportunity that I had in practically al 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.620
 start the game no and there you see how it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.760
 get if it is practically alone against 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.400
 the goalkeeper and the fault 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.410
 I do not know how that could fail but good the 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.630
 karma was going to cure me with this great goal 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.030
 of zico there you see how I make the threat of 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.930
 rabona I put with a roulette a tail 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.210
 of cow gold award and this and the nail and 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.280
 Well, I put the bells there 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.540
 with the challenges that I have achieved that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.090
 in this case it has been to score a goal 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.030
 doing skills and put one of three 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.220
 goals I get good little by little little to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.200
 little boy saybe is the second goal that 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.090
 he took the ball from the goalkeeper that good 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.040
 yes it is true that I had a little 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 of luck but good, you always have to 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.900
 Be attentive for these occasions 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.210
 and here you see the third goal in the head and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.820
 You see a super loose ball I said that 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.470
 does not enter but if I enter or for a defense 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.180
 of bronze that I love is not 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.830
 I see it a brutality and good 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.410
 I just put it here to camera 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.930
 fast more or less the whole game the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.810
 second part as it was going I was arriving 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.270
 we went up balonazo up that the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.750
 pulled and again I was back to attack 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.730
 I always tried to see if I could do 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.610
 some play and you see me platinum in 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.320
 in front of the goalkeeper there is another against 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.720
 and well I think that's how it is 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.400
 entertaining to see a little the second 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.390
 part although he arrived there were no goals in 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.730
 the second there was no luck 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.110
 there you see the result 0 3 in the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.230
 first match that I think is 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.310
 pretty good and as you can see pulls the cable 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.310
 in the middle of the part 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.120
 well, nothing second game, yes 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.829
 that gave me a little bit of anger because 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.159
 I knew I was going to have half a party 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.379
 less and I was costing quite a bit 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.629
 let's say to your goal but good 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.849
 I said let's continue we will not continue 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.299
 with the quarterfinals if in the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.579
 equivocal and there you see the córdoba fc yes 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.310
 that brings a team a team a team 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:18.040
 In this case, I think that the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.560
 Spanish second division and good and you see 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.599
 I'm going to take advantage of that failure 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.330
 defense let's say again with tired the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.880
 it 's December and good to put that goal 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.950
 that it was not a shot a pass or I mean 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.330
 It really was a pass because it stuck 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.180
 in memory the pass and good but at 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.950
 final was goal and there is another goal that I 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.790
 loved it since I related to all 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.219
 but well nothing happens 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.739
 and the key still is that I have a 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.390
 little bit of fortune when he regained that 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.670
 ball in the area but good I think 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.290
 it was quite good the goal has not 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.079
 been entirely clean but hey this 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.920
 it's okay you see the counter that makes me 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:59.099
 and see there the pass is pasted up and 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.010
 as it does not define fruit in the definition of 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.359
 the bronzes against the goalkeepers of 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.980
 bronze obviously because so the 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.439
 I tried the bronzes once I did not like them 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.000
 but now I'm loving the truth 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.090
 is that boy has created me several plays 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.180
 several pretty good times and one and 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.840
 you are going to see another chance of mine 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.849
 good since after the pass to the hole as 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.920
 do not push me inland I do the 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:29.310
 roulette and eye penalti eye penalti 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.400
 so good redirect that takes him out 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.530
 defense and I saying then nothing panenka 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.630
 we're going from that goal I do not know if 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.630
 tell it like Vaseline and you'll tell me in 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.820
 the comments since I find it curious 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.800
 and there you see the result of the match 13 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.410
 again practically nothing more than 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.139
 stand out in this game and we go with the 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.850
 last game today we will see if 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.880
 we reach the final we are in 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.610
 semifinals we are about to arrive 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.130
 there and see how hard it is to find 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.860
 rival and good when I find it not 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.840
 accepted and well you see the team that 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.600
 it takes me the tri balconies practically 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.180
 without penetrating and I said good I think that 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.479
 I think you can and there you see the first 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:19.789
 the first strongest occasion I had and 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:22.940
 as it separates us it happened and the nail and the 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.250
 mister tired going very good very good in the 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.530
 team another of passes milestone but good yo 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.080
 I think this has not been so so so 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.620
 exaggerated ducklings and well there you go 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.220
 see how another rejects I see it clear with 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.500
 cançó and I say I'm going to throw 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.120
 the goalie stops it but good good 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.310
 song shot and the truth as I say 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.010
 has a very good definition and they see the 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.300
 first part 01 second part I the 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.300
 I've been there with eric stolen and 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.599
 vaseline 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.999
 there it is and good then the first goal that 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:01.020
 he gets me he's this corner is I think 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:04.680
 that he did not have I was not so lucky but 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.479
 well that's what there is and eye is eye 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.879
 there the defensive failure that happens and 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.270
 how it bursts us and nothing is impossible 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.879
 stop that and it arrived arrived by its 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.439
 goal but could not get started 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.900
 weird things happen and we get to the 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:20.969
 92 minute extension 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.430
 there you see how I go wrong again 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.920
 defensively in the passes hit the e1 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.230
 triangle to the rebound goal 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.300
 nothing guys the party the truth is that 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.030
 it ended like that it gave me a lot of anger because 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.730
 he had come much more than him like today 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.190
 we have a goal with five simply 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.660
 we have to score two more goals and good 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.670
 now I'm going to put you say the 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.150
 challenges completed and as you can see 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:49.300
 we have made a vaseline we have 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:53.280
 put a goal with five we are missing and 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.280
 well we have also got 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:59.860
 the goal of doing skills and also 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:02.809
 we had the opportunity to do the 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.879
 Chilean or the scissors but yes that is 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:06.499
 true that I did think two in these 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:08.449
 three parties and both of them were 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:10.699
 out so in the next chapter 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:14.029
 we will go top with vaseline to 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.829
 top with cicu and top with the cope 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:19.309
 gentlemen but you liked the first 

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:21.439
 chapter good let's say the first of the 

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:23.360
 series since the other was introduction the 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:25.219
 second chapter of this series and nothing 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.809
 guys little more to say thank you very much 

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:29.739
 for having seen the video and see you in 

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:29.739
 the next goodbye
