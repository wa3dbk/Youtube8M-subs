00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.330
 so people welcome to one 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.520
 new video with me in the channel 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.529
 finally it is time for me to finally 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.869
 the rest speak old swede was that 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.060
 a damn long time as I wait 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.769
 I had to sign an end 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.869
 that I do not talk about it though 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.489
 Now I can finally talk about it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 I was in Los two weeks ago 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.100
 angeles at the developer studio infinity 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.300
 Wards was able to call the new call of duty 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.870
 ghosts together with the extension mode so 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 to play the new alien mode and man 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.739
 I must honestly say it was me 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 do not know such a right finger 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.730
 itch, where i said basti now 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.440
 I have to talk about it 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.710
 it is so if you have the opportunity 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.809
 to upload something on youtube 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.549
 Of course it's like you should 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.710
 You really say if you like this one 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.240
 this fingertip has it like this 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.760
 but I have to go over now 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.650
 what to say and what this new mode 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.600
 extension is just such a mode of is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.970
 really cool 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.880
 and it was so we were four speak 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:31.860
 elliot imada gary cooper there and just me 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.020
 We were able to lead the first mode 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.590
 So it's going to be this mode 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 play 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.640
 it got full for the first time 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.790
 public so shown in front of people 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 and also played the background 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.049
 excerpts you can see that are gameplay 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 scenes with all the people there 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.119
 played and we have a total 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.270
 I think I played three rounds of that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.130
 new mode it was just that we 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 have repeatedly tried these waves 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.079
 to insist so the mode is similar 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 built up of the new song so the old one 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.500
 zombie mode 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.000
 But you can now work with class 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.640
 it does not work that way anymore 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.300
 but it is similar now but stop 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.090
 something else 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.650
 So you have to say 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.709
 Something new is no longer so that 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 old that says after ten choose 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.080
 It will always be the same 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.590
 you have it we have three times 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.800
 played 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.879
 you have so had the emotion each round 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.989
 every new round was a bit different 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.519
 different one could also one 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.739
 take different class 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.410
 it is so there are different 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.610
 Classes and there are the weapons 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.920
 Specialists the tank that is 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.019
 In the end, that means the people 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.120
 can take the most damage 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.670
 then there are the engineers so then 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.349
 so can repair the drill 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.180
 means you always have to have one 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.760
 carry drill from one place to another 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.720
 and let one of these lines line 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.120
 to ruin 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.160
 then there is also the medic who can 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.959
 can invigorate ally faster 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.379
 there are also so points one man 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.450
 can use where to get his skills 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.950
 This is improved during the game 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.739
 definitely very cool 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.799
 because it does a bit too 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.079
 the whole more attractive now you will 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.090
 say 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:17.150
 choosing amy mode sounds pretty pretty 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.040
 similarly yes it is that's just only 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.650
 something different again because you completely 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.850
 honestly you have to have news 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.069
 installed such as for example 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.859
 quickly this class system again 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.170
 can now better action separately 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.209
 I thought it was a bit difficult 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.099
 in zombie mode somewhere when you have everything 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.870
 what did you do now and here 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.370
 is it so you have the possibility then 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.810
 to get ahead, for example, against 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.430
 to fight endbosses 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.700
 there is also something we, for example 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.349
 he has seen it will continue in the future 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.370
 gameplay increasingly crass realities 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.109
 give opponents 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.599
 But we did not go there 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.299
 can betray what a blatant alien 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.579
 adversary it is there I have so munkeln 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.440
 that there will be a track as 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.560
 elli mutated is because we also have one 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.099
 other dinosaurs in the gameplay 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.620
 have seen 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.829
 I'm really curious so I am 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.790
 really curious how this mode 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.700
 I think it will work again 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.569
 Some easter eggs give the one 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.389
 Can be found 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.310
 on the other side it is like that too 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.870
 also gives in this new mode 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.919
 hidden things on the floor 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.889
 lie about 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.150
 that means you can with any 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.560
 looking for environment that is if there the 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.310
 rubbish for example is one can in this 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.440
 looking for garbage 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.330
 that's really cool because you too 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.070
 possibility have your environment for you 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.840
 to use one can also weapons again 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.790
 buy so the system you know yes 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.370
 already from the other call of duty 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.260
 Share that you go to the wall or to 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.360
 goes to a box buys weapons 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.120
 Ammunition or something like that is for example 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.560
 also so one can throw ammunition boxes 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.210
 that means it's not like that anymore 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.800
 before that you only have ammo 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.680
 can buy at the weapon but it 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.229
 can one of the team, for example, ammunition 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.210
 buy and then throw the box down 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.400
 that, of course, facilitates the whole for 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.630
 the team you can jump then 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 buy ammunition 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.020
 that's just everything from several 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.360
 levels possible that means one level then 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.570
 also slowly but surely so this 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.790
 level system was indeed in the tommy 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.169
 mode also in shape but has one 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.090
 nothing brought anywhere except that 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.120
 they say I have more now 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.200
 skull as before 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.120
 That's the first thing I like, for example 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.100
 interesting because that makes of course 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.870
 also the character of two video playing 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.520
 thing I had to reach the 10 o'clock 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.130
 for example, to unlock the weapon 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.780
 These are all things that find 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.250
 I definitely encourage someone 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.690
 to continue playing and have me 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.600
 personally liked very much 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.340
 that's the way i will be even if you 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.010
 Bock has this mode show times 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.500
 so more in detail it is so we may 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.360
 So today with the embargo 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.220
 this game is on the playstation 4 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.169
 So the console was created in 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.760
 the shape does not mean that is 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.380
 not allowed in any case before all 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.440
 the whole game and in any case before 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.180
 all the whole upload 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.610
 that means we play this mode 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.650
 may and I'm really curious how 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.880
 it pleases you out there write me 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.130
 but a comment on the new 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.220
 Mode under you have bock on the 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.700
 new mode yes or no write times 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.669
 underneath 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.669
 until next time different servos
