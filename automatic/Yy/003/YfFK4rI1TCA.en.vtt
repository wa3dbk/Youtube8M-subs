00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.840
 poblanos I do 8 in the morning 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.289

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.850
 here form dita look north inhabit 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.939
 well after a few hours it is for rendered 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.220
 fruits far away active and dashing 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.990
 the national flag appeared cut by 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.049
 the first contingent that opened the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.299
 parade were the military and marines that 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.440
 for almost an hour they took the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.440
 palms of own and strangers 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.570
 special assault forces plan dn3 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.430
 rescuers with camouflage and without the walking 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.460
 or on board their military vehicles 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.909
 sergeants and soldiers dazzled 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.360
 to the attendees everything I liked 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.250
 but the military hands special mention 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.140
 deserves the historical contingent of the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.509
 militia and is that through their 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.060
 new account elements seem 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.480
 come to life the army of the east and the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.480
 French 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.069
 3 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.510
 because the poblanos can and will 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.299
 we broke will add to the brand 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.610
 The military must take as the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.939
 beautiful is the most beautiful 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.810
 there is a great emotion names one hundred you 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.129
 go the vibes you feel that emotion 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.799
 while elegance and martial 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.530
 of the marines not only brought out the 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.989
 nationalism of the poblanos at every step 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.829
 that they gave also made another flower flourish 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.829
 kind of occasions 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.440
 in case it was little to step firm and with 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.630
 eagles in hand the cadets of the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.230
 naval school also showed off 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.230
 its attributes 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.790
 and as here what it was about was 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.670
 to please everyone for the gentlemen 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.650
 there was also where to choose with gala and 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.020
 grace naval school nurses 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.870
 they made hearts vibrate and cough 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.720
 more than one of the very beautiful nurses 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.080
 all in her very beautiful face until the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.390
 base everything is very beautiful but as in 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.720
 everything here was not missing who messed up 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.720
 the best said to advance the step 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.670
 but the show was not only in 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.680
 land military aircraft plowed the 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.830
 Poblano sky under the amazement of guys 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.830
 and big 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.340
 I finish the military contingent but the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.260
 parade continued behind them les 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.200
 followed more than six thousand students 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.030
 of the school contingent the first in 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.690
 appear for the members of the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.690
 war band 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.410
 the floats followed 24 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.720
 that told the story of 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.000
 populate since the discovery of corn 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.610
 the conquest of the baroque people and 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.500
 course the battle that covered the weapons 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.770
 national glory 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.900
 Wonderful, I'm glad that I do not know 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.540
 lose the roots of our country 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.780
 every year I come to enjoy this 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.400
 beautiful destiny 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.490
 I do not miss it 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.889
 it's a tradition of my land people 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.120
 a lot of emotion 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:23.360
 do not get inspired 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.950
 I would like city like this throughout 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.260
 the three and a half kilometers of 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.390
 traveled each of these children and 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.850
 young people will give their best to 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:36.700
 Mexico and remind the world 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.700
 triumph of that afternoon in 1862 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.540
 whereas, like every year, 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.280
 music bands of the centers 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.470
 schoolchildren put the 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.580
 spectators with themes like the huapango 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.440
 of moncayo 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.770
 Guadalajara and the 'cielito lindo' between 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.770
 others 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.270
 two 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:20.880
 and all this the war bands and so 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.610
 because it is that it is very beautiful 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.770
 the drums and so there were even those who 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.530
 after seeing happen here we poblana 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.290
 zacapoaxtlas and caneoneras remembered their 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.210
 Young years but I paraded when I was 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.310
 in high school and it feels very nice 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:40.760
 I remember my youth my adolescence 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.790
 Well, more than the truth, it feels to be 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.920
 poblano was how this 5 of 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.710
 May the streets of the city of the 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.080
 angels who were filled with joy and 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:55.810
 color with images of giovanni palmas 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.810
