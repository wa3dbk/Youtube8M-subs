00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.730
 If I receive a sum of money for an inheritance 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:20.050
 how do I not leap so that what I acquire with this sum of money that 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.900
 I received 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.259
 for example bought the house will not be part of conjugal partnership 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.319

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.440
 and after tomorrow 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680
 it separates me 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.120
 that real estate 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.470
 I acquired it before marriage 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.170
 and therefore 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 does not enter society 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.710
 second 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.500
 yes i am married today 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.870
 today I'm married 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 and tomorrow, Friday, if I get married 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.700
 on Saturday 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.650
 acquire a real estate 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.730
 free of charge 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.730
 how is the donation or is the inheritance 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 does not enter the conjugal society either 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.480
 I'm married 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.040
 and tomorrow my father dies 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 and it's my turn to inherit a money 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010
 let's say that money 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.410
 the ape and it would not be to be able to well them those 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.020
 of the berzo 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.080
 uu social goods 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 at the moment that I receive the money 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.590
 being married 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.510
 I receive the inheritance money 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.360
 and I go for you bought a house 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.640
 at that moment 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.620
 I'm buying 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.900
 in symbian property 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.100
 I'm buying what 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.780
 with money and therefore that property they want to return 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.460
 if it would happen to be 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.119
 of the social vega 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.849
 today those social assets at the moment that there is a dissolution and liquidation 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.969
 of that conjugal society 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.749
 the question then that they make us a user is 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.059
 is married 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.969
 will receive a money as an inheritance 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.059
 but with that money 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.609
 is going to buy a house 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.799
 and he wants that house not to enter the conjugal society 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.219
 a very difficult conflict 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.169
 if he bought the house with that money for the mind as I said mantra to see 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.389
 Social 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.989
 unless 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.739
 there are two alternatives the first 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.519
 when they were married, capitulations were constituted and in the capitulation 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.389
 agreed expressly to demonstrate capitulations a mutual agreement 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.309
 between the two between the spouses 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.959
 in the capitulations 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.099
 patrimonial was agreed 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.029
 that money 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.029
 jump to receive free 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.199
 as a donation 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.219
 as a donation for example an inheritance 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:18.129
 that money and what is bought with that money will not enter the social market if 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.729
 That remained in the capitulations 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.989
 because we should exclude 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.989
 and there is a second alternative 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.669
 I really do not share it 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.359
 mela report that he considered that he is a person who also handles very well 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:33.879
 topic 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.279
 telesur consulting 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.139
 but I say it and I repeat it with all due respect 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.469
 I can allow you this idea but I share it 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.329
 you tell me another expert on law issues 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.819
 st when you receive the money 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.599
 that married man 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.349
 that immediately constituted cdt and I never copied it 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.339
 until the day people dissolve that marriage after it sometimes I've 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.700
 made that divorce that dissolution and liquidation now yes 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.739
 become a veto money and never had to partition it 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.229
 I do not share that thesis but I pass it on 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.609
 fandÃ³s that will soon be alternative 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.979
 because anyway 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.829
 the money I feel the marriage 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.120
 because when the judge or the notary distributes the money 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:22.970
 I'm sorry 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.520
 when physically if I have to move to a bank to constitute a 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.029
 cdt at that time 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:31.419
 uu 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.050
 a better income 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.629
 to my estate that money 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.610
 and the fact that a cdt is constituted does not mean that that money is outside 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.689
 of my heritage is still my heritage and how it is here in the 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.710
 marriage would be part of the conjugal partnership at the time of dissolution 

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:50.969
 and liquidation
