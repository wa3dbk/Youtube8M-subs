00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.650 

clear<00:05:11.589> case

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.240 

yeah<00:05:14.750> it's<00:05:15.050> pretty<00:05:15.230> nice<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.710> tight<00:05:15.920> fitting

yeah it's pretty nice is tight fitting
what's<00:05:16.400> really<00:05:16.640> annoying<00:05:16.790> is<00:05:17.060> that<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.390> need

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
what's really annoying is that you need

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.190 
what's really annoying is that you need
a<00:05:17.810> key<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.680> take<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:20.090> not<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.300> key<00:05:20.570> or<00:05:20.720> key<00:05:20.990> or

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
a key to take and not a key or key or

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
a key to take and not a key or key or
anything<00:05:21.680> flat<00:05:22.040> like<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.250> coin<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:23.200> pop<00:05:24.200> pop<00:05:25.010> the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
anything flat like a coin to pop pop the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.790 
anything flat like a coin to pop pop the
thing<00:05:25.460> open<00:05:25.850> that's<00:05:26.570> only<00:05:26.690> con<00:05:27.230> of<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.590> and

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
thing open that's only con of it and

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.550 
thing open that's only con of it and
dust<00:05:28.340> get<00:05:28.550> trapped<00:05:29.030> under<00:05:29.360> there<00:05:29.560> well

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
dust get trapped under there well

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.350 
dust get trapped under there well
otherwise<00:05:30.740> it's<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.310> pretty<00:05:31.520> nice<00:05:31.730> case<00:05:32.060> and

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
otherwise it's a pretty nice case and

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.690 
otherwise it's a pretty nice case and
this<00:05:32.720> is<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:33.200> for<00:05:33.440> my<00:05:33.530> ipod<00:05:33.950> touch<00:05:34.690> jailbroken
