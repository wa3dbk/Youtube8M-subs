00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.360 

the<00:00:00.810> nice<00:00:00.930> thing<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.680> getting<00:00:01.860> octaves

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
the nice thing about is getting octaves

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.910 
the nice thing about is getting octaves
and<00:00:02.460> legato<00:00:03.049> trusting<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.170> airspeed<00:00:04.589> rather

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
and legato trusting the airspeed rather

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.499 
and legato trusting the airspeed rather
than<00:00:05.220> using<00:00:05.460> Leone<00:00:05.910> which<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.299> much

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
than using Leone which is so much

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.600 
than using Leone which is so much
relying<00:00:06.930> on<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.470> squeeze<00:00:07.799> notes<00:00:08.130> out<00:00:08.340> or

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
relying on that to squeeze notes out or

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.900 
relying on that to squeeze notes out or
to<00:00:09.450> get<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.170> difference<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.740> register<00:00:11.160> so

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
to get the difference in the register so

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.560 
to get the difference in the register so
a<00:00:12.240> good<00:00:12.630> exercise<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.139> try<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.610> play<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.179> C

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
a good exercise to try is to play a C

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.109 
a good exercise to try is to play a C
and<00:00:16.340> we're<00:00:17.340> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.490> do<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> we're<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.700 
and we're going to do is we're going to
play<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.449> loads<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.900> bottom<00:00:19.230> harmonics<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
play with loads of bottom harmonics to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.019 
play with loads of bottom harmonics to
begin<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.430> we're<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.820> get<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
begin with and we're just going to get a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.970 
begin with and we're just going to get a
hint<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> top<00:00:21.720> octave<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:22.859> we're

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
hint of the top octave and then we're

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.250 
hint of the top octave and then we're
going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.130> change<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.490> ratio<00:00:23.779> to<00:00:24.779> about<00:00:24.960> half

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
going to change that ratio to about half

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.050 
going to change that ratio to about half
and<00:00:25.410> half<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.830> getting<00:00:25.980> two<00:00:26.550> offices<00:00:26.910> at

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
and half so you getting two offices at

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
and half so you getting two offices at
the<00:00:27.150> same<00:00:27.300> time<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.410> we're<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the same time and then we're going to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.990 
the same time and then we're going to
slowly<00:00:29.189> push<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> air<00:00:30.029> faster<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.790> use

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
slowly push the air faster and just use

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.819 
slowly push the air faster and just use
the<00:00:33.180> SB<00:00:33.480> rather<00:00:33.690> than<00:00:33.870> change<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.320> shirt<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the SB rather than change your shirt to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.000 
the SB rather than change your shirt to
get<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> top<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.489> too<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.770> start<00:00:37.770> off<00:00:37.829> with

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
get the top up too so start off with

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.970 
get the top up too so start off with
just<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.250> normal<00:00:38.370> C<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> begin<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:42.710> nice<00:00:43.710> big

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
just a normal C to begin with a nice big

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
just a normal C to begin with a nice big
fat<00:00:44.190> sound<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
fat sound and then we're just going to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.970 
fat sound and then we're just going to
show<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> hint<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> top<00:00:46.530> property<00:00:46.829> without

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
show a hint so the top property without

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.380 
show a hint so the top property without
going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> top

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.260 

you<00:00:57.170> can<00:00:57.320> hear<00:00:57.560> this<00:00:57.650> is<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:57.830> slight<00:00:58.340> tingling

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
you can hear this is a slight tingling

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.580 
you can hear this is a slight tingling
at<00:00:59.450> the<00:00:59.510> top<00:00:59.690> octave<00:00:59.990> now<00:01:00.140> we're<00:01:00.260> going<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.410> get

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
at the top octave now we're going to get

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.890 
at the top octave now we're going to get
even<00:01:00.830> more<00:01:00.860> we<00:01:01.220> can<00:01:01.400> and<00:01:01.610> try<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.510> control

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
even more we can and try and control

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:18.760 
even more we can and try and control
both<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.410> octaves<00:01:03.710> at<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.860> same<00:01:04.040> time<00:01:04.250> so

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.740 

you<00:01:19.310> can<00:01:19.460> hear<00:01:19.670> those<00:01:19.820> two<00:01:20.149> octaves<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:20.600> there

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
you can hear those two octaves in there

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.529 
you can hear those two octaves in there
and<00:01:20.990> then<00:01:21.409> I'm<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.590> going<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:21.950> slowly<00:01:22.539> play

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
and then I'm just going to slowly play

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.090 
and then I'm just going to slowly play
the<00:01:23.750> air<00:01:23.929> get<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.229> air<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.439> go<00:01:24.530> faster<00:01:24.979> through

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
the air get the air to go faster through

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.249 
the air get the air to go faster through
the<00:01:25.219> flute<00:01:25.429> and<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:26.390> push<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.780> forward<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:27.229> I

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
the flute and just push it forward so I

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.139 
the flute and just push it forward so I
get<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.829> talk<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.310> without<00:01:28.549> changing

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
get it to talk to you without changing

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:56.220 
get it to talk to you without changing
too<00:01:29.329> much<00:01:29.360> with<00:01:29.689> you<00:01:29.750> on<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.929> show

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.639 

Oh

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.230 

you<00:01:59.649> can<00:01:59.799> hear<00:01:59.950> that's<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.280> much<00:02:00.460> more<00:02:00.490> natural

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
you can hear that's a much more natural

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.510 
you can hear that's a much more natural
legato<00:02:01.810> rather<00:02:02.259> than<00:02:02.470> having<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.740> do<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.040> big

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
legato rather than having to do it big

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.550 
legato rather than having to do it big
jump<00:02:03.939> with<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.240> octave<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.540> then<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:05.320> color

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
jump with the octave and then the color

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.810 
jump with the octave and then the color
of<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.770> sound<00:02:05.979> changes<00:02:06.310> as<00:02:06.460> well<00:02:06.610> about

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
of the sound changes as well about

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.490 
of the sound changes as well about
shifting<00:02:07.329> so<00:02:07.509> much<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.990> bottom<00:02:08.259> lip<00:02:08.380> of

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.339 

you<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:15.730> hear<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.030> change<00:02:16.300> try<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.170> get<00:02:17.260> it

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
you can hear the change try and get it

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.809 
you can hear the change try and get it
really<00:02:17.560> really<00:02:17.800> smooth<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.430> Trust<00:02:18.670> the

really really smooth and Trust the

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.360 
really really smooth and Trust the
airspeed<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.110> even<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:20.769> showing

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
airspeed so that even if it's showing

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.949 
airspeed so that even if it's showing
the<00:02:21.459> two<00:02:21.580> octaves<00:02:21.880> are<00:02:22.000> correct<00:02:22.360> slightly<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
the two octaves are correct slightly you

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.930 
the two octaves are correct slightly you
were<00:02:23.050> using<00:02:23.290> entrusting<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> airspeed<00:02:24.340> you

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
were using entrusting the airspeed you

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.479 
were using entrusting the airspeed you
can<00:02:25.090> speed<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.599> that<00:02:25.930> jump<00:02:26.200> up<00:02:26.349> up<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.310> get

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
can speed that that jump up up and get

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.040 
can speed that that jump up up and get
it<00:02:27.580> smaller<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.480> actually<00:02:28.599> just<00:02:28.900> do

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
it smaller so that you actually just do
