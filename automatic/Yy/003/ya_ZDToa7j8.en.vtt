hi<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.300> welcome<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.599> bits<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.929> blender<00:00:10.200> I'm

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
hi and welcome to bits of blender I'm

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.950 
hi and welcome to bits of blender I'm
here<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.590> boy<00:00:10.740> Richard<00:00:11.190> hi<00:00:11.820> today<00:00:12.809> we're

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
here with my boy Richard hi today we're

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.720 
here with my boy Richard hi today we're
gonna<00:00:13.019> do<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> quick<00:00:13.530> introduction<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.460> soft

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
gonna do a quick introduction to soft

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.960 
gonna do a quick introduction to soft
bodies

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.170 

so<00:00:20.929> we'll<00:00:21.170> start<00:00:21.320> with<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.500> default<00:00:21.830> scene

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
so we'll start with the default scene

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.900 
so we'll start with the default scene
let's<00:00:23.180> go<00:00:23.300> ahead<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.480> create<00:00:23.750> a<00:00:23.779> plane<00:00:24.910> shift

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
let's go ahead and create a plane shift

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.310 
let's go ahead and create a plane shift
a<00:00:27.250> and<00:00:28.250> s<00:00:29.529> 10<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.890> scale<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.220> enter<00:00:32.230> let's<00:00:33.230> go

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
a and s 10 to scale it enter let's go

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.689 
a and s 10 to scale it enter let's go
ahead<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.500> look<00:00:33.649> through<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.040> camera

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
ahead and look through the camera

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.220 
ahead and look through the camera
hitting<00:00:35.449> 0<00:00:35.660> on<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.870> keypad<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:36.790> we'll

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
hitting 0 on the keypad and we'll

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.710 
hitting 0 on the keypad and we'll
right-click<00:00:39.230> on<00:00:39.589> the<00:00:39.650> cube<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:40.370> control<00:00:41.360> drag

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
right-click on the cube and control drag

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.790 
right-click on the cube and control drag
up<00:00:43.360> now<00:00:44.360> actually<00:00:45.230> let's<00:00:45.379> drag<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.680> little

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
up now actually let's drag it a little

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.619 
up now actually let's drag it a little
bit<00:00:45.980> higher<00:00:46.100> I'm<00:00:46.760> just<00:00:47.000> doing<00:00:47.120> control<00:00:47.420> drag

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
bit higher I'm just doing control drag

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.420 
bit higher I'm just doing control drag
so<00:00:47.809> we're<00:00:47.960> snapping<00:00:48.199> to<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.530> grid<00:00:48.710> we're<00:00:49.339> to

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
so we're snapping to the grid we're to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.450 
so we're snapping to the grid we're to
look<00:00:49.460> at<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:49.699> from<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.940> side<00:00:51.159> hitting<00:00:52.159> one

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
look at it from the side hitting one

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.979 
look at it from the side hitting one
than<00:00:52.729> 5<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:53.390> we're<00:00:53.720> not<00:00:53.960> in<00:00:54.589> perspective

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
than 5 so that we're not in perspective

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.880 
than 5 so that we're not in perspective
it's<00:00:56.989> allowing<00:00:57.350> me<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.559> snap<00:00:57.799> to<00:00:57.830> that<00:00:58.100> grid<00:00:59.890> so

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
it's allowing me to snap to that grid so

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.090 
it's allowing me to snap to that grid so
what<00:01:01.040> we're<00:01:01.129> gonna<00:01:01.189> do

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.050 

is<00:01:04.820> going<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.510> object<00:01:06.439> button<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.130> then

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
is going to the object button and then

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.590 
is going to the object button and then
click<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.390> physics<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.119> first<00:01:11.119> we're<00:01:11.509> going

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
click on physics and first we're going

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.330 
click on physics and first we're going
to<00:01:11.659> tell<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:13.600> closure<00:01:14.600> collision<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.159> that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
to tell it closure collision so that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.960 
to tell it closure collision so that
it'll<00:01:16.610> recognize<00:01:17.270> collisions<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.970> next

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
it'll recognize collisions and next

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.279 
it'll recognize collisions and next
we're<00:01:20.149> going<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.360> say<00:01:20.990> make<00:01:21.320> this<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.530> soft<00:01:21.830> body

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
we're going to say make this a soft body

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.410 
we're going to say make this a soft body
now<00:01:24.289> we<00:01:24.350> needed<00:01:24.649> something<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.009> Clyde<00:01:25.250> with<00:01:25.490> so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
now we needed something to Clyde with so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.649 
now we needed something to Clyde with so
we're<00:01:26.539> gonna<00:01:26.630> select<00:01:26.810> select<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.289> plane<00:01:27.530> and

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
we're gonna select select the plane and

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.100 
we're gonna select select the plane and
click<00:01:29.659> close<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.960> for<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.200> as<00:01:30.350> well<00:01:31.690> now<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
click close in for it as well now in the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.080 
click close in for it as well now in the
soft<00:01:33.350> bodies<00:01:33.740> what<00:01:33.890> I'm<00:01:33.950> gonna<00:01:34.070> do<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.549> I'm

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
soft bodies what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.440 
soft bodies what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.299> turn<00:01:35.509> off<00:01:36.009> use<00:01:37.009> goal<00:01:37.369> because<00:01:38.240> use

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
going to turn off use goal because use

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.980 
going to turn off use goal because use
goal<00:01:38.780> will<00:01:39.229> set<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.860> goal<00:01:40.069> for<00:01:40.509> where<00:01:41.509> it<00:01:41.630> wants

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
goal will set a goal for where it wants

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.790 
goal will set a goal for where it wants
to<00:01:45.460> set<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.610> end<00:01:47.530> position<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
to set the end position for the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.320 
to set the end position for the
animation<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.580> what<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:49.850> want<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.210> really

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
animation and what we want is really

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.919 
animation and what we want is really
gravity<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.440> effect<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:53.509> soft

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
gravity just to effect this the soft

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.460 
gravity just to effect this the soft
body<00:01:54.170> has<00:01:54.380> gravity<00:01:54.830> here<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:55.819> changed<00:01:55.970> it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
body has gravity here I just changed it

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.969 
body has gravity here I just changed it
9.8<00:01:57.470> meters<00:01:57.950> per<00:01:57.979> second<00:01:58.429> is<00:01:59.619> normal<00:02:00.619> gravity

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
9.8 meters per second is normal gravity

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.430 
9.8 meters per second is normal gravity
has<00:02:01.880> little<00:02:02.149> friction<00:02:02.330> by<00:02:02.659> default<00:02:02.959> as<00:02:03.140> a

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
has little friction by default as a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.680 
has little friction by default as a
massive<00:02:03.709> one<00:02:04.039> speed<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.880> one<00:02:05.030> we're<00:02:05.569> just

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
massive one speed of one we're just

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.630 
massive one speed of one we're just
going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.840> take<00:02:05.990> those<00:02:06.200> defaults<00:02:06.560> turn<00:02:07.369> use

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
going to take those defaults turn use

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.690 
going to take those defaults turn use
goal<00:02:07.970> off<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:08.750> then<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.799> breathe<00:02:10.039> preview<00:02:10.579> it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
goal off and then to breathe preview it

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.330 
goal off and then to breathe preview it
we're<00:02:11.420> going<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.570> use<00:02:11.780> alt<00:02:12.079> a<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:16.040> can<00:02:16.190> see

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
we're going to use alt a you can see

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.140 
we're going to use alt a you can see
there<00:02:16.519> we've<00:02:16.700> got<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:17.440> jello<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:18.709> cube<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
there we've got a jello like cube and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.390 
there we've got a jello like cube and
then<00:02:20.690> eventually<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.230> collapses<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:22.280> on

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
then eventually it collapses in on

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.340 
then eventually it collapses in on
itself<00:02:22.660> that's<00:02:23.660> because<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.019> made<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.320> of

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
itself that's because it's made out of

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.800 
itself that's because it's made out of
quads<00:02:24.970> now<00:02:25.970> we're<00:02:26.150> not<00:02:26.269> going<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.480> force<00:02:26.660> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
quads now we're not going to force it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.360 
quads now we're not going to force it
into<00:02:26.930> triangles<00:02:27.620> instead<00:02:27.859> we're<00:02:28.190> going<00:02:28.220> to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
into triangles instead we're going to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.930 
into triangles instead we're going to
say<00:02:28.519> use<00:02:28.790> stiff<00:02:29.600> quads<00:02:29.870> which<00:02:30.829> will<00:02:31.160> be

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
say use stiff quads which will be

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.780 
say use stiff quads which will be
basically<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.630> same<00:02:32.810> type<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.049> effect<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.640> now

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
basically the same type of effect so now

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.470 
basically the same type of effect so now
when<00:02:35.030> we<00:02:35.150> play<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.950> I'll<00:02:36.950> pop<00:02:37.160> down<00:02:37.269> I'll<00:02:38.269> see

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
when we play it I'll pop down I'll see

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.890 
when we play it I'll pop down I'll see
it<00:02:38.570> wobble<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.350> bit<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:40.269> then<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.450> doesn't<00:02:41.630> fall

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
it wobble a bit and then it doesn't fall

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.220 
it wobble a bit and then it doesn't fall
in<00:02:42.079> on<00:02:42.200> itself<00:02:43.630> now<00:02:44.630> we<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:44.870> play<00:02:44.959> with<00:02:45.109> some

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
in on itself now we can play with some

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.759 
in on itself now we can play with some
of<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.380> parameters<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:49.690> poll<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.989> the

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
of the parameters of this poll is the

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.099 
of the parameters of this poll is the
amount<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:52.100> stress<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.780> out<00:02:53.959> of

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
amount of stress we have out of

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.099 
amount of stress we have out of
stretchiness<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.549> edges<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.840> if<00:02:56.959> we

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
stretchiness of the edges so if we

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.050 
stretchiness of the edges so if we
reduce<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.799> quite<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> bit

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
reduce it quite a bit

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.699 
reduce it quite a bit
we'll<00:03:01.060> see<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.450> edges<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.950> stretch<00:03:04.680> see<00:03:05.680> a

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
we'll see the edges really stretch see a

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.130 
we'll see the edges really stretch see a
lot<00:03:05.890> more<00:03:05.920> stretch<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.670> notice<00:03:07.450> when<00:03:07.660> when

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
lot more stretch and notice when when

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.290 
lot more stretch and notice when when
when<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:08.560> stretching<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.069> wobbling<00:03:09.489> how

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
when it's stretching and wobbling how

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.699 
when it's stretching and wobbling how
it's<00:03:10.450> going<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.020> out<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:13.410> moving<00:03:14.410> in<00:03:14.530> and

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
it's going in and out that moving in and

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.930 
it's going in and out that moving in and
out<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.970> control<00:03:16.300> through<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.690> push<00:03:17.940> so

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
out we can control through the push so

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.050 
out we can control through the push so
we<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.180> lower<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.450> quite<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:19.989> bit<00:03:20.080> too<00:03:21.060> all

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
we can lower that quite a bit too all

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.009 
we can lower that quite a bit too all
day<00:03:23.459> uh-huh<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:25.060> really<00:03:25.300> stretching<00:03:25.930> and

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
day uh-huh it's really stretching and

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.960 
day uh-huh it's really stretching and
moving<00:03:26.140> in<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.530> out<00:03:26.620> oh<00:03:28.800> that's<00:03:29.800> cool<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.880> is

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
moving in and out oh that's cool this is

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.750 
moving in and out oh that's cool this is
my<00:03:31.090> favorite<00:03:31.450> part<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:35.260> if<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:35.950> notice<00:03:36.310> what

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
my favorite part and if we notice what

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.350 
my favorite part and if we notice what
would<00:03:36.880> happen<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:37.209> we<00:03:37.360> raise<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.080> pull<00:03:38.290> way<00:03:38.470> up

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
would happen if we raise the pull way up

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.780 
would happen if we raise the pull way up
but<00:03:40.360> we'll<00:03:40.510> keep<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.840> push<00:03:41.019> where<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.319> is<00:03:41.440> oh

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.020 

yeah<00:03:45.790> looks<00:03:46.269> funny

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.230 

let's<00:03:50.750> bring<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> push<00:03:51.770> way<00:03:51.980> up

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.500 

it's<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.900> bit<00:03:58.050> more<00:03:58.230> solid<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.770> cube<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.190> has

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
it's a bit more solid of a cube it has

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.110 
it's a bit more solid of a cube it has
barely<00:04:00.510> any<00:04:00.630> wobble<00:04:01.110> at<00:04:01.350> all<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.220> now<00:04:02.610> lastly

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
barely any wobble at all and now lastly

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.180 
barely any wobble at all and now lastly
let's<00:04:03.390> just<00:04:03.600> do<00:04:03.720> one<00:04:03.930> with<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.380> pull<00:04:05.160> down

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
let's just do one with the pull down

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.700 
let's just do one with the pull down
lower<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.940> push<00:04:06.660> up<00:04:06.810> high<00:04:06.990> oh<00:04:09.410> that's<00:04:10.410> so

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
lower and push up high oh that's so

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.340 
lower and push up high oh that's so
funny<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:14.390> couple<00:04:15.390> other<00:04:15.510> features<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.200> we

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
funny a couple other features that we

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.010 
funny a couple other features that we
can<00:04:16.500> take<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.709> look<00:04:16.890> at<00:04:17.360> let's<00:04:18.360> go<00:04:18.570> ahead<00:04:18.660> and

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
can take a look at let's go ahead and

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.370 
can take a look at let's go ahead and
we'll<00:04:19.950> reduce<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.780> here<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.989> take<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.230> look

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
we'll reduce this here and take a look

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.430 
we'll reduce this here and take a look
at<00:04:23.480> so<00:04:24.480> there<00:04:24.600> we<00:04:24.660> got<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.870> nice<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.050> squishy

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
at so there we got it nice and squishy

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.280 
at so there we got it nice and squishy
and<00:04:26.060> let's<00:04:27.060> rotate<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.900> little<00:04:27.930> bit

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.380 

you<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.440> see<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.710> effect<00:04:32.010> yeah<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:34.230> we<00:04:35.010> can

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
you can see the effect yeah and we can

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.250 
you can see the effect yeah and we can
increase<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.690> stiffness<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:38.930> how<00:04:39.930> much<00:04:40.050> the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
increase the stiffness of how much the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.380 
increase the stiffness of how much the
edges<00:04:40.680> are<00:04:40.770> bending<00:04:41.190> down<00:04:41.430> here<00:04:41.760> be<00:04:41.970> e<00:04:42.000> is

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
edges are bending down here be e is

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.790 
edges are bending down here be e is
short<00:04:42.630> for<00:04:42.690> Bend<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.400> if<00:04:45.150> we<00:04:45.360> were<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.510> like<00:04:45.840> say

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
short for Bend so if we were to like say

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.910 
short for Bend so if we were to like say
hey<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.780> can<00:04:48.780> pump<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.290> all<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.500> way<00:04:49.560> up<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.680> 10

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
hey I can pump that all the way up to 10

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.280 
hey I can pump that all the way up to 10
max<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.610> out<00:04:50.810> see<00:04:51.810> if<00:04:51.840> you've<00:04:51.990> got<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.140> very

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
max it out see if you've got a very

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.270 
max it out see if you've got a very
rigid<00:04:52.620> cube<00:04:53.040> at<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.370> point<00:04:53.670> yeah

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
rigid cube at that point yeah

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.840 
rigid cube at that point yeah
you<00:04:56.820> can<00:04:56.970> also<00:04:57.180> play<00:04:57.690> with<00:04:58.070> how<00:04:59.070> much<00:04:59.250> force<00:04:59.670> it

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
you can also play with how much force it

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.710 
you can also play with how much force it
takes<00:04:59.880> before<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:01.410> starts<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.310> bend<00:05:02.720> and

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
takes before it starts to bend and

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.370 
takes before it starts to bend and
that's<00:05:03.930> sheer<00:05:04.320> that's<00:05:04.650> down<00:05:04.860> here<00:05:06.380> let's

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
that's sheer that's down here let's

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:17.170 
that's sheer that's down here let's
lower<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:07.980> down<00:05:10.490> see<00:05:11.490> very<00:05:11.820> very<00:05:13.220> clear<00:05:15.230> cool

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
lower this down see very very clear cool

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.460 
lower this down see very very clear cool
plops<00:05:18.180> down<00:05:18.450> one<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.280> then<00:05:20.280> lastly<00:05:21.290> at<00:05:22.290> least

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
plops down one and then lastly at least

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.040 
plops down one and then lastly at least
for<00:05:22.650> this<00:05:22.740> bit<00:05:23.060> we've<00:05:24.060> got<00:05:24.270> plastic<00:05:24.810> and

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
for this bit we've got plastic and

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.750 
for this bit we've got plastic and
plastic<00:05:25.260> what<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.889> allows<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.400> do<00:05:26.550> is

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
plastic what it allows you to do is

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.470 
plastic what it allows you to do is
decide<00:05:27.660> how<00:05:28.020> much<00:05:28.200> you<00:05:28.260> want<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.480> retain

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
decide how much you want it to retain

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.000 
decide how much you want it to retain
the<00:05:30.660> deformation<00:05:33.290> so<00:05:34.290> for<00:05:34.500> example<00:05:34.560> one

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
the deformation so for example one

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.920 
the deformation so for example one
hundred<00:05:35.220> percent<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.730> this<00:05:36.660> is<00:05:36.810> in

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
hundred percent and this is in

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.570 
hundred percent and this is in
percentage<00:05:37.850> if<00:05:38.850> we<00:05:39.030> play<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:41.370> gets

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
percentage if we play this it gets

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.230 
percentage if we play this it gets
scrunched<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.300> it's<00:05:42.540> stays<00:05:43.169> scrunched<00:05:44.240> let's

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
scrunched and it's stays scrunched let's

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.770 
scrunched and it's stays scrunched let's
go<00:05:45.419> ahead<00:05:45.450> and<00:05:47.000> bring<00:05:48.000> this<00:05:48.150> back<00:05:48.419> somewhere

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
go ahead and bring this back somewhere

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.950 
go ahead and bring this back somewhere
to<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.050> midpoints<00:05:49.590> again

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.900 

see<00:05:53.590> how<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:53.830> kind<00:05:53.889> of<00:05:54.100> our<00:05:54.310> sort<00:05:54.789> of<00:05:54.850> a

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
see how it's kind of our sort of a

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.820 
see how it's kind of our sort of a
dilapidated<00:05:55.150> cube<00:05:56.110> now<00:05:56.289> has<00:05:56.560> its<00:05:56.710> been

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
dilapidated cube now has its been

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.710 
dilapidated cube now has its been
crunched<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:57.430> it<00:05:57.580> stays<00:05:57.759> that<00:05:57.789> way<00:05:58.030> yeah<00:05:58.600> it

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
crunched and it stays that way yeah it

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.850 
crunched and it stays that way yeah it
just<00:05:58.780> gets<00:05:59.139> dented<00:06:00.240> uh<00:06:01.380> we<00:06:02.380> can<00:06:02.500> make<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.650> little

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
just gets dented uh we can make a little

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.480 
just gets dented uh we can make a little
more<00:06:02.949> interesting<00:06:03.220> we<00:06:04.210> can<00:06:04.389> add<00:06:05.069> vertices<00:06:06.069> so

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
more interesting we can add vertices so

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.089 
more interesting we can add vertices so
i<00:06:06.520> tabbed<00:06:07.419> into<00:06:07.750> it<00:06:07.870> I<00:06:07.960> hit<00:06:08.110> W<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.770> bring<00:06:08.919> up<00:06:09.009> the

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
i tabbed into it I hit W to bring up the

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.490 
i tabbed into it I hit W to bring up the
specials<00:06:09.460> menu<00:06:09.520> I'll<00:06:10.389> do<00:06:10.509> subdivide<00:06:11.020> multi

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
specials menu I'll do subdivide multi

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.990 
specials menu I'll do subdivide multi
and<00:06:15.960> now<00:06:16.960> we've<00:06:17.110> got<00:06:17.229> a<00:06:17.259> lot<00:06:17.440> of<00:06:17.470> vertices

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
and now we've got a lot of vertices

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.620 
and now we've got a lot of vertices
little<00:06:19.000> slow<00:06:19.180> things<00:06:19.389> down<00:06:19.449> a<00:06:19.599> bit<00:06:19.720> oh<00:06:21.630> yes

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
little slow things down a bit oh yes

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.070 
little slow things down a bit oh yes
great<00:06:23.470> really<00:06:23.800> crumbles<00:06:24.250> and<00:06:24.370> stays<00:06:24.639> crumbled

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
great really crumbles and stays crumbled

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.990 
great really crumbles and stays crumbled
yeah<00:06:26.080> now<00:06:27.009> uh<00:06:28.860> maybe<00:06:29.860> we<00:06:30.070> should<00:06:30.310> increase<00:06:30.820> the

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
yeah now uh maybe we should increase the

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.170 
yeah now uh maybe we should increase the
stiffness<00:06:31.270> a<00:06:31.630> little<00:06:31.660> bit<00:06:32.849> just<00:06:33.849> do<00:06:33.940> that<00:06:34.090> with

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
stiffness a little bit just do that with

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.200 
stiffness a little bit just do that with
the<00:06:34.330> bend<00:06:35.250> it<00:06:36.250> slowed<00:06:36.580> everything<00:06:36.729> down<00:06:36.970> you

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
the bend it slowed everything down you

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.430 
the bend it slowed everything down you
can<00:06:37.330> see<00:06:37.449> it<00:06:37.539> rendering<00:06:38.259> much<00:06:39.009> slower<00:06:39.280> now<00:06:40.440> and

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
can see it rendering much slower now and

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.969 
can see it rendering much slower now and
effect<00:06:41.830> what<00:06:41.979> we're<00:06:42.160> pretty<00:06:42.430> cool<00:06:42.789> though<00:06:43.000> oh

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 
effect what we're pretty cool though oh

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.900 
effect what we're pretty cool though oh
yeah

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.240 

much<00:06:48.540> stiffer<00:06:48.900> I'm<00:06:49.410> going<00:06:49.530> to<00:06:49.620> escape<00:06:50.070> out<00:06:50.220> of

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
much stiffer I'm going to escape out of

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.740 
much stiffer I'm going to escape out of
that<00:06:50.430> because<00:06:50.580> that<00:06:50.640> was<00:06:50.820> too<00:06:50.970> much

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:05.670 

let<00:06:57.380> me<00:06:57.470> just<00:06:57.760> increase<00:06:58.760> this<00:06:59.000> up<00:06:59.240> a<00:06:59.360> bit

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.960 

crunch<00:07:06.340> oh<00:07:06.630> yeah<00:07:07.630> I<00:07:08.340> love<00:07:09.340> I<00:07:09.490> want<00:07:09.699> to<00:07:09.789> gets

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
crunch oh yeah I love I want to gets

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.070 
crunch oh yeah I love I want to gets
dented<00:07:10.270> like<00:07:10.660> that<00:07:10.900> boom<00:07:12.270> so<00:07:13.270> now<00:07:13.419> one<00:07:13.840> thing<00:07:13.870> I

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
dented like that boom so now one thing I

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.870 
dented like that boom so now one thing I
didn't<00:07:14.440> point<00:07:14.650> out<00:07:14.770> is<00:07:15.070> that<00:07:15.100> when<00:07:15.550> we're

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
didn't point out is that when we're

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.450 
didn't point out is that when we're
rendering<00:07:16.120> this<00:07:16.919> when<00:07:17.919> we're<00:07:20.100> watching<00:07:21.100> this

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
rendering this when we're watching this

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.969 
rendering this when we're watching this
we're<00:07:22.419> doing<00:07:22.600> all<00:07:22.780> day<00:07:22.990> so<00:07:23.050> it's<00:07:23.289> plain<00:07:23.500> the

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
we're doing all day so it's plain the

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.550 
we're doing all day so it's plain the
animation<00:07:24.940> along<00:07:25.120> the<00:07:25.270> timeline<00:07:25.509> you<00:07:26.320> notice

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
animation along the timeline you notice

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.990 
animation along the timeline you notice
we've<00:07:26.710> been<00:07:26.919> always<00:07:27.070> starting<00:07:27.460> at<00:07:27.550> frame<00:07:27.759> 1

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
we've been always starting at frame 1

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.290 
we've been always starting at frame 1
well<00:07:28.900> we<00:07:29.020> can<00:07:29.199> skip<00:07:29.830> ahead<00:07:29.979> and<00:07:30.610> see<00:07:31.060> where<00:07:31.210> it

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
well we can skip ahead and see where it

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.080 
well we can skip ahead and see where it
is<00:07:31.419> so<00:07:31.600> it's<00:07:31.750> actually<00:07:32.070> doing<00:07:33.070> this<00:07:33.250> in<00:07:33.910> our

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090 
is so it's actually doing this in our

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.650 
is so it's actually doing this in our
workspace<00:07:35.130> yeah<00:07:36.130> i<00:07:36.610> mean<00:07:37.210> we<00:07:37.389> could<00:07:37.479> take<00:07:37.630> a

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:37.660 
workspace yeah i mean we could take a

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.839 
workspace yeah i mean we could take a
look<00:07:38.320> at<00:07:38.470> it<00:07:38.500> there<00:07:39.250> we<00:07:39.340> go<00:07:39.460> there's<00:07:39.729> our

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:39.849 
look at it there we go there's our

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:43.439 
look at it there we go there's our
scrunched<00:07:40.300> up<00:07:40.419> thing<00:07:40.660> how<00:07:40.870> it<00:07:40.960> looks<00:07:42.449> pretty

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:43.449 
scrunched up thing how it looks pretty

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:48.210 
scrunched up thing how it looks pretty
cool<00:07:43.599> yeah<00:07:46.080> we'll<00:07:47.080> see<00:07:47.169> you<00:07:47.259> next<00:07:47.349> time<00:07:47.560> yeah

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.220 
cool yeah we'll see you next time yeah

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.610 
cool yeah we'll see you next time yeah
bye
