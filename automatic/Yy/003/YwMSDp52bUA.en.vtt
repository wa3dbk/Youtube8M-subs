00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.020 
we knew we had a fox causing problems
and<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:45.260> just<00:00:45.620> had<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:45.860> double<00:00:46.100> check<00:00:46.130> when<00:00:46.910> we

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
and I just had to double check when we

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.430 
and I just had to double check when we
picked<00:00:47.240> up<00:00:47.330> the<00:00:47.480> eyes<00:00:47.600> because<00:00:48.020> I<00:00:48.050> wasn't<00:00:48.320> sure

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
picked up the eyes because I wasn't sure

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.010 
picked up the eyes because I wasn't sure
exactly<00:00:48.950> what<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.520> was<00:00:49.670> because<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.150> was<00:00:50.690> very

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
exactly what it was because it was very

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.720 
exactly what it was because it was very
light<00:00:51.200> coloration<00:00:51.740> and<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:51.980> size<00:00:52.220> of<00:00:52.400> it<00:00:52.490> was

light coloration and the size of it was
sort<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:52.970> sitting<00:00:53.090> up<00:00:53.300> looking<00:00:53.600> at<00:00:53.690> us<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:53.900> I

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
sort of sitting up looking at us and I

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.200 
sort of sitting up looking at us and I
wasn't<00:00:54.170> sure<00:00:54.320> if<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:54.560> was<00:00:54.650> a<00:00:54.680> dog<00:00:55.210> obviously

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
wasn't sure if it was a dog obviously

looking looking through the scope

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.069 
looking looking through the scope
confirmed<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:58.880> was<00:00:59.030> it<00:00:59.510> was<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> very<00:00:59.930> very

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
confirmed it was it was a very very

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.340 
confirmed it was it was a very very
large<00:01:00.320> Fox<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.450> so<00:01:02.450> squeeze<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.989> trigger<00:01:03.110> and

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
large Fox and so squeeze the trigger and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.289 
large Fox and so squeeze the trigger and
down<00:01:03.680> he<00:01:03.829> went<00:01:03.860> as<00:01:04.189> I<00:01:04.519> said<00:01:04.670> last<00:01:04.820> year<00:01:05.000> I'd

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
down he went as I said last year I'd

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.090 
down he went as I said last year I'd
never<00:01:05.449> seen<00:01:05.689> a<00:01:05.720> fox<00:01:05.930> at<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.560> size<00:01:06.799> before

never seen a fox at that size before

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.070 
never seen a fox at that size before
whether<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.939> climatic<00:01:08.240> cycles<00:01:08.510> are<00:01:08.840> making

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
whether the climatic cycles are making

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.530 
whether the climatic cycles are making
it<00:01:09.170> easier<00:01:09.470> for<00:01:09.500> foxes<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:11.060> they're<00:01:11.270> they're

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
it easier for foxes and they're they're

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.780 
it easier for foxes and they're they're
able<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.900> capitalize<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.440> we're<00:01:13.430> now<00:01:13.550> seeing

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
able to capitalize and we're now seeing

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.270 
able to capitalize and we're now seeing
larger<00:01:14.450> foxes<00:01:14.780> coming<00:01:15.020> through<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:16.040> quite

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
larger foxes coming through not quite

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.130 
larger foxes coming through not quite
sure<00:01:16.310> it's<00:01:17.030> not<00:01:17.240> obviously<00:01:17.600> it's<00:01:17.780> not<00:01:17.840> every

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
sure it's not obviously it's not every

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.680 
sure it's not obviously it's not every
Fox<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.770> we're<00:01:18.890> shooting<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:20.180> making<00:01:20.540> these

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
Fox that we're shooting is making these

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.090 
Fox that we're shooting is making these
sizes<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.170> we're<00:01:21.350> definitely<00:01:21.500> getting<00:01:21.950> more

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
sizes but we're definitely getting more

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.830 
sizes but we're definitely getting more
and<00:01:22.220> more<00:01:22.310> individuals<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:22.970> are<00:01:23.120> getting

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
and more individuals that are getting

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.050 
and more individuals that are getting
larger<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.100> one<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:25.520> definitely<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.940> lot

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
larger and this one is definitely a lot

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.550 
larger and this one is definitely a lot
bigger<00:01:26.180> than<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.570> one<00:01:26.930> we<00:01:27.049> saw<00:01:27.170> last<00:01:27.200> year

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
bigger than the one we saw last year

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.530 
bigger than the one we saw last year
we've<00:01:28.220> always<00:01:28.400> thought<00:01:28.549> foxes<00:01:29.390> are

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
we've always thought foxes are

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.420 
we've always thought foxes are
increasing<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.200> size<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.650> number<00:01:30.710> thanks<00:01:31.310> to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
increasing in size and number thanks to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.480 
increasing in size and number thanks to
easy<00:01:31.820> pickings<00:01:32.540> in<00:01:32.810> towns<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.380> cities<00:01:33.490> pumped

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
easy pickings in towns and cities pumped

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.149 
easy pickings in towns and cities pumped
full<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.729> calories<00:01:35.360> these<00:01:35.960> wild<00:01:36.560> animals<00:01:36.950> are

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
full of calories these wild animals are

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.480 
full of calories these wild animals are
growing<00:01:37.640> in<00:01:37.850> size<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.510> number<00:01:39.190> so<00:01:40.190> just<00:01:40.400> for

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
growing in size and number so just for

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.039 
growing in size and number so just for
size<00:01:40.640> comparison<00:01:40.670> we've<00:01:41.270> got<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> dog<00:01:41.570> Fox<00:01:41.780> here

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
size comparison we've got a dog Fox here

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.980 
size comparison we've got a dog Fox here
which<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.860> dog<00:01:43.280> Fox<00:01:43.520> from<00:01:43.670> last<00:01:43.909> year<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.360> he

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
which is a dog Fox from last year so he

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.590 
which is a dog Fox from last year so he
was<00:01:45.110> obviously<00:01:45.380> born<00:01:45.760> you<00:01:46.760> know<00:01:46.880> last<00:01:47.090> last

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
was obviously born you know last last

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.410 
was obviously born you know last last
season<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.950> see<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.189> huge<00:01:49.490> size

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
season and so you can see the huge size

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.630 
season and so you can see the huge size
differential<00:01:50.900> between<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.650> fella<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
differential between this fella and the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.960 
differential between this fella and the
big<00:01:53.150> boy<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.540> got<00:01:53.689> last<00:01:54.290> night<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.760> then

size variants there so let's do the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.249 
size variants there so let's do the
measurements<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.720> there<00:02:05.720> we<00:02:05.810> go<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:05.960> we've

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
measurements so there we go so we've

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.229 
measurements so there we go so we've
just<00:02:06.290> just<00:02:07.220> stuck<00:02:07.369> him<00:02:07.490> on<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> scales<00:02:07.909> and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
just just stuck him on the scales and

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.890 
just just stuck him on the scales and
we're<00:02:08.509> what<00:02:09.049> are<00:02:09.140> we<00:02:09.259> thirty<00:02:09.500> five<00:02:09.709> point<00:02:09.979> five

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
we're what are we thirty five point five

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.899 
we're what are we thirty five point five
so<00:02:11.900> yeah<00:02:12.709> definitely<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.249> heavy<00:02:13.430> old<00:02:13.489> Charlie

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
so yeah definitely a heavy old Charlie

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.050 
so yeah definitely a heavy old Charlie
but<00:02:14.180> he<00:02:14.620> felt<00:02:15.620> quite<00:02:15.859> quite<00:02:16.459> big<00:02:16.639> last<00:02:16.849> night

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
but he felt quite quite big last night

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.950 
but he felt quite quite big last night
when<00:02:17.269> we<00:02:17.299> picked

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
when we picked

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.410 
when we picked
-<00:02:18.920> put<00:02:19.070> him<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> put<00:02:19.790> him<00:02:19.880> in<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.030> box<00:02:20.180> but

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
- put him in the put him in the box but

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.810 
- put him in the put him in the box but
yeah<00:02:21.350> on<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:22.100> getting<00:02:22.160> him<00:02:22.430> back<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.670> putting

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
yeah on on getting him back and putting

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.460 
yeah on on getting him back and putting
them<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.030> scales<00:02:23.300> still<00:02:23.690> can't<00:02:24.380> quite

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
them on the scales still can't quite

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.500 
them on the scales still can't quite
believe<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.610> one<00:02:25.760> measures<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.180> about

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
believe that this one measures in about

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.770 
believe that this one measures in about
what<00:02:26.660> meters<00:02:27.020> 1<00:02:27.410> metre<00:02:27.590> 30<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.730> he<00:02:29.300> really<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.660> a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
what meters 1 metre 30 so he really is a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.150 
what meters 1 metre 30 so he really is a
very<00:02:30.380> very<00:02:30.560> large<00:02:30.770> lad<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.870> big<00:02:33.320> Fox<00:02:33.770> and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
very very large lad it's one big Fox and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.910 
very very large lad it's one big Fox and
maybe<00:02:34.760> we'll<00:02:35.060> break<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.630> 40-pound<00:02:36.260> barrier

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
maybe we'll break the 40-pound barrier

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.180 
maybe we'll break the 40-pound barrier
next<00:02:37.460> new<00:02:37.790> year
