00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.000
 one of the fundamental rites of Sunday 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.900
 evening was to take the ragù la 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.800
 pasta with advanced sauce and warm them up 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.630
 stretcher 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.780
 in reality the word heated is not that 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:01.100
 I like it but it gets its face 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:08.110
 avast aruska tajah means peach the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 edge antennas much nicer then this 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.530
 I remember your rusca from take me a 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:21.070
 another memory of a good cousin of mine 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:24.860
 brav'om soul that when I was at one 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.560
 fratter sicca so I ate mauro 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.820
 vintage and he always ate a 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.100
 pass it off to get a fork 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.560
 here's the 2000 detail of the fork 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.860
 so then he would work it 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.660
 the fork is steep, no teeth 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.850
 of the fork and if it widened 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.430
 practically in coming have more or less 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.190
 which are about two centimeters 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.010
 available the easy to become co 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.320
 things paragraph 4 cm and the actual demand 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.470
 but that makes Russia in exposed 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.380
 because when miles or attack went 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.159
 vast pinion this fork made like this 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.540
 and this is very welcome 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.920
 he did die I always have 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:16.610
 linked to ma staruss kahn ca forchetti 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.060
 beppin that if I have to romagna it seems more 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.930
 it's a question but then the apple spaghetti 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.870
 spaghetti whistle s3 this thing 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.360
 so now let's see what I do know 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.580
 without a facade it will be indispensable but it should be 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 applied and practically have a 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.030
 arrangement of the advanced sauce of the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.420
 pasta with advanced sauce clearly not 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.840
 of a week to Sunday a 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.100
 noon we eat and in the evening yes 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.610
 took the vast advance 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.610
 and as a ritual if he practically did 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.690
 large scale as the first operation 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.980
 take a nonstick pan e 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.840
 put a tablespoon of oil and then 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.250
 obviously light the flame so 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:20.020
 to bring the oil more or less to 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:22.810
 temperature when the oil is 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:30.420
 warmed up well take yours 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.420
 part and put it in the pan 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:51.959
 you have to keep the temperature nice 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:55.470
 constant and slow here had to go 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:59.190
 really really slowly slowly 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 on the one hand then soon when 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.900
 below it makes a sort of costinha 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.810
 we'll turn and have the other dinner done 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.799
 also on the other side someone this 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.690
 report 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.950
 the app also with the man but to me 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.260
 sincerely the ragù with the mafia 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:24.570
 this is good just because of da 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:28.740
 knowledge of Ragusa must not know place 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.350
 but above all the form that that 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.800
 wonderful crouton that makes the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.320
 difference between avast scalfaro the vast 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.660
 put in the oven or with the writing tell me but 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:46.350
 that we wait a little and then turns 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.690
 this is the creed you need to hear e 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.710
 look at how beautiful staruss kahn sees ho 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:58.110
 already from a half turn they recognize each other 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.539
 own and on the cucchiarella own one 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:07.260
 classic example of swapping weapons 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:10.680
 perfect and they were our pasta 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:15.180

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.070

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.620
