seemed to come where too easily because

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.179 
seemed to come where too easily because
there's<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> little<00:00:17.580> bit<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.820> heavy<00:00:18.060> handed<00:00:18.509> and

the Chuggington star trap is actually
really<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:23.730> durable<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.929> haven't<00:00:25.470> been

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
really really durable I haven't been

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.079 
really really durable I haven't been
doing<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:25.859> hard<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.249> I<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.939> not

together<00:00:30.839> usually<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:32.279> swap<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> two

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
together usually just swap the two

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.870 
together usually just swap the two
pieces<00:00:33.060> together<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.620> done<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.490> I<00:00:35.520> can

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
pieces together and it's done now I can

pieces together and it's done now I can
do<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.150> prime<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.810> do<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.910> even

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
do it prime that can do it and even

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.520 
do it prime that can do it and even
Monster<00:00:39.330> can<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:39.780> by<00:00:39.960> themselves<00:00:39.990> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
Monster can do it all by themselves and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
Monster can do it all by themselves and
that<00:00:40.590> makes<00:00:40.830> them<00:00:40.980> feel<00:00:41.130> a<00:00:41.160> little<00:00:41.370> bit<00:00:41.490> more

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that makes them feel a little bit more

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.070 
that makes them feel a little bit more
grown-up<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.330> it<00:00:42.420> makes<00:00:42.570> them<00:00:42.690> take<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> little

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
grown-up and it makes them take a little

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.720 
grown-up and it makes them take a little
bit<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.260> pride<00:00:43.560> in<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:43.800> toys<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
bit of pride in these toys it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.960 
bit of pride in these toys it's
something<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.150> he's<00:00:45.390> built<00:00:46.340> on<00:00:47.340> each<00:00:47.580> set

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
something that he's built on each set

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.840 
something that he's built on each set
comes<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.810> a<00:00:49.230> diecast<00:00:49.470> train<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.280> they're<00:00:50.820> a

comes with a diecast train and they're a
little<00:00:50.940> bit<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.300> durable<00:00:51.600> than<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:51.870> plastic

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
little bit more durable than a plastic

we've got the Wilson may set and the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.709 
we've got the Wilson may set and the
five<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.649> one<00:01:22.859> stuck<00:01:23.429> at<00:01:23.579> our<00:01:23.729> place<00:01:23.969> F<00:01:24.299> so

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
five in one stuck at our place F so

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.289 
five in one stuck at our place F so
there<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.469> playsets<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.249> and<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.179> like

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
there is for playsets here and but like

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
there is for playsets here and but like
they<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.810> inflate<00:01:28.319> them<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:28.829> it's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
they can all inflate them now it's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.800 
they can all inflate them now it's
really<00:01:29.399> clever<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.969> that<00:01:29.999> each<00:01:30.270> place<00:01:30.569> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
really clever is that each place that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.230 
really clever is that each place that
comes<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> factors<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.429> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
comes with one of the factors and and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.870 
comes with one of the factors and and
this<00:01:33.509> allows<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.560> new<00:01:35.009> playsets

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
this allows the new playsets

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
this allows the new playsets
to<00:01:35.999> be<00:01:36.119> linked<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> alternative<00:01:37.139> play<00:01:37.319> set

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
to be linked to the alternative play set

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.529 
to be linked to the alternative play set
so<00:01:37.859> you'd<00:01:38.039> be<00:01:38.189> able<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.639> more<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
so you'd be able to get more use out of

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.010 
so you'd be able to get more use out of
your<00:01:39.630> old<00:01:39.929> ones<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:41.670> popular<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.359> that<00:01:42.539> you're

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
your old ones now popular in that you're

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:56.039 
your old ones now popular in that you're
young

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.289 

now<00:01:57.049> because<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.770> playsets<00:01:58.520> can<00:01:58.670> insulate<00:01:59.030> you
