00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello out there and thanks for that 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 turn on today there is a very 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360
 delicious shrimp soup and I'm from 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 the recipe also sent as you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.020
 thought about my god that's great 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 but it is really easy to handle it 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.530
 takes a maximum of 30 minutes 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.510
 promised and it tastes great on everyone 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.980
 case great for the recipe you need 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.480
 also collect oleg and there I was in 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.530
 supermarket has been the days and now 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.450
 they wanted for such a small one 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.730
 two euros are almost 90 years ago 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.930
 three euro that is super super expensive and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.880
 there in the city in the market 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.550
 It's delicious asian snack and there 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.649
 is there this huge dose for just 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.539
 once 50 cents so keep your eyes open 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.609
 And then it will definitely get a lot 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.199
 much cheaper at the end if the 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.210
 soup is almost done the whole thing once 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.289
 23 minutes to simmer and the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.670
 Add the prawns 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.019
 In any case, no longer because the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.579
 shrimp them to be very small 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.409
 we pretty much does not taste so 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.179
 great but you get that on 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.600
 every case and you would have a lot 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.460
 enjoy the video and a good appetite 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.690
 first we need a medium sized 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.730
 Onion we chop very finely 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 best as fine as you can and 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.850
 we'll do the same thing 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.430
 with the garlic clove becomes the soup 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 not cured after that 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.730
 so here's a bit of prep work 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.840
 already required 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.480
 then you need a big pot 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.190
 give some oil to put him to 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.410
 middle level and then give the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.410
 onions and garlic in the pot 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.670
 Now I'm about a tablespoon with 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.810
 butter in the pot lasters whole already 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.910
 to melt and from this I make one 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.370
 little mini roux a bit more 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.370
 give it over and stir a bit 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.030
 and now the fish comes from you 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.090
 Alternatively, use a vegetable before 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.259
 That's about 400 to 450 milliliters 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.780
 they 'll come in for a spoon 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.310
 with the tomatenmark also gives one 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:07.049
 wonderful color and about 350 to 400 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 gramme fresh now depending on how 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.250
 still wants to have sharp 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.640
 Collector oleg is an alternative 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.750
 Of course Tabasco is still good too 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.209
 just stir well I have now 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.480
 Something a little something big teaspoon 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.700
 taken and at the end I give 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.720
 shrimp it for a few 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:33.510
 then simmer for a moment 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.860
 cream then stir well again 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.720
 you can still do that with us 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.630
 something to taste pepper and salt and 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 had a wonderful soup ever 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.880
 have fun and try and one 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.880
 Enjoy your meal 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.060
 since the soup is the crew as well 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.060
 directly 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.620
 not very tasty temperature at night 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.940
 sleep is still to bring but to 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.410
 Completely over already 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.700
 you can of course with the sharp 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.740
 a little bit less 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.090
 sambal olek or simply the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.310
 snowflakes on top of that 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.360
