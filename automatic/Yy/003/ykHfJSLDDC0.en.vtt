00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the confirmed 14 menu so it's kind of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
the confirmed 14 menu so it's kind of
similar<00:01:49.020> 13<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> television<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
similar 13 you got the television in the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
similar 13 you got the television in the
background<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.840> Big<00:01:52.049> Z<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
background we got Big Z in the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.260 
background we got Big Z in the
background<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.100> opposed<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.970> all

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
background as opposed to like the all

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
background as opposed to like the all
the<00:01:54.509> lineups<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> left<00:01:55.409> side<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the lineups on the left side as you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.889 
the lineups on the left side as you
would<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.700> 13<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.750> like

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
would see in 13 I think it's just like

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.499 
would see in 13 I think it's just like
the<00:01:58.079> team's<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:59.040> Captain<00:01:59.520> maybe<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.299> maybe

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the team's like Captain maybe or maybe

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.330 
the team's like Captain maybe or maybe
their<00:02:00.750> most<00:02:00.930> valuable<00:02:01.079> player<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.920> don't<00:02:02.189> know

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
their most valuable player I don't know

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
their most valuable player I don't know
but<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.700> kind<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.149> touch<00:02:03.509> stuff<00:02:03.780> it's

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but it's kind of a touch stuff it's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.100 
but it's kind of a touch stuff it's
similar<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> HL<00:02:05.130> 13<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.880> way<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.299> see<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
similar to HL 13 in a way I see is that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
similar to HL 13 in a way I see is that
the<00:02:07.229> background<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.160> fonts<00:02:08.520> changed<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the background of the fonts changed the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.820 
the background of the fonts changed the
bit<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.450> starts<00:02:10.050> good<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.289> see<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.679> they're

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
bit I starts good to see that they're

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.740 
bit I starts good to see that they're
just<00:02:10.860> improving<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.760> bit<00:02:11.819> more<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.209> really<00:02:12.569> did

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
just improving a bit more I really did

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.120 
just improving a bit more I really did
like<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.140> HL<00:02:13.470> 13

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
like the HL 13

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.160 
like the HL 13
on<00:02:14.190> screen<00:02:14.520> or<00:02:14.700> menu<00:02:15.450> whatever<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.930> want<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
on screen or menu whatever you want to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.960 
on screen or menu whatever you want to
call<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:17.160> as<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> left

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
call it but as you can see on the left

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.370 
call it but as you can see on the left
hand<00:02:18.150> side<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.540> screen<00:02:18.660> they<00:02:18.960> did<00:02:19.200> die

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
hand side of the screen they did die

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.380 
hand side of the screen they did die
like<00:02:19.710> condense<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.340> menus<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> bit<00:02:20.940> more<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.330> as

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
like condense the menus a bit more so as

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.150 
like condense the menus a bit more so as
you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.630> see<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.960> says<00:02:22.080> play<00:02:22.410> at<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> top<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
you can see it says play at the top I

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.370 
you can see it says play at the top I
saw<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.030> offline<00:02:24.660> modes<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.140> play

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
saw just like offline modes you can play

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.930 
saw just like offline modes you can play
with<00:02:25.470> your<00:02:25.590> body<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.220> by<00:02:26.340> herself<00:02:26.700> whatever

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
with your body just by herself whatever

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.030 
with your body just by herself whatever
which<00:02:27.330> no<00:02:27.570> really<00:02:27.900> does<00:02:28.080> let's<00:02:28.350> face<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
which no really does let's face it a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.100 
which no really does let's face it a
community<00:02:29.820> that's<00:02:30.150> where<00:02:30.450> they<00:02:30.570> condense<00:02:30.930> it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
community that's where they condense it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.800 
community that's where they condense it
a<00:02:31.200> bunch<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.770> all<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.880> game<00:02:33.120> modes<00:02:33.360> such<00:02:33.750> as

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
a bunch so all the game modes such as

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.130 
a bunch so all the game modes such as
ashl<00:02:34.590> versus<00:02:35.040> play<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:36.120> OTP<00:02:36.570> lobbies<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
ashl versus play and the OTP lobbies and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.230 
ashl versus play and the OTP lobbies and
shoots<00:02:37.800> are<00:02:37.950> all<00:02:38.160> gonna<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.460> under<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.850> about

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
shoots are all gonna be under that about

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.180 
shoots are all gonna be under that about
most<00:02:39.480> likely<00:02:39.990> i'm<00:02:40.110> guessing<00:02:40.530> anyways<00:02:40.860> unless

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
most likely i'm guessing anyways unless

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.070 
most likely i'm guessing anyways unless
there's<00:02:41.460> like<00:02:41.670> future<00:02:42.060> changes<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.690> whatnot

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
there's like future changes and whatnot

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.990 
there's like future changes and whatnot
but<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.860> most<00:02:44.070> likely<00:02:44.430> all<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:44.970> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
but on most likely all that's going to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.340 
but on most likely all that's going to
be<00:02:45.120> under<00:02:45.420> community<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:45.960> it's<00:02:45.990> good<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.260> see

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
be under community so it's good to see

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.080 
be under community so it's good to see
how<00:02:46.500> their<00:02:46.680> clean<00:02:46.920> up<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> menu<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:47.850> all

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
how their clean up the menu that's all

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.700 
how their clean up the menu that's all
scattered<00:02:48.750> around<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.320> stuff<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.650> that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
scattered around and stuff like that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.800 
scattered around and stuff like that
it's<00:02:50.100> good<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.280> see<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.550> they're<00:02:51.360> doing<00:02:51.510> that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
it's good to see that they're doing that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.780 
it's good to see that they're doing that
