is<00:01:49.210> crap<00:01:49.509> um<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.590> let's<00:01:50.770> force<00:01:51.700> quit<00:01:51.970> quicktime

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
is crap um so let's force quit quicktime

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.719 
is crap um so let's force quit quicktime
because<00:01:52.720> it's<00:01:52.869> just<00:01:52.960> not<00:01:53.110> working<00:01:53.350> um<00:01:53.830> and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
because it's just not working um and

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.690 
because it's just not working um and
let's<00:01:55.420> look<00:01:55.750> at<00:01:55.930> imovie<00:01:56.649> HD<00:01:56.680> because<00:01:57.550> that's

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
let's look at imovie HD because that's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.380 
let's look at imovie HD because that's
probably<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.119> most<00:01:58.270> useful<00:01:59.700> program<00:02:00.700> they

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
probably the most useful program they

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.880 
probably the most useful program they
can<00:02:01.630> get<00:02:01.720> this<00:02:01.840> thing<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:02.140> work<00:02:02.170> with<00:02:02.500> because

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
can get this thing to work with because

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.680 
can get this thing to work with because
you<00:02:03.100> can<00:02:03.220> throw<00:02:03.580> in<00:02:03.700> some<00:02:03.820> nice<00:02:03.940> titles<00:02:04.479> and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
you can throw in some nice titles and

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.770 
you can throw in some nice titles and
stuff<00:02:04.840> like<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.910> plus<00:02:06.910> it<00:02:07.060> works<00:02:07.240> relatively

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
stuff like that plus it works relatively

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.680 
stuff like that plus it works relatively
