00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
needed to go down and then if you got a

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.520 
needed to go down and then if you got a
guy<00:02:35.639> that<00:02:35.819> really<00:02:35.969> can't<00:02:36.359> shoot<00:02:36.659> what<00:02:37.230> ends<00:02:37.439> up

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
guy that really can't shoot what ends up

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.319 
guy that really can't shoot what ends up
happening<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:38.040> they<00:02:38.280> sag<00:02:38.549> off<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.000> help<00:02:39.180> off

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
happening is they sag off and help off

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.209 
happening is they sag off and help off
for<00:02:39.540> him<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.590> end<00:02:40.739> up<00:02:40.919> basically

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
for him and then you end up basically

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.300 
for him and then you end up basically
playing<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:42.120> somewhat<00:02:43.049> uneven<00:02:43.530> match<00:02:43.799> up<00:02:44.129> it

playing a somewhat uneven match up it

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.899 
playing a somewhat uneven match up it

live stream it's been hectic so been a

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.520 
live stream it's been hectic so been a

lot of 2k being played just because mad
sometimes<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.220> know<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.370> game<00:04:47.699> could<00:04:47.879> be

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
sometimes you know that game could be

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.219 
sometimes you know that game could be
frustrating<00:04:48.599> just<00:04:48.720> with<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.020> lack<00:04:49.199> of

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
frustrating just with the lack of

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.649 
frustrating just with the lack of
defense<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.979> that's<00:04:50.099> definitely<00:04:50.569> just<00:04:51.569> the

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
defense and that's definitely just the

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.570 
defense and that's definitely just the
opposite<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.169> this<00:04:52.349> game<00:04:52.560> there<00:04:52.770> may<00:04:52.919> be<00:04:52.949> too

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
opposite in this game there may be too

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.490 
opposite in this game there may be too
much<00:04:53.610> defense<00:04:54.300> but<00:04:54.479> I'm<00:04:54.599> very<00:04:54.960> happy<00:04:55.349> with

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
much defense but I'm very happy with

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.040 
much defense but I'm very happy with
that<00:04:55.680> as<00:04:55.889> opposed<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:57.060> know<00:04:57.090> less<00:04:57.479> defense

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
that as opposed to you know less defense

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.200 
that as opposed to you know less defense
definitely<00:04:58.949> some<00:04:59.190> things<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.669> need<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.060> be

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
definitely some things that need to be

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.899 
definitely some things that need to be
patched<00:05:00.599> and<00:05:00.960> worked<00:05:01.199> on<00:05:01.379> of<00:05:01.620> course<00:05:02.009> as<00:05:02.310> with

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
and then they become a really really

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.550 
and then they become a really really
tough<00:05:11.400> game<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.479> a<00:05:12.539> really<00:05:12.810> really<00:05:13.050> fun<00:05:13.169> game

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
like the rebounding sucks you will see a

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.659 
like the rebounding sucks you will see a
ton<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.330> offensive<00:05:22.050> rebounds<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:23.520> will

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
ton of offensive rebounds and you will

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.469 
ton of offensive rebounds and you will
see<00:05:23.819> a<00:05:23.849> ton<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.210> times<00:05:24.629> where<00:05:25.020> guys<00:05:26.009> will<00:05:26.370> just

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
see a ton of times where guys will just

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.119 
see a ton of times where guys will just
not<00:05:27.479> really<00:05:28.020> pay<00:05:28.199> attention<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.889> ball

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
not really pay attention to the ball

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.830 
not really pay attention to the ball
they'll<00:05:29.400> let<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.729> ball<00:05:29.909> bounce<00:05:30.180> instead<00:05:30.719> of

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
they'll let the ball bounce instead of

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.120 
they'll let the ball bounce instead of
reaching<00:05:30.960> for<00:05:31.319> it<00:05:31.349> at<00:05:31.500> its<00:05:31.650> highest<00:05:31.800> point

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
reaching for it at its highest point

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.370 
reaching for it at its highest point
things<00:05:32.849> like<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.270> just<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.690> rebounding<00:05:34.199> all

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
things like that just the rebounding all

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.890 
things like that just the rebounding all
together<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.979> really<00:05:35.310> really<00:05:36.150> flaunting<00:05:36.810> to

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
together is really really flaunting to

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.200

too<00:06:43.000> too<00:06:43.210> big<00:06:43.420> of<00:06:43.540> a<00:06:43.600> difference<00:06:43.780> but<00:06:44.050> things

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
too too big of a difference but things

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.830 
too too big of a difference but things
like<00:06:44.710> files<00:06:45.070> and<00:06:45.490> reaching<00:06:45.940> and<00:06:46.180> you<00:06:46.690> know

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
like files and reaching and you know

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.870 
like files and reaching and you know
still<00:06:47.200> success<00:06:47.740> those<00:06:48.010> types<00:06:48.280> of<00:06:48.400> things<00:06:48.460> are

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
still success those types of things are

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.410 
still success those types of things are
major<00:06:49.450> differences<00:06:50.100> three-point<00:06:51.100> success<00:06:51.580> as

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
major differences three-point success as

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.210 
major differences three-point success as
opposed<00:06:52.870> to<00:06:53.050> simulation<00:06:53.680> to<00:06:53.800> default

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
opposed to simulation to default

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.760 
opposed to simulation to default
settings<00:06:54.340> so<00:06:55.000> all<00:06:55.600> you<00:06:55.810> 2k<00:06:56.230> guys<00:06:56.470> you<00:06:56.650> probably

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
settings so all you 2k guys you probably

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.380 
settings so all you 2k guys you probably
already<00:06:57.100> know<00:06:57.340> this<00:06:57.370> for<00:06:57.730> all<00:06:57.820> you<00:06:57.940> mad<00:06:58.120> guys

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
already know this for all you mad guys

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.470 
already know this for all you mad guys
that<00:06:58.720> maybe<00:06:58.990> have<00:06:59.290> never<00:06:59.470> tried<00:06:59.710> to<00:06:59.950> K<00:07:00.480> you

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
that maybe have never tried to K you

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.000 
that maybe have never tried to K you
know<00:07:01.600> that's<00:07:01.840> the<00:07:01.960> big<00:07:02.140> difference<00:07:02.170> there<00:07:02.710> so

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
know that's the big difference there so

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.770 
know that's the big difference there so
they<00:07:03.340> actually<00:07:03.700> do<00:07:03.850> have<00:07:04.000> different<00:07:04.180> settings

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
they actually do have different settings

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.510 
they actually do have different settings
I<00:07:05.020> guess<00:07:05.530> it<00:07:05.710> would<00:07:05.830> be<00:07:05.860> the<00:07:06.130> difference

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
I guess it would be the difference

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.070 
I guess it would be the difference
between<00:07:06.580> playing<00:07:07.060> on<00:07:07.300> All<00:07:07.480> Pro<00:07:07.720> and<00:07:07.990> all

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080
