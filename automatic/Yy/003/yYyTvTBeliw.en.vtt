00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
tolerating it for instance lactose even

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.969 
tolerating it for instance lactose even
lactose<00:01:09.150> isn't<00:01:09.450> necessarily<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:10.200> allergy<00:01:10.830> but

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
lactose isn't necessarily an allergy but

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
lactose isn't necessarily an allergy but
it<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> an<00:01:11.400> intolerance<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.659> sometimes

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it is an intolerance that can sometimes

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
it is an intolerance that can sometimes
have<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> same<00:01:13.680> symptoms<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.400> IBS<00:01:15.030> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
have the same symptoms as IBS so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
have the same symptoms as IBS so
tracking<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.590> foods<00:01:16.830> again<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> very

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tracking your foods again is very

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.510 
tracking your foods again is very
important<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.770> trying<00:01:20.009> gentle<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
important also just trying gentle to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.359 
important also just trying gentle to
avoid<00:01:20.759> high<00:01:21.090> fatty<00:01:21.450> foods<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.110> these<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
avoid high fatty foods as these are in

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
avoid high fatty foods as these are in
general<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.030> reflux<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
general a reflux of that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.850 
general a reflux of that
gastrointestinal<00:01:27.020> stimulation<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.110> guess<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
gastrointestinal stimulation I guess so

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.170 
gastrointestinal stimulation I guess so
when<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.189> those<00:01:29.369> high<00:01:29.610> fatty<00:01:29.880> foods

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
when you have those high fatty foods

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.760 
when you have those high fatty foods
you're<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.570> likely<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.049> an<00:01:31.200> active<00:01:31.500> gut

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you're more likely to have an active gut

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.310 
you're more likely to have an active gut
active<00:01:32.250> bowel<00:01:32.430> try<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> avoid<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> spicy
