before you go planet hunting be sure and

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.229 
before you go planet hunting be sure and
check<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.649> sky<00:00:42.040> if<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.700> stars<00:00:42.940> are<00:00:43.120> twinkling

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.390 

well<00:01:20.960> for<00:01:21.110> planetary<00:01:21.500> detail<00:01:21.980> you're<00:01:22.280> going

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
well for planetary detail you're going

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.050 
well for planetary detail you're going
to<00:01:22.460> want<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.610> little<00:01:22.670> higher<00:01:22.910> magnification

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
to want a little higher magnification

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.000 
to want a little higher magnification
again<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.080> always<00:01:24.320> start<00:01:24.530> with<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.680> low<00:01:24.800> power

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
again you always start with a low power

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.950 
again you always start with a low power
to<00:01:25.250> Center<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.760> so<00:01:26.000> let's<00:01:26.600> say<00:01:26.720> I'm<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.900> to

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
to Center it so let's say I'm going to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.090 
to Center it so let's say I'm going to
be<00:01:27.050> looking<00:01:27.230> at<00:01:27.320> Jupiter<00:01:27.620> it's<00:01:27.710> nice<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.010> high

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
be looking at Jupiter it's nice and high

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.520 
be looking at Jupiter it's nice and high
here<00:01:28.370> about<00:01:28.550> 40<00:01:28.820> degrees<00:01:29.090> up<00:01:29.350> locked<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.500> down

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
here about 40 degrees up locked it down

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.520 
here about 40 degrees up locked it down
my<00:01:30.890> motors<00:01:31.250> tracking<00:01:31.990> especially<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.140> handy

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
my motors tracking especially it's handy

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.840 
my motors tracking especially it's handy
to<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.770> motor<00:01:33.980> looking<00:01:34.430> at<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.580> planet

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
to have a motor looking at a planet

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.190 
to have a motor looking at a planet
because<00:01:34.940> you're<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.330> so<00:01:35.480> high<00:01:35.690> power<00:01:35.930> the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
because you're in so high power the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.840 
because you're in so high power the
field<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.500> view<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.680> very<00:01:36.710> narrow<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.700> will

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
field of view is very narrow and it will

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.920 
field of view is very narrow and it will
move<00:01:38.000> out<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.330> field<00:01:38.480> of<00:01:38.570> view<00:01:38.630> fairly

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
move out of the field of view fairly

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.530 
move out of the field of view fairly
quickly<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:40.190> found<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.090> centered<00:01:41.420> it

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
quickly so I found it and centered it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.930 
quickly so I found it and centered it
I'll<00:01:41.900> pop<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.350> my<00:01:42.380> high<00:01:42.590> power<00:01:42.800> eyepiece<00:01:42.940> now

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
I'll pop in my high power eyepiece now

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.640 
I'll pop in my high power eyepiece now
this<00:01:44.090> particular<00:01:44.240> one<00:01:44.540> on<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.020> maxi<00:01:45.320> table<00:01:45.500> is

this particular one on the maxi table is

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.730 
this particular one on the maxi table is
giving<00:01:45.920> me<00:01:46.010> about<00:01:46.100> 150<00:01:46.790> power<00:01:46.970> 15<00:01:47.870> 40<00:01:48.200> divided

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
giving me about 150 power 15 40 divided

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.969 
giving me about 150 power 15 40 divided
