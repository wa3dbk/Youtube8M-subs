00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
difficulty is with sourcing Lego parts

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.039 
difficulty is with sourcing Lego parts
and<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> from<00:01:10.070> from<00:01:11.070> brick<00:01:11.729> link

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
and you can do that from from brick link

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.960 
and you can do that from from brick link
which<00:01:13.049> has<00:01:13.080> numerous<00:01:13.740> sites<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> UK<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the spare parts and this took about two

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.030 
the spare parts and this took about two
months<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> end<00:01:24.750> slow<00:01:25.259> time<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.950> of
