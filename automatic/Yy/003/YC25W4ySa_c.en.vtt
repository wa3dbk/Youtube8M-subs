yet it's already have 1i have two of
them<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> take

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
them actually so I'm not going to take

them actually so I'm not going to take
this<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.020> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.469> screw<00:00:37.710> somebody<00:00:37.890> out

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160

this one and kind of screw somebody out
of<00:00:38.250> theirs<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.360> they're<00:00:40.050> fairly<00:00:40.290> hard<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
of theirs but they're fairly hard to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910 
of theirs but they're fairly hard to
find<00:00:41.719> now<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> argument<00:00:43.290> would<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.440> once<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
find now the argument would be once to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310 
find now the argument would be once to
take<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.079> rare

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

while I did already and it's not a rare
I<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.660> poor-quality<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:52.460> but

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I know this is a poor-quality one but

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.350 
I know this is a poor-quality one but

here is at level 25 1360 health 282 and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.310 
here is at level 25 1360 health 282 and
237<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.710> uncommon<00:01:26.100> status<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:27.990> breath

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
237 at uncommon status so you get breath

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.359 
237 at uncommon status so you get breath
and<00:01:29.150> healing<00:01:30.150> flame<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.049> start<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.530> breath

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and healing flame to start with breath

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.120 
and healing flame to start with breath
is<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.820> straight<00:01:33.090> damage<00:01:33.619> magic<00:01:34.619> damage

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
is just a straight damage magic damage

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.940 
is just a straight damage magic damage
healing<00:01:36.090> flame<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.020> heal<00:01:37.259> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
healing flame which is a good heal you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.039 
healing flame which is a good heal you
get<00:01:38.579> liftoff<00:01:39.060> you'll<00:01:39.270> probably<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.659> liftoff

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
get liftoff you'll probably have liftoff

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.210 
get liftoff you'll probably have liftoff
when<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> start<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.799> guys<00:01:40.950> too

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
when you start with these guys too

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.590 
when you start with these guys too
because<00:01:41.970> yeah<00:01:42.119> they're<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.509> at

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
because yeah they're going to be at

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.289 
because yeah they're going to be at
least<00:01:42.630> level<00:01:42.899> 10<00:01:43.170> i<00:01:43.200> believe<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.490> liftoff<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
least level 10 i believe so liftoff is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
least level 10 i believe so liftoff is
