00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
see that we're in 50 7.5 feet of water

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.560 
see that we're in 50 7.5 feet of water
this<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.340> bottom<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.150> what<00:03:20.269> I'm<00:03:20.390> going<00:03:20.480> to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
this is the bottom so what I'm going to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.539 
this is the bottom so what I'm going to
do<00:03:20.720> these<00:03:20.900> Cisco's<00:03:21.440> can<00:03:21.709> be<00:03:21.829> suspended<00:03:22.220> from

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
do these Cisco's can be suspended from

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.460 
do these Cisco's can be suspended from
ten<00:03:22.880> feet<00:03:23.209> below<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.660> ice<00:03:23.780> or<00:03:24.049> all<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.440> way

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
ten feet below the ice or all the way

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.620 
ten feet below the ice or all the way
down<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.980> sixty<00:03:25.340> feet<00:03:25.519> so<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.090> gotta<00:03:26.390> use<00:03:26.600> a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
down to sixty feet so you gotta use a

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
down to sixty feet so you gotta use a
sonar<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.709> very<00:03:27.980> hard<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.489> catch

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
sonar like this it's very hard to catch

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.120 
sonar like this it's very hard to catch
them<00:03:29.120> otherwise<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:30.290> what<00:03:30.410> I'm<00:03:30.530> doing<00:03:30.799> now<00:03:30.920> I

them otherwise so what I'm doing now I

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.800 
them otherwise so what I'm doing now I
let<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.400> drop<00:03:31.579> down<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:32.180> now<00:03:32.299> I'm<00:03:32.390> reeling<00:03:32.690> it

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
up I'm at about twenty four feet because

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.699 
up I'm at about twenty four feet because

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
this sliding condition they can be ten

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.330 
this sliding condition they can be ten
fifteen<00:03:39.079> feet<00:03:39.290> below<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.739> ice<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.100> letting

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
fifteen feet below the ice and letting

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.849 
fifteen feet below the ice and letting
it<00:03:40.400> fall<00:03:40.640> again<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:42.019> it's<00:03:42.140> very<00:03:42.260> important

great power augers when it's called the
black<00:04:57.050> ice<00:04:57.290> it's<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.620> little<00:04:57.860> bit<00:04:57.980> bigger<00:04:58.160> than

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
black ice it's a little bit bigger than

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.280 
black ice it's a little bit bigger than
this<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.580> little<00:04:58.820> bit<00:04:59.030> stronger<00:04:59.330> this<00:04:59.990> is<00:05:00.170> the

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
this a little bit stronger this is the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.500 
this a little bit stronger this is the
vortex<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.100> it's<00:05:01.700> very<00:05:01.880> lightweight<00:05:02.150> it's

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
vortex and it's very lightweight it's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.470 
vortex and it's very lightweight it's
actually<00:05:02.840> about<00:05:03.020> 22<00:05:03.560> or<00:05:03.590> 23<00:05:04.160> pounds<00:05:04.640> it<00:05:05.240> has

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
actually about 22 or 23 pounds it has

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.740 
actually about 22 or 23 pounds it has
very<00:05:05.900> good<00:05:06.140> auger<00:05:06.440> cutters<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:08.150> really

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
very good auger cutters and a really

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.840 
very good auger cutters and a really
good<00:05:08.930> blade<00:05:09.170> at<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.380> bottom<00:05:09.770> also<00:05:10.430> what<00:05:10.820> I

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
good blade at the bottom also what I

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.850 
good blade at the bottom also what I
like<00:05:11.030> about<00:05:11.180> this<00:05:11.480> unit<00:05:11.900> is<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.380> can<00:05:12.530> see<00:05:12.680> that

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
like about this unit is you can see that

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.350 
like about this unit is you can see that
the<00:05:12.980> tank<00:05:13.250> is<00:05:13.430> clear<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.090> can<00:05:14.240> actually

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
the tank is clear so you can actually

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.850 
the tank is clear so you can actually
see<00:05:14.630> how<00:05:14.690> much<00:05:14.900> feel<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.260> have<00:05:15.410> in<00:05:15.560> it<00:05:15.680> there's

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
see how much feel you have in it there's

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.640 
see how much feel you have in it there's
no<00:05:15.980> need<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.400> use<00:05:16.580> an<00:05:16.790> actual<00:05:17.060> fuel<00:05:17.480> gauge<00:05:17.750> okay

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
no need to use an actual fuel gauge okay

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.380 
no need to use an actual fuel gauge okay
so<00:05:18.710> you<00:05:19.070> make<00:05:19.280> sure<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:19.520> you<00:05:19.760> prime<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.270> so

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
so you make sure that you prime it so

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.150 
so you make sure that you prime it so
that<00:05:20.510> you<00:05:20.600> see<00:05:20.750> that<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.020> fuel<00:05:21.320> is<00:05:21.530> inside<00:05:21.980> the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
that you see that the fuel is inside the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.910 
that you see that the fuel is inside the
line<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.640> then<00:05:23.240> on<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.840> repeller<00:05:24.260> they've

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
line and then on the repeller they've

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.290 
line and then on the repeller they've
got<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.100> really<00:05:25.280> nice<00:05:25.490> system<00:05:25.790> there's<00:05:26.150> an

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
got a really nice system there's an

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.180 
got a really nice system there's an
on/off<00:05:26.480> switch<00:05:26.720> here<00:05:27.080> right<00:05:27.470> now<00:05:27.650> it's<00:05:27.920> off

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
on/off switch here right now it's off

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.060 
on/off switch here right now it's off
I'm<00:05:28.640> gonna<00:05:28.880> push<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.360> on<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:30.410> I<00:05:30.560> already<00:05:30.710> have

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
I'm gonna push it on and I already have

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.530 
I'm gonna push it on and I already have
the<00:05:31.100> choke<00:05:31.520> on<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.030> there's<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.360> run

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
the choke on and there's the run

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.510 
the choke on and there's the run
position<00:05:32.720> so<00:05:33.170> I'll<00:05:33.260> push<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.620> choke<00:05:33.830> down<00:05:34.070> now

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
position so I'll push the choke down now

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.100 
position so I'll push the choke down now
look<00:05:34.700> at<00:05:34.820> this<00:05:34.970> isn't<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.450> a<00:05:35.480> nice<00:05:35.660> handle

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
look at this isn't that a nice handle

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.650 
look at this isn't that a nice handle
even<00:05:36.350> if<00:05:36.470> I<00:05:36.620> had<00:05:36.800> big<00:05:37.250> mitts<00:05:37.520> on<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:38.000> can<00:05:38.420> still

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
even if I had big mitts on I can still

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.840 
even if I had big mitts on I can still
start<00:05:38.960> this<00:05:39.140> unit<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:39.770> put<00:05:40.070> my<00:05:40.220> hand<00:05:40.490> in<00:05:40.670> there

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
start this unit and put my hand in there

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.750 
start this unit and put my hand in there
so<00:05:41.540> you<00:05:41.600> hold<00:05:41.840> on<00:05:42.050> to<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:42.290> your<00:05:42.740> buddies<00:05:43.070> with

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
so you hold on to it your buddies with

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.980 
so you hold on to it your buddies with
you<00:05:43.940> you<00:05:44.060> can<00:05:44.180> hold<00:05:44.300> on<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.630> other<00:05:44.780> side

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
you you can hold on to the other side

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.080 
you you can hold on to the other side
and<00:05:45.680> a<00:05:45.890> good<00:05:46.100> augur<00:05:46.310> should<00:05:46.610> start<00:05:46.880> on<00:05:47.000> the

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
and a good augur should start on the

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.720 
and a good augur should start on the
first<00:05:47.360> Pole

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.150 

so<00:05:50.240> once<00:05:50.480> you<00:05:50.600> have<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.900> opera<00:05:51.290> running<00:05:51.650> let

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
so once you have the opera running let

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.860 
so once you have the opera running let
it<00:05:52.280> warm<00:05:52.490> up<00:05:52.670> a<00:05:52.820> little<00:05:52.970> bit<00:05:53.270> right<00:05:53.300> now<00:05:53.540> it's

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
it warm up a little bit right now it's

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.960

just hold on don't push on it when

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:23.130 
just hold on don't push on it when
you're<00:06:14.870> ready

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.960 

the<00:06:24.140> other<00:06:24.260> important<00:06:24.800> thing<00:06:24.860> always<00:06:25.370> make

the other important thing always make
sure<00:06:26.000> that<00:06:26.360> you<00:06:26.660> cover<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.170> blades<00:06:27.470> when

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
sure that you cover the blades when

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.530 
sure that you cover the blades when
you're<00:06:27.830> not<00:06:27.950> using<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.400> auger<00:06:28.580> okay<00:06:29.210> so<00:06:29.360> it's

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
you're not using the auger okay so it's

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.030 
you're not using the auger okay so it's
really<00:06:29.600> importantly<00:06:30.290> you<00:06:30.440> put<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:30.740> cover<00:06:30.950> on

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
really importantly you put the cover on

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.590 
really importantly you put the cover on
properly<00:06:31.730> you<00:06:31.820> can<00:06:32.000> see<00:06:32.120> that<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.390> cover

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
properly you can see that the cover

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.900 
properly you can see that the cover
actually<00:06:33.170> has<00:06:33.380> steps<00:06:33.710> for<00:06:34.400> the<00:06:34.520> different

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
actually has steps for the different

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.480 
actually has steps for the different
size<00:06:35.180> of<00:06:35.450> auger<00:06:35.660> blades<00:06:36.080> this<00:06:36.770> particular<00:06:37.340> one

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
size of auger blades this particular one

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.340 
size of auger blades this particular one
is<00:06:37.640> an<00:06:37.790> 8<00:06:38.030> inch<00:06:38.240> auger<00:06:38.540> so<00:06:38.960> that's<00:06:39.140> the

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
is an 8 inch auger so that's the

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.440 
is an 8 inch auger so that's the
diameter<00:06:40.010> of<00:06:40.100> the<00:06:40.220> hole<00:06:40.400> and<00:06:41.060> you<00:06:41.180> can<00:06:41.330> see

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
diameter of the hole and you can see

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.570 
diameter of the hole and you can see
that<00:06:41.570> you<00:06:41.630> have<00:06:41.660> the<00:06:41.840> actual<00:06:42.400> protector<00:06:43.400> right

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
that you have the actual protector right

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.340 
that you have the actual protector right
here<00:06:43.940> so<00:06:44.210> that's<00:06:44.390> where<00:06:44.570> this<00:06:44.660> is<00:06:44.840> supposed<00:06:45.200> to

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
here so that's where this is supposed to

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.530 
here so that's where this is supposed to
sit<00:06:45.680> right<00:06:45.890> there<00:06:46.160> so<00:06:46.610> you<00:06:46.640> very<00:06:46.880> gently<00:06:47.270> hold

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
sit right there so you very gently hold

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.830 
sit right there so you very gently hold
it<00:06:47.690> like<00:06:47.840> you<00:06:47.990> would<00:06:48.140> a<00:06:48.200> bowling<00:06:48.680> ball<00:06:49.810> put<00:06:50.810> it

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
it like you would a bowling ball put it

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.780 
it like you would a bowling ball put it
on<00:06:51.020> and<00:06:51.260> turn<00:06:51.500> it<00:06:51.680> until<00:06:51.830> you<00:06:52.160> find<00:06:52.430> it<00:06:52.550> in<00:06:52.670> the

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
on and turn it until you find it in the

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.970 
on and turn it until you find it in the
right<00:06:52.940> slot<00:06:53.300> so<00:06:53.510> it's<00:06:53.630> in<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:53.840> slot<00:06:54.110> now<00:06:54.350> and

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
right slot so it's in the slot now and

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.250 
right slot so it's in the slot now and
then<00:06:55.130> just<00:06:55.340> take<00:06:55.550> the<00:06:55.580> actual<00:06:56.060> bungee<00:06:56.960> cord
