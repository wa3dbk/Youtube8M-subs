00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.020
 hello everyone serve here at 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.090
 strasbourg where I had the chance to 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 test the renault zoé and we are here in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 train to recharge the car on a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.210
 project chrome terminals 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.000
 it's a project in fact of installation 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.160
 charging stations between France and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.930
 Germany led with edf on here at 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 side of a charger that allows the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 accelerated recharge and in one hour on 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.679
 can refuel the car 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.059
 full of electricity of course 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.579
 it is extremely extremely 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.309
 interesting and so there are all around 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.749
 from strasbourg soon to colmar and 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.199
 also on the other side of the rhine 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.480
 Germany 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.070
 so then the zoe recharge is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.210
 obviously the subject that has done a lot 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.710
 talk on the forums 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.390
 so we are very happy to be able to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 recharge on a charging station 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 fast with the cable that goes well that is 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.590
 provided with zoe so we have a catch 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 of type iii on the terminal 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.280
 this is where the car is connected 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.560
 what we could regret is this 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.760
 small flapper if it seems a bit fragile 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 and we quickly see vandals damaged 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.090
 flapper so that's it can do a little 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.750
 scared and I think it's a room 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.250
 which is likely to be replaced quite often 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 then to recharge the zoé one needs 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.540
 of the cable here so there one to the making of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.410
 guy iii who's going to go on the terminal and we 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.630
 here's taking type 2 which she's going 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.390
 go to the renault logo level 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.790
 there we are going to have the charging socket so 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.830
 for that to actually open the flapper 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.290
 here the logo we have a small button 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:58.790
 on which we press the logo opens on 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.900
 open the little clap n here and so here we 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.220
 can come connect the cable 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.020
 so I take the cable I plug it into 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.180
 teen level is there there is a small 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.630
 lock that makes block the plug is 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:16.810
 so I can not take it off then I 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:20.600
 will come to my bollard 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.090
 he's doing some checking and here I'm going 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:33.650
 can simply recharge 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:36.320
 plugging here the cable so here's the the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.180
 load is ready will start and so 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.660
 it's extremely simple we do not have 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.660
 to have a coffee 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.239
 so here we see the zoe that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.739
 recharge so there is 99% charge 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.739
 so the car is well full rate 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.739
 that's when we had a good coffee 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.360
 the car is loaded so we go to the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.019
 simply disconnect so for that 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.380
 we have the badge for the pass here 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.840
 in front of the terminal and then we can 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.670
 remove the cable 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.880
 at the level of zoe small subtlety 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.610
 we need again so the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.000
 remote control we press here and it comes 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.470
 unlock so here our recovery is 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.920
 so there we can put away the cable and we 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.920
 can leave
