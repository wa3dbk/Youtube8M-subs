00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.360 

okay<00:00:04.970> so<00:00:05.439> what<00:00:06.439> I'm<00:00:06.560> going<00:00:06.680> to<00:00:06.769> show<00:00:06.859> you<00:00:07.069> today

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
okay so what I'm going to show you today

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.020 
okay so what I'm going to show you today
is<00:00:07.580> how<00:00:07.849> to<00:00:08.059> take<00:00:09.190> regular<00:00:10.190> three<00:00:10.580> quarter

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
is how to take regular three quarter

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.619 
is how to take regular three quarter
round<00:00:11.299> steering<00:00:11.900> shaft<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:13.209> basically<00:00:14.209> turn

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
round steering shaft and basically turn

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.160 
round steering shaft and basically turn
it<00:00:14.809> into<00:00:15.019> a<00:00:15.799> common<00:00:16.570> three-quarter<00:00:17.570> double<00:00:17.960> D

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
it into a common three-quarter double D

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.620 
it into a common three-quarter double D
the<00:00:18.920> reason<00:00:19.279> for<00:00:19.490> that<00:00:19.519> is<00:00:19.849> we<00:00:20.029> want<00:00:20.240> to<00:00:20.359> attach

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
the reason for that is we want to attach

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.630 
the reason for that is we want to attach
a<00:00:20.840> steering<00:00:21.230> joint<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:21.769> it<00:00:21.920> steering<00:00:22.340> joints

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
a steering joint to it steering joints

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.070 
a steering joint to it steering joints
three-quarter<00:00:23.150> double<00:00:23.420> D<00:00:24.189> steering<00:00:25.189> shaft<00:00:25.460> a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
three-quarter double D steering shaft a

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.570 
three-quarter double D steering shaft a
modern<00:00:27.080> steering<00:00:27.619> shafts<00:00:27.859> three-quarter

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
modern steering shafts three-quarter

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.409 
modern steering shafts three-quarter
double<00:00:28.880> D<00:00:29.029> but<00:00:29.750> an<00:00:29.869> old<00:00:30.019> standard<00:00:31.300> Bronco<00:00:32.300> or

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
double D but an old standard Bronco or

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.480 
double D but an old standard Bronco or
many<00:00:32.689> others<00:00:33.110> are<00:00:33.380> just<00:00:33.950> three<00:00:34.160> quarter

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
many others are just three quarter

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.770 
many others are just three quarter
rounds<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:34.879> we're<00:00:34.969> going<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:35.149> take<00:00:35.300> this<00:00:35.539> three

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
rounds so we're going to take this three

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.569 
rounds so we're going to take this three
quarter<00:00:36.110> round<00:00:36.320> we're<00:00:36.980> going<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.190> turn<00:00:37.399> them

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
quarter round we're going to turn them

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.540 
quarter round we're going to turn them
into<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:38.329> three<00:00:38.629> quarter<00:00:38.899> double<00:00:39.289> D<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:40.430> we

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
into a three quarter double D so that we

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.729 
into a three quarter double D so that we
can<00:00:40.730> put<00:00:40.910> our<00:00:40.969> steering<00:00:41.510> joint<00:00:41.809> on<00:00:41.960> there<00:00:42.230> this

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
can put our steering joint on there this

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.040 
can put our steering joint on there this
is<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:42.980> real<00:00:43.190> easy<00:00:43.399> process<00:00:44.120> basically<00:00:44.480> we're

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
is a real easy process basically we're

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.090 
is a real easy process basically we're
going<00:00:45.199> to<00:00:45.260> grind<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.969> two<00:00:47.840> opposite<00:00:48.469> sides<00:00:48.500> of

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
going to grind the two opposite sides of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.680 
going to grind the two opposite sides of
the<00:00:49.160> three<00:00:49.489> quarter<00:00:49.879> shaft<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.739> then<00:00:52.660> fit<00:00:53.660> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
the three quarter shaft and then fit the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.020 
the three quarter shaft and then fit the
joint<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.500> that's<00:00:54.680> basically<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:55.789> we'll

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
joint to it that's basically it so we'll

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.639 
joint to it that's basically it so we'll
do<00:00:56.149> a<00:00:56.180> little<00:00:56.480> grind<00:00:56.809> in<00:00:56.960> for<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.260> sake<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.530> the

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
do a little grind in for the sake of the

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.590 
do a little grind in for the sake of the
video<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.219> then<00:00:58.670> show<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.000> how<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.359> all

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
video and then show you how this all

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:16.120 
video and then show you how this all
works

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.660 

that<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:18.110> 180<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> same<00:01:20.070> thing<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.550> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that over 180 do the same thing on the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
that over 180 do the same thing on the
opposite<00:01:21.180> side<00:01:21.450> we'll<00:01:21.720> probably<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> go

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
opposite side we'll probably have to go

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.670 
opposite side we'll probably have to go
back<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.560> forth<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.100> few<00:01:23.280> times<00:01:24.020> easier<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.530> do

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
back and forth a few times easier to do

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
back and forth a few times easier to do
a<00:01:25.710> few<00:01:25.980> times<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.580> double<00:01:26.850> check<00:01:27.090> yourself

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a few times and double check yourself

00:01:27.540 --> 00:02:02.120 
a few times and double check yourself
than<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:27.900> grind<00:01:28.230> too<00:01:28.470> much<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.620> can<00:02:01.890> see

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
than to grind too much so you can see

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.580 
than to grind too much so you can see
it's<00:02:02.310> real<00:02:02.640> minimal<00:02:03.210> amount<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:04.020> grinding

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's real minimal amount of grinding

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.540 
it's real minimal amount of grinding
that<00:02:05.250> took<00:02:05.580> us<00:02:05.760> all<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.920> about<00:02:07.920> two<00:02:08.280> minutes

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that took us all of about two minutes

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.910 
that took us all of about two minutes
and<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:11.240> it's<00:02:12.240> got<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> good<00:02:12.750> fit<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.680> what

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and it's on it's got a good fit now what

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.200 
and it's on it's got a good fit now what
we're<00:02:14.070> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.460> we're<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.850> kind<00:02:15.030> of

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
we're going to do we're going to kind of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.440 
we're going to do we're going to kind of
market<00:02:15.860> because<00:02:16.860> we've<00:02:17.040> got<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> set<00:02:17.700> screw<00:02:18.090> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
market because we've got a set screw and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.920 
market because we've got a set screw and
a<00:02:18.600> jam<00:02:18.930> nut<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:20.100> want<00:02:20.340> us<00:02:20.459> we<00:02:20.880> want<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.239> slot

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
a jam nut and we want us we want a slot

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.340 
a jam nut and we want us we want a slot
for<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.920> set<00:02:23.310> screw<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.820> go<00:02:24.000> into<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.230> can

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
for that set screw to go into so we can

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.470 
for that set screw to go into so we can
use<00:02:25.530> loctite<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.310> really<00:02:26.520> lock<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:27.060> into<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
use loctite and really lock it into the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.390 
use loctite and really lock it into the
shaft<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:29.070> it's<00:02:29.850> kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.150> easy<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.020> take

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
shaft so it's kind of easy just to take

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.120 
shaft so it's kind of easy just to take
so<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.730> take<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> little<00:02:33.209> punch<00:02:34.040> put<00:02:35.040> it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
so we just take a little punch put it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.640 
so we just take a little punch put it
right<00:02:35.160> there<00:02:35.340> through<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.970> hole<00:02:36.500> give<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
right there through the hole give it a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.580 
right there through the hole give it a
little<00:02:37.800> punk<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> hammer<00:02:39.380> whatever<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
little punk with a hammer whatever you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.610 
little punk with a hammer whatever you
have<00:02:40.620> lying<00:02:41.130> around<00:02:41.840> now<00:02:42.840> I've<00:02:43.050> got<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> little

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
have lying around now I've got a little

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.400 
have lying around now I've got a little
spot<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.489> know<00:02:44.640> right<00:02:45.030> where<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.300> grind<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:46.260> my

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
spot I know right where to grind for my

00:02:46.410 --> 00:03:09.540 
spot I know right where to grind for my
indentation<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.489> myself

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:17.500
