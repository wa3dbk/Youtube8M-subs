I'd<00:03:11.720> be<00:03:11.870> interested<00:03:12.110> who<00:03:12.980> did<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.489> why<00:03:13.959> why

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
I'd be interested who did it and why why

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.690 
I'd be interested who did it and why why
someone<00:03:15.470> planted<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.489> small<00:03:16.549> caution<00:03:17.299> in<00:03:18.430> I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.720 

think<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:23.000> someone<00:03:23.629> might<00:03:23.870> want<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.459> plant<00:03:25.459> a

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
think that someone might want to plant a

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.530 
think that someone might want to plant a
small<00:03:26.569> garden<00:03:27.140> in<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.470> hot<00:03:28.040> zone<00:03:28.069> because<00:03:28.849> they

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
small garden in a hot zone because they

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.920 
small garden in a hot zone because they
might<00:03:29.720> might<00:03:30.500> want<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.829> make<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:30.980> point<00:03:31.280> that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
might might want to make a point that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.080 
might might want to make a point that
this<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.319> a<00:03:33.349> actually<00:03:35.769> unnecessary<00:03:37.090> thing

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
this is a actually unnecessary thing

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.819 
this is a actually unnecessary thing
that<00:03:38.329> took<00:03:38.540> Butte<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:39.049> also<00:03:39.230> well<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.620> might

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
that took Butte that also well it might

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.399 
that took Butte that also well it might
be<00:03:39.980> also<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.340> beautify<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:42.049> city<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.049> very

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
be also to beautify the city it is very

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.199 
be also to beautify the city it is very
pretty<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:45.859> I<00:03:46.069> hope<00:03:46.250> it'll<00:03:46.489> be<00:03:46.609> left<00:03:46.909> there

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
pretty and I hope it'll be left there

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.809 
pretty and I hope it'll be left there
that<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.629> won't<00:03:47.810> go<00:03:48.019> over<00:03:48.049> with<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.769> fast

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
that it won't go over with that fast

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.080 
that it won't go over with that fast
I<00:03:50.230> don't<00:03:51.230> leave<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.440> length<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:52.129> the<00:03:52.730> life<00:03:52.940> of

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
I don't leave the length of the life of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.220 
I don't leave the length of the life of
the<00:03:53.150> garden<00:03:53.480> would<00:03:53.599> be<00:03:53.659> the<00:03:53.870> problem<00:03:54.170> I

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
the garden would be the problem I

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.270 
the garden would be the problem I
suppose<00:03:54.440> it<00:03:54.530> would<00:03:54.620> be<00:03:54.650> more<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:54.950> way<00:03:55.069> it

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
suppose it would be more the way it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.339 
suppose it would be more the way it
might<00:03:55.400> meet<00:03:55.639> its<00:03:55.819> end<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.450> if<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.720> was<00:03:56.900> going<00:03:57.230> to

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
might meet its end so if it was going to

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.710 
might meet its end so if it was going to
be<00:03:57.439> constantly<00:03:57.829> run<00:03:58.010> over<00:03:58.250> by<00:03:58.400> by<00:03:59.090> cars<00:03:59.420> it

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
be constantly run over by by cars it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.550 
be constantly run over by by cars it
would<00:03:59.840> be<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.019> little<00:04:00.230> bit<00:04:00.349> sad<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.799> suppose<00:04:02.560> and

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
would be a little bit sad I suppose and

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.110 
would be a little bit sad I suppose and
this<00:04:03.709> because<00:04:03.980> he<00:04:04.159> is<00:04:04.280> more<00:04:04.519> visible<00:04:04.849> when

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
this because he is more visible when

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.990 
this because he is more visible when
you're<00:04:05.239> driving<00:04:05.450> this<00:04:06.079> big<00:04:06.319> Billy<00:04:07.220> yeah<00:04:07.670> I

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
you're driving this big Billy yeah I

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.759 
you're driving this big Billy yeah I
think<00:04:08.629> I<00:04:08.780> better<00:04:08.900> way<00:04:09.139> of<00:04:09.170> highlighting<00:04:09.409> a

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
think I better way of highlighting a

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.089 
think I better way of highlighting a
pothole<00:04:10.159> would<00:04:10.310> be<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:11.470> big<00:04:12.470> lump<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.829> Sonic

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
pothole would be a big lump of Sonic

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.539 
pothole would be a big lump of Sonic
