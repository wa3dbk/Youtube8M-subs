on it and if you take all of the tension

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.939 
on it and if you take all of the tension
off<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.359> could<00:00:30.570> Bend<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.439> direction<00:00:31.920> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
off it could Bend in a direction that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.229 
off it could Bend in a direction that
you<00:00:32.309> actually<00:00:32.460> will<00:00:32.730> need<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.149> an

you actually will need to have an
adjustment<00:00:33.660> after<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.140> put<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.320> strings<00:00:34.680> on

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.520 
wiggle it a little bit side to side so
that<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.290> loosens<00:01:48.620> easily<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:50.510> pull<00:01:51.200> straight

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
that it loosens easily and pull straight

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.500 
that it loosens easily and pull straight
out<00:01:51.560> like<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:52.010> when<00:01:52.910> you<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:53.119> that<00:01:53.270> it

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
out like that when you do that it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.000 
out like that when you do that it
releases<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.020> ball<00:01:54.110> end<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.470> string<00:01:54.530> and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
releases the ball end of the string and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.760 
releases the ball end of the string and
you<00:01:55.610> don't<00:01:55.760> have<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.380> don't<00:01:57.440> have<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.619> do

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
you don't have to you don't have to do

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.990 
you don't have to you don't have to do
anything<00:01:57.950> more<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.280> take<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.490> string<00:01:58.700> out<00:01:58.790> it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
anything more to take the string out it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.469 
anything more to take the string out it
is<00:01:59.180> already<00:01:59.479> your<00:01:59.630> is<00:02:00.229> already<00:02:00.860> taken<00:02:01.160> out<00:02:01.479> so

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
is already your is already taken out so

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.540 
is already your is already taken out so
one<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.780> things<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.050> like<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.320> do<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.190> to

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
one of the things I like to do is to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.190 
one of the things I like to do is to
keep<00:02:04.700> all<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.119> old<00:02:05.270> strings<00:02:05.600> together<00:02:05.930> so

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
keep all of the old strings together so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
keep all of the old strings together so
that<00:02:06.350> when<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.500> discard<00:02:07.130> them

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that when I discard them

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.699 
that when I discard them
they<00:02:09.140> all<00:02:09.530> go<00:02:09.709> in<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.920> same<00:02:10.040> trash<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.880> and

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
they all go in the same trash can and

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.810 
they all go in the same trash can and
one<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.860> reasons<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.160> that's<00:02:13.310> important

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
one of the reasons that that's important

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.699 
one of the reasons that that's important
is<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.570> strings<00:02:14.930> are<00:02:15.050> very<00:02:15.080> sharp<00:02:15.500> and

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
is that the strings are very sharp and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.640 
is that the strings are very sharp and
if<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.610> have<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> loose<00:02:17.180> one<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:17.540> near<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.470> your

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
if you have a loose one out near in your

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.610 
if you have a loose one out near in your
carpet<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.550> could<00:02:19.760> puncture<00:02:20.380> somebody's<00:02:21.380> foot

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
carpet it could puncture somebody's foot

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.259 
carpet it could puncture somebody's foot
or<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.220> could<00:02:22.430> get<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> hands<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.150> small

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
or it could get in the hands of a small

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.060 
or it could get in the hands of a small
person<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> really<00:02:24.470> good<00:02:24.590> idea<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.860> keep

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
person it's a really good idea to keep

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.560 
person it's a really good idea to keep
all<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.250> your<00:02:25.400> loose<00:02:25.610> ends<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.150> your<00:02:26.330> old

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
strings together and discard them all

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.050 
strings together and discard them all
together<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:29.030> one<00:02:29.060> package<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:31.190> next<00:02:31.459> step<00:02:31.700> is

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
on both sides of the of the head is you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.200 
on both sides of the of the head is you
want<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.829> wind<00:04:21.099> from<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.489> inside<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
want to wind from the inside to the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.749 
want to wind from the inside to the
outside<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.560> your<00:04:23.860> your<00:04:24.160> strings<00:04:24.400> gonna<00:04:24.610> come

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
outside so your your strings gonna come

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.850 
outside so your your strings gonna come
up<00:04:24.910> across<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.479> nut<00:04:25.659> and<00:04:25.930> it's<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.770> go

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
up across the nut and it's going to go

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.320 
up across the nut and it's going to go
around<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.310> peg<00:04:27.490> from<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.849> inside<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.270> the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
around the peg from the inside to the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.270 
around the peg from the inside to the
outside<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:29.530> with<00:04:29.710> these<00:04:29.800> plain<00:04:30.070> wound

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
outside and with these plain wound

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.680 
outside and with these plain wound
strings<00:04:30.639> it's<00:04:30.789> a<00:04:30.849> real<00:04:31.030> good<00:04:31.150> idea

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
strings it's a real good idea

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.560 
strings it's a real good idea
to<00:04:32.289> wind<00:04:32.470> them<00:04:32.620> maybe<00:04:32.800> three<00:04:33.070> or<00:04:33.099> four<00:04:33.310> times

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
to wind them maybe three or four times

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.719 
to wind them maybe three or four times
or<00:04:34.570> more<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.220> can<00:04:36.370> get<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.580> best

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
or more so that you can get the best

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.430 
or more so that you can get the best
tension<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.330> string<00:04:37.599> when<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.229> tighten

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
tension on the string when you tighten

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.050 
tension on the string when you tighten
it<00:04:38.650> otherwise<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.490> string<00:04:39.729> might<00:04:39.880> come<00:04:40.030> a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
it otherwise the string might come a

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.210 
it otherwise the string might come a
little<00:04:40.240> bit<00:04:40.419> loose<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:40.900> now<00:04:41.860> I'm<00:04:41.949> gonna<00:04:42.039> go

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
little bit loose so now I'm gonna go

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.520 
little bit loose so now I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.400> wind<00:04:42.639> this<00:04:43.060> string<00:04:43.449> around<00:04:43.530> and

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
ahead and wind this string around and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.140 
ahead and wind this string around and
I'm<00:04:44.650> gonna<00:04:44.740> give<00:04:44.919> it<00:04:44.949> four<00:04:45.280> good<00:04:45.460> wines<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.940> hold
