 line 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.290
 to the EU 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.819
 in order to make 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.429
 should be the top 5 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.459
 jsc vneshtorgbank 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.459
 this practice is clear 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.109
 and at the fence forward 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.070
 it is unacceptable and many others in the evening 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.749
 cabins 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.749
 given time to head 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 so to speak 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.779
 mayor of Abakan cleaver on this subject 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.020
 for medication explains 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.040
 for tourists we have five years 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.620
 when i was at school 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 Recall that the body Takeda Kid 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.050
 Chinese 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.600
 then for the cause 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.510
 start your own business 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.160
 then it was sealed 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.500
 I expect 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 person 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 it's shareholders 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.370
 this bacterium e 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.400
 some objects can be said 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.400
 In general, yes and what 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.470
 crush room 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 then they are marshal 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 these important ones are shorter 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 for this purpose further endure 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.050
 bright head why army 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920
 because 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 participants pharmacy network at all 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.289
 in that race 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.639
 but what's the point 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.569
 also eu 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.569
 thick 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 I already then it will be next 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.159
 cool too often 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.839
 etc 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.839
 passed away 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.549
 I didnâ€™t take it at all 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:46.639
 it happened 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.649
 rather 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.649
 svetlana savchenko 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.319
 leader refused 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.529
 when everything talks about 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.529
 Nikolay 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.419
 as reported by rbk daily 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.390
 etc 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.390
 first star of the match 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.059
 I think yes 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.059
 until the end of the year 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.860
 this data 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 but not given 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.689
 scene in Kiev 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.240
 I need something more than 20 matches 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.680
 each one 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 now after the passage of time twice 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.219
 it is significant that a woman 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:49.350
 if that 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.289
 540 thousand 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.289
 become for her 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.020
 hardly slept
