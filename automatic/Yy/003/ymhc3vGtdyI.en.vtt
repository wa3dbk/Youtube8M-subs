00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 and looks without actually one 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 enemy in the immediate vicinity is extreme 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 Excited service escape and sincere 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.179
 Welcome to a new episode 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.889
 minecraft waro comments today with the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.839
 three following teams we have once 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.490
 excerpt they have it for the third time 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.939
 already succeeded in the consequences we have 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.550
 team techniques that are after epe with kev 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.720
 and spark of phoenix and we have team 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.519
 So fans were playing and rocking 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.140
 hd i can tell you right now that it is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.550
 today went to the right thing 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.079
 There were some fighting situations 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.270
 there is something in the direction of water 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.730
 will you see, I would say 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.870
 put it on with timo is it going on 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.430
 By the way, I can do it myself 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 if I comment on it at all 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 do not breathe that's kind of that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.730
 a different atmosphere when I go to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.590
 comment when I play is everything 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.969
 cool so pi pa po but not after 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
 I have correct style and comments 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.670
 Incidentally, problems with maxis take today 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.789
 micro 4 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.539
 he has my micro she is 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.949
 loaned 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.180
 Her bite is a bit too 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.949
 That's why the audio is down 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.549
 maybe not as usual 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.290
 order 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.320
 let's get started team is okay 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.400
 look good in their today 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.900
 follow that the consequence 6 not in their 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 follow but before their consequence 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.420
 actually, four hours 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.759
 Fought to cut someone who 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 this person is this leighton wanted 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 Can I tell you? I think so 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.060
 not being too much today and that is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.650
 the good esi as somehow done 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.409
 in the riflescope of the badi falter too 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.140
 advised by team from it and have the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.479
 We tried to steal that today 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:48.030
 has some consequences or it 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.380
 was more like the buddys gambling in front of it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.180
 already tried together as 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.530
 get the coordinates of the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.329
 have sought out its coordinates there 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.920
 we have already said 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.920
 It was not the last time 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.950
 successful and now almost the second 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.009
 They really have four hours trying 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.920
 from the pc wrong to wait for him is 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.050
 was crowned with success you see with the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.459
 first link in the sequence before that he was 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.080
 still or 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.690
 also in the sequence they still have 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.190
 looking for lapis lazuli it's all 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.560
 is terrible it does not work 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.580
 the 8 lapis lazuli has me the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.740
 last follow a bit 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.970
 messed up and although I have a lot 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.710
 contradictory the sources I have ne 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.780
 for source found the claims 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.800
 that lapis lazuli only at height for 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.480
 that can find until 11 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.880
 then there were still others swell the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.990
 said you can hear the interception 31 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.180
 Finding the way down was also the source 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.930
 who uses the buddys talk it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.360
 then actually have in their wake 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.460
 still lifeless found and indeed at height 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.610
 17 this is my assertion from the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.130
 Last revision revised is wrong 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.450
 You can also falsify it outside 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.180
 find the layers five to eleven 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.920
 apparently from 31 down and the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.870
 layers are the most common 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.550
 probably the layers 13 and 16 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.930
 the problem is now with the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.440
 main tenants you still only still of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.810
 the baroque that lives really has 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.980
 really bad equipment for that 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 sixth consequence that one can believe me 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.540
 already say so that is there on everyone 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.640
 case in the lower third I would say 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.110
 must be an argument he should be there 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.090
 maybe give a little gas otherwise 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.769
 if he somehow surprises himself 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.480
 which is unlikely because he is around 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.850
 but runs when he meets someone 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.120
 because of a problem because I full tray 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.320
 does not make it that hard 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.060
 there should know what to do, however 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.640
 That was only because he had many 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.290
 have made a lot of slapping her try 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.540
 perhaps crowned with success today 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.950
 as I said only that distracts you that 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.230
 but I think that's good to praise 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.510
 and that makes you think you are 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.510
 not so good equipment has okay then 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.300
 Let's go to team technology there 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.000
 it's really around today 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.030
 actually hit on opponents 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.110
 and that looks like this from the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.530
 guys log a nod build up 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.300
 out of her hole somehow high and 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.850
 a minute later or even more 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.940
 company or later the zander and 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.959
 knows white after all and really 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.010
 after the clouds the seemingly 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.880
 wegklatschen 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.890
 yes and then it's around my opinion 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.570
 is that one in the situation 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.910
 you were like you do not know, of course 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.080
 who did it a little if you do that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.720
 as has not yet seen the situation 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.220
 you would have 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.000
 make better use of the height advantage 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.710
 can strike at the opponents underneath 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.330
 they'll be around that way 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.790
 a hole danced around you can see that too 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.230
 a team would have the height advantage good 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.400
 I believe I can use it around the year 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.130
 other team or beat 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.520
 but I think they were too excited 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.510
 However, also had a team 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.650
 clear equipment disadvantage would me 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.290
 because there are other topics really 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.570
 was really good then we come now 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.220
 finally, by the way, link number 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.420
 Two leads to a fight that one should 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.780
 absolutely look there it was right 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.480
 round 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.930
 then we come to third place 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.250
 team unbelievably unbelievable they have theirs 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.590
 followed that started in the 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.400
 village have logged deliver such a 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.430
 a little bit around then suddenly it works 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.310
 round and indeed looks without actually one 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.040
 enemy in the immediate vicinity is extreme 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.710
 Excited retiree back 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.640
 the meetings are louder 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.410
 hectic then stay relatively long 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.910
 and then they go hunting 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.020
 after the opponent which opponent that is 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.860
 and maybe it's a whole team 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.940
 you see with the third link there it goes 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 then a little bit more and I think so 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.450
 but what simon there clearly 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.800
 aggressive could have gone on it 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.900
 so he would have the same right away 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.479
 has seen or has he seen it 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.260
 Immediately have to go to the quali 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.970
 to squeeze 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.350
 even if it is now against the intuition 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.550
 is always so excited because of that 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.640
 I do not blame myself either 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:59.350
 but in retrospect it would be 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.610
 to be fairer and quasi that 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.260
 with her running after you 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.330
 then meet with rocks 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.220
 However, one must also say that 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.350
 Simon did not have such good equipment 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.750
 but the enemy he saw there 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.440
 I do not think so either 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.050
 about equipment he is then stop 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.700
 just the hustle and bustle at the moment 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.750
 owed, I believe so my opinion 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.390
 is there a fight? 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.070
 dare in retrospect that's of 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.690
 today's episode were comments today 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.230
 a little shorter that was all good 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.000
 comment compact 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.380
 Since so good and check necessarily the 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.600
 in the description on the left if you 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.130
 want to see what happened exactly there 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.390
 and also like to leave a word for 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.380
 the essens is but it is likely the first 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.610
 be description 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.410
 that wanted before to twelfth 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.640
 pay attention and if that works then you can 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.380
 we maybe up to no suppliers 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.340
 start united, he knows the 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.340
 united
