that<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.430> accurate<00:00:47.789> than<00:00:48.239> most

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
that it's more accurate than most

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.560 
that it's more accurate than most
wristbands<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.980> also<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.270> detect

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
wristbands and also can actually detect

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
wristbands and also can actually detect
your<00:00:51.809> posture<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.800> need<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> ton

trend is called a chrono watch this is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.720 
trend is called a chrono watch this is
described<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> article<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> cobra<00:00:59.579> like

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
described in the article as a cobra like

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
described in the article as a cobra like
watch<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.239> basically<00:01:01.199> instead<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.890> just

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
watch because basically instead of just

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.770 
watch because basically instead of just
going<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.640> your<00:01:02.940> wrist<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.480> sort<00:01:03.719> of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
going around your wrist it's sort of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260 
going around your wrist it's sort of
like<00:01:03.899> coils<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> way<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
like coils in a way and actually the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.690 
like coils in a way and actually the
display<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> watch<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.409> inside

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
display of the watch is on the inside

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
display of the watch is on the inside
and<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.909> fixing<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.080> really

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and not fixing up so that's really

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
and not fixing up so that's really
interesting<00:01:10.549> in<00:01:11.549> terms<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> way<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
interesting in terms of the way that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
interesting in terms of the way that
it's<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.689> designed<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.439> also<00:01:13.560> super

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's just designed it's also super

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's just designed it's also super
futuristic<00:01:14.340> looking<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.930> has<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> lot<00:01:16.380> more

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
futuristic looking it has a lot more

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830 
futuristic looking it has a lot more
features<00:01:16.710> than<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.130> normal<00:01:17.250> watch<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.970> though

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
features than a normal watch so though

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
features than a normal watch so though
this<00:01:19.259> isn't<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:19.740> style<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.280> anything<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
this isn't really my style or anything I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.160 
this isn't really my style or anything I
would<00:01:21.090> wear<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> really

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
would wear I just think it's a really

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.410 
would wear I just think it's a really
interesting<00:01:22.259> look<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:23.070> where<00:01:23.909> wearable

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
interesting look at where wearable

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.330 
interesting look at where wearable
technology<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.770> number<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.130> train

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
technology is going my number two train

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.100 
technology is going my number two train
is<00:01:26.490> called<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> Clio<00:01:26.939> clearview<00:01:27.509> speaker<00:01:27.900> and

is called the Clio clearview speaker and
this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> most<00:01:29.250> futuristic

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
this is one of the most futuristic

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
this is one of the most futuristic
looking<00:01:30.060> speakers<00:01:30.299> I've<00:01:30.540> ever<00:01:30.720> seen<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
looking speakers I've ever seen so

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.130 
looking speakers I've ever seen so
instead<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> having<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.520> traditional<00:01:33.140> black

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
instead of having the traditional black

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.219 
instead of having the traditional black
and<00:01:34.530> chunky<00:01:35.250> design<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.360> basically<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and chunky design it basically is a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
and chunky design it basically is a
silver<00:01:37.920> mount<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.729> basically<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> piece<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
silver mount with basically a piece of
