00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.740
 today I introduce you to the rubric 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.179
 the remnants are sweet with us after having given birth 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.789
 there is always a large number 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.480
 serum by no means and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.100
 pour out 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.470
 not only can be made of it 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.230
 gorgeous pancakes or put dough 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.559
 but if you market him a lot 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.390
 so many pancakes do not eat but people for a long time 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.820
 learned to use whey and 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.000
 get out of it secondary sir for example 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.829
 Italians make ricotta in essence 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:01.120
 it is very similar to our cottage cheese and 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:03.519
 made just from serum here 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.190
 it is clear that there is a lot more in serum 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.410
 protein on absolutely opaque to 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.320
 cooking recode and we need with you 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.890
 heat the serum to 95 degrees 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:22.420
 almost boiling but not quite ours 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.940
 the serum is already almost hot rica 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.149
 it is generally translated from Italian 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.670
 means double boiled because milk 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.369
 heated once and then now 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.560
 heats up the second time so our 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.020
 the serum has heated up and now we need 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.819
 add here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.819
 60 milliliters of regular table vinegar 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.280
 here it becomes clear how we 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.990
 asked leftovers 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.520
 squirrel we need to wait for this 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.140
 moment to all our serum 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.350
 grabbed and formed enough 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.240
 tight already clot here look after all 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.209
 as we separated the serum she already 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:36.400
 absolutely transparent but these here 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:37.690
 cereal you are our ricotta and so the whole 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.850
 we have protein completely 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.230
 grabbed my neat now 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.120
 shifted to such an Italian 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.720
 a mold for cheese she most often just 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:56.050
 and used for such here 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.970
 fresh cheeses are very convenient that the record 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.450
 us floating on the surface and very easy 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.450
 collect 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.370
 but you all we gathered our ricotta in 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.859
 basket is very convenient and put here on 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.750
 This stand can be used any 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.620
 lattices on legs which are often in 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.400
 microwaves 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.069
 and now leave for about 10 hours 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.230
 on shurika tu for sealing the longer 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.780
 he will stand the denser she will 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.310
 in a couple of hours it will be 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.730
 soft cottage cheese which is also possible 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.799
 use it with us so 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.720
 called sweet recode but because in 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.090
 she has no salt and she can be 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.510
 used in casserole he desserts 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.359
 if you add salt and mix 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.250
 then it will be a traditional river 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.959
 then it can be used as us 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.490
 called cheese or lasagna for 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.150
 famous pairs of friction with crypot and with 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.919
 spinach 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:33.800
 Overall a very tasty product and so is ours. 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:37.009
 the river is ready and you can click on 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.949
 Essentially this is a nice soft gentle 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:51.169
 curd can be shifted to any 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:57.349
 capacity and use as usual our 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:58.820
 familiar cottage cheese well when you can 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.630
 use serum 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.710
 you can add salt here 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:10.010
 and use as soft cheese or just 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.750
 eat with jam like cottage cheese also 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.750
 make any casserole or cheese cakes
