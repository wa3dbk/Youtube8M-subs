00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.880
 look 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 Well, well, the other day, I was 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.320
 looking at what the notifications would be 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.290
 of twitter when suddenly I got a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.990
 tweet from a subscriber like you who 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.750
 he told me the next thing was called chris 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.390
 cash ram and told me this altar or have you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.450
 tried the links with iron sights is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.130
 like a fal but four times better 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.079
 well sincerely, I after 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.180
 read this tweet I stood in my head 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.950
 the following not a links a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.899
 sniper that I played in the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.520
 random class or leave it on the screen to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.079
 run from me because it really cost me 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.710
 very much get me the game of random 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.449
 class not really a links with sight of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.309
 iron is going to be four times better with 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.289
 the lack really I raised it in the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 head but good still as you are one 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.059
 of my subscribers so I got into the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.850
 starting I put those accessories and what 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.890
 I tried and this is what has come out 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.320
 and good kids once in a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.810
 playstation 4 I already got it 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.580
 use many times both in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
 public games as in games 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.030
 private with bots reached the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.250
 conclusion that what you have in 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.259
 screen would be the class with which better 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.540
 is this brother going so let's start 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.490
 with her the first accessory that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.520
 I would put the link would be the measure of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.920
 iron not because otherwise it would not be funny 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 but hey it is necessary to say it not the second 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.070
 accessory that I would put would be 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.690
 large chargers that would increase it from 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.119
 eight bullets the link is coming 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.890
 default would increase it to 12 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 bullets that you want not those four 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.479
 bullets at open combat time it 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 they notice a lot no and then the ice cream 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.460
 cylinder head accessory that takes away a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.319
 little bit of recoil and increases it 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.659
 quite what would be the precision to 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.700
 long distances kids and good 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.380
 disadvantages and streaks you can put in the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.179
 that we want but good I have 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.830
 put those that better handled that would be 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.299
 in the first lightweight to go a 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.700
 a little bit faster because the French 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.500
 shooter weighs his own after second 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 advantage agile hands to aim a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.820
 tast faster and third advantage me 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.600
 I would put hardness so that when I 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.490
 shoot 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 lose the profession and the recoil is 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.330
 then increase that for distances 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.130
 long also good is super cool and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.440
 good of gusts because what I put myself 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.300
 always does not evaluate system pirates 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.239
 barbie and bomber so nothing 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.770
 kids this would be what what I 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.120
 would put with this water and good what 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.340
 I'll be seeing right now in the background will be 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.140
 a game against bots surely already 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.390
 that I do not have what would be the cylinder head 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.920
 the loaders and the iron mine no longer 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.600
 that there are enough casualties in the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.790
 head in public pounds that I've 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.620
 played quite little not the truth is that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.209
 yes I am sincere only player for 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.040
 practice a little stopping in class and 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.530
 little more no but good as you are 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.730
 watching on screen playing against bots 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.819
 in professional the truth is that in 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.250
 Busting a lot does not kill absolutely 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.110
 of two bullets and even one if 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.569
 we give in the head not now is it a 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.400
 cheto quite interesting and it reminds me 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.780
 much to what would be the lamppost that we 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.120
 said our partner on twitter 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.030
 but it also reminds me of a style of 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.980
 mk 14 but much more than anything because the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.290
 mercat orce del culo kitty advanced uav 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.420
 as you know you usually kill two 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.800
 but almost always throws three and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.660
 truth is that it is much worse than this 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.440
 the truth is that this weapon distances 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.510
 long does not move absolutely nothing and 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.130
 perhaps the only bad thing is that when 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.320
 the bullets end we have to give 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.000
 recharge us since it does not have 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.550
 automatic recharging and the truth is that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.010
 that at the time of being in combat we 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.600
 You can leave a tad sold but good 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.520
 kids the truth is that yes what 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.830
 We have controlled and we are recharging 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.420
 the weapon every time we see it and 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.900
 that the truth is that it is a very 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.150
 Let's go, it's the help of two bullets 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.590
 no hello insanity of two bullets and the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.750
 truth is that with two simple bullets 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.760
 we are going to be able to blow them to anyone 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.650
 that is with two simple bullets kids 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.440
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.700
 this video that you try it and that I 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.890
 leave in the comments that has 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.570
 it seemed like its good part and that and nothing 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.730
 we see you guys in the following 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.510
 videos like they subscribed you are and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.510
 goodbye
